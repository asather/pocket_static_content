<h1>CMU apologizes for excluding historically black communities from tourist map </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University posted a map of Pittsburgh online several weeks back in which it described for prospective students and families a city of nearly 90 neighborhoods, a place where "you can always find something new."</p>
<p>Highlighted by name were neighborhoods as far from its Oakland campus as Downtown, Lawrenceville, the South Side and even Highland Park.</p>
<p>But the map, labeled as being from undergraduate admissions at CMU, omitted several largely African American neighborhoods, including ones closer to the private university. The Hill District, Garfield, Homewood and Larimer were among parts of the city left blank.</p>
<p>Amid criticism from individuals on and off campus about the depiction —&nbsp;and a satirical T-shirt designed in its wake — Carnegie Mellon has now apologized. It called the map a mistake and said university officials have removed all print and digital references to the original version.</p>
<p>“Carnegie Mellon University should have never used this map, as it fails to uphold our values of inclusion, equity and diversity,” said a statement issued late Wednesday by a campus spokeswoman, Julianne Mattera. “We sincerely apologize for this mistake and the hurt it created.</p>
<p>“This map was developed as a resource for incoming Carnegie Mellon students with the intention of identifying some of Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods that students frequently visit,” the statement continued. “While it highlighted select communities by name, it failed to include others, some of which are historically black Pittsburgh communities.</p>
<p>“We recognize the value, richness and history of these excluded neighborhoods, which makes our mistake especially painful.”</p>
<p>The school, said Ms. Mattera, is working to identify better practices “to foster a more welcoming, respectful and inclusive environment” for those on campus and surrounding communities.</p>
<p>“We have set up meetings with campus community members who have reached out to us, in addition to others who are committed to engaging and advising the university on diversity and inclusion initiatives,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The neighborhood omissions did not go unnoticed on social media, where one post called it an attempt at a “friendly” map, but added: ‘"The BIG problem was is that they created an insanely inaccurate map that COMPLETELY ERASED THE BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS."</p>
<p>Ebony Thomas, 33, of Swissvale, who created the post, said she first saw someone else’s posting about the map on Facebook a couple weeks back. She called the omissions frustrating but not a shock.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t surprised due to the subtle gentrification that has been going on around the city,” said Ms. Thomas, who said she originally is from East Liberty and has spent time the Hill District over the years. “We also hear in Pittsburgh about how it’s a most livable city, things like ‘Stronger than Hate,’” she said.&nbsp;“When it comes to the inner community, minorities don’t feel the love.”</p>
<p>Ms. Thomas, whose e-business, Influenchill, makes streetwear clothing, said she was moved to design and market a T-shirt&nbsp;“Hood Lives Matter,” that turns the tables, creating a T-shirt that omits neighborhoods CMU omitted and includes those the school’s original map left off.</p>
<p>“I kept the region [but] muted the fancier neighborhoods,” she said.</p>
