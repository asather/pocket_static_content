<p>Tristan Jarry and Kris Letang have been invited to the All-Star game after all.</p>
<p>The NHL on Tuesday announced that both Penguins have been selected as injury replacements for All-Star weekend, which takes place Jan. 24-25 in St. Louis. Jarry will replace Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo and Letang will go in place of teammate Jake Guentzel, who underwent shoulder surgery last week.</p>
<p>Guentzel was initially the Penguins’ <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/30/pittsburgh-penguins-nhl-all-star-jake-guentzel/stories/201912300101" target="_blank">lone All-Star</a> when teams were announced last week. Letang was Pittsburgh’s candidate for the “Last Men In” fan vote to select the final player for the nine-skater, two-goalie Metropolitan Division team.</p>
<p>Jarry will be making his All-Star game debut. Entering Tuesday, he has played in 20 games this season, posting a record of 13-6-1. The 24-year-old goalie leads the league with a 1.99 goals-against average and a .935 save percentage.</p>
<p>This is the sixth All-Star game selection for Letang, the most among defensemen in Penguins history. While he has been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/05/Penguins-florida-panthers-loss-ppg-paints-arena-kris-letang-tristan-jarry-Brian-Dumoulin-Vincent-Trocheck/stories/202001050174" target="_blank">up and down</a> with partner Brian Dumoulin sidelined, his 26 points in 34 games rank fourth among Metro blue-liners.</p>
