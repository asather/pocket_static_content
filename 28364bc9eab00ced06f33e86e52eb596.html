<h1>Conor Sheary ‘excited’ about potential top-line reunion with Sidney Crosby, Jake Guentzel</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the Penguins returned to UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex last week, Conor Sheary found himself surrounded by familiar faces. His small group during this stage —&nbsp;Phase 2 of the NHL’s return-to-play plans —&nbsp;includes captain Sidney Crosby and All-Star winger Jake Guentzel.</p>
<p>That’s probably not a coincidence.</p>
<p>The last time Sheary, Crosby and Guentzel were skating together in June, Sheary was adding his highlights to a championship DVD and helping the Penguins plan another Stanley Cup parade. With Sheary back in black and gold following a deadline-day trade and Guentzel using the NHL’s pause to his advantage to recover from shoulder surgery, the odds of that Cup-winning line being reunited when the season resumes are looking increasingly possible — if not likely.</p>
<p>“It would be nice if we were able to do that again,” Sheary said. “We had a good run together while I was here last time. I don’t think much has changed in any of our games that it wouldn’t be a smooth transition back to growing that chemistry.</p>
<p>“If we do get that opportunity, I think we can really contribute offensively and also be a responsible line at the same time. I think we can be excited for the fact that that might happen.”</p>
<p>This season has been something of a homecoming for Sheary, no matter on which line he plays.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old Massachusetts native began his professional career with the Penguins organization at the end of the 2013-14 season when he signed as an undrafted free agent out of UMass. The Penguins never really wanted to part ways with Sheary, who scored several memorable goals during the recent back-to-back Cup runs, including the overtime winner in Game 2 of the 2016 Cup final. But amid a salary cap crunch, he was traded to Buffalo in the summer of 2018.</p>
<p>On the NHL’s trade deadline day this year, the Penguins reacquired the speedy winger, along with versatile forward Evan Rodrigues, in exchange for Dominik Kahun. From his very first practice back in Pittsburgh, Sheary has skated on Crosby’s right wing. He scored one goal and tallied three assists in eight games with the Penguins before COVID-19 forced the NHL to suspend the season March 12.</p>
<p>Sheary said that while many of the teammates from those Cup runs are gone, the core players and the staff have made it a “fairly easy” transition.</p>
<p>“It’s different in terms of players,” Sheary said. “But in terms of the system and the culture and everything like that, I think not much has changed.”</p>
<p>During the three-month pause when players were asked to self-isolate at their homes, Sheary was able to maintain his strength and conditioning levels thanks to his home gym. Now, during the voluntary workouts, a strength coach is leading his group through exercises off the ice. On the ice, players led workouts last week. This week, a skills coach has joined several of the groups.</p>
<p>This will be the norm for the next several weeks. The NHL informed teams last week that it doesn’t plan to move into Phase 3, which is a formal training camp period, until at least July 10.</p>
<p>“As far as my strength and conditioning, I was able to keep that up,” Sheary said. “But I think timing and things on the ice, you can’t get that in a gym. For myself and a lot of the guys who came back for these, I think it was just to have the access. I think it will be really beneficial for us that we’re able to skate together moving into the Phase 3.”</p>
<p>Also, as a part of Phase 2, players are tested for COVID-19 at least twice a week. The NHL plans to administer daily tests to each player once the league enters the hub city phase.</p>
<p>“It’s not the most fun test to take,” Sheary said. “I think I’ve gotten it twice. Like you said, they pretty much stick a Q-tip way up your nostril. It feels like it’s in the back of your brain.”</p>
<p>While it’s not the most pleasant experience, Sheary said he and his teammates are willing to follow the protocols put into place to make their return to their ice as safe as possible.</p>
<p>“I think at the end of the day we all want to play,” he said. “Health is the main concern. As long as they have that in place, I don’t have any reservations myself.”</p>
