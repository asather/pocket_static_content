<h1>Senate passes resolution limiting Trump against Iran in bipartisan vote</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — A bipartisan Senate majority voted to pass a resolution Thursday limiting President Donald Trump from ordering future strikes against Iran without first seeking Congress’ explicit permission, a pointed rebuke of his administration’s resistance to involving the legislative branch in foreign policy decisions many fear could lead to all-out war.</p>
<p>Eight Republicans joined all Democrats in voting 55 to 45 for the measure from Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., which invokes the War Powers Act to block Trump from engaging in hostilities without consulting Congress except in cases where self-defense is required against a clear, imminent attack.</p>
<p>Trump is expected to veto the measure, which he warned Wednesday on Twitter would “show weakness” and “sends a very bad signal.” Neither the Senate nor the House, which has yet to vote on the measure, has the votes to overcome a veto - though proponents have argued that getting bipartisan majorities of both chambers in Congress to register their strong desire to rein in Trump’s Iran policy will send an indelible message to the administration nonetheless.</p>
<p>Kaine launched the effort to restrain Trump just a day after the strike that killed top Iranian military commander Qasem Soleimani, and gained early Republican support from Sens. Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Rand Paul, R-Ky., who were incensed that even after the operation, administration officials were tight-lipped about their reasons for carrying it out, and unrepentant about not bringing lawmakers into the loop on their decision-making.</p>
<p>GOP support for the measure expanded to include Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Todd Young of Indiana after Kaine agreed to remove specific references to Trump from the resolution in a later draft, giving the measure enough votes to pass the Senate.</p>
<p>But the measure languished for several weeks, as the chamber devoted its full attention to Trump’s impeachment trial. After Trump was acquitted, Sen. Jerry Moran, R-Kan., announced he too would back the war powers resolution; Sens. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., Bill Cassidy, R-La., and Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, also joined the GOP lawmakers voting in favor of the measure Thursday.</p>
<p>There is expected to be bipartisan backing for the measure in the House, where last month, members voted 224-194 in favor of a similar, but non-binding resolution restraining Trump’s Iran actions, with the support of three Republicans.</p>
