<h1>Report that Trump may hold campaign event next week in Pittsburgh spurs criticism</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two of Western Pennsylvania’s top officials discouraged President Donald Trump from holding an in-person campaign event in Pittsburgh next week after The New York Times reported he’s “exploring” the option.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, insisting that the region is&nbsp;“doing very well on stopping the spread” of COVID-19, said Mr. Trump — who is currently infected with the disease — should think twice before coming.</p>
<p>“We won't jeopardize that success &amp; I hope the *President of the United States* would never deliberately try to do so,” Mr. Fitzgerald wrote on Twitter on Wednesday evening.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump’s reelection campaign has not publicly announced a visit to Pittsburgh for the president, but Times reporter Maggie Haberman reported that it’s&nbsp;“exploring having [Mr. Trump] hold an event (not a rally) in Pittsburgh on Monday,” citing three people familiar with the discussions.</p>
<p>“They’re setting up possible&nbsp;travel plans for him all week, with later in the week seeming more solid,” Ms. Haberman tweeted — a report that Mr. Fitzgerald and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto cited in their warnings.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto asked on Twitter,&nbsp;“I thought those who were even in the presence of COVID-19 are to quarantine for 14 days?” The mayor followed his question by urging Pittsburghers to vote&nbsp;“like your life depends on it.”</p>
<p>The mayor is right that for people who come into contact with someone who has COVID-19, they are recommended to isolate for 14 days since symptoms may appear 2 to 14 days after exposure to the virus, according to guidance by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>But for those who actually have the virus, the CDC says that they may end quarantine after at least 10 days since their symptoms first appeared, at least 24 hours without a fever and when their other symptoms are improving as well.</p>
<p>That guidance is for standard cases of COVID-19, but for those who have more serious cases, they may be recommended to isolate up to 20 days, upon guidance with a health care provider, the CDC says.</p>
<p>The safety of a trip to Pittsburgh on Monday for Mr. Trump would hinge on several factors — not all of which are known publicly.</p>
<p>The Times has reported that Mr. Trump appeared lethargic at an event last Thursday, and sounded raspy in an interview on Fox News that night. Late into the early morning hours of last Friday, Mr. Trump said he had tested positive for the virus, and it was reported that he had a mild cough, nasal congestion and fatigue.</p>
<p>If he was indeed experiencing symptoms last Thursday, he would be able to leave isolation on Oct. 11 at the very earliest under CDC guidelines — a day before the rumored Pittsburgh visit — if he met the other recommendations, too. But there are indications that Mr. Trump’s case of COVID-19 was — and is — more&nbsp;severe. He was administered supplemental oxygen at one point. That would put the date closer to Oct. 21 — under the public health guidelines — for him to be around others.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump could leave isolation earlier, the CDC says, if he receives two negative test results in a row, “from tests done at least 24 hours apart.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Trump’s doctor said the president isn’t showing symptoms of the virus, and hadn’t for the previous 24 hours, CBS News reported.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign could not be reached for comment.</p>
