<h1>Supreme Court declines to make 2nd Amendment ruling in New York gun case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — A 2nd Amendment challenge to a New York City gun ordinance fizzled in the Supreme Court on Monday, but conservative justices looked poised to expand gun rights in future cases.</p>
<p>In a brief unsigned opinion, the high court said the New York case was moot because the city had repealed the ordinance that barred licensed gun owners from carrying their weapons across town or outside the city.</p>
<p>The decision is only the latest disappointment for 2nd Amendment advocates. For a decade, they have tried and failed to get the Supreme Court to rule squarely on whether gun owners have a constitutional right to carry a firearm with them in public.</p>
<p>The decision dismissing the case may have been unsigned, but three justices filed a dissent.</p>
<p>“By incorrectly dismissing this case as moot, the court permits our docket to be manipulated in a way that should not be countenanced,” wrote Justice Samuel Alito Jr., joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Neil Gorsuch.</p>
<p>The majority opinion said only that the case was moot, and that arguments made by plaintiffs to try to keep it alive were too late.</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. appeared to be in the majority along with liberal Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan.</p>
<p>Justice Brett Kavanaugh wrote separately to say he agreed with the decision, but that the issue warrants the Supreme Court’s attention.</p>
<p>“I share Justice Alito’s concern that some federal and state courts may not be properly applying” the Supreme Court’s decision recognizing an individual’s right to gun ownership, Kavanaugh wrote.</p>
<p>“The court should address that issue soon, perhaps in one of the several Second Amendment cases with petitions for certiorari now pending before the court.”</p>
<p>New York, California and other liberal states restrict who can carry guns in public and under what circumstances. And the justices have repeatedly refused to strike down those laws.</p>
<p>But Monday’s brief ruling is not the last word on the issue. The court has other appeals pending that raise 2nd Amendment challenges to state restrictions on semiautomatic weapons and on carrying guns in public.</p>
