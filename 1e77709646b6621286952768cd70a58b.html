<p>How far would you go for an incredible cupcake, a caramel bear claw or a “solid” brownie?</p>
<p>If you’re Steve Emery, about 12 miles.</p>
<p>That’s the trip he and his wife, Cathy, make at least once a week to eat at Farmhouse Kitchen &amp; Bakery in Claysville. And if his description of that walnut brownie sounds like faint praise, well, you don’t know West Finley’s fire chief. It’s a high compliment, especially when his blood sugar is low.</p>
<p>“Why don’t you have some juice?” Cathy asks him on a recent visit.</p>
<p>“‘I don’t want juice,” Chief Steve steams. “I want that last brownie.”</p>
<p>Victoria Culbertson, 24, laughs from behind the counter as the fire chief devours his prize, exclaiming, “That’s a solid brownie. Man, it’s good!”</p>
<p>It is indeed the last brownie because it’s almost 2 p.m., closing time for the restaurant. No one gripes about the early close because they know the Culbertson sisters have been busy in the kitchen since 5:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Victoria and her sister, Taylar, 21, have been drawing dessert lovers and diners from all over Washington County and beyond since May, when they opened their restaurant and bakery in the former Allum’s Family Restaurant.</p>
<p>Their father, David, was a regular there. When he heard Ron and Judy Allum were planning to retire after 35 years, he helped his daughters buy the old storefront for their first business together. The girls, both McGuffey High School grads, have always been close.</p>
<p>“We bickered over sharing clothes,” Victoria admits. “Now we’re getting along better than ever.”</p>
<p>Could you spend most of the day with your sister or brother, working side by side? Taylar, who has a culinary arts certificate from Pittsburgh Technical College, toiled in several restaurants before becoming Victoria’s partner.</p>
<p>Now she gets up around 5 a.m., feeds and walks her wire-haired Jack Russell terrier, and heads to the restaurant to start baking cupcakes, tartlets, trifles and other pastries that fill the display case. Farmhouse serves breakfast all day, from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m.</p>
<p>On Friday, the breakfast special was strawberry French toast. The lunch special, served from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m., was a cheeseburger with a side of mac and cheese. The steak and potato burrito is a best-seller. When I visited, the lunch special was a steak burrito made from shaved ribeye, hash browns, cheddar cheese, two fried eggs and horseradish sauce. It was the best $8.50 lunch I’ve ever had.</p>
<p>Taylar says she favors baking over cooking “because it’s more precise.” She also makes custom cakes, raspberry danish, lemon bundt cake, apple streusel and cream puffs stuffed with banana fosters or strawberry cream.</p>
<p>Taylar is the main cook and baker “I don’t share a kitchen well,” she says, laughing.</p>
<p>Victoria, who has a business degree from Washington &amp; Jefferson College with an emphasis on entrepreneurship, handles the fryer and toaster and works out front.</p>
<p>“We combined our degrees,” she says.</p>
<p>Victoria works alongside her sister from 6 a.m. to 2 p.m., heads home to feed and let out her three dogs, a Pomeranian and long-haired dachsunds. After a quick dinner with her fiance, Brian Rogers, she heads back to do prep work for the next day. The sisters worked until 8:30 p.m. the night before I visited.</p>
<p>“I don’t get to date. I don’t get to do anything!” Taylar gripes.</p>
<p>Never much of a partyer, she doesn’t really mind going to bed by 10 p.m. How many 21-year-olds can say they’re co-business owners?</p>
<p>“Tori has always been my best friend,” Taylar says. “I wouldn be half the person i am today without my sister or my dad.”</p>
<p>She will be Victoria’s maid of honor when her sister and Brian tie the knot May 9 in North Myrtle Beach, S.C. They will haul the ingredients for the wedding cake and cupcakes there and whip it up in the kitchen of a rented beach house. It will be a 10-day reception/family vacation for the Culbertsons and at least 50 guests.</p>
<p>The sisters hope Farmhouse customers will understand. “With a restaurant, it’s hard to get away,” Victoria says.</p>
<p>For a solid brownie and a steak and potato burrito, it’s worth the wait, Victoria.</p>
