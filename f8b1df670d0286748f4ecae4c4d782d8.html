<h1>Ex-Butler Health System COO admits to $1.3 million embezzlement scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former top official at Butler Health System accused of pilfering $1.3 million admitted her guilt Wednesday in a video plea hearing before a U.S. judge.</p>
<p>Stephanie Roskovski, 49, the former chief operating officer, pleaded guilty to mail fraud and filing a false tax return in connection with the scheme.</p>
<p>Her husband, Scott Roskovski, 51, a former detective for the district attorney in Butler County, is set to plead guilty in the same case on Thursday.</p>
<p>The pair was indicted last year on 42 counts of embezzlement, money-laundering, conspiracy and other crimes.</p>
<p>While Ms. Roskovski pleaded only to two counts, the other counts will be considered at sentencing as "relevant conduct" for a judge to craft a sentence.</p>
<p>Federal prosecutors said the couple used the stolen money for vacations, concerts, home improvements and expenses at their motocross complex.</p>
<p>Ms. Roskovski used company credit cards and expense reimbursement forms for personal expenses and then disguised the purchases as business costs, according to the indictment and plea.</p>
<p>Prosecutors had been seeking forfeiture of the couple's house in Butler, several vehicles and Switchback MC, their dirt bike racing operation.</p>
<p>Ms. Roskovski was COO from 2012 until she was fired in 2017. Mr. Roskovski was a longtime detective handling fraud cases until he was fired on suspicion of fraud.</p>
<p>Ms. Roskovski misappropriated money from the hospital system from 2011 to 2017. In addition to the thefts, the couple made false statements on loan applications in 2018, according to the government.</p>
<p>Directors at the hospital were given company credit cards for business expenses and required everyone who got one to document their expenses.</p>
<p>Ms. Roskovski used her corporate Visa card to make more than $500,000 in personal purchases and disguised them with fake receipts for bogus expenses such as "welcome gifts" and "physician recruitment."</p>
<p>She also presented the CEO with disbursement request forms on which she falsely said she had incurred business expenses, usually in amounts under $1,000. She then altered the forms by increasing the amounts before turning them in to the accounting department for payment. Those fraudulent disbursements totaled $489,000, according to the government.</p>
<p>Ms. Roskovski also submitted other disbursement forms to the CEO, saying she needed the money to buy gift cards for business meetings. After getting approval, she altered those forms to boost the amounts and used the money to buy items for herself.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge William Stickman will sentence her in October.</p>
