<h1>Pirates mailbag: Can Oneil Cruz stay at shortstop with his size?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Greetings and salutations. Welcome to the Pirates mailbag. Grapefruit League play opened on Saturday. There are games to discuss. Yeah, they're practice games, but baseball is back.&nbsp;</em><em>The mailbag will run on Monday and will be manned by yours truly, Nubyjas Wilborn. Send your questions to nwilborn@post-gazette.com or Twitter @nwilborn19.</em></p>
<p>This week, we're going to start the mailbag with three questions we frequently received over the last week. We'll do this when multiple people have the same inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Will Oneil Cruz remain at shortstop?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> Maybe. It will be up to him and his range. He has the athletic ability to make it work. Watching him work during spring training has been a highlight of camp. Pirates fans should be excited. I know that very few players have been that tall at shortstop. But Cruz (6-feet-7, 210 pounds) could break the mold. His height won't be what keeps him playing the position as long as he wants.</p>
<p><strong>Who will be the fifth starter?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> It appears that it'll come to Steven Brault, Derek Holland, and Chad Kuhl. Holland and Brault both had solid outings to open spring training games. Kuhl will pitch soon.</p>
<p>I give a slight edge to Brault. It'll be close. Don't be surprised to see all three make the team, with the two who don't get starter roles go to the bullpen.</p>
<p><strong>@Catfish293 and Jeff Holt @Jeffery_Holt:</strong> Will the Pirates add any other players via trade or free agency before the end of spring training?</p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> Ben Cherington has said that the team is always looking for ways to improve the team. If we are to take him at his word, then yes, the organization is seeking out a player or two. But it's been pretty quiet. For now, I don't expect anything significant.</p>
<p>Now let's get to your individual questions.</p>
<p><strong>Peter F. @petefromPitt:</strong> What do the Pirates need to do this year to be competitive in 2022 or 2023?</p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> It will start with continuing to develop young players like Mitch Keller, Bryan Reynolds, Kevin Newman, and Cole Tucker on the bi- league level. Next is making sure that Ke'Bryan Hayes is ready when he's called up. From there, they'll have to ensure continued development for guys like Cruz, Travis Swaggerty, and Quinn Priester. They'll want Chris Archer, Keone Kela, Adam Frazier, and possibly Gregory Polanco to play well and make good trades for them. Oh, and extend Josh Bell.</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl @Serenade_Az:</strong> What have you observed to be the biggest change between spring training last year and this year?</p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> A lot has been made of how manager Derek Shelton wanted camp to be fun and efficient. Players have been smiling and agreeing with the new set up. But one tangible difference is the way the team goes about live batting practice.</p>
<p>Last year, they used an L-screen in front of the pitcher and a hitting cage behind the batter. Shelton moved both and at-bats look more authentic. The change is popular with hitters and pitchers.</p>
