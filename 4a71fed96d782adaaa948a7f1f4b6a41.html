<h1>U.S. stocks open lower as the oil market continues to crumble</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stocks are opening lower on Wall Street and oil prices are continuing to collapse as traders anticipate demand for energy to shrivel because of the widespread business, factory and travel shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The world remains awash in an oversupply of crude just as demand for it is suffering an unprecedented pullback.</p>
<p>Dow Jones industrial average plunged 500 points, about 2%, at the open.&nbsp;The selling was widespread across industries, and 96% of the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 index fell and tech-heavy Nasdaq fell roughly 1%. In another sign investors were feeling nervous, prices for ultra-safe U.S. government bonds rose again, sending yields lower.</p>
<p>European markets were off significantly and Asian indexes in decline as uncertainty gripped investors, who are hungry for any sign of relief from the coronavirus pandemic’s economic stranglehold.</p>
<p>“The collapse in oil drives home the stark drop in economic activity around the world due to this virus,” said John Kilduff of Again Capital. “That puts a fine point on what we are staring down here.”</p>
<p>The extreme volatility in energy markets highlights investors’ worries about the duration of the coronavirus outbreak and its impact on the economy. That is in turn weighing on financial markets more broadly, including stocks.</p>
<p>The drop comes a day after the price of oil fell below zero on Monday, partly due to technical factors as traders shifted from one futures contract to another. The U.S. oil contract for delivery in May settled at negative $37.63 per barrel on Monday, an indication that investors don’t want to be left holding oil at a time when storage facilities are almost full and demand is at its lowest since the mid-1990s.</p>
<p>The tumult in the oil market reflects uncertainty over where the world economy will head as governments begin to loosen controls imposed to contain the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“We could merely be in the eye of the hurricane as the epicenters of its rage remain centered around demand devastation and crude oil oversupply,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp. said in a commentary.</p>
<p>“At a minimum, oil prices will be the last asset class to recover from lockdown” and only when travel restrictions are lifted, he said.</p>
<p>Brent crude, the international standard, dropped $45.72 to $19.85.</p>
<p>“The historic drop in WTI prices is an indication of the downward pressure which many other crude oil grades could face, given the oversupply situation,” Sushant Gupta of Wood Mackenzie said in a report.</p>
<p>The volatility in energy markets unsettled stock markets as well. with Germany’s DAX stock index losing 3.3% to 10,319 and the CAC 40 in France shedding 3.2% to 4,384. Britain’s FTSE 100 declined 2.6% to 5,664.</p>
<p>While share prices have gradually stabilized after wild swings earlier this year, uncertainty over growing numbers of coronavirus cases in Japan and in some Southeast Asian countries has left investors wary about new waves of infections.</p>
<p>Unconfirmed reports Tuesday that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un was in fragile condition after surgery added to the jitters. But South Korea’s government said Kim appeared to be handling state affairs as usual.</p>
<p>Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 stock index fell 2% Tuesday to 19,280.78 while the Hang Seng index in Hong Kong lost 2.2% to 23,793.55. South Korea’s Kospi slipped 1%, to 1,879.38.</p>
<p>Australia’s S&amp;P/ASX 200 fell 2.5% to 5,221.30 and the Shanghai Composite index gave up 0.9% to 2,827.01.</p>
<p>In a sign of continued caution in the market, Treasury yields remained extremely low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury slipped to 0.57% from 0.62% late Monday.</p>
<p>In currency trading, the dollar edged down to 107.40 Japanese yen from 107.63 on Monday. The euro fell to $1.0831 from $1.0862.</p>
