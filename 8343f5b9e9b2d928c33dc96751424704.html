<h1>Lab owner admits role in Medicare ripoff scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Monroeville businessman at the heart of a $127 million Medicare kickback scheme involving his genetic testing labs admitted his guilt Friday and will be sentenced in the spring.</p>
<p>Ravitej Reddy waived indictment by grand jury and pleaded to four counts before U.S. District Judge William Stickman.</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy admitted that he conspired with out-of-state marketing and medical companies to pay kickbacks for lab tests at his two testing labs here. Three of the accused out-of-state conspirators, who controlled telemedicine companies in Florida and South Carolina, have also been charged in the Southern District of Florida and one has entered a guilty plea there.</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy, 52, who owns Personalized Genetics LLC in Pittsburgh and Med Health Services Management in Monroeville, was accused Nov. 26 in a complaint called an information that typically indicates someone is cooperating in an investigation.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said when Mr. Reddy was charged that he and a group of cohorts in four southern states fleeced Medicare from May 2018 to April of this year.</p>
<p>The fraud is massive. Judge Stickman noted that part of Mr. Reddy's plea requires him to pay restitution of $77 million to Medicare.</p>
<p>The conspiracy involved two kinds of testing. One was called CGx, or cancer genomic testing, which used DNA sequencing to detect mutations that could indicate cancer risk. The other, PGx, or pharmacogenetic testing, is designed to detect the effectiveness of medications.</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy and six conspirators in the other states representing marketing companies and a Fort Lauderdale telemedicine company collected DNA samples from Medicare beneficiaries using kits either sent to their homes or administered to them at health fairs across the United States.</p>
<p>The samples were then sent to Mr. Reddy's labs in Pittsburgh in exchange for kickbacks, with the government paying the bill. To make the scheme work, the conspirators also paid kickbacks to a Florida telemedicine company to obtain fraudulent prescriptions for the genetic testing so that Mr. Reddy could charge Medicare.</p>
<p>Mr. Reddy said nothing in court except to answer Judge Stickman's questions about his guilt. He remains free on a $1 million bond.</p>
<p>The Fort Lauderdale telemedicine company was identified in court as Elab Partners. Owners Christopher Miano and Dean Austin were charged in September by prosecutors in Florida and Mr. Miano entered a guilty plea there last week.</p>
<p>The other accused conspirator who has been publicly named is James Simmons, founder of MedSymphony in South Carolina, who was indicted in Florida in September.</p>
