<h1>North Hills School District plans to retain Superintendent Patrick Mannarino</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The president of the North Hills School Board announced Thursday it intends to keep Superintendent Patrick Mannarino.</p>
<p>Allison Mathis said the board and Mr. Mannarino are working on a five-year extension of his contract, which is set to expire June 30, 2021.</p>
<p>“Dr. Mannarino is an amazing asset to North Hills and a very visible and active superintendent. Anyone who spends even a few minutes with him can see his passion and commitment to this district and how much he cares about our students,” Mrs. Mathis said. “I’m pleased that with the unanimous support of this board we have reached a tentative agreement to extend his contract upon its expiration and secure his future in North Hills.”</p>
<p>She added that, legally, the board cannot vote on the extension until July at the earliest.</p>
<p>“Thank all of you for your support. I really appreciate it,” Mr. Mannarino said. “North Hills is my home. I’m so proud of what we’ve built and thrilled to continue the greatness that we have established in this district.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mannarino has been superintendent since 2012. He has been at North Hills for 15 years, previously serving as assistant superintendent, high school principal and assistant high school principal.</p>
<p>In other business, the board approved a contract with turnKey Taxes Inc. to review the database for business privilege and mercantile taxes, and to collect any taxes found to be delinquent.</p>
<p>The contract is for one year with renewal options. Cost is $6,000 with turnKey Taxes also keeping 25% of the taxes collected.</p>
<p>The contract passed 8-1 with Kathy Reid dissenting.</p>
<p>The board also named Charles Bossong as its new chief of police, replacing Dean Lawrence, who left the district in January.</p>
<p>Mr. Bossong joined the district’s school police department when it formed in 2018. Prior to that, he served 25 years with the Franklin Park Police, and is a veteran of the Marines.</p>
<p>Also, state Sen. Lindsey Williams presented information about a proposed bill that reforms charter school payments.</p>
<p>She said the bill she co-sponsored would require charter school officials and boards to have the same financial and ethics rules as public school officials and boards. It also establishes a matrix for performance and outcomes, a “common sense tuition rate,” and enacts a 10-year moratorium on new cyber charter schools.</p>
<p>Ms. Williams added that the new funding formula could save the North Hills district $223,000 a year.</p>
