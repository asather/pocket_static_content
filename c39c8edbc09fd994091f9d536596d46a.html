<h1>Bethel Park High school blood drive lands international award </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bethel Park High School has received an international award for its commitment to student blood drives.</p>
<p>Bethel Park is the first high school in Pennsylvania to receive the honor from the Association of Donor Relations Professionals, an international division of America’s Blood Centers.</p>
<p>The award, which is given annually to a college, university or high school, will be presented at a ceremony in Phoenix in May.</p>
<p>Bethel Park High School, which has been holding blood drives for 13 years, was nominated by Kathryn Ryan, senior donor recruitment representative at Vitalant.</p>
<p>The award comes with local scholarship funds for the top schools that donate. The scholarships will be given to students at the high school’s awards night in May.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited and proud of the students, faculty, staff and administration of Bethel Park High School for winning this award,” Ms. Ryan said.</p>
<p>In the past 13 years, the school has held 54 blood drives and has collected more than 4,700 units of blood.</p>
<p>In 2019, the school had its best year on record for the number of blood drives held, the variety of people involved, and the amount of blood collected. During the past year, they collected 453 units of blood for patients in local hospitals.</p>
<p>Eight blood drives were held last year — five for students, a districtwide drive for teachers and staff, and two blood drives open to the community at large. The drives are organized by two student organizations: The Principal’s Action Committee for Students and the DECA Marketing Club.</p>
<p>“Their blood drive program engages and has the support of the entire school community, and most importantly, the program is organized and led by two enthusiastic and dedicated student organizations, which is the key to their phenomenal success,” Ms. Ryan said.</p>
<p>“It is a great honor to be receiving this national award because of Bethel Park High School’s commitment to raising awareness of the importance of blood donation,” said Principal Zeb Jansante.</p>
<p>The award is based upon the number of blood donations and the work done on the blood drives.</p>
<p>“Bethel Park High School was the top school in the Pittsburgh area this past year as far as number of donations,” Mr. Jansante said.</p>
<p>He credits the success of the blood drives to the students.</p>
<p>“The students make posters, utilize social media and make personal contacts with fellow students in order to get a commitment to donate,” Mr. Jansante said. “The students work hard to get everyone involved. It is hard to say no to a student or a classmate. This project adds an extra layer of school pride for our students.”</p>
<p>The school will also be recognized this spring at Vitalant’s annual luncheon. Vitalant, formerly Central Blood Bank, supplies blood to hospitals throughout Western Pennsylvania.</p>
