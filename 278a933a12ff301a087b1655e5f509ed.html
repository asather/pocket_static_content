<h1>At National Cemetery of the Alleghenies, an even more somber salute to U.S. heroes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A brief ceremony was held Sunday at the National Cemetery of the Alleghenies in Cecil to honor the men and women who gave their lives serving their country.</p>
<p>The Memorial Day event didn’t see the number of visitors it usually has for the annual occasion due to the ongoing pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After a brief speech, there was a wreath-laying ceremony, a moment of silence and the playing of “Taps.” Only cemetery staff participated in the ceremony. Visitors were allowed to peruse the grounds of the 292-acre cemetery, but were held to strict social distancing guidelines and mask wearing.</p>
