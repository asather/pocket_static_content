<h1>Pa. Supreme Court to review landmark church-abuse case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong><em>This story will be updated.</em></strong></p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court has agreed to review a precedent-setting decision by a lower court that allows alleged victims of long-ago sexual abuse by priests to sue Catholic dioceses, using a legal strategy that avoids the statute of limitations.</p>
<p>The court didn’t rule on the case itself yet, but its decision to review the case was a boost for Catholic dioceses seeking to limit their financial liabilities in abuse cases. Even if the Supreme Court ultimately upholds the precedent, plaintiffs will have to wait longer to press their claims.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court agreed to review a landmark 2019 ruling by the state Superior Court.</p>
<p>A three-judge panel of that court ruled unanimously that an Altoona-area woman, Renee Rice, could sue the Diocese of Altoona-Johnstown, alleging it engaged in fraud and conspiracy to cover up sexual abuse by numerous priests, including the one she said abused her in the 1970s and 1980s, the Rev. Charles Bodziak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the&nbsp;statute of limitations in effect at the time of the abuse, she wouldn’t have been able to sue over the abuse itself because it occurred too long ago. A Blair County court dismissed her lawsuit.</p>
<p>But she argued, and the Superior Court agreed, that she should be able to pursue her claim that the diocese engaged in conspiracy and fraud right up until a 2016 statewide grand jury report exposing the history of abuse and cover-up in the diocese.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That precedent, upheld later in 2019 by the full Superior Court, opened the door for numerous similar lawsuits against other Pennsylvania dioceses, including Pittsburgh, Greensburg and Harrisburg, alleging a similar pattern of fraud and conspiracy right up through a follow-up 2018 grand jury report on six dioceses.</p>
<p>Since most of the reported abuse in these dioceses occurred in the 20th century, when the statute of limitations of abuse-related lawsuits was limited, the Rice case was a potential game-changer by giving plaintiffs another way in the courthouse door.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawyer for the Harrisburg diocese cited the Rice case, and the potential for huge payouts if such lawsuits go through, as one reason for its filing for bankruptcy in February.</p>
<p>Attorney Alan Perer, representing Ms. Rice, said he was disappointed but not surprised the Supreme Court took up the case.</p>
<p>“It’s not entirely unexpected,” he said.&nbsp;“I was hoping we could avoid this because it was a well-reasoned (Superior Court) opinion. It was unanimous.” But given the significance of the case, he’s not surprised the top court wanted to give it a look.</p>
<p>In granting the Altoona-Johnstown diocese’s bid for a review, the court is asking both sides to answer various questions.</p>
<p>It’s asking whether the Superior Court was correct in applying a recent Supreme Court precedent in a medical malpractice case to the Altoona-Johnstown case.</p>
<p>It’s also asking whether the Superior Court was correct in allowing the&nbsp;“a secondary cause of action for civil conspiracy where the primary cause of the harm is time barred” under the statute of limitations for sexual abuse.</p>
<p>And the Supreme Court is asking the attorneys to weigh in on whether the diocese had a&nbsp;“never-ending duty” to disclose its&nbsp;“ongoing cover-up and Fr. Bodziak’s history of child molestation.”</p>
<p>The 2016 grand jury report&nbsp;named Father Bodziak as among priests who had committed sexual abuse in the Altoona-Johnstown diocese.</p>
<p>The Superior Court’s ruling did not actually rule the diocese committed conspiracy and fraud, but rather it said Ms. Rice should have the chance to prove her case before a Court of Common Pleas jury.</p>
<p>The effort to overcome the statute of limitations through the courts comes even as similar efforts have not yet succeeded at the legislative level. States such as New York and New Jersey have created windows in the statutes, allowing for lawsuits over decades-old abuse against any religious or other youth-serving group. Such efforts are still pending in the Pennsylvania General Assembly.&nbsp;</p>
