<h1>A tired Pitt team will get some rest before the ACC tournament. But is it too late?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The past 10 weeks have been a grind for the Pitt men’s basketball team, an exacting sequence of events that offers little in the way of a pause. From Dec. 30 through March 4, a stretch of 65 days, it played 19 games and never got more than four full days off.</p>
<p>By the 11th week, the Panthers had finished the work they had been doing, so on the 11th week, they rested.</p>
<p>As Pitt heads into the ACC tournament in Greensboro, N.C., where it will play a yet-to-be-determined opponent on the competition’s first day, it will be doing so as a relatively rested team, with five full days separating it from its 73-57 loss Wednesday at Georgia Tech. While the league’s 14 other teams will compete against each other this weekend, the Panthers will, at last, be away from the fray.</p>
<p>The timing of it, coming as late as it is, is admittedly awkward. For a team that finished the regular season by losing its final seven games, though, it’s a welcome development.</p>
<p>“I think all of that has taken a toll on us,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said Wednesday. “I really do. It’s an odd time to have a bye, at the end. We’ll take advantage of it.”</p>
<p>Over the past couple of weeks, Capel has publicly said his team is tired, so much so that he was worried about the effect all of those games would have even before the Panthers’ current skid began, back when they were 15-9 and looking like a shoo-in for a postseason tournament of some sort. There are built-in stoppages within any game, including a 150-second one every four minutes of game time, but they only provide so much of a lull.</p>
<p>With a team that is still accruing talent, meaning it’s not particularly deep right now, Pitt has had to lean heavily on its best players, meaning that parade of games has a greater impact than it may on other squads. It is one of only two teams in the ACC with four players averaging at least 30 minutes per game, with the other being Syracuse, a team with a 2-3 zone that is less physically exhausting for its players defensively.</p>
<p>Capel has made adjustments to account for that lack of a break. Some practices haven’t been as intense as normal, especially if there is only a day or two between games, and in some instances the day after a 9 p.m. tip-off, the Panthers won’t practice.</p>
<p>“It could be very beneficial, just getting into practice and listening to what coach says that we need to improve on and just competing, going at each other in practice like we did at the beginning of the season,” forward Eric Hamilton said.</p>
<p>The way the ACC schedule is set up, there are two different sets of games — ones played Monday through Thursday and others played Friday through Sunday. Over the course of the season, each team is excluded from one of those periods once. With a handful of exceptions that fall just short, like Pitt between its regular-season finale and the ACC tournament, that time away provides at least a full six days without a game. A couple of teams have also had a separate five-day stretch without a game, in addition to their designated off week.</p>
<p>Those recesses have been beneficial. Teams are 10-3 this season in their games immediately following the idle week, with Pitt and Louisville still waiting to play theirs. Three of those games took place against Pitt, matchups in which the Panthers went 1-2.</p>
<p>Given that and the placement of his team’s off week, at the tail end of the season and not at a time when it may have been more advantageous, Capel sees what he believes to be unfair irregularities in the schedule.</p>
<p>“I think it’s the worst time, if I’m being perfectly honest,” Capel said Wednesday. “I think we got screwed on the schedule. I’ve been upset about it. I wish other people were upset about it. We’re the only team that hasn’t had a bye. We won’t even get a full week like everyone else has had in our league.”</p>
<p>Another point of contention for the second-year Pitt coach exists in the frequency of games at inopportune time slots — either at noon, when the early tip dramatically alters a team’s pre-game routine, or at 9 p.m., which has an effect on what the team does the following day, especially if it’s a road game, meaning they won’t likely arrive back to campus until 3 a.m. or later.</p>
<p>This season, the Panthers have played 11 ACC games at noon or 9 p.m. (six of the former, five of the latter). The next-closest team in the conference in that category is Miami, with seven such games. Eleven of the league’s 15 teams have five or fewer such games.</p>
<p>“It’s been really interesting,” Capel said. “I do think that has affected us a little bit.”</p>
<p>Whatever extra energy or strength comes from an additional day or two without a game will be compounded by the urgency that comes with this time of year. The toil of a season is nearly complete, the stakes are higher, and players are pushing to continue their seasons and, in the cases of some, their college careers.</p>
<p>Just how relevant that is to a Pitt team that has lost five of its past seven games by at least 10 points, looking drained or disinterested for much of that time, is uncertain.</p>
<p>“From here on out, it’s win or go home,” Hamilton said. “That’s my mentality and I want to make sure my teammates have that same mentality, as well, which I think they will.”</p>
