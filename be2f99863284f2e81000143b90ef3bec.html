<h1>John Calipari comes to WPIAL championships for his old high school coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of Cornell High School’s fans sat three rows behind the bench at Thursday night’s WPIAL Class 1A boys basketball championship. He clapped a lot for the Raiders and even got to his feet a few times and cheered for Cornell.</p>
<p>This was John Calipari, the fan.</p>
<p>Calipari, the University of Kentucky coach, flew in to Pittsburgh Thursday night for the game just because of Cornell coach Bill Sacco.</p>
<p>When Calipari played at Moon High School, Sacco was his coach. Sacco’s Cornell team played Vincentian in the WPIAL title game at Petersen Events Center. It says something about Calipari that he would make the effort to come in for his old high school coach. Kentucky plays Saturday.</p>
<p>“I had to come, just for [Sacco],” Calipari said. “He means a lot to me. He didn’t even know I was coming.”</p>
<p>Cornell was playing in a title game for the first time since 2012, when it lost to Lincoln Park at the Palumbo Center.</p>
<p>“We’re still very close,” Calipari said of his relationship with Sacco. “We talk at least once every couple weeks.”</p>
