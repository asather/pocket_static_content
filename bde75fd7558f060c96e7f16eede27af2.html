<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins center Evgeni Malkin has made a donation to the Ronald McDonald House of Pittsburgh that, though the monetary amount is unknown, was enough to help the nonprofit “fulfill its entire pantry wish list and provide games for family entertainment,” according to the Penguins.</p>
<p>“My wife, Anna, and I wanted to do something to help families in the Pittsburgh area,” Malkin said in a news release. “We know it is hard for everyone right now, but we couldn’t imagine having a child hospitalized during this uncertain time. While we are comfortable in our own homes, others are relying on the generosity of others, like Ronald McDonald House, to open their doors.”</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 crisis continues to unfold, the Ronald McDonald House is currently serving as a home for 20 families with hospitalized children, according to the release. Malkin’s donation will aid the organization with giving these kids hot meals, important supplies such as paper products and games to help escape from the realities of their situations.</p>
<p>In addition, the Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation also gave the Ronald McDonald house a care package of Penguins-themed promotional items, blankets and Malkin bobbleheads.</p>
<p>“We are incredibly grateful for the support that Evgeni Malkin has extended to our charity,” Eleanor Reigel, Ronald McDonald House’s executive director, said in the press release. “His generosity ensures that we can continue to provide our families with warm meals, essential household and pantry items and a safe and supportive environment to call home during this uncertain time.”</p>
<p>Malkin, who led the Penguins with 74 points before the NHL suspended play in March, is just one of many Penguins trying to provide Pittsburgh families with relief during this trying time.
