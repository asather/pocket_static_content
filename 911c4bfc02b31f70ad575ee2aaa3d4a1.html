<h1>Special teams, just like a special goalie, could turn the tables in a short series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the many, many things that will make this NHL postseason unique is the qualifying round. In a five-game series, the margin for error is even slimmer than in a seven-game slugfest, and the odds of an upset surely spike.</p>
<p>Thus, much has been made these past two months about the potential for a hot goalie to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/23/nhl-return-to-play-24-team-playoffs-penguins-canadiens-analysis/stories/202005230053" target="_blank">steal the Penguins’ opening series</a> with the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>Well, what if somebody’s power play suddenly sparks into a five-alarm fire?</p>
<p>Special teams could be just the thing to swing a shortened series.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be the most important [factor],” Jared McCann said Friday.</p>
<p>Once again, success on special teams made the Penguins one of the top teams in the East. But this time around, it wasn’t the unit you might first think of. It was actually their aggressive penalty kill that ranked in the league’s top 10.</p>
<p>In the fall, their 10-game run without surrendering a power play goal helped the Penguins survive some of those early-season injuries. The penalty kill was among the NHL’s stingiest in December and January. And even as the Penguins skidded into the pause with a 3-8-0 finish, that unit remained a rare positive.</p>
<p>When play was suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Penguins ranked eighth with an 82.1% success rate on the penalty kill. That was the team’s highest percentage since 2015-16, when Mike Sullivan was hired midseason.</p>
<p>“Overall, I think we showed this year that we could be really dangerous on the power play, but also we can be really good on the PK,” said Kris Letang, one of a few Penguins players with a prominent role on both special-teams units.</p>
<p>Assistant coach Jacques Martin, who oversees the penalty kill, believes that unit was at its best when the Penguins ratcheted up the pressure and pesky forwards such as Brandon Tanev and Teddy Blueger took away time and space.</p>
<p>But that approach requires all four defenders to move together as if on a string to ensure that soft spots don’t open up in the high slot or at the back door. If they aren’t a cohesive quadrilateral, skilled opponents could soon celebrate.</p>
<p>Do the Habs have the firepower to capitalize if the Penguins get out of line?</p>
<p>This season, the Canadiens got at least one power play goal from 14 players. But only two, leading scorer Tomas Tatar and young forward Nick Suzuki, scored more than three. So they had a hard time finding combinations that worked.</p>
<p>The numbers reflect that. Their 17.7% conversion rate ranked 22 in the NHL. Only four of the 24 playoff teams scored less frequently with their power play.</p>
<p>Still, they have enough talent to pop a few past the Penguins. Shea Weber still has one of the NHL’s heaviest shots from the point. Max Domi, assuming he suits up, is a playmaking threat. And fellow forward Jonathan Drouin is back on the ice after injuries limited him to only 27 games during the regular season.</p>
<p>“When you look at their power play, they’re a team that has tremendous speed, great quickness,” Martin said. “They have a lot of skilled forwards [but not] a lot of size. ... I think it’s a power play we have to be prepared to pressure.”</p>
<p>Speaking of pressure on the power play, the Penguins better get theirs working again if they want to make a deep playoff run up in Canada. They <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/08/penguins-camp-preview-how-to-fix-power-play-pittsburgh/stories/202007080023" target="_blank">ranked just 16th in the league this season at 19.9%</a>, their lowest mark in a few seasons.</p>
<p>They had four stretches of at least four games without a power play goal and at one point nearly had the longest slump in team history. Some of it was due to the trade of Phil Kessel, their top power play point-getter a season ago. Injuries were the other main factor, leaving them without top talent and continuity.</p>
<p>“But,” Sullivan said last Wednesday, “we feel like we have capable people.”</p>
<p>For the first time in their postseason training camp, the Penguins at Friday’s practice had all of those capable people on the ice. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/24/sidney-crosby-returns-penguins-practice-pittsburgh/stories/202007240110" target="_blank">Sidney Crosby rejoined the team</a>, and net-front maniac Patric Hornqvist has been back in the mix since Monday.</p>
<p>Prior to Friday, with at least one key player sitting out, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/15/penguins-power-play-training-camp-2020-coronavirus/stories/202007150135" target="_blank">Jared McCann worked on the top unit</a>. But late in Friday’s session, that group, without any defenders, practiced scripted plays that encouraged player movement. McCann was not among the seven players who cycled through the low-key drill.</p>
<p>In McCann’s old spot in the left circle was Bryan Rust, a righty who scored nine of his 27 goals on the power play this season. Rust was joined by Crosby, Hornqvist, Evgeni Malkin, Jake Guentzel and blue-liners Letang and Justin Schultz.</p>
<p>So, with Game1&nbsp; against the Canadiens looming Aug. 1, it’s clear Sullivan and the Penguins are still searching for solutions for their inconsistent power play.</p>
<p>While they know special teams can swing this series, they’re not sweating it yet.</p>
<p>“It can make a difference in a short series like that,” Letang said. “We’re working hard right now. I think the intensity and the attention to details are there.”</p>
