<h1>After initially backing federal aid to states, Trump questions ‘bailing out poorly run states’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — As talk in Washington has swiftly moved to the next coronavirus relief package, President Donald Trump on Monday questioned whether federal taxpayers should provide money of “poorly run” states and cities run by Democrats.</p>
<p>“Why should the people and taxpayers of America be bailing out poorly run states (like Illinois, as example) and cities, in all cases Democrat run and managed, when most of the other states are not looking for bailout help?” Trump asked on Twitter.</p>
<p>“I am open to discussing anything, but just asking,” the president added.</p>

<p>Trump’s question was a reversal from late last week when, after the federal Paycheck Protection Program received a new injection of funds, he indicated support for addressing state and local government revenue shortfalls due to the pandemic as part of the next round of relief.</p>
<p>A bipartisan letter from the National Governors Association to congressional leaders made clear that the loss of revenue and financial hardship caused by coronavirus is happening in states of all political stripes.</p>
<p>“Congress must appropriate an additional $500 billion, specifically for states and territories, in direct federal aid that allows for replacement of lost revenue,” Maryland Republican Gov. Larry Hogan and New York Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo wrote in the April 21 letter, which was signed on behalf of the nation’s governors. “These continuing losses will force states and territories not only to make drastic cuts to the programs we depend on to provide economic security, educational opportunities, and public safety, but the national economic recovery will be dramatically hampered.”</p>
<p>Trump’s social media post was the latest twist in an ongoing debate over federal aid to state and local governments. Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., suggested that states facing huge public employee pension debts be offered the opportunity to file for bankruptcy, which they are now prohibited from doing.</p>
<p>McConnell said Senate Republicans supported a “pause” in considering federal relief aid to states and cities, which drew criticism from Democrats as well as some Republicans.</p>
<p>He relented somewhat Monday on his stance about overall state aid, telling a Fox News Radio’s Guy Benson that “There probably will be another state and local funding bill, but we need to make sure that we achieve something that will go beyond simply sending out money.”</p>
<p>Controversy over federal help to states was magnified when Illinois Senate President Don Harmon of Oak Park earlier this month asked the state’s congressional delegation for more than $41.6 billion in federal aid, including $10 billion for the state’s vastly underfunded public employee pension system.</p>
<p>The state’s five GOP congressman rejected the request as an attempt to use federal money to paper over decades of mismanagement, including the pensions which have a $138 billion unfunded liability.</p>
<p>Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, who most recently was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations in the Trump administration, touched on the issue on Twitter last week.</p>
<p>“A 5th aid package should not bail out states that have recklessly spent and taxed their way into oblivion. Illinois lawmakers are seeking tens of billions in taxpayer funds to deal with the state’s looming pension debt — that has nothing at all to do with the COVID-19 pandemic,” Haley tweeted.</p>
<p>Asked about Haley’s comment, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Sunday tossed it back to Republicans.</p>
<p>“I want to know if members of the Republican Party in Illinois agree with her that Illinois doesn’t deserve to get any federal help. That’s what I want to know,” he said.</p>
<p>That prompted the state GOP to tweet that Illinois “should get the same proportional funding as others. IL pays more than its fair share. But IL Dems should not use the covid-19 crisis as an excuse to receive a multi-billion dollar pension bailout along the lines of Sen. Harmon’s shameless request.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi promised Sunday that the next coronavirus relief package will provide “significant” money for state and local governments, akin to the more than $600 billion that has gone to small business.</p>
<p>Criticized by some Democrats for not including local assistance funds in the latest package, Pelosi urged them to “just calm down” in an interview on CNN. “The governors are impatient,” Pelosi added.</p>
<p>Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, told Fox News on Sunday that the administration will “consider” local aid in the next package but “we’ll only do it with bipartisan support.”</p>
<p>Democratic U.S. Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi of Schaumburg said he thought it was imperative to help state and local governments and to avoid laying off first responders dealing with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“If you don’t take care of, or help those municipalities and state governments that are really suffering, they’re going to add to the woes of the economy by laying off hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of firefighters, police officers and other public servants and that only furthers the hole in which we’re in,” Krishnamoorthi said Sunday on WGN AM-720.</p>
<p>“I hope that my Republican counterparts really basically step up and talk about the need for this. It should not be a partisan issue at this point,” he said.</p>
<p>On Monday,&nbsp;congressional leaders outlined vastly different priorities for the provisions they would like to include in the next coronavirus bill when they return next week, with Democrats seeking more wage protections for workers and Republicans aiming to insulate companies from employee lawsuits.</p>
<p>McConnell released a statement confirming his intention to bring the Senate back into session May 4 and said his top priority would be “strong protections from opportunistic lawsuits” for health-care workers and businesses.</p>
<p>“We cannot get distracted by preexisting partisan wish lists or calls to paper over decades of reckless decisions that had nothing to do with covid-19,” McConnell said, in apparent reference to House Democrats’ plans to advance a massive new coronavirus rescue bill that would include a number of liberal priorities, along with aid to prop up state budgets.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., told Democrats on a conference call that the House, too, would be reconvening May 4. Earlier, Pelosi said Congress might need to consider offering a guaranteed income to some Americans to help the country recover from the economic impact of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>“We may have to think in terms of some different ways to put money in people’s pockets,” Pelosi said on MSNBC. “Others have suggested a minimum income, a guaranteed income for people. Is that worthy of attention now? Perhaps so.”</p>
<p>The comments from McConnell and Pelosi put the two parties on a collision course over their next steps to deal with the pandemic, setting up an ideological and partisan clash over the federal government’s path forward as the nation’s economy reels heading into the election.</p>
