<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — While protesters loyal to President Donald Trump rallied in state capitals last week against stay-at-home&nbsp;orders, lawmakers in both parties pledged that reopening the economy amid the COVID-19 pandemic will be guided by health experts and likely conducted in phases.</p>
<p>Yet the congressional delegation representing the Pittsburgh region split on some of the finer details of that approach, including the metrics that should guide officials, the timeline for allowing businesses to resume and the value of universal COVID-19 testing — which is far from ready to track the full extent of the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>Two plans for Pennsylvania released last week — one by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/22/Pennsylvania-Governor-Wolf-color-coded-plan-begin-reopening-lockdown-coronavirus/stories/202004220164?cid=search" target="_blank">Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat</a>, and the other by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/23/Pat-Toomey-COVID-19-pandemic-reopen-economy/stories/202004230125" target="_blank">Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican</a>&nbsp; — underscored the caution required to&nbsp;resume business, a decision that could carry complicated policy, health and political risks.</p>
<p>Lawmakers, largely endorsing the phased approach outlined in both plans, tiptoed around the question of COVID-19 testing, pointing to other metrics and trust in business owners and customers to take the virus seriously.</p>
<p>“We just can’t have a one-size-fits-all solution to any of this, whether you’re talking about all the United States or my district,” said Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters.</p>
<p>Mr. Reschenthaler, a supporter of Mr. Trump, said he successfully pressed Mr. Wolf to exempt coal mines, car dealerships and construction from the state’s mandatory shutdowns. While he acknowledged the need for more testing, the tests are “not the end-all, be-all,” he said.</p>
<p>“These tests aren’t perfect, and the risks of getting a false negative and going out, not practicing social distancing and infecting a slew of people is really bad,”&nbsp;Mr. Reschenthaler said, referring to reports of faulty test results.</p>
<p>As part of its bill last week to replenish a small business loan program, Congress approved $25 billion for testing, requiring the Trump administration to develop a national testing strategy aimed at scaling up and improving the accuracy of tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, also raised questions about the scale and accuracy of testing.&nbsp;<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>“Both plans rely on an assumption of testing and data that we need to be very careful about,” Mr. Lamb said. The per-capita rates of COVID-19 cases, which both the governor and senator propose as metrics,&nbsp;“can change based on whether you’re only testing 100 people or you’re testing 1,000 people.”</p>
<p>“Our mass quantity of testing is still way below where it needs to be to have confidence in what those rates are,” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Lamb said he generally agrees with reopening businesses in stages.</p>
<p>“A governor is well-placed to figure out that sequence,” he said. “My concern is we keep putting tools in his hands to get better and better data.”</p>
<p><strong>A series of phases</strong></p>
<p>In Mr. Wolf’s plan, businesses would reopen according to a color-coded series of phases — red, yellow and green — based on&nbsp;Pennsylvania Department of Health metrics, plus a data tool being developed by Carnegie Mellon University. The plan, in part, requires regions to have an average of less than 50 cases per 100,000 individuals over a 14-day period.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the north-central and northwest regions of the state are targeted to begin this phase on May 8.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey, who was among the lawmakers named to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/16/Senator-Pat-Toomey-Trump-task-force-supports-reopening-parts-economy-very-soon/stories/202004160161?cid=search" target="_blank">the White House’s task force</a> to reopen the economy,&nbsp;proposed allowing all but 18 counties in southeastern Pennsylvania to begin reopening this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Certain outdoor-centric businesses — such as construction, car dealerships, nurseries and golf courses — should be permitted to reopen immediately, and doctors and hospitals should resume elective procedures with expanded testing for health care workers.</p>
<p>“There would be more businesses able to reopen sooner under my plan than the governor’s,” Mr. Toomey told reporters last week.</p>
<p>Under both plans, businesses would be allowed to reopen subject to federal health guidelines of social distancing, personal hygiene and face protection.&nbsp;But monitoring and enforcement of federal health guidelines remained an open question.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb called for a greater collaboration between the Occupational Safety and Health Administration and local officials to ensure employees have the protection they need.</p>
<p>Other lawmakers, like Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, did not anticipate many problems and said customers could report any serious issues to local authorities.&nbsp;Mr. Kelly — who contracted COVID-19 last month and expected to receive his doctor’s clearance to return to Washington this week — said he would like businesses to open&nbsp;“as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“I really doubt you’d have to have a lot of policing … that’s not who we are in America,” Mr. Kelly said. “People can self-police themselves. They know now this is a serious virus.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Statistics gathered by the Pennsylvania Department of Health support that large swaths of the state have escaped the worst of COVID-19. As of April 20, the department <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85054b06472e4208b02285b8557f24cf" target="_blank">reported 2,746 patients hospitalized</a>, mostly in the Philadelphia area, and 71% of the state’s ventilators remained available. Allegheny County reported hundreds of empty ICU and medical/surgical beds, according to the data.</p>
<p>Hospitals are working with Mr. Wolf’s office on allowing patients to resume elective procedures and doctor’s visits, said Andy Carter, president and CEO of The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“If a region of the state was fortunate enough to have a very modest number of cases present, you can expect that they would likely be in a position to begin the long journey toward normalcy sooner than others,” Mr. Carter said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/20/Hundreds-gather-at-Capitol-in-Harrisburg-for-anti-shutdown-rally-calling-to-reopen-Pennsylvania/stories/202004200085?cid=search" target="_blank">protests at state capitals</a>, including Harrisburg, were organized by Liberate America, an organization led by a self-described Trump devotee demanding an approach that “makes individuals responsible for social distancing standards, not enforced by government fiat.”</p>
<p>Yet the protests were small in number and in the minority of public opinion polls. Even Mr. Trump — who has at times clashed with the advice of his health experts in calling to reopen the economy — urged caution.</p>
<p>After Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, allowed some businesses to reopen, Mr. Trump told reporters he “strongly” disagrees with Mr. Kemp’s decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s colleague, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said there isn’t nearly enough data to reopen businesses.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey called the limited availability of COVID-19 testing “a colossal national failure” and urged the Trump administration to expedite new rules&nbsp;requiring nursing homes to disclose information about their COVID-19 cases.&nbsp;Nationwide, a quarter of all COVID-19 deaths are among nursing home residents.</p>
<p>“People have a right to this information,” Mr. Casey said. “If you live in a community and there’s a big outbreak in the nursing home two blocks away, you should know that.”</p>
<p>“We are getting reminders all the time that if you declare victory too early, you’re going to have a spike and make reopening a lot harder,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p><strong>Debate preview</strong></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh region may preview the contentious debate that could play out across the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s proposal suggested&nbsp;allowing Beaver County to begin reopening businesses because more than half of its cases are confined to residents and staff in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/06/Brighton-Rehab-and-Wellness-Beaver-PA-nursing-home-coronavirus-positive-cases/stories/202004060124" target="_blank">a single nursing home</a>. Mr. Toomey called that outbreak in Brighton an “anomaly” and a “localized” outbreak that should be considered to be contained.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, whose district includes Beaver County, disagreed with using that metric as a measure of containment.</p>
<p>“All of this started with one person coming here from China — and it helps remind you that it doesn’t take much for this thing to spread from a small dot on the map to a huge cluster,” Mr. Lamb said. “And so if you already have a huge cluster in the middle of the county, even if it’s inside of one building, it poses a risk to everyone in the county.”</p>
