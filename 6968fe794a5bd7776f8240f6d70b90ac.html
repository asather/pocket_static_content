<p>Western Pennsylvania snagged a few ribbons and medals in the statewide beer, cider and wine competitions at the Pennsylvania Farm Show.</p>
<p>In the second annual beer competition, judges from eight states sampled 262 craft brews from breweries in 25 counties. The winners, announced on the Farm Show’s opening day Saturday, include the North Side’s Allegheny City Brewing, which took third place in the kettle sours category with a&nbsp;boysenberry sour now called My Name is Boysen.</p>
<p>Erie-based Lavery Brewing won a big one: first in&nbsp;IPA with more than 7.5% alcohol by volume for its&nbsp;Double Dulachand. It also took first place for a Belgian,&nbsp; Gold Leopard, and third in light lagers and ales with its&nbsp;Lucha Gorda.</p>
<p>In the cider competition, Lawrenceville-based Arsenal Cider House won first in modern sweet cider with its&nbsp;Event Blend and third in spiced cider with its Grants Flying Pumpkin.</p>
<p>The North Side’s Threadbare Cider won first in spiced cider with its&nbsp;Bouquet de Rose. Threadbare’s Hopped took first in hopped cider, a category in which Hopped by&nbsp;Godfrey Run Cider Mill in Lake City, Erie County, won second.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cider competition had judges from five states judging&nbsp;101 entries in nine categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both competitions pump up the Pennsylvania producer positives of the state’s beer and cider industries. The PA Preferred Legacy Award for a beer made with predominantly Pennsylvania-sourced ingredients went to Saucony Creek Brewing Co. of Kutztown, Berks County, for its PA Preferred English Ale. That brewery’s Rum Barr Aged maple Mistress also won Best of Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Best of Show cider was Northern Spy from Wyndridge Farm LLC of Dallastown, York County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you happen to be going to Harrisburg for the Farm Show, which runs through Saturday, you can sample these beers and ciders and meet some of the people who make them at&nbsp;the Bier Garden and Cider Garden in the Main Hall. Also look for them at the places where they’re made.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There also were a multitude of winners from the 36 wineries in the Farm Show’s annual wine competition. One of three winners of the&nbsp;Governor’s Cup was Mazza Vineyard of North East in Erie County, which won&nbsp;Best in Show for sweet/dessert wines with its Ice Wine of Vidal Blanc (2017). Other double gold winners included North East’s Presque Isle Wine Cellars for its Blushing Heron and North East’s&nbsp;Courtyard Winery for its 2018 Twisted Red.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other medal-winning wineries from this end of the state include Greendance near Mount Pleasant in Westmoreland County, Kingview Mead in Pleasant Hills and Thistlethwaite in Greene County.&nbsp;You also can sample and purchase wines at the Farm Show.&nbsp;</p>
