<h1>Andean condor egg on view at the National Aviary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two big birds named Lianni and Lurch have laid a very important egg at the National Aviary. Though the North Side bird zoo is temporarily closed to the public, people can watch the male and female take turns sitting on their egg because the habitat is outside of the building and can be viewed from Arch Street.</p>
<p>Lianni, the female who laid the mango-sized egg, and Lurch, her breeding partner, are Andean condors. The egg is important because in the wild the condors are “critically endangered” in Ecuador and “threatened” throughout much of their range in other South American countries.</p>
<p>Lianni produced four chicks in the past with her former partner Rhodan, and three of them were released into the wild, when grown, in Colombia and Venezuela. After Rhodan died, Lurch was brought to Pittsburgh in 2017 to be Lianni’s breeding partner.</p>
<p>Lurch also has a proven track record. He produced three offspring at other facilities.</p>
<p>This egg was laid earlier in April, and is expected to hatch in early June. Lianni's last surviving chick was born at the aviary in 2009.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lianni and Lurch weigh 25 pounds each, and observers may be lucky enough to see them display their 10-foot wingspans.&nbsp; They will also see the birds taking turns incubating the egg while the other one stretches legs, basks in sunlight or takes a bath. Lianni is the one with a bald head. The head of Lurch is topped by a crest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andean condors are vultures, and in the wild their primary diet is dead animals. At the National Aviary, staff brings food to them and the 550 other animals that live there. Most are birds, but there are seven mammals — three popular sloths and four Malayan flying foxes, which are actually very large bats.</p>
<p>Lianni’s 36th birthday was April 23. Lurch is 49.</p>
<p>“Lianni is truly a special bird” and has&nbsp;“overcome so much, said veterinarian Pilar Fish. In 2012 she treated Lianni for “a difficult illness” that required a blood transfusion, which had never before been done with an Andean condor. Lianni fully recovered&nbsp;“and now lives a normal, active life.”</p>
<p>The condor breeding program at the Nation Aviary is part of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums Species Survival Plan.</p>
