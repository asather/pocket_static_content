<h1>Pirates-Cubs preview: Tough test against first-place Chicago</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — The big story here isn’t necessarily the first-place Cubs, although it’s always fun to go to Wrigley Field. Hitting an MLB-low .171 coming out of their first off-day, the Pirates need an offensive spark.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Cubs bullpen can do the trick.</p>
<p>While Chicago has won four of six over the Brewers and Reds — their series finale Thursday in Cincinnati was rained out — Cubs relievers have encountered a heap of trouble.</p>
<p>And you thought the Pirates were having a tough time.</p>
<p>The Cubs’ bullpen ERA (9.64) is by far the worst in baseball, the same for its walks per nine innings (9.64). Only Cincinnati’s relievers have a higher rate of home runs per nine (3.38).</p>
<p>The Pirates have allowed one home run, 13 walks and 13 earned runs in 26⅓ innings, but it’s nothing next to the Cubs bullpen: seven home runs allowed, 20 walks and 20 earned runs in 18⅔ innings.</p>
<p>So, what we’re saying is that it might be best to pay attention in the later innings.</p>
<p>What else can we expect this weekend? Let’s take a look:</p>
<p><strong>Players to watch</strong></p>
<p>▪ 2B Nico Hoerner — In his first full season in the majors, Hoerner — a first-round pick out (24th overall) of Stanford in 2018 — has a .389 batting average, with hits in all five of his starts.</p>
<p>▪ 3B Kris Bryant — The Cubs’ leadoff man has endured a slow start, as he snapped an 0-for-20 skid Wednesday. He’s also been battling a sore elbow. In 79 career games against the Pirates (78 starts) Bryant has 16 homers and 50 RBIs, his second-most against anyone.</p>
<p>▪ 1B Josh Bell — Bell has 10 home runs against the Cubs, his most against any team, though only two of those have come at Wrigley, where Bell is a career .222 hitter with a .702 OPS. The slugger is off to a slow start, hitting .174 (4-for-23) with no extra-base hits.</p>
<p><strong>Scouting the Cubs</strong></p>
<p>The Cubs have managed to win games because their offense and starting pitching has been much better than the bullpen.</p>
<p>The Cubs have hit 11 home runs, a total eclipsed only by the Tigers (15) and Reds (12). They’ve also scored 38 runs in six games (6.3 avg.), which is surpassed only by the Padres (44), who have played one more game.</p>
<p>Leading the charge has been first baseman Anthony Rizzo, who has three home runs. David Bote, Javier Baez and Ian Happ have contributed two apiece. The Cubs’ hottest hitter, though, might be Hoerner, who has seemingly stepped into the regular second-base role.</p>
<p>The same for many teams with power, the Cubs do strike out a lot. They’ve whiffed 67 times through six games. Only five teams have struck out more.</p>
<p>Series-wise, this one has not been kind to the Pirates, who last had a winning record against the Cubs in 2014 (14-5). In 2019, the Pirates went 8-11 against Chicago — 7-3 at PNC Park but just 1-8 at Wrigley.</p>
<p><strong>The matchups</strong></p>
<p>▪ Friday: RHP Trevor Williams (0-1, 7.36) vs. RHP Yu Darvish (0-1, 6.75)</p>
<p>Seems like it’s always a tossup with Darvish, who went 0-1 with a 4.00 ERA in three starts last season against the Pirates. On one hand, he struck out 18 and walked one in 18 innings. He also allowed four home runs in those games. Darvish has been trying to establish his split-finger fastball more.</p>
<p>▪ Saturday: RHP Mitch Keller (0-1, 1.80) vs. RHP Tyler Chatwood (1-0, 1.50)</p>
<p>The young Pirates right-hander makes his first start at Wrigley Field. In two starts last season against the Cubs, Keller went 0-1 with a 6.75 ERA. He allowed 14 hits over 9⅓ innings, with six doubles and two home runs.</p>
<p>▪ Sunday: TBA vs. LHP Jon Lester (1-0, 0.00)</p>
<p>In his second start of 2020, Lester has yet to allow a hit; he was lifted after five scoreless, no-hit innings Monday in a 6-0 victory over the Reds. Although he’s 36, Lester’s cutter is still excellent, and he traditionally fares well against the Pirates. In five starts last season, Lester went 3-0 with a 3.16 ERA.</p>
