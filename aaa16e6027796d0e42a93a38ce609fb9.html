<h1>Increased use of public lands leads to property abuse</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A shift in recreation patterns is having an impact on public properties in Pennsylvania. State-owned game lands, forests and parks are experiencing increased visitation as people seek temporary escape from shelter-at-home guidelines, and parents and caregivers invent homeschool recess and gym class opportunities. Public places are beginning to show signs of wear.</p>
<p>Among Gov. Tom Wolf’s original orders to slow the spread of COVID-19 were permissions for some public lands to remain open without facilities where people may gather, and recommendations to seek outdoor recreation for its physical and mental health benefits. Fishing, hiking, running, nature watching and other activities were encouraged.</p>
<p>Pennsylvanians got the message. Increased use of public lands has been reported, but so has abuse.</p>
<p>Last week, game wardens across southwestern Pennsylvania issued citations or warnings for illegal ATV riding, removal of native plants and handling young wildlife on state game lands.</p>
<p>“I have encountered more people than normal searching for mushrooms, hiking and fishing,” said Andy Harvey, game warden for Fayette and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey and other game wardens also reported more dumping of garbage on game lands, which were purchased with hunting revenue to create public hunting grounds. Additional patrols have been scheduled to protect those properties.</p>
<p>The state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources reported last week that state forests are experiencing higher incidences of vandalism and illegal activity, including ATV riding on state forest roads, graffiti, dumping of trash and waste and removal and damage of gates.</p>
<p>“These illegal activities damage the environment and take away from the natural experience and natural beauty that all forest users have the right to enjoy,” stated the DCNR. “Rangers and forest district staff are still actively patrolling during the COVID-19 outbreak and will issue citations and prosecute those who are engaged in illegal activity on state forest lands.”</p>
<p>Information and tips from the public have resulted in successful prosecutions. DCNR advised that illegal activities in a state forest should be reported to the district office and recommended taking a photo of the damage or activity if it can be done without provoking or risking confrontation.</p>
<p><strong>More shooting ranges reopen</strong></p>
<p>As Pennsylvania slowly rolls out its plan to relax business and home seclusion orders in selected counties, the Game Commission announced that public shooting ranges on state game lands will reopen Friday throughout most of the state’s southwestern corner.</p>
<p>Public rifle, shotgun, pistol and archery ranges are to be open during regular hours of operation in Allegheny, Armstrong, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>Repairs were made to some game lands shooting ranges during the shutdown. Ranges in northcentral counties reopened May 8. Shooting range users must be in possession of a valid hunting-trapping license or shooting range permit. To compensate for the temporary range closings, the Game Commission extended the life of 2019-20 shooting-range permits through Aug. 31. Pennsylvania 2019-20 hunting licenses also will be honored for range use through Aug. 31, but hunting activities will require a 2020-21 license starting July 1.</p>
