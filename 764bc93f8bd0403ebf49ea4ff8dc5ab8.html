<h1>How a former Pirates reliever helped Dennis Quaid in ‘The Rookie’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jim Gott remembers sitting at home with his family when he got a call out of the blue from one of his former Pirates teammates, Bill Landrum. A Pittsburgh reliever from 1989-91, Landrum had moved into movies after baseball and needed help on his latest project.</p>
<p><span>In the early 2000s, Landrum had to groom the star of this particular film to look like a major league pitcher, and they had just three months before filming started in Texas.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“He tells me who the star is, and I’m like, ‘Oh my God. Unbelievable.’ ” Gott said. “Then they send me this script, and it’s this beautiful script. All of it was right in my wheelhouse.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Hollywood actor Gott would have to teach was Dennis Quaid, and the movie was “The Rookie,” about a 35-year-old high school science teacher who, after wowing scouts at a tryout, wound up pitching for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays from 1999-2000.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">So Gott, a Pirates reliever from 1987-89 and again in 1995, wound up “coaching” Quaid three days a week at his house for three months, making sure he looked, threw and acted like a major league pitcher.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The workouts focused a lot on throwing techniques, with the biggest goal to build up Quaid’s arm strength. According to Gott, Quaid was an eager learner and quick study, too.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“He was a good enough athlete to be able to understand what I was teaching,” Gott said. Quaid grew up a diehard Astros fan in Houston, Texas. He also told Golf Magazine last July that he was an 8 handicap (and 0.6 at one time).</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The workouts were held in Quaid’s front yard. They evolved from simply throwing to fielding grounders and fly balls. “All the little things that you need to still do as a pitcher that are not seen,” Gott said.</span></p>
<p>Gott’s final major league season was with the Pirates in 1995, although before that he pitched five years with the Dodgers. While working with Quaid, he called in a favor to a few of L.A. friends, arranging for his famous pupil to throw at Dodger Stadium to get the feel of pitching off of a big league mound.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">And with the ballpark empty in October and November of 2000 — the movie came out in March 2002 — Gott said Quaid threw there three or four times to get ready for filming.</span></p>
<p>Quaid seemed to enjoy the experience, Gott said. The 66-year-old — who was 48 when the movie came out — also more than held his own. But on a project where a couple of relievers collaborated to determine how the baseball looked, there was one particular scene they knew they needed to nail: the entrance from the bullpen.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I loved the significance that was placed on that,” Gott said. “The gate opening, running into the lights for his first appearance [at the Ballpark in Arlington]. … I told Dennis, ‘That’s the coolest thing for any big league reliever.’ They did a great job with the scene.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Worrying about baseball scenes in movies is a real job, whether it’s what Gott did before the shoot or making sure that things look as realistic as possible during it. But to this point, “The Rookie” has been Gott’s first and last assignment.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Gott, who beat Jim Palmer and the Baltimore Orioles for his first major league win (May 30, 1982) — the day Cal Ripken Jr., started his infamous streak — has actually been climbing the coaching ranks over the past decade.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">He’s currently the Phillies’ bullpen coach, a role he’s held since November 2017, and before that Gott spent eight years with the Angels as their minor league pitching coordinator.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Gott pitched parts of 14 years in the majors with the Blue Jays, Giants, Pirates and Dodgers, producing a 3.87 ERA over 554 career games. The right-hander finished second in the National League and tied for fifth in the majors with 34 saves for the Pirates in 1988.</span></p>
<p>One of Gott’s favorite parts of shooting involved the scenes with the high school team Quaid’s character, Jim Morris, coached — the team to which he promised to try out if they started winning — called the Reagan County Owls. (In the movie, the high school is Big Lake, which is a city inside of Reagan County.)</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Quaid was always extremely professional, but Gott said he saw another level of that when it came to working with those young actors and ballplayers. Gott attended that part of shooting to help conduct workouts.</span></p>
<p>“It was really fun seeing that,” Gott said. “They were all in awe of him because he was this huge star. He handled that beautifully. He was like a veteran ballplayer bringing them all in and loving ’em up. It was an ‘us thing’ instead of him being above everybody else. He was just a really good teammate.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The final interaction Gott had with anyone associated with the movie was a cast-only premier, to which Gott brought his wife, a few of his kids and father-in-law to see the finished product before everybody else, capping it off with an appearance at the after-party.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Then we got into our car and went back to our normal life,” Gott said with a laugh. “But it remains one of my favorite baseball movies, and it was such a neat experience for our family. Obviously we’ve all grown up with the game. But to get to do something like that, it was really a lot of fun.”</span></p>
