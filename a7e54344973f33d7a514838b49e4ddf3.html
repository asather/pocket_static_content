<h1>Rollier's Hardware in Mt. Lebanon reopens with limited days and hours</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After being closed for two weeks because of short staffing, Rollier’s Hardware in Mt. Lebanon reopened Saturday at 9 a.m. and will be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on subsequent Saturdays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>Floor manager Kirk Satterfield said Rollier’s is considered an essential business and therefore is permitted under the statewide COVID-19 emergency to remain open because it sells cleaning products, some groceries and supplies for plumbing, among other items that would be needed in emergencies.</p>

<p>“We cleaned everything,” he said in a telephone interview Saturday. “This place is gleaming this morning. We had a few people waiting outside in their car when we first opened, and for the first hour or two, it was pretty busy. People did a good job keeping apart. Some people waved to each other.”</p>
<p>He said masks of any kind are out of stock, but that employees wore masks and gloves and that most customers had made their own masks and were wearing them —&nbsp;“a lot of scarves, a couple bandanas or ski-type hats.”</p>
<p>The most common purchases were cleaning supplies, paper towels and toilet paper, and a few people bought mulch, Mr. Satterfield said.</p>
<p>The store had closed two weeks ago because many employees were concerned about the risk of falling ill with COVID-19. The store has some elderly part-timers who were not comfortable coming in, he said, and other part-timers who are in high school and whose parents forbade them from continuing to work.</p>
<p>“But then some people said they wanted to come back,” Mr. Satterfield said. “We got a clear idea how to proceed from the employees who wanted to come to work.”</p>
<p>Rollier’s, at 600 Washington Road, has 10 full-time staff members, he said.</p>
<p>“We are meeting all the guidelines for essential businesses,” Mr. Satterfield&nbsp;said. “We’re not encouraging people to shop, but to get in and get out. I’m pleased that people have been very good about social distancing.”</p>
