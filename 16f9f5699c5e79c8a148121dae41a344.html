<h1>ESPN pegs Pirates fan excitement at ... zero</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The day pitchers and catchers report to spring training is supposed to fill baseball fans with some amount of excitement. Even if your team stinks, it’s at least a signal that warm summer evenings at the ballpark aren’t far off despite the frosty conditions of mid-February.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28661348/one-thing-watch-all-30-teams-spring-training-begins#NL_Central" target="_blank">ESPN’s David Schoenfield</a> doesn’t sense that’s enough for Pirates fans this year. He gave the club and excitement score of zero in listing one thing to watch for each of MLB’s 30 teams Monday, writing:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>No fan base is more disillusioned with its ownership than Pirates fans. Attendance has plummeted by a million since 2015. I doubt it will increase in 2020.</em></p>
<p>Baltimore was the only other team across baseball to get tagged with a goose egg on the 0-5 scale. Even Detroit, Kansas City and Miami fared better despite losing more than 100 games in 2019.</p>
<p>Cincinnati led NL Central teams with an excitement score of 5 following some noteworthy offseason acquisitions. Milwaukee and St. Louis were scored a notch worse at 4, while the Chicago Cubs were given a 3 rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the Pirates are going to boost their score in the coming months,&nbsp;Schoenfield seems to think it will be the pitchers leading the way. He listed starters Trevor Williams and Mitch Keller as the guys to watch during the spring because they have shown ability to perform well in the past. He wrote:&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Well, we know who they are, but the question is how good are they? Williams won 14 games in 2018 with a 3.11 ERA, including an amazing run in which he had a 1.29 ERA over his final 13 starts. He couldn't replicate that success in 2019 (5.38 ERA). Keller was a hotshot prospect who got blitzed in his first MLB test, with a 7.13 ERA and 72 hits allowed in 48 innings over 11 starts.</em></p>
