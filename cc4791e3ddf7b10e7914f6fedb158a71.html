<h1>MADD, legislators link drunken driving restrictions to massive infrastructure bill</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The push for a new transportation funding bill may be the key for passage of legislation that requires vehicle manufacturers to install systems to keep drunken drivers off the nation’s highways.</p>
<p>Key congressional leaders and Mothers Against Drunk Driving announced Thursday that a bill to battle drunk driving introduced last year by Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., has been incorporated into the massive Moving Forward Act. That act, announced Tuesday, would authorize $1.5 trillion to rebuild the nation’s infrastructure, including $500 billion to replenish federal transportation spending that expires in September.</p>
<p>Ms. Dingell’s provision would require the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration to review technology and develop standards for vehicle manufacturers to install passive systems to prevent drivers from operating a vehicle when they are drunk. That could include items that detect alcohol from normal breathing; obtain blood alcohol content from something the driver touches like an ignition button; or monitor the driver’s behavior behind the wheel similar to systems that determine if someone is too drowsy to drive.</p>
<p>“The technology clearly is out there to do this,” J.T. Griffin, MADD’s chief government affairs officer, said in an interview. “It’s just a matter of deciding which direction to go and writing the regulations. There’s certainly enough time to get everything right.”</p>
<p>If the Moving Forward Act is approved, it would set deadlines for safety administration officials to set in motion the protocol for introducing new vehicle technology requirements. In about 18 months, the agency would publish an advance notice of rulemaking, which would lead to a series of public hearings about the technology .</p>
<p>Final rules would be published in 2025 that would require manufacturers to have the equipment in place in the 2027-28 model year.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin said it is “an opportune time” to consider the drunken driving provision and praised Ms. Dingell and others for what he called “a brilliant move” to include it in the Moving Forward Act.</p>
<p>Ms. Dingell introduced her bill in September in response to a horrific crash in Kentucky that killed a Dearborn, Mich., couple and their three children in January 2019. A man who had a blood-alcohol level of 0.306% — nearly four times the legal limit of 0.08% — drove his pickup truck the wrong way on Interstate 75 and crashed head-on into the family’s SUV.</p>
<p>“It’s time to … do everything we can to make sure this doesn’t happen again,” Ms. Dingell said. “The technology to save lives exists today. These are the kinds of things that can go in all automobiles. These are preventable deaths.”</p>
<p>MADD President Helen Witty said the organization has been pushing for more than 12 years for vehicles to include technology that would prevent motorists from driving when they are drunk. Regulators in the European Union already have requirements set through the New Car Assessment Program for all vehicles to have equipment to prevent drowsy drivers by 2022 and drunken drivers by 2025.</p>
<p>The proposal under the Moving Forward Act “sets realistic dates” for manufacturers to meet, Ms. Witty said. About 7,000 people died in accidents last year involving alcohol-impaired drivers, she said.</p>
<p>“Twelve years later, we know it’s possible to develop a system to stop this,” she said. “Safety must not be optional.”</p>
<p>Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. and chair of the House Consumer Protection and Commerce Subcommittee, said drunken driving deaths have reached “really intolerable levels.”</p>
<p>“We have a bold response,” she said. “No more victims. We want to make sure every car, regardless of price, has [passive drunken driving controls] available.</p>
<p>“We’re really serious about moving this legislation.”</p>
<p>Supporters are optimistic about the issue because it also has strong support in the Senate, where Sens. Tom Udall, D-New Mexico, and Rick Scott, R-Fla., have introduced similar legislation to Ms. Dingell’s bill.</p>
<p>“Requiring drunk driving systems is no different than requiring air bags,” said Mr. Udall, who has worked to restrict drunken driving since his days as New Mexico’s attorney general in the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Mr. Griffin said he believes all the pieces are in place for the drunken driving restrictions to move forward.</p>
<p>“We’re pretty excited about where we’re at right now,” he said. “I think we have pretty good congressional support.</p>
<p>“The goal is to save as many lives as we can. This is the appropriate time to move this through.”</p>
