<h1>Civil Saturdays march at Bakery Square celebrates Black lives in final protest of 16-week run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Between 200 and 300 people gathered Saturday afternoon at Bakery Square for what was described by organizers as the 16th and last Civil Saturdays protest. Speakers did not say why it was the last.</p>
<p>The crowd was peaceful and mostly young, many in colorful clothes, some all in black, carrying signs including “Black Lives Matter,” “Black Trans Lives Matter,” “Defund the Police” and “End White Silence.”</p>
<p>Penn Avenue was closed for several blocks, with police discreetly at far perimeters. Two rows of civilian bicyclists formed cordons across the street. One cyclist described them as defenders of the protesters.</p>
<p>The crowd was festive and peaceful. They formed a circle around a hub of speakers and dancers who represented Black Lives Matter and Black, Young and Educated, spoke and led chants. A small band assembled to accompany the chants on drums, tambourines and trumpet.</p>
<p>One speaker led a call and response, asking, “Black Lives Matter where?” and eliciting “Black Lives Matter here” from the crowd. The call and response was followed with “No justice, no peace.”</p>
<p>Everyone appeared to be masked, and when one man rolled by on a bicycle, a young man dressed in black asked him to put a mask on.</p>
<p>“This is the last Civil Saturday but not the end of the movement,” one woman said into a microphone. “Keep on calling people, keep on doing what you have to do.”</p>
<p>Many people wore orange, an homage to Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old girl who was shot and killed in Chicago a week after marching with her high school band in President Barack Obama’s 2013 inauguration. The speaker said orange was Hadiya’s favorite color.</p>
<p>She described the Wear Orange Movement as a tribute to victims and survivors of gun violence in general.</p>
<p>“The fighting never stops,” she said. “We’re still fighting to bring Breonna’s killer to justice.” That reference was to Breonna Taylor, a Black 26-year-old emergency medical technician who was killed by police in Louisville, Ky., in March while in her bed.</p>
<p>“Make sure you contact the people who are in power. You may not think one email or letter counts, but it all counts.”</p>
<p>After an hour, the group that included children and dogs on leashes moved west on Penn Avenue, where it stopped at the intersection of Highland Avenue for another demonstration of chants and calls for justice.</p>
