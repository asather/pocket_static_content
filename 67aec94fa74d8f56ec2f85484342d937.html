<h1>A top U.K. scientist quits government panel over coronavirus distancing violation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose frightening projections of coronavirus deaths precipitated the lockdown in Britain, resigned from the government’s scientific advisory group on Tuesday, after admitting he breached social distancing rules by illicitly meeting his lover.</p>
<p>Ferguson, whose research also influenced thinking <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/16/us/coronavirus-fatality-rate-white-house.html" rel="nofollow">in the White House</a>, said in a statement to the Daily Telegraph, which first reported the story, “I accept I made an error of judgment and took the wrong course of action.”</p>
<p>“I deeply regret any undermining of the clear messages around the continued need for social distancing,” said Ferguson, who has become a household name in Britain over the last two months, preaching the virtues of staying apart.</p>

<p>Leading a respected team of scientists at Imperial College London, Ferguson has long been an influential voice on infectious diseases. But he achieved a new level of notoriety in mid-March, with a report warning that without steps to control it, the virus could kill 250,000 to 510,000 Britons.</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/world/europe/coronavirus-imperial-college-johnson.html" rel="nofollow">prompted Prime Minister Boris Johnson</a> to impose a lockdown, putting Britain in line with other European countries.</p>
<p>During this period of confinement, the Telegraph reported that Ferguson, 51, allowed a woman with whom he had a relationship to visit him at home. He had just come out of his own self-isolation after suffering from COVID-19.</p>
<p>In his statement to the Telegraph, he said, “I acted in the belief that I was immune, having tested positive for coronavirus and completely isolated myself for almost two weeks after developing symptoms.”</p>
<p>Ferguson sat on the government’s secretive Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies, or SAGE. His membership was only formally confirmed on Monday, when the government published the names of 50 of the 52 members.</p>
<p>Approaching 30,000 coronavirus deaths, Britain has been one of the hardest-hit countries, and the government’s handling of the crisis has come under <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/04/world/europe/coronavirus-britain-boris-johnson.html" rel="nofollow">harsh scrutiny</a>.</p>
