<h1>'Heartbroken' and 'devastated': What WPIAL athletes are saying about sports cancellations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like many of his peers, Dante Spadafora saw the writing on the wall.</p>
<p>As the COVID-19 pandemic intensified, high schools remained shut down and the PIAA postponed deciding whether or not sports would resume this school year, making it more and more unlikely Spadafora and his Our Lady of the Sacred Heart team would get to continue their march toward a state basketball title.</p>
<p>Still, there was some hope. That was until Thursday.</p>
<p>A few hours after Gov. Tom Wolf announced that Pennsylvania schools would remain closed through the end of the school year, the PIAA announced that high school winter and spring sports would be canceled. That means there won’t be a continuation of the state basketball or swimming championships and there won’t be a spring sports season.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s heartbreaking,” said Spadafora, a junior point guard for the WPIAL Class 2A champion Chargers. “We were ranked No. 1 in the state going into the state playoffs. I don’t think I’ve ever been on a team with team chemistry this good. We were one family this year. Everything felt right and was coming together. It’s crazy to see how easily things can be taken away from you.”</p>
<p>The PIAA basketball playoffs were halted March 12, and at that time were postponed for two weeks. The quarterfinal round was set to begin and a total of 19 boys and girls teams from the WPIAL were still in contention for championships.</p>
<p>“Devastated” and&nbsp;“heartbroken” were words used often by players on teams that were just a few wins away from competing for state titles.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously really devastating and I’m heartbroken not to be able to finish out the year,” said North Allegheny junior Lizzy Groetsch, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/29/Post-Gazette-Fabulous-5-2020-Lizzy-Groetsch-Megan-McConnell-Aislin-Malcolm-Tess-Myers-Mackenzie-Amalia/stories/202003290021" target="_blank">girls basketball player of the year.</a> “But at the same time, it’s understandable and I’m thankful for everything we did get to experience. I had so much fun with these girls. I’m bummed we didn’t finish it out but feel lucky we got to do what we did.”</p>
<p>Megan McConnell was the only senior starter on a Chartiers Valley team that was trying to become the first girls team to win back-to-back PIAA titles with perfect records.</p>
<p>“It really hurts for seniors,” she said, “but I have to just remember all of the things I accomplished in my career. Not many people can say they were part of a basketball team that broke a WPIAL record with 57 wins in a row and won two WPIAL titles undefeated. Even though it ended, we have to remember the good things that we did.”</p>
<p>Athletes who play spring sports now see their seasons end before they ever started. That’s especially tough for seniors such as Serra Catholic baseball star Mark Black, who was hoping to lead his team back to the WPIAL and PIAA championship games.</p>
<p>“It obviously sucks,” said Black, last year’s Post-Gazette player of the year. “I had been looking forward to this season since the end of last season. We came up short in the state championship and were really excited to get back. We’re obviously not getting that chance anymore.”</p>
<p>Bethel Park junior Emily Carter is one of the top track and field athletes in the WPIAL. Last spring, she became the first Bethel Park girl in 38 years to win a PIAA title when she set a meet record in the 3,200-meter run.</p>
<p>“I’m definitely devastated that I won’t be able to better my meet record in the 3,200, but I kind of saw it coming after they postponed everything until the end of April,” Carter said. “I figured that would knock out most of the invitationals and I didn’t think they’d be able to get everything in.”</p>
<p>As tough as Thursday’s news was to digest, the decision made sense to players considering the health risks and the spread of the coronavirus around the state. There have been 16,239 confirmed cases and 310 deaths in Pennsylvania as of Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>“There was always a little bit of hope. I wanted to trick myself into thinking there was a chance,” Mt. Lebanon senior basketball player Jake Hoffman said. “But things were getting really serious, and they’re not going to risk the health of people so we can play in a basketball tournament.”</p>
<p>Spadafora added: “Once I saw there were a lot of cases and deaths in Pa., I figured they’d have to cancel us. They canceled big-time sports, so why wouldn’t they cancel us?”</p>
<p>One issue some athletes are dealing with, particularly juniors, is that the cancellation of high school sports means they won’t be seen by colleges this spring, throwing a curveball into their recruitment. And for Black, it means he won’t be seen by major league scouts. Some believe Black could be taken in this year’s MLB draft.</p>
<p>“Obviously, not playing in front of [scouts] with my teammates is going to hurt. They like to check up on guys and see how they’re developing,” Black said. “But they’ve seen me at a lot of events and I’m sure there will be some kind of scouting event I’ll find a way to attend.”</p>
<p>While seniors have seen their high school careers prematurely come to an end, many underclassmen said this will make them even hungrier next year.</p>
<p>“For me personally, it’s going to fuel me in the offseason,” Groetsch said, “and when we come back next year, we’ll be ready.”</p>
