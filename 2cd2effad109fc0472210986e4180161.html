<h1>Gov. Wolf urges Pa. Legislature to begin work on his election reform package</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf is urging the Republican-controlled state Legislature to take up a package of election reform proposals his office says will give county elections offices “the time they need to quickly count the anticipated historic numbers of votes cast” in November’s general election.</p>
<p>But Republican leaders in the Legislature say they want to pass their own proposal — which contain a few similarities to the governor’s wish list, but also some crucial differences that Democrats have spoken out against in the past.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, in a public statement this past week, said he wants the legislature to allow counties to start the tedious process of pre-canvassing mail-in and absentee ballots 21 days before Nov. 3 — a desire that numerous counties have expressed, given the amount of time it takes to match signatures, open envelopes and remove and scan the ballots. Counties are currently permitted to start this process at 7 a.m. on Election Day.</p>
<p>In the state Senate, the Republican caucus introduced a bill last week — designed to&nbsp;“safeguard that every voter has the opportunity to vote, has confidence in the system and receives results in a timely manner,” leaders said — that would give counties three days before the election to pre-canvass ballots. As with the governor’s proposal, counties wouldn’t be allowed to officially tabulate the ballots until 8 p.m. on Election Day under the GOP’s plan.</p>
<p>Both proposals — the governor’s and the Republicans’ — seek to require that counties start sending mail-in ballots to voters at least 28 days before the election instead of 14, which would give those who applied for a ballot early the extra time to submit.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf wants to permit counties to tabulate ballots that were postmarked by Election Day, but received by the Friday following the election — an extension similar to the one he gave to six counties during the primary. This proposal is not part of the GOP’s plan.</p>

<p>While the governor asks the legislature to give counties the permission to fill poll worker vacancies earlier than five days before Nov. 3, the GOP wants to make it so poll workers can serve in any voting location in their county of residence, instead of just in their home election district.</p>
<p>The Republicans also want poll watchers to be permitted to serve statewide rather than in their own counties, and&nbsp;“secure return locations” for ballots to be set up at county courthouses, election board offices and polling places.</p>
<p>“Our proposal to increase election access, accountability and security goes further than the Governor’s plan,” Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati and Majority Leader Jake Corman said in a joint statement. “We look forward to working with him to fulfill the legislative responsibility to ensure fair elections and trust in the election process.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said his reforms will&nbsp;“further strengthen our elections, help people to vote safely from home, and assist counties in processing the surge in mail-in ballots.”</p>
<p>Suzanne Almeida, interim executive director of the accessible voting advocacy group Common Cause Pennsylvania, praised the governor for his pitch to the legislature, but said “we need action to protect our election in November.”</p>
<p>The Legislature, governor, advocates and counties must work together, she said.</p>
<p>“Given all that is at stake in this election —&nbsp;from a contentious presidential election to the need to protect the health and safety of Pennsylvanians as they cast their votes — it’s more imperative than ever that voters have every option available to them to vote in a safe, secure and accessible manner,” Ms. Almeida said in a statement.</p>
