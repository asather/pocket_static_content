<h1>Penguins on pause: Justin Schultz's contract year derailed by injuries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, hockey players celebrate goals. Other times, they breathe a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Justin Schultz fell into that second category on March 10, when he beat Devils goalie MacKenzie Blackwood for his first goal since Nov. 12.</p>
<p>That fourth-month drought between the two goals largely defined Schultz’s 2019-20 season. During that span, Schultz spent two separate stints on injured reserve and endured a 21-game drought without a point and a 27-game dry spell without a goal.</p>
<p>When he’s healthy and on top of his game, Schultz is an offensively gifted blue liner with skill, smarts and the ability to run the top power play. As recently as three years ago, he racked up 51 points during the 2017 season and filled in flawlessly for Kris Letang during a second straight Stanley Cup run. The problem for Schultz this season was he was rarely healthy and on top of his game. In total, Schultz tallied just three goals and nine assists in 46 games to go along-with a minus-13 rating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tough-luck season couldn’t have come at a much worse time.</p>
<p>There were already questions about Schultz’s long-term future in Pittsburgh when the season began. The 29-year-old defenseman was playing out the final year of a three-year deal, with unrestricted free agency looming at season’s end. Some salary cap gymnastics might have been necessary to keep the blue liner in Pittsburgh long term on a team that’s always challenged to keep all its talent on the payroll.</p>
<p>As the season unfolded, a number of factors cast more doubt that Schultz will be a Penguin beyond this season. Schultz’s recent injury history is at the top of the list. After a broken ankle derailed Schultz’s 2018-19 season, he once again fell on hard injury luck, missing 23 of the Penguins’ 69 games.</p>
<p>Beyond that, rookie defenseman John Marino emerged, almost out of nowhere, to become a top-four caliber defenseman. With Letang on the top pairing and Marino in the second, Schultz got bumped to the third pairing as the team’s third-best righty.</p>
<p>The other factors are financial. The Penguins already made a considerable investment on their blue line when they inked Marcus Pettersson to an extension that will carry an average annual value of $4,025,175 through the 2024-25 season. Adding Jason Zucker in the trade market will eat up another $5.5 million per year from the cap through the 2022-23 season. And the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic could add another wrinkle when it comes to the cap.</p>
<p>Add it all up and it’s not unreasonable to wonder if that slump-snapping goal Schultz scored in New Jersey might be one of his last in a Penguins uniform.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong>&nbsp;Schultz’s injury issues began to flare up on Nov. 21, when coach Mike Sullivan said the defenseman would be out “longer term” with a lower-body injury. Sullivan said at the time that it was difficult to pinpoint when the injury occurred, suggesting it was something that had been nagging Schultz even before he was sidelined.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Injuries have forced Schultz to miss considerable time over the last two seasons. After missing 53 games last year, Schultz missed another 23 this season. He’s played just about 50 percent of the 151 games over the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Schultz had been playing on the third pairing next to Jack Johnson. With the defensemen now all healthy, odds are Schultz would remain in this spot. Recently, the Penguins have been using Schultz on the top power play unit in place of Letang. It remains to be seen if that will continue.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong>&nbsp;There are three options when Schultz becomes an unrestricted free agent this offseason. The Penguins could decide this year is an anomaly and find a way to fit him into their long-term future. Schultz could bet on himself with a one-year deal with the hope of driving up his value. Or, after winning the Cup two times in Pittsburgh, maybe Schultz find a new long-term home elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>
