<h1>Ex-WVU professor gets prison for defrauding school while working in China</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former West Virginia University professor will go to prison for defrauding the school, a judge ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>James Patrick Lewis of Fairview, W.Va., was sentenced to three months.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Thomas Kleeh, presiding in Clarksburg, also fined Lewis $9,363 for the cost of his incarceration and ordered him to pay $20,189 in restitution to WVU. The money has already been repaid.</p>
<p>Lewis, 54, formerly a tenured professor of physics who specialized in reactions in coal conversion technology, had pleaded guilty to lying to the school about taking leave to care for his newborn when in fact he was working as a professor in China.</p>
<p>According to the FBI and the IRS, Lewis entered into an employment contract with the People's Republic of China through its “Global Experts 1000 Talents Plan,” a program designed to lure foreign scientists to work for the good of China — and reward them for stealing proprietary information.</p>
<p>Lewis fooled WVU, which is publicly funded, into giving him parental leave so that he could work in China and hid what he was doing from his school, according to the Justice Department.</p>
<p>At the time of his plea, the head of the FBI in Pittsburgh, which covers all of West Virginia, said the Chinese government targets advanced technologies and technical know-how developed in the U.S. to give itself a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>Participation in the China talent program is not illegal, but the FBI has discovered that participants are often enticed to transfer proprietary information done in the U.S. to China.</p>
<p>Under Lewis’s contract, the Chinese Academy of Sciences agreed to employ him as a professor for three years. He agreed to maintain an active research program and produce publications in science journals as well as provide training for Chinese Academy students.</p>
<p>He was promised a living subsidy of $143,000, a research subsidy of $573,000 and a salary of $86,000. To get all that money, he had to work full time in China for three years for no less than nine months per year. He was to have started work no later than Aug. 8, 2018, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>In March of that year, investigators said, he submitted a request to WVU to be released from his teaching duties for the fall of 2018 so he could be the primary caregiver for a child he and his wife were expecting in June 2018.</p>
<p>But it was a lie. Instead of caring for the infant, Lewis planned to work in China while still being paid by WVU.</p>
<p>The school granted his request and Lewis spent most of the semester in China. The child stayed home in the U.S. with his wife.</p>
<p>During that time, WVU paid him $20,189 under his purported parental work assignment.</p>
<p>Lewis resigned from WVU last year. He has 30 days to report to prison.</p>
