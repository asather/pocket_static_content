<p>Point Park University President Paul Hennigan is retiring at the end of this academic year.</p>
<p>The president notified the board of trustees of his decision to step down this summer, and it was shared with students and employees in a 10 a.m. message Monday. He will have served 16 years and will do consulting work for the university, officials said.</p>
<p>“I am honored to have worked with so many talented people affiliated with Point Park over the past 20 years. Together, we have built so much that has influenced the lives of so many. The summer of 2021 will be a perfect time for new leadership at Point Park,” Mr. Hennigan, 59, said in a statement released by the university Monday.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, the world will be out of the worst of the pandemic, and it will be good for a new leader with new ideas and new energy to work with the University community to develop the next vision and strategic plan for Point Park University,” he added.&nbsp;“It should be an exciting opportunity for the University to help define a new era for higher education.”</p>
<p>The board’s executive committee has chosen WittKieffer as a consultant for the new president search.</p>
<p>Board chair Joe Greco expressed “deep gratitude” for his years of service.&nbsp;Mr. Hennigan will serve as a consultant on “a number of strategic initiatives, including the presidential transition, community relations, alumni engagement and fundraising,” the university’s statement said.</p>
<p>Officials cited completion of the new Pittsburgh Playhouse and the Center for Media Innovation, and the development of a university-wide undergraduate cooperative education program among the president’s accomplishments. However, like other schools, the 4,000-student university Downtown has dealt with financial, enrollment and academic uncertainty due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“As a 1971 graduate of Point Park, I have watched the school manage through several difficult circumstances, and emerge better and stronger,” Mr. Greco said. “I am confident that we will work together to stay focused on student learning and manage our way through this present set of challenges.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hennigan came to Point Park&nbsp;in 2000 as vice president of finance and operations. The university named him acting president in January 2006 and appointed him president in September that year.</p>
<p>Prior to his tenure at Point Park, he worked for several years as chief financial officer for former Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy’s administration.</p>
