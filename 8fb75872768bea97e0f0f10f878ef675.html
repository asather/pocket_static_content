<h1>How Josh Bell found his voice and started to use his platform</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Josh Bell sprinted up and down the stairs of his 10-story apartment complex in the Strip District, weights strapped to his ankles and a heavy vest around his upper-body. At other times, Bell did kettle bell workouts — whatever he could to stay in shape.</p>
<p>The Pirates first baseman with the powerful swing has also continued to work on his throwing and fielding with the hope of proving to critics that he’s more than a designated hitter waiting to happen.</p>
<p>However, all of that pales in comparison to Bell’s most important work during what was essentially a second offseason.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old is, for all intents and purposes, the face of the franchise, and over these past few months, Bell has taken some important steps in delivering a message that the country needs to hear right now, that of improving race relations and eradicating social injustice.</p>
<p>Speaking out has come relatively natural, Bell said, the result of how the bigger-picture conversation has changed; thankfully, it’s not the way it was when Colin Kaepernick first started advocating to end systemic racism and policy brutality involving Black Americans.</p>
<p>“First and foremost, I grew up as a Black kid in America and secondly as a baseball player,” Bell said. “I can talk on the Black experience. I can talk about the baseball side. I feel like social justice is something that a lot of people are learning right now.</p>
<p>“For the most part, I’m trying to stay as politically correct as I can. I’m not trying to bring emotions into anything. I’m not trying to be the guy who has the headline for something negative. I’m doing my best to try to learn.”</p>
<p>Bell spent a Zoom call Saturday following Day 2 of Pirates summer camp at PNC Park talking about a variety of things, including his workouts and on-field improvements, but it was the social justice talk that stood out, especially Bell handled himself so well during it.</p>
<p>The 2019 All-Star began to realize that magnitude of his platform in late May and early June, when he watched peaceful protests devolve into riots and Bell’s girlfriend challenged him to channel his anger into something more meaningful.</p>
<p>That led to Bell, along with Chris Archer and other major leaguers, leading the #SocialJusticeSunday movement on Twitter. Bell has also been working with the Pirates about getting out more in the community, targeting schools and other youth academies who might benefit from Bell’s involvement.</p>
<p>Whether it’s RBI Academy locally or a book club he’s starting, Bell said the Pirates’ support has been huge toward him finding his voice.</p>
<p>“That has allowed an opportunity for the pain that I felt watching that [George Floyd] video, that feeling where I felt like a lot of voices weren’t being heard … the Pirates came to me and said, ‘You want to go out in the community and help? We’re right behind you.’ That has made me feel a lot better.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a smile on my face coming to the field every day, knowing when the time is right I can get back into the community and do what I can to promote good in this world. I’m excited about that.”</p>
<p>The book club is an especially interesting one. Bell said it’s not all about social reform but more about reading together “so everybody can be on the same page in regards to not only understanding what social justice looks like, but understanding what being a good human being looks like.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Among the books Bell has recommended: “The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness,” by Michelle Alexander; “The Optimist Creed,” by Christian D. Larson; and “The Alchemist,” by Paulo Coelho.</span></p>
<p>“It’s not one side against the other or being right or wrong,” Bell said.&nbsp;“We’re all in this thing together. We’re all here. It’s July 4. We’re all celebrating. This is the best nation in the world, and we have an opportunity to be even better. That’s exciting.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Baseball talk</span></strong></p>
<p>Bell said his revamped throwing motion has continued to improve. He has also dropped his arm slot even lower, from around three-quarters to sidearm or even a little below that.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“My catch and funnel and release for the throw is a lot quicker, a lot more repeatable,” Bell said.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Throwing issues plagued Bell last season. So did other aspects of playing first base, although it wasn’t due to lack of effort. Bell continues to chip away at the position and said not yet OK with shelving the idea of playing the field.</span></p>
<p>“I’m working my tail off every day,” Bell said. “I have gotten some feedback from teammates, and I've got some feedback from coaches saying that I’m on the right path.</p>
<p>“So as of right now, I view myself as a first baseman every day. I'm going to try and keep it like that. I'm going to do my best to work my tail off over there and make sure [Pirates manager Derek] Shelton has confidence to put me in the lineup there every day.”</p>
<p><strong>Staying healthy</strong></p>
<p>Bell said he hasn’t read MLB’s 100-plus-page Operating Manual but has placed several phone calls to his agency to learn more about best practices to stay healthy.</p>
<p>He also believes that might be the key to contending this season — how many players can avoid contracting the coronavirus and which teams are able to keep their talent on the field.</p>
<p>“If we can stay healthy, we have a real, real shot at this thing,” Bell said. “I’m definitely excited to fight for that opportunity every day.”</p>
