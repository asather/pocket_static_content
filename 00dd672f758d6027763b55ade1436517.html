<h1>Republicans likely have the votes to end Trump impeachment trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — With Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., announcing his opposition late Thursday, the Senate is likely to have the votes to block witnesses in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>All 100 senators will gather in the gilded chamber to vote whether to effectively end the impeachment trial or expand its scope in a potentially dramatic way. If the Senate rejects efforts, led by Democrats, to hear any more information, it could move to acquit Mr. Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Alexander, seen as the swing vote, said in a statement he believed Mr. Trump committed the acts House Democrats alleged. But he said he did not believe the president’s actions were impeachable.</p>
<p>“It was inappropriate for the president to ask a foreign leader to investigate his political opponent and to withhold United States aid to encourage that investigation,” Mr. Alexander wrote shortly after senators’ questioning wrapped up.&nbsp;“There is no need for more evidence to prove something that has already been proven.”</p>
<p>However,&nbsp;“the Constitution does not give the Senate the power to remove the president from office and ban him from this year’s ballot simply for actions that are inappropriate,” he stated.</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled Senate had been playing a political tug of war with four members in particular: Mr. Alexander, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Collins announced Thursday she would vote to call witnesses. Mr Romney is also likely in favor of witnesses.</p>

<p>Even if Ms. Murkowski would vote for witnesses, too, that would result in a 50-50 tie, assuming all 45 Democrats — and the two Independents who often join Democrats — vote in favor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chief Justice John Roberts could intervene to break the tie, but it is unclear whether he would do so.</p>
<p>Ms. Murkowski, however, seemed skeptical in a late-hour question posed Thursday to White House lawyers. She, along with Mr. Alexander,&nbsp;joined a question that asked, even if Mr. Bolton were to testify, “isn’t it true that the allegations [against Mr. Trump] would not rise to an impeachable offense” and that Mr. Bolton’s testimony “would add nothing?”</p>
<p>If senators vote to block witnesses, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., told reporters on Thursday he had tactics up his sleeve to delay a speedy acquittal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The minority has rights, and we will exercise those rights,” Mr. Schumer told reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senate will convene at 1 p.m. today.</p>
