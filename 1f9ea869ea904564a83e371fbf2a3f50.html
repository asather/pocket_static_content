<p>A Wilkinsburg man will be immediately paroled after being sentenced Thursday for involuntary manslaughter.</p>
<p>Alonzo Glenn, 28, admitted to killing Marion White, 49, of Wilkinsburg after White threatened him with a sword. Police said the two men were in a home in the 1500 block of Laketon Road on June 11 when there was a confrontation between the two, and White retrieved a sword from upstairs.</p>
<p>Glenn fled to the dining room at first, a witness told police, then went to the stairs and shot White, who had gunshot wounds to the head and chest.</p>
<p>Glenn pleaded guilty before Common Pleas Judge Susan Evashavik DiLucente in February.</p>
<p>On Thursday, she ordered him to serve 11Â½ to 23 months in jail but be paroled immediately. He will also serve four years probation.</p>
