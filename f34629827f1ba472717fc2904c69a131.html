<h1>'It takes away more vibrancy' — Three restaurants close in or near Market Square </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The new year has signaled the end — not a fresh start — for three restaurants in or near Market Square, raising some worries about the future of the popular Downtown dining area.</p>
<p>Molinaro Ristorante and Bar, Wolfies Pub and the former Pizzuvio have closed their doors. Molinaro and Wolfies shut down last weekend and Pizzuvio, which was being used as a pop-up concept, closed at the start of the month.</p>
<p>All three occupied prominent spots in or near Market Square. Molinaro, which opened in July 2018, anchored a corner spot at 2 PPG Place in the heart of the square. Wolfies Pub, which opened last March, and Pizzuvio fronted Forbes Avenue in Tower Two-Sixty just off the square.</p>
<p>“We gave it a try. It just didn’t work out. At the end of the day, we didn’t have enough traffic to keep it going,” said Shane Wilps, beverage manager for the three restaurants.</p>
<p>The abrupt closings sparked concern over what that signals for Market Square, a top Downtown destination that city officials have worked for years to improve and cultivate. Just how significant the closings are is a matter of debate.</p>
<p>The restaurants were owned by Ron Molinaro and partner Bob Wolfinger, neither of whom could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Employees at Molinaro did not find out until Friday that the restaurant would be shutting down after business the next day, said general manager Sean Fitzpatrick, who called the closing “very unfortunate.”</p>
<p>Molinaro closed for “strictly financial reasons,” Mr. Fitzpatrick said.</p>
<p>The restaurant, he said, opened as a high-end concept that did not work out. Customers “were intimidated by the pricing at first.”</p>
<p>Last June, the restaurant changed course, opting for a moderate price point and a more casual atmosphere, Mr. Fitzpatrick said. That proved to be more of a hit with diners.</p>
<p>Business was increasing. But the gains were not enough to offset earlier losses, he explained.</p>
<p>“We really came a long way. It’s unfortunate. Six months earlier [with the new concept], I think we would have made it,” he said.&nbsp;“Financially, it seemed like we were in it too deep to try to dig out of the hole.”</p>
<p>Mr. Molinaro, the founder of II Pizzaiolo restaurant in Mt. Lebanon, created Molinaro after taking over the former Poros restaurant in the same space from Yves Carreau’s Big Y Group. At one time, he also was a partner in the former II Pizzaiolo restaurant in Market Square, which has changed concepts. He no longer is involved.</p>
<p>Andy Wisniewski, vice president in Pittsburgh for Highwoods Properties, the owner of Molinaro’s 2 PPG Place space, could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Wolfies Pub occupied the former Pirata rum bar space, also operated by Mr. Molinaro and Mr. Wolfinger, in Tower Two-Sixty. Pirata had closed at the end of 2018, opening the door for the new concept.</p>
<p>Pizzuvio, Mr. Wilps said, always was meant to be a pop-up seasonal space.</p>
<p>Given that January and February are traditionally slow months in the restaurant industry, the two partners “decided to take a break and evaluate what’s next” for both of the spaces, he noted.</p>
<p>“Certainly, in some regard, we’re exploring options. Nothing is set in stone yet,” Mr. Wilps said, adding that they want to see how the landscape in Market Square changes in the months ahead.</p>
<p><strong>How important are the losses?</strong></p>
<p>Herky Pollock, a CBRE executive vice president who is the broker for the space, said owner Millcraft Investments “is still working with the existing tenant on their future plans.” The group still holds the lease to the spaces and could re-occupy both.</p>
<p>“This restaurant group owns multiple concepts. There’s a real potential they may rebrand and reopen under different names and concepts,” he said.</p>
<p>But even if they leave entirely, he expects takers for the space.</p>
<p>“In the event they don’t continue to operate under a different concept, we have several new and creative users who have expressed interest in locating in these spaces,” he said, noting that the Downtown site has advantages.</p>
<p>“We strongly feel with the new sidewalk enhancements, which allow for substantial outdoor dining, and the growth in and around Market Square that these spaces are prime for repositioning.”</p>
<p>The closings leave the area in and near Market Square down more restaurants after a fire shut down Winghart’s in November.</p>
<p>One worried about the closures is John Valentine, executive director of the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corp. “I’m concerned for Market Square. It takes away more vibrancy,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Valentine said replacing the Diamond Market Bar and Grill with a Bank of America branch in 2018 has had a detrimental impact on the square.</p>
<p>“One of the things that transformed Market Square into a dining attraction was the outdoor dining. The more outdoor dining we lose, Market Square definitely loses some of its luster,” he said.</p>
<p>While Mr. Valentine believes Molinaro will be replaced with another restaurant, “The bigger concern is that another bank comes in and eliminates outdoor seating. If you get more situations like that, Market Square will definitely see a downward trend,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pollock, on the other hand, does not view a few restaurant closings as having a negative impact on the square as a whole.</p>
<p>“Certainly there is no shortage of vital and successful restaurant concepts in and around Market Square. It is without question the most vibrant that it’s ever been in my career,” he said.</p>
<p>“Even the best shopping centers and trade areas experience store closures and it does not in any way diminish the success of either and, further, it creates opportunities for new and better concepts to enter the marketplace.”</p>
<p>One 2,000-square-foot bank, he suggested, “does not diminish the overall appeal of Market Square. In fact, there are many tenants, both local and national, clamoring to get into Market Square and this presents an ideal opportunity for them.”</p>
