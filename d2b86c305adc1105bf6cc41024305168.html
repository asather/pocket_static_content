<h1>Pitt setting its sights on 'a ring that matters' as spring camp opens</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rashad Weaver received a ring two years ago. So did Damar Hamlin, Paris Ford, Jaylen Twyman, Patrick Jones II and the rest of the Panthers. One side bore the player’s name, while the face featured three words surrounding a script Pitt: “ACC Coastal Champions.”</p>
<p>The piece of jewelry commemorated Pitt’s first ACC division title, an accomplishment worthy of a bit of bling. But as spring practice opened Monday, Weaver expressed why he thinks Hamlin, Ford, Twyman and Jones skipped the NFL and returned to Pitt. You know, aside from boosting their draft stock.</p>
<p>“Those guys want to go out on a right note with a real ring — a ring that matters,” Weaver said. “An important one, whether that’s in the ACC championship or after that. That’s really where those guys’ heads are at.”</p>
<p>Hamlin and Ford confirmed that themselves. Feet away from Weaver’s interview backdrop at Pitt’s South Side indoor facility, Ford uttered two words — “ACC championship” — when asked what he and Hamlin, longtime friends, have yet to accomplish together. Hamlin referenced a conference crown, too.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s still early. Pitt’s two-hour practice Monday was the first of 15 spring sessions, culminating in the Blue-Gold game April 11. There are position battles to figure out at running back, wide receiver, tackle and linebacker. There are a few new faces to incorporate and 12 freshmen still to join in the fall. There’s a lot of time in between now and the Saturdays that matter.</p>
<p>Six months separate Pitt from spring ball and the 2020 season, three more from a potential trip to Charlotte’s Bank of America Stadium for the ACC title game.</p>
<p>But make no mistake about it: Getting there and winning is the goal for Pitt in 2020.</p>
<p>“We all preach that we want an ACC Championship and then go from there. But you’ve got to take it day by day,” Hamlin said. “Everybody is bought in. We’re not thinking about what’s ahead. We’re not thinking about the next level. We’re not worried about the NFL right now. We bought in, and we’re right where we’re at right now, where our feet are. The sky’s the limit.”</p>
<p>And what does Pat Narduzzi think about all this? Well, he answered a question in his opening statement before anyone had the chance to ask it.</p>
<p>“Is it going to be the best team we’ve had since I’ve been here? I don’t know,” Narduzzi said in his opening statement. “But the maturity we practiced with today, the tempo, the conditioning ... we’re happy with where we are after one [practice].</p>
<p>“We’ll see. We’ve got a lot of work to do.”</p>
<p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Offensive lineman Gabe Houy will miss spring ball in its entirety, Narduzzi said.</p>
<p>Houy was seen walking the sidelines Monday with a cast on his right arm. The redshirt junior, who started six games last season at guard, was expected to battle with Carson Van Lynn for the starting right tackle gig in camp. That competition will have to wait until the fall.</p>
<p>“He was hurt all last year,” Narduzzi said of Houy. “He’ll be ready to roll, though. He’ll be strong and ready to roll in the fall.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/11/06/tre-tipton-injury-pitt-football-l-o-v-e-pittsburgh/stories/201911050171" target="_blank">Tre Tipton will return</a> for a sixth year of eligibility through an NCAA-granted medical hardship waiver, punctuating the news with a jersey change from No. 5 to 6.</p>
<p>The former Apollo-Ridge standout has suffered three torn ACLs in his five previous seasons at Pitt, most recently succumbing to injury in September. Tipton isn’t healthy enough to run routes yet. But he should compete for the open slot receiver role in the fall — and he’s already provided a veteran presence in the wide receiver room.</p>
<p>“Every throwing session he was out there helping guys,” quarterback Kenny Pickett said. “He’s going to be huge moving forward.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Tipton is receiving one of the scholarships that became available with linebacker Albert Tucker and offensive lineman Jerry Drake being placed on permanent medical scholarships.</p>
<p>Drake and Tucker are still with the program and on scholarship, but they don’t count against the 85-scholarship cap. The former three-star 2017 prospects cannot play for Pitt again but can elsewhere if they choose to do so in the future.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Pitt also officially announced a few position changes Monday morning: Tight ends Grant Carrigan and Jason Collier will slide to the offensive line, while Kaymar Mimes will move from defensive end to tight end.</p>
<p>Carrigan never caught a pass for the Panthers, serving primarily as a blocker. Collier practiced with Pitt’s offensive line all of last season while still listed as a tight end. And Mimes has worked at tight end before, learning both positions last spring.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to find a home for him,” Narduzzi said of Mimes. “I think there’s less depth at the tight end spot compared to the defensive end spot. I think Kaymar is capable, and he’s going to get a ton of reps this spring.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Panthers are still waiting to hear whether or not Arizona State transfer quarterback Joey Yellen will be immediately eligible in 2020.</p>
<p>Yellen applied for an NCAA transfer waiver after enrolling at Pitt in January. Whether or not he’s eligible won’t affect the number of seasons allotted with the Panthers. Yellen is currently a redshirt freshman and could serve as Pickett’s backup in 2020 should the NCAA side with him.</p>
<p>“Who knows? Maybe we’re not even going to have to ask for a waiver,” Narduzzi said, referencing the one-time transfer proposal backed by the ACC. “Maybe they’re going to give everyone a waiver.”</p>
<p>“I guess it’s happening more and more,” Narduzzi said when asked earlier about the possible rule change, which would allow players to transfer once without sitting out. “I just hope it doesn’t open the floodgates.”</p>
