<h1>Paul Zeise: Should the Pirates revisit the hiring of Don Kelly?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat Steelers with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> If&nbsp;all of the coaches/executives with ties to Houston the last three seasons — AJ Hinch, Alex Cora, Carlos Beltran — are considered fruits of a poisonous tree, are the Pirates going to have to revisit <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/12/07/Sources-Don-Kelly-to-become-Pirates-bench-coach/stories/201912070051" target="_blank">the hiring Don Kelly</a>?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> That’s a fair question, actually. Kelly hasn’t been implicated in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/13/houston-astros-suspensions-a-j-hinch-sign-stealing/stories/202001130101" target="_blank">MLB sign-stealing scandal</a>, but he was around the team as Houston’s bench coach in 2019. The question is, how far do you want to take it? Is everyone that was a part of that organization now untouchable based on the idea that they may or may not have known? I don’t think so. This isn’t life or death scandal in my book, so I have no issues with the guys who didn’t participate but maybe didn’t stop it either. You can’t hammer everyone. Kelly is fine, unless it comes out that he was banging on garbage cans.</p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> Why is what the Astros did considered such a serious issue? Teams steal signs all the time, and this is just gamesmanship in my book.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> It’s interesting the difference between the NFL and MLB and how they view these things. I think it’s a gray area. Teams have stolen signs and signals since teams have been doing signs and signals. It is gamesmanship to a point. Where it crosses the line is when you start using video cameras and banging on garbage cans. I think there are degrees of sign stealing I can live with, but this definitely crossed the line.</p>
<p><strong>Joseph:</strong> After watching the Titans run all over the Patriots and Ravens the last two weeks are we still gung-ho about the prospects of Ben Roethlisberger coming back and throwing the ball 40 times a game? The best way to win is running the football well, and the Steelers have not the last two years.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well it sure helps when you have Derrick Henry, and the last time I checked the Steelers don’t. Your overall point, though, is well taken. I’ve written several times that the Steelers’ lack of a running game is why they missed the playoffs the last two years. They have to do better and they have to be committed to it. They cannot go back to throwing the ball all over the field and not handing it off. I don’t believe that is a formula to win.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Clayton:</strong> I completely disagree with your story that Bill Cowher is not a Hall of Famer. He was a great coach and had 15 years of mostly success and didn’t have the benefit of having a great quarterback every year. If you don’t think Cowher is a Hall of Famer, do you also not think Mike Tomlin is?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;Mike Tomlin needs to win another Super Bowl to become a Hall of Famer in my book. Now, he likely would get in if he retired right now, but I put him in the category of&nbsp;“really good.” If he wins one more Super Bowl or even gets to another one, then I think he is a lock.</p>
<p><strong>Jake:</strong> Why have the Steelers not hired a quarterbacks coach yet? They desperately need one for Mason Rudolph.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Luckily for you, I was late today getting this in because they just hired one. Matt Canada will be the quarterbacks coach. He was the offensive coordinator at Pitt a few years ago and is considered an innovative mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Does college football need a challenge system like the NFL instead of reviewing every remotely close play? The national championship taking nearly five hours to complete is ridiculous.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I think they should ditch the challenge system in every sport. They should have someone watching the game and buzz the officials if there is something that needs another look. And only egregious calls should be overturned, which would mean you put a 20-second time limit on each review. The whole replay thing has gotten way out of hand.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Why are ACC officials so biased against Pitt? I know we aren’t south of the Mason-Dixon line and don’t have a Hall of Fame coach, but it’s crap that we can’t get a fair shake from the officials in this league.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I don’t think they are biased against Pitt. Every fan I have ever met swears the refs are out to get their teams. Now, do they get the benefit of the doubt that say a Duke or North Carolina might get from time to time? No, probably not. But Jeff Capel even said it — the best teams get the benefit of the doubt. And he also said he hopes to build a program that is so good that the officials do start to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt. Nobody is cheating Pitt, though, and nobody is out to get Pitt.</p>
