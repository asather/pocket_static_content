<h1>Ron Cook: Ricky Cobb's 'Super70sSports' is the escape we need on Twitter</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>His name is Ricky Cobb. I follow him more these days than I do Roger Goodell, Rob Manfred and Gary Bettman. The sports czars can’t offer me anything but hope. Cobb delivers the goods every day without fail.</p>
<p>Maybe you don’t know the name Ricky Cobb. It’s time you got to know him. He runs the best account on Twitter. He never fails to make me laugh at a time when everything else in the sports world seems to be in a horrible place.</p>
<p>@Super70sSports.</p>
<p>It’s not always about sports. “Maybe 65% of the time,” Cobb said.</p>
<p>It’s not always about the 1970s, either. “Probably 50% of the time,” Cobb said.</p>
<p>But it’s always fun.</p>
<p>Who can’t use a little of that in these troubled times?</p>
<p>“I hear from a lot of people who thank me for what I’m doing,” Cobb said during an hour-long interview last week. “I’ve been trying to step it up a little bit, but it’s not like I’m trying to be a comedic hero. It’s more self-therapy for me and me finding comfort in the normalcy of continuing to do what I do. I probably benefit more from it than anyone.”</p>
<p>Cobb, 48, is from the wonderfully named town of Horse Cave, Ky. He received an undergraduate degree from Western Kentucky and a master’s degree in sociology from Louisville. He has been a sociology professor for 17 years at Moraine Valley Community College near Chicago. He is married with five daughters and two step-daughters.</p>
<p>Cobb always has had a passion for comedy. Larry David, the genius behind “Seinfeld” and “Curb Your Enthusiasm,” is an inspiration. “There’s so much material in the mundane trivialities of life,” Cobb said. “I’ve always been a social observer. Pulling comedy out of everyday life is what I love to do.”</p>
<p>Cobb has come a long way since he stepped seriously into the Twitter world on New Year’s Day, 2015. He said he hasn’t missed a day tweeting since then and seldom posts fewer than a dozen tweets a day. His account received a huge boost at the end of 2015 when Sports Illustrated listed him on its Top 100 Twitter list. Now, he has more than 350,000 followers and has turned his work into a nice little business with a website, a podcast, a monthly magazine column and his own apparel line.</p>
<p>Cobb estimates he spends at least 10 hours a day on his account. He dives into the internet looking for the right picture from the time period. Nothing is sacred, although he often tweets about an athlete’s or entertainment celebrity’s shining moment or sends out best wishes for a happy birthday or a happy anniversary. Once he finds his photograph, he attaches a clever, often hilarious caption.</p>
<p>Cobb admits his humor isn’t for everyone because he can be profane.</p>
<p>“Like it or not, that’s always been a part of who I am. If you know me, you know that’s me,” Cobb said. “My sense of comedy has proven to be pretty successful. I like to give people what they want. I’m probably known a little too much for the cursing. I only do it with about 30 percent of my tweets.”</p>
<p>Cobb’s most famous tweet happened on Aug. 19, 2017. He remembers the day because it was his 46th birthday. He found a picture of Howard Cosell holding a microphone with O.J. Simpson on his left and Bruce Jenner (who now is known as Caitlyn Jenner) on his right as the three hosted “Battle of the Network Stars” in 1977. His caption had Cosell saying, “Ladies and gentlemen, I’ve looked into the future and you will not believe this [bleep].”</p>
<p>The tweet was retweeted more than 50,000 times and liked by more than 110,000 people.</p>
<p>“That one is still out there,” Cobb said.</p>
<p>“I find the people you can poke fun at and who are able to laugh at themselves are my kind of people. It seems hard to believe, I guess, that no one has wanted to kick my [behind]. I think most people realize that what I do is tongue-in-check. It’s all in good fun.</p>
<p>“Now, O.J.? I take great delight in mocking him. He deserves it.”</p>
<p>Cobb has an affinity for Pittsburgh sports figures and often tweets their photographs. Among his favorites are Roberto Clemente (“One of my heroes”), Willie Stargell, Dave Parker (“He absolutely should be in the Hall of Fame”) and, of course, Jack Lambert and Joe Greene.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in Pittsburgh once in my life,” Cobb said. “I went to a double-header at PNC Park in 2013. That has to be the greatest ballpark in the country. Then I went out to see Mazeroski’s wall. I’ll never forget that day …</p>
<p>“You guys were blessed. The Steelers were ’70s football. They were the coolest team by far. They had like 20 icons on that team.”</p>
<p>A number of prominent athletes, sports people and celebrities follow Cobb on Twitter, including Derek Shelton, Dale Earnhardt Jr., John Elway, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers. He proudly pointed out Rocky Bleier is another follower.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor for me just to be able to interact with those Steelers. They are legends,” he said.</p>
<p>Cobb envisions the time coming soon when he will give up his day job and turn even more to his comedic endeavors. Stand-up. Podcasts. Television. Maybe a book.</p>
<p>“But I’ll certainly stay on Twitter.”</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be nearly so much fun without him.</p>
