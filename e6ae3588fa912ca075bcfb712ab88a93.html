<p>Hunkered down with their season in limbo, a few Penguins have done good things to help folks in the Pittsburgh community impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The team announced that Bryan Rust, Zach Aston-Reese and Marcus Pettersson purchased 500 personal pizzas from Fox’s Pizza Den that were delivered Friday to community distribution centers in the Hill District and on the Northside.</p>
<p>Fox’s Pizza Den delivered the pizzas to the Neighborhood Resilience Project and the Jeron X. Grayson Community Center in the Hill District and The EAT Initiative Third Meal on the North Side. The goal was to help feed children and families who typically rely on schools and community pantries for some meals.</p>
<p>“Words can’t adequately express our appreciation for the Penguins family’s continuous support of the Hill,” Rev. Glenn G. Grayson Sr., CEO of the community center, said in a statement. “As our families enjoy these pizza meals, I believe it will resonate that we are stronger together.”</p>
<p>In a press release, the Neighborhood Resilience Project and The EAT Initiative also expressed gratitude for the kindness of their “neighbors,” the Penguins.</p>
<p>Two other Penguins announced Friday that they would help feed others, too.</p>
<p>Zach Trotman’s wife, Jeanna, <a href="https://twitter.com/JeannaTrotmanTV" target="_blank">said on Twitter</a> that the Trotman Foundation is donating 715 food items to Gleaners Community Food Bank of Southeastern Michigan in Detroit. Casey DeSmith and his wife, Ellie, stepped up to match their donation, giving theirs to the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.</p>
