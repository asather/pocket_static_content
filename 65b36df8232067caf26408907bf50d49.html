<h1>Dan + Shay, featuring McCandless native Dan Smyers, win country Grammy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dan + Shay got their prime-time moment at the Grammys Sunday night, accepting the award for best country duo/group performance for “Speechless.”</p>
<p>The duo features McCandless native, North Allegheny High School and Carnegie Mellon University grad Dan Smyers, who had a previous life in the Christian rock band Transition before moving to Nashville and hooking up with Shay Mooney to become country hitmakers.</p>
<p>They won their first Grammy last year for the single “Tequila” and now follow with a win for “Speechless,” which topped the country charts and went to No. 24 on the Hot 100.</p>
<p>“I’m going to put my heart up to this microphone,” Smyers said, accepting the award. “You can literally hear it beating out of my chest right now. This is one of my coolest moments ever. Thank you to my wife, Abby, who’s in the crowd down there, for inspiring this song, for inspiring every song we write, for inspiring everything we do in our lives.”</p>
<p>Dan + Shay were also nominated for best country song, which went to Tanya Tucker, winning her first Grammy at 61, 38 years after her first nomination.</p>
<p>The other Pittsburgh connections —&nbsp;the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and hip-hop duo Social House (Mikey Foster and Scootie Anderson), nominated with Ariana Grande —&nbsp;did not win in their categories.</p>
