<h1>Afghan capital is locked down with dueling inaugurations ahead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KABUL, Afghanistan — Afghanistan’s capital was under lockdown early on Monday, with commandos posted at every road leading toward the presidential palace, as marathon overnight talks to prevent the formation of two clashing governments in Kabul appeared to have brought no breakthrough.</p>
<p>The country’s <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/18/world/asia/afghanistan-election-ashraf-ghani.html" rel="nofollow">monthslong political crisis</a> is only worsening, with President Ashraf Ghani, who was declared the winner of a bitterly disputed vote, pushing ahead with his inauguration despite threats of a parallel government from his opponent, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/12/world/asia/abdullah-afghanistan-election.html" rel="nofollow">Abdullah Abdullah</a>, who accuses Mr. Ghani of winning unfairly through fraud.</p>
<p>All of this is playing out in the middle of a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/29/world/asia/us-taliban-deal.html" rel="nofollow">U.S.-negotiated peace plan</a> with the Taliban, which calls for a full U.S. military withdrawal over the next 14 months as well as the start of direct talks between the Afghan government and Taliban insurgency.</p>
<p>The Afghan government is supposed to preparing for those talks now. But the political conflict in Kabul has threatened plans for those to start on Tuesday. And an increasingly fraught disagreement between Mr. Ghani’s government and the U.S. negotiating team over the potential release of thousands of Taliban prisoners threatens to collapse the process in yet another way.</p>
<p>Guests were arriving for inauguration ceremonies of both teams early on Monday morning at palaces separated by just a thin wall. Mr. Abdullah is the chief executive of the coalition government brokered by the United States when a previous election in 2014 ended in another messy stalemate.</p>
<p>This is the third presidential election, out of the country’s total of four since the U.S. invasion in 2001, that has been bitterly disputed and has required American mediation to find a way out.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghani was declared winner by a thin margin of about 12,000 votes above the minimum 50 percent required. Mr. Abdullah’s team has disputed about 15 percent of the total vote. They accuse Mr. Ghani of pressuring the election commission to rush the process of auditing the questionable votes, making sure he begins his second term in office before progress in peace talks shift the conversation to power-sharing with the Taliban.</p>
<p>A previous attempt by Mr. Ghani to hold his swearing-in late last month was delayed by U.S. shuttle diplomacy, as it would have brought the crisis to a head right on the eve of the Taliban and United States signing their deal in Qatar on Feb. 29, officials said. Mr. Ghani’s advisers said the election crisis needed to be brought to a conclusion so a government with a clear mandate could lead the talks with the Taliban.</p>
<p>Now, Mr. Ghani’s inauguration, and Mr. Abdullah’s threat of announcing his own government next door, comes on eve of another milestone in the peace deal: the Taliban and a delegation representing the Afghan government and other parties were supposed to start direct negotiations on Tuesday. That appears unlikely now.</p>
<p>Zalmay Khalilzad, the U.S. special envoy for the talks, came to Kabul soon after signing the deal with the Taliban, in hopes of figuring out a solution between Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah to keep the government from splitting. He shuttled between the two leaders half a dozen times on Sunday, officials said, with the meetings stretching to the early morning hours on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Khalilzad even briefly managed to get Mr. Ghani and Mr. Abdullah to meet face to face close to midnight on Sunday, but Afghan officials from both sides said there was no breakthrough.</p>
<p>Advisers to Mr. Abdullah said they were ready to find a solution to the crisis in the form of an all-inclusive government, something not unlike the current setup negotiated by Secretary of State John Kerry after the 2014 vote ended in a stalemate. The Abdullah team’s bottom line was that whatever form the government took, nothing should validate an official victory through the vote for Mr. Ghani.</p>
<p>Mr. Ghani’s advisers said they were willing to accommodate Mr. Abdullah through a “solution in accordance with the Constitution,” essentially ruling out Mr. Abdullah’s continuing in his current extra-constitutional role as chief executive. But they said that Mr. Abdullah’s demands had made that impossible.</p>
<p>Late into Sunday night, state television broadcast drone footage of the palace boulevards lined with large Afghan flags for the occasion. Representatives and diplomats from 45 countries, and about 2,500 domestic guests, were invited to Mr. Ghani’s event, his inauguration officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Abdullah’s team, hours after, announced that they had issued 10,000 invitation cards. A large numbers seats were arranged around a fountain, and a stage was decorated with flowers.</p>
<p>“We have just sent invites to embassies and foreign organizations in Kabul,” Fazal Ahmad Manawi, a senior adviser to Mr. Abdullah, said on Twitter around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Around 2 a.m. on Monday, Mr. Manawi tweeted that the American side had told them that Mr. Ghani had agreed to postpone his inauguration to allow more time for negotiations between the two camps. One adviser to Mr. Abdullah, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Khalilzad had managed to persuade Mr. Ghani to postpone after getting Secretary of State Mike Pompeo into the conversation. There was no immediate confirmation of that claim from American officials.</p>
<p>But just hours later, at 6 a.m., Shahhusain Murtazawi, a senior adviser to Mr. Ghani, said the inauguration was going ahead on Monday as planned.</p>
