<p>Pittsburgh’s Equal Opportunity Review Commission approved more than $23 million in contracts to minority- and women-owned businesses in 2019, according to its latest annual report.</p>
<p>The commission reviewed $37.5 million worth of city and city authority contracts last year and awarded nearly $11 million (29%) to minority-owned businesses and $12.5 million to women-owned businesses, accounting for 33% of contracts.</p>
<p><a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/10224_2019_EORC_Annual_Report.pdf" target="_blank">In the annual report</a>, nine minority-and-women-owned businesses were listed as&nbsp;“prime-contractors on government contracts” out of the 38 names of the prime contractors listed in the report. The nine businesses include:&nbsp;Alliance Technology Group, Branderic Consulting, Cosmos Technologies, Eisler Landscapes, Grayson Law Firm LLC, Maher Duessel, Mulford Community Teaching Garden, Pashek + MTR and Rosalyn Guy-McCorkle.</p>
<p>The EORC is an 11-member group that reviews professional service contracts of more than $50,000 and construction and development contracts that are above $250,000 to&nbsp;“ensure participation” by minority- and women-owned businesses. The review also entails checking the contractor’s compliance with the city’s equal employment goals of employing 25 percent minorities and 10 percent women.</p>
<p>Between 2018 and 2019, the commission found a 37 percent increase in contracts awarded to minority- and female-owned businesses. Such businesses were awarded a total of $16 million in contract opportunities in 2018.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto said in the press release that he is&nbsp;“proud” of creating the Office of Equity in May 2019 and the restructuring of buying plans to&nbsp;“create tangible economic opportunities for all.”</p>
