<h1>Port Authority to hire consultant for 25-year service plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For more than six months, Port Authority Chief Development Officer David Huffaker and his staff have pored over regional growth projections and other data as they begin developing a plan for where transit service should be expanded over the next 25 years. Now it’s time for the next step.</p>
<p>The authority board is expected to approve a two-year, $1.6 million contract Friday with Michael Baker International Inc. to work with staff on the long-range plan. Baker submitted the most expensive of three proposals for the project, but Mr. Huffaker told a committee last week that Baker stood out because of its intent to reach out to the public as it develops the plan.</p>
<p>The consulting contract is considered a professional service such as hiring a lawyer or architect, so the agency isn’t required to accept the lowest bid for the work.</p>
<p>“They are a strong team particularly dedicated to providing a strong outreach program,” Mr. Huffaker said.&nbsp;“There will be a very large amount of public outreach.”</p>
<p>The plan will be the first the agency has developed since 2006. The agency considers it particularly important to project its long-term needs before the state’s current transportation funding plan expires in 2022.</p>
<p>Michelle Zmijanac, chairwoman of the performance oversight committee that agreed to recommend Baker for the contract, said she is&nbsp;“very excited” to see the plan move forward. The plan will give the agency&nbsp;“a real handle” on where service should be expanded in the future.</p>
<p>“If we don’t have that plan, we can’t tell [state and federal agencies] what we need,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Huffaker said the authority will work in conjunction with the City of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership and the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission, which also are working on long-range plans.</p>
<p>Authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman, who came to the agency two years ago with a strong planning background, called the long-range plan&nbsp;“our chance to dream big.”</p>
<p>“This is the vision of what the transportation system should be in 25 years,” she said.&nbsp;“Will we get everything? No. But if we don’t ask, we won’t get anything.”</p>
<p>Mr. Huffaker stressed the plan will look at where the agency should expand service, not what mode will be used to provide the service. With pending technological improvements such as self-driving vehicles and hyperloop under development, the industry may be changing too quickly to project how to move people so many years from now, he said.</p>
<p>“We want to take the technology out of the [discussion],” Mr. Huffaker said.&nbsp;“We don’t want to burden this process with the location of every station. In 2045, where do we expect to see changes from what we have now.”</p>
<p>The plan also will help the authority decide other major issues, such as whether it should switch away from diesel-powered buses and where it should build a fifth service garage for transit vehicles.</p>
<p>The key, Mr. Huffaker said, will be that the long-range plan is a living document that will be updated regularly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have to have a process for looking at the future, not something that’s going to be on the shelf, but something that’s implemented,” he said.&nbsp;“This is something that we’re going to use every day.”</p>
<p>The plan will be among the topics discussed during the agency’s public engagement meetings that start with three sessions at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center Jan. 29. Specific public meetings about the long-range plan could begin as soon as April with a goal of producing a plan by the end of 2021.&nbsp;</p>
