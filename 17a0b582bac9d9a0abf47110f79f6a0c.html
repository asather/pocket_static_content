<h1>Nation/World briefs: Azerbaijan, Armenia OK cease-fire; 50K errant ballots mailed in Ohio; Judge allows Chauvin to live outside Minn.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Azerbaijan and Armenia negotiated a limited cease-fire early Saturday after almost two weeks of fierce fighting over a disputed province, with the goal of pausing combat long enough to collect bodies from the battlefield and to exchange prisoners.</p>
<p>The Russian-brokered agreement, which takes effect at noon Saturday, was short on specifics. The issue of the how the cease-fire would play out on the front lines was left to the sides to agree to in “additional” talks.</p>
<p>The four-point agreement said the warring parties would halt hostilities on “humanitarian” grounds for the prisoner exchange and to retrieve bodies under criteria set by the Red Cross. It was not clear if the Red Cross would oversee the process.</p>
<p>Under the terms of the deal, Azerbaijan and Armenia committed again to negotiate for a lasting peace in the Minsk Process, a long-drawn-out diplomatic effort at a settlement that hasn’t prevented earlier escalations in fighting.</p>
<p>Even before the announcement, the prospects for a broader peace deal appeared dim after Azerbaijan President Ilham Aliyev said in a televised speech Friday that he was happy to have talks but was making no concessions.</p>
<p><strong>50K errant ballots&nbsp;mailed in Ohio</strong></p>
<p>Nearly 50,000 voters received incorrect absentee ballots in the county that is home to Columbus, Ohio’s capital and largest city, elections officials said Friday as they promised corrected ballots would be mailed within 72 hours.</p>
<p>With about 240,000 ballots mailed, that meant one in five voters received a wrong ballot. The error happened Oct. 3, when someone changed a setting on a machine that places absentee ballots into mailing envelopes, Franklin County elections officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>Some ballots had an incorrect congressional race, while others had the correct information but were sent to voters in a different precinct. The Franklin County Elections Board said 49,669 voters received incorrect ballots out of 237,498 that were mailed.</p>
<p>That represents 6% of the county’s about 880,000 registered voters and 0.6% of the 8 million registered statewide.</p>
<p>The process to print, stuff the replacement ballots in envelopes and mail them was underway Friday, the Franklin County Elections Board said.</p>
<p>The board said multiple checks are in place to ensure voters can cast only one ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Judge allows Chauvin&nbsp;to live outside Minn.</strong></p>
<p>A Minnesota judge cited safety concerns as he issued new conditions of release for an ex-Minneapolis police officer charged in the death of George Floyd that would allow him to live in a neighboring state while he awaits trial.</p>
<p>Derek Chauvin posted $1 million bond Wednesday and was allowed to walk free. Floyd died after Mr. Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for several minutes, even after the Black man pleaded for air before his death May 25. Mr. Chauvin was later charged with second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.</p>
<p>His release triggered two nights of protests in Minneapolis and St. Paul.</p>
<p>Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill said in an order released Friday that the state Department of Corrections presented unspecified evidence in private “supporting safety concerns that have arisen.”</p>
<p>Three other fired former officers who also face charges in the case were released on bond earlier. Their trial is set for March.</p>
