<h1>Lawmakers propose $80 billion in federal money to help cities catch up to Silicon Valley</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The dollars never could quite match the scale of the headlines as Pittsburgh saw tech advances in robotics, machine learning and app development generated by big names like Uber, Ford, Google, Apple, Duolingo and Amazon.</p>
<p>This year, legislation is brewing in Congress to open up federal funding for cities like Pittsburgh, whose civic leaders&nbsp;have touted its growing tech scene while wringing their hands over the relative <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2017/12/15/Pittsburgh-is-spewing-startup-talent-but-the-valley-of-death-is-stunting-growth/stories/201712150002?cid=search" target="_blank">dearth of funding for tech ventures</a>&nbsp;and loss of talented entrepreneurs to other cities.</p>
<p>Two Democratic senators this month introduced a bill to authorize $80 billion over nine years for&nbsp;so-called innovation centers — a label that researchers have suggested should apply to the Pittsburgh region. The Innovation Centers Acceleration Act would target regions far from Silicon Valley with the potential to grow existing innovation engines, such as research universities, and the ability to match funding from state, local and private sources.</p>
<p>That bill comes on top of legislation introduced in May by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Todd Young, R-Ind., that would allocate $100 billion to the National Science Foundation and other agencies, in addition to $10 billion for innovation centers.</p>
<p>As Congress debates another round of COVID-19 legislation, lawmakers have struck a bipartisan note to boost innovation as a way&nbsp;to jump-start struggling state and local economies. They hope to reverse the downward trend of taxpayer spending on federal research and development that by one measure&nbsp;hit a 65-year low in 2018.</p>
<p>Lawmakers are more concerned that declining federal R&amp;D spending has allowed the country’s innovation to become more concentrated in fewer cities — which is a detriment to the country as a whole, said Mark Muro, senior fellow at the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution, a research organization in Washington.</p>
<p>From 2005 to 2017, five U.S. metro areas — Boston, San Francisco, San Jose, Seattle, and San Diego&nbsp;— accounted for more than 90% of the country’s growth in the innovation sector, according to a <a href="http://www2.itif.org/2019-growth-centers.pdf?_ga=2.236307777.112429680.1592237943-1416067703.1592237943" target="_blank">report in December</a>&nbsp;published by Brookings and the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, far more cities, including Pittsburgh, have experienced a “brain drain.” Half of the nation’s 382 metro areas lost innovation-sector jobs, the report found, while identifying Pittsburgh among about three dozen cities, mostly in the Midwest and Southeast, that were strong candidates for federal investment.</p>
<p>Brookings also produced a <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/research/capturing-the-next-economy-pittsburghs-rise-as-a-global-innovation-city/" target="_blank">much-publicized study in 2017</a> that found Pittsburgh could become a “top global destination for technology-based economic activity” if it could translate the&nbsp;region’s innovation sector into broader economic growth.</p>
<p>“It’s not enough to have five to seven superstars along the coasts,” Mr. Muro said. “Pittsburgh has such strong assets that the idea here of a pretty comprehensive and bold effort to turbocharge growth is especially useful.”</p>
<p>Federal money distributed through the “innovation center” model, he said, would spur a rush of dollars for education and workforce development, affordable housing and transportation. “There’s no substitute for having a national government that is actively and substantially intervening to help,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Tradition</strong></p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, research universities like Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh have a long tradition working on federally funded research programs.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, or DARPA,&nbsp;gave rise to robotics engineering at CMU, and Pitt is among the leading recipients of grants from the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute, a nationwide coalition pursuing technologies to <a href="/The%20Advanced%20Robotics%20for%20Manufacturing%20Institute," target="_blank">make American factories more globally competitive</a>, launched at the National Robotics Engineering Center in Lawrenceville with $80 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Defense.</p>
<p>Despite the collaboration, the broader region lags behind the biggest tech hubs. For years, employment growth — at least before the COVID-19 pandemic — has been nearly flat, and local officials have bemoaned the fact the Pittsburgh region loses <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2019/03/04/Allegheny-Conference-Linda-Topoleski-Inflection-Point-workforce-Pittsburgh-jobs/stories/201903030003?cid=search" target="_blank">more than half its college graduates</a> each year.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh tech startups have been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2017/12/15/Pittsburgh-is-spewing-startup-talent-but-the-valley-of-death-is-stunting-growth/stories/201712150002?cid=search" target="_blank">forced to go to Boston</a> to pitch potential investors, and so many fledgling companies sputter out that the tech advocates characterize later-stage funding rounds as the “valley of death.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers are aiming to reverse a trend: In 2018, federal research and development spending fell to 0.61% of the GDP — the country’s lowest level since 1955, according to a report from the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation.</p>
<p><strong>The best solution?</strong></p>
<p>Some tech policy experts questioned whether the bills introduced this year would be the best avenue for federal research dollars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regional innovation centers proposal&nbsp;“would be a big change from the postwar approach,”&nbsp;said Patrick Windham, a public policy lecturer at Stanford University and a partner at Technology Policy International, a consulting firm.</p>
<p>Mr. Windham said the prevailing method of federal research spending since WWII has been to distribute dollars to the top schools and most promising ventures — rather than factoring in concerns about unequal distribution of tax dollars. While innovation may be concentrated in some regions, the thinking went, the entire country benefited.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/10/17/NEWtechpgh1000x200-jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p>Any region can build local capacity to compete for the grants. Mr. Windham&nbsp;pointed to places like San Diego and Austin, Texas, as cities whose leaders have built tech hubs from scratch that can compete for grants.</p>
<p>“The trap is … you can end up putting money into areas that just don’t produce much beyond the annual report,” Mr. Windham said.&nbsp;“Figuring out how to do that is tricky.”</p>
<p>Christopher T. Hill, an emeritus professor of public policy and former vice provost for research at George Mason University, said there was a “sudden increase” in regional development “coming from both sides of the aisle in Congress.” But he also questioned the delivery model.</p>
<p>“This is a great deal of money coming fairly quickly, and regions would be drinking from a firehose,” he said. “What I’d like to see is slightly less ambitious and more structured support.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh leaders would experience a similarly heady challenge as they did during the Amazon HQ2 search, which promised an economic windfall that would touch every part of the region. Leaning on CMU and Pitt, a federal program could finally translate groundbreaking university research into widespread economic fortunes.</p>
<p>“This isn’t just, ‘Let’s write eight research universities $700 million checks and leave it at that,’” said Sean Luther, executive director of InnovatePGH, a public-private partnership including the universities, City of Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and other groups.</p>
<p>“What’s important [is] that we don’t just say there are eight winners in this game, but that there are eight regions, and we’re going to invest, soup to nuts, in those maturing entrepreneurship ecosystems,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s a much more nuanced — and frankly, I think more bipartisan, palatable approach.”</p>
<p>Matt Smith, president of the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce, said the regional leaders were committed to working together.</p>
<p>“Thoughtful and strategic policies will only enhance our ability to grow, succeed, and increase velocity on the innovation and tech vibrancy already occurring,” Mr. Smith said. “We look forward to being part of this discussion as such public policy advances.”</p>
