<p>St. Patrick’s Day festivities are right around the corner, and Pittsburgh is among the top five places to be in the country to celebrate, according to a new report.</p>
<p>WalletHub, a personal-finance website, released a report Tuesday that analyzed <a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-for-st-patricks-day-celebrations/19603/" target="_blank">2020’s best cities for St. Patrick’s Day celebrations</a>, and voted Pittsburgh No.4 out of 30 major cities.</p>
<p>WalletHub compared 200 of the largest cities across 17 metrics -- things like Irish pubs, restaurants per capita and lowest price for a three-star hotel on St. Patrick’s Day -- and narrowed down the top 30. The company reviewed four key dimensions including St. Patrick’s Day traditions, costs, safety/accessibility and St. Patrick’s Day weather forecast.</p>
<p>The city of Pittsburgh hosts one of the oldest and largest St. Patrick’s Day parades in the country, averaging over 22,000 participants, according to <a href="https://downtownpittsburgh.com/st-patricks-day-downtown/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership</a>.</p>
<p>This year’s celebration will be held on Saturday, March 14, and the parade begins at 10:00 a.m. in Downtown, along Grant Street and the Boulevard of the Allies.</p>
<p>WalletHub found that Pittsburgh had the second highest percentage of Irish population the among cities it studied, falling behind Naperville, Illinois, at No.1. Pittsburgh tied for number one with Las Vegas for highest grade in access to bars.</p>
