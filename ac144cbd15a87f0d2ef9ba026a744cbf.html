<h1>County, state health officials urge hospitals to postpone elective procedures to prepare for COVID-19 patients</h1>

<p>Want to schedule a hip replacement, get your kidney stones taken care of, or have a hernia repaired in the age of COVID-19?</p>
<p>You may already be too late.</p>
<p>So-called elective surgeries involve medical procedures that are the needed but not immediately urgent. But now hospitals have to weigh their choices:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Should they keep surgical suites and beds open in case there’s a sudden onslaught of COVID-19 emergencies?</p>
<p>Or does putting off an elective surgery unnecessarily risk complicating a currently manageable condition?</p>
<p>On Tuesday, physician Debra Bogen, director of the Allegheny County Health Department, and Secretary of Health Rachel Levine asked local health care providers to cancel elective surgeries in the coming days to ensure that systems are prepared for an expected surge of COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>A spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of Health said Tuesday that hospitals “should review all scheduled elective admissions, surgeries and procedures and develop a plan to postpone or cancel those admissions, surgeries and procedures if they have not done so already.”</p>
<p>But a UPMC spokesman said Tuesday that the region’s largest hospital network has no immediate plans to cancel or postpone elective surgeries as it continues to monitor the situation.</p>
<p>“Balancing our patients’ ongoing clinical needs with the avoidance of unnecessary exposure requires a nuanced approach — not an across-the-board canceling of clinics and procedures,” said spokesman Paul Wood. “UPMC recommends that ‘elective’ procedures for those that are at higher risk should be delayed only when it is clinically safe to do so.”</p>
<p>Allegheny Health Network spokesman Dan Laurent, meanwhile, said they support the recommendation to postpone non-emergency cases for now “to further ensure that the community’s significant anticipated health care needs related to the COVID-19 pandemic can be fully met.”</p>
<p>He said the network has moved limit non-emergency procedures to only ones considered “medically urgent.”</p>
<p>Others have also taken steps to limit or postpone elective procedures: On Tuesday, Heritage Valley Health System said it was halting elective surgeries for the rest of the month. And West Virginia University Medicine — the largest provider in the only U.S. state without a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis as of Monday — had already announced Monday it is deferring all elective surgeries and GI procedures beginning Thursday until May 15.</p>
<p>The varying responses reflect a nation still trying to grasp how to respond to the still-unfolding COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On Saturday, U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams sent out a tweet asking health systems to “consider stopping elective procedures” until the immediate crisis passes, saying that performing elective surgeries might bring COVID-19 into their facilities while using needed masks and other protective gear and adding strain to already overtaxed clinical staff.</p>
<p>The next day, leading hospital associations including the American Hospital Association, wrote to Dr. Adams, questioning any suggestion that hospitals immediately stop elective surgeries.</p>
<p>“It is imperative to note that ‘elective’ simply means a procedure is scheduled rather than a response to an emergency,” stated the letter, which was co-signed by the Association of American Medical Colleges, Children’s Hospital Association and the Federation of American Hospitals.</p>
<p>Elective surgeries, it continued, “could include replacement of a faulty heart valve, removal of a serious cancerous tumor, or a pediatric hernia repair. Often, if these types of procedures are delayed or canceled, the person’s condition gets rapidly worse and can even be life threatening.”</p>
<p>But the number of hospitals opting to hold off on non-emergency procedures is growing, with geography seeming a deciding factor as outbreak hotbeds force hospital administrators’ hands.</p>
<p>In New York, where an outbreak in suburban neighborhood led to officials implementing a one-mile “containment zone,” the seven-hospital New York Presbyterian Hospital system decided last weekend that it would postpone all elective surgeries and procedures “until further notice.”</p>
<p>It appears it may soon be Southwestern Pennsylvania’s turn.</p>
