<h1>The rush to keep businesses afloat sent more than $3 billion in government loans to Pittsburgh-area employers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the federal government scrambled this spring to pump money into an economy being decimated by the COVID-19 pandemic, southwestern Pennsylvania employers received more than $3 billion in loans.</p>
<p>The money was part of the Paycheck Protection Program, a government-backed loan initiative intended to help small businesses avoid layoffs. So far, the program has yielded more than half a trillion dollars in loans nationwide. Companies and nonprofits that receive the money can apply for loan forgiveness if they demonstrate that most of it went to cover payroll expenses.</p>

<p>Statewide, Pennsylvania companies have collected more than $20 billion through the program so far, according to the latest data from the U.S. Small Business Administration. Small businesses owners still have until Aug. 8 to apply for a loan.</p>
<p>The program, which was implemented unusually quickly for a federal funding initiative, was intended as a rapid stopgap measure to allow companies some breathing room. Some companies receiving loans used the time to adapt to new restrictions imposed by the pandemic, as COVID-19 case counts continue to rise in many U.S. cities.</p>
<p>In southwestern Pennsylvania — which includes Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette, Greene, Indiana, Lawrence, Washington and Westmoreland counties — lenders distributed 33,515 loans, which translates into roughly one loan for every two employers in the region.</p>
<p>The vast majority of loans were below $150,000, but some were as high as $10 million. In releasing detail of the program’s lending activity, the Small Business Administration provides ranges (not specific numbers) for the larger loans. That puts the total so far received by the Pittsburgh region’s companies between $3.3 billion and $6.4 billion.</p>
<p>The largest chunk of loans went to employers in professional fields such as legal services, technical consultancies and design firms, industries that may have an easier time with remote work than manufacturers or restaurant operators —&nbsp;or solar installers like Westwood-based company Energy Independent Solutions, whose owner, Joe Morinville received a loan between $150,000 and $350,000 through the program.</p>
<p>Mr. Morinville said that the Paycheck Protection Program loan helped save his company from severe financial problems — but that doesn’t mean the experience has been entirely positive.</p>
<p>When the program started, he already had been paying a number of employees who had been laid off by the company but were not receiving their owed unemployment benefits. Mr. Morinville says he felt responsible for ensuring the financial security of the laid-off personnel, who he hoped to hire back later. Continuing to pay them with the assistance would have damaged EIS’s ability to rebound when the area reopened.</p>
<p>When the company received the loan, Mr. Morinville contacted all the furloughed employees to let them know they could come back — but then he ran into an unexpected problem.</p>
<p>Under the $600-per-week pandemic unemployment subsidy — which is being distributed on top of regular unemployment benefits —&nbsp;it was financially better for some of the employees to stay out of work for the time being instead of returning to EIS’s payroll. Mr. Morinville said he understood their decision, but the amount of his loan that could be forgiven would diminish if the number of people on the payroll went down over the loan period.</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do — am I going to fire my good people because they’re making more money, or what?” he said. “It was a period of time where we were doing everything [the government was] asking us to do, but it was still impossible to comply. That’s where our frustration came in.”</p>
<p>On the conflict between the forgiveness qualifications and the relatively high unemployment benefit rate, Mr. Morinville said, “I would have taken the PPP even if there wasn’t any forgiveness, because we needed the capital and the banks are not lending money like they used to.”</p>
<p><strong>An effective stopgap</strong></p>
<p>For manufacturing companies, the program was an effective stopgap to help avoid having to shut down permanently, said&nbsp;David N. Taylor, president and CEO of the Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association, a Harrisburg-based trade group.&nbsp;But Mr. Taylor isn’t in favor of extending the program.</p>
<p>“The average business has two months or less of cash on hand, so we’re already past the breaking point for many businesses.” he said.</p>
<p>“The PPP payments may have helped them to prolong that for a little while, but we’re approaching the time when these businesses are going to have to decide whether they’re going to be able to reopen or whether they’re just going to close their doors forever.”</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor is concerned that if businesses don’t reopen, the resulting “wave” of closures and bankruptcies will “annihilate” tax bases of towns and cities across the state. But he doesn’t want another stimulus package; instead, he says, state and federal governments should pass safe-harbor laws to protect small businesses from legal liability associated with virus transmitted in the workplace.</p>
<p>Even if businesses do reopen, there’s no guarantee that companies or the general public will feel safe or financially secure enough to return to pre-pandemic buying habits.</p>
<p>And with many cities that have previously evaded a major outbreak now seeing rising numbers of cases, it’s possible that governors could re-institute the shelter-in-place orders that were commonplace during the early stages of community transmission of COVID-19 in the United States.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the Paycheck Protection Program is just one of a number of government programs attempting to prop up the U.S. economy as the virus continues to spread. Even though there’s still close to $132 billion available for businesses through the program, further aid is already being debated in Washington.</p>
