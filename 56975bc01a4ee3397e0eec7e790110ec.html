<h1>South Fayette park and ride to close</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The South Fayette Park and Ride, located at 100 Hickory Grade Road, is set to close on July 4.</p>
<p>The owner of the park and ride has decided to end the agreement with Port Authority so that a new development can move into the space, according to the authority. As a result, the 31-Bridgeville and the G31-Bridgeville Flyer will not serve that park and ride. No other stops will be missed.</p>
<p>As an alternative to the South Fayette location, Port Authority is encouraging customers to park in the South Hills Village Garage. That garage has a daily fee of $2 or $22 for a monthly pass.</p>
<p>The 31-Bridgeville and the G31-Bridgeville Flyer will continue to serve the Woodville Park and Ride in Carnegie, however Port Authority warns that this lot is quickly filled on most weekday mornings.</p>
<p>Port Authority is continuing to look for alternate parking options in that area.</p>
