<h1>Gary Goga, Peters Township basketball coach, will resign at season's end</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Peters Township High School boys basketball team’s season isn’t finished, but Gary Goga has decided his time as the Indians’ coach is over.</p>
<p>Goga has decided to resign, effective at the end of the season. Goga has been the Indians’ coach for 15 seasons and guided the team to the WPIAL quarterfinals the past two seasons. He will still coach Peters Township when it plays McDowell High in a PIAA Class 6A first-round playoff game Saturday at Edinboro University.</p>
<p>“The last 15 years have been the best years of my life, but it’s time for a change,” Goga said. “It’s a good time now with the new (Peters Township) school opening next year.”</p>
<p>Goga was the Post-Gazette Coach of the Year in 2009 after the Indians won a WPIAL championship. In his 15 years, the Indians made the WPIAL playoffs eight times and his record was 172-176. This year’s team is 14-10 and lost to Butler in double overtime in the WPIAL quarterfinals.</p>
<p>Goga’s departure means Peters Township will be looking for new boys and girls basketball coaches. Bert Kendall decided recently to resign as Peters Township’s girls coach, only one year after winning WPIAL and PIAA championships.</p>
