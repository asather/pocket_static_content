<p>A second person has been charged in the destruction of a Pittsburgh police vehicle during a protest outside the PPG Paints Arena last month following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>According to investigators, Robert Redman, 27, of Imperial, was captured on video using a skateboard to damage the front of the police car. Court records show he was arrested Thursday following a police investigation of&nbsp;video footage from the city and social media accounts of the May 30 incident.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said demonstrations turned destructive and violent roughly two hours after protests began at 4:30 p.m. that day. Violence began with the vandalism and burning of the marked police car, which was parked outside the PPG Paints Arena, Downtown, a criminal complaint stated.</p>
<p>Mr. Redman was also seen tagging bridge supports with graffiti in the area of Crosstown Boulevard and Forbes Avenue, the criminal complaint states. He is charged with felony counts of criminal mischief, institutional vandalism, rioting, and several misdemeanors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for July 1 at City Court, Downtown.</p>
