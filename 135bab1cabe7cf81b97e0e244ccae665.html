<h1>Autonomous vehicle firm Aurora gears up for move to the Strip District</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Autonomous vehicle firm Aurora Innovation is expanding its Pittsburgh presence with a new location in the Strip District.</p>
<p>The company, one of a handful in Pittsburgh developing and testing self-driving cars, confirmed that it plans to take over space in the 1600 Smallman Street office project to house employees from a range of teams — including engineers, technical operations, recruiting and IT — as well as its fleet of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Aurora expects to move from its Lawrenceville headquarters to the new Strip District location in the spring of 2021, according to a spokesperson for the company.</p>
<p>The new office, which is still under construction, is part of a larger development in the area that is meant to produce three floors of office space, street level retail and more than 200 parking spaces. Chicago-based McCaffery Interests paid $10.5 million to buy the building in February 2019 and is working on the project as a companion to the developing produce terminal across the street. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/09/01/Strip-District-produce-terminal-McCaffery-1600-Smallman-Fine-Wine-Good-Spirits/stories/202009010073" target="_blank">McCaffery had previously indicated Aurora would be part of the project</a>.</p>
<p>The produce terminal is expected to be filled with restaurant, retail and market space. Earlier this week, the project <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/09/16/Strip-produce-terminal-District-Brew-Yards-chicago-brewery-City-Grows-OnPar/stories/202009150167" target="_blank">announced new tenants for the area</a> — a brewery collective and beer hall, an organic garden and gift shop, and a golf facility.</p>
<p>Most Aurora employees are still working remotely amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company said in a press release it was excited about Strip District attractions, like breakfast at DeLuca’s Diner or watching Steelers games at Primanti Brothers.</p>
<p>The company did not disclose how much the new office location cost. In addition to Aurora’s Pittsburgh office, which has 150 employees, the firm has operations in San Francisco, Palo Alto, California and Bozeman, Montana.</p>
<p>In moving to the Strip District, the self-driving car company is getting even closer to some of its competitors —&nbsp;including Argo AI and Uber Advanced Technologies Group — as well as other high-tech ventures like Honeywell, Apple and Facebook.</p>
<p>"The Strip District is a place steeped in history and character, but always evolving and vibrant. You can say the same for the City of Pittsburgh and the Strip's latest neighbor, Aurora,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a prepared statement. “I am so happy they have settled in the new Smallman Street corridor and continue to call Pittsburgh home.”</p>
