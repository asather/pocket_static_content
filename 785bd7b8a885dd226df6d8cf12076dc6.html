<h1>Gene Therapy:  Lies then and now, the stuff of resignation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Humorless to the point of being inhumane, devious, vacillating, profane, ignorant, suspicious, and of such minimal loyalty as to be of no good use, the President of the United States should rightly consider tendering his resignation.</p>
<p>Donald Trump? Sure, but that blast was aimed at Richard Nixon in the summer of 1974, when the nation’s newspapers began a rhetorical gang tackle of a president at the leading edge of the Watergate Scandal and all of its attendant felonious skullduggery.</p>
<p>The Chicago Tribune, until it unfurled the blistering editorial re-situated in the first paragraph above, had been a rock-ribbed Nixon defender. It wasn’t until it became evident through the president’s own words in the president’s own voice that he’d been lying for years to the detriment of these United States that reasonable people with long-established public standing began clamoring for his public hide.</p>
<p>Forty-six summers later, a president who knows virtually nothing about our history has forced a comparison of contexts, but basically it’s just as James Clapper, the 79-year-old former director of national intelligence, described it on television the night of the freshest Bob Woodward revelations.</p>
<p>“This makes the Watergate tapes pale,” Mr. Clapper said.</p>
<p>Mr. Nixon resigned Aug. 9, 1974, for high crimes and misdemeanors that didn’t amount to a fraction of that for which Mr. Trump is culpable on the coronavirus alone. Mr. Woodward, whose reporting in conjunction with Carl Bernstein led to that same long-ago resignation, has Mr. Trump on a Feb. 7 recording describing the coronavirus as “more deadly (than the flu). This is 5% versus 1% and less than 1%. You know? So, this is deadly stuff.”</p>
<p>Three weeks later, in front of a packed rally in South Carolina, he called the deadly virus a “hoax,” and later, “the sniffles.” On March 19, Mr. Trump was back on Mr. Woodward’s phone admitting that the virus was killing young as well as old. He then spent the summer insisting children go back to school because they are “almost immune.”</p>
<p>As doctors and public health experts were painting a much darker COVID-19 from empirical evidence and as the president approached an all-topics total of 20,000 false and misleading claims for his first term according to the Washington Post, some staggering numbers were getting crunched at Columbia University, which Mr. Trump immediately ripped as “liberal” and “disgraceful,” words he deploys as synonyms.</p>
<p>Columbia’s trans-Trumpian-aggression was in calculating that 36,000 lives would have been spared had the president shut down the country a week earlier, and that had he done so two weeks earlier (still three weeks after the Feb. 7 conversation with Woodward), 82% of COVID-19 deaths could have been prevented, as well as 84% of the now more than 6million cases.</p>
<p>I’m not in the business of re-writing Ivy League scientists, but let’s put that this way. Of the 196,345 Americans lost to this pandemic as of the weekend, 161,003 would be alive if the president were somehow capable of that simplest of moral clarities: telling the truth.</p>
<p>“This isn’t Watergate,” Mr. Bernstein told a cable audience the other night. “This is the greatest felony by any president. He covers up what he knows can cause tens of thousands of deaths. He’s willing to just throw away lives, the ultimate felony by a president of the United States.”</p>
<p>Naturally, the first defense Mr. Trump lunged for when the Woodward tapes came to light made no sense whatsoever. He didn’t want to panic anybody. Panic? Panic is the man’s brand. The drug-dealing criminal raping Mexicans are coming! The caravan is heading for our Southern border! Anarchists! Looters! Agitators! Rioters! Low-income housing will ruin the suburbs! Antifa! They’re coming for your beautiful Second Amendment! They’re gonna have late term abortions on demand! They’ll get rid of the death penalty! Radical left socialists! This will be the most rigged election in history! And my favorite, which I quote for you directly, “People that you’ve never heard of,” he told favored Fox bootlick Laura Ingraham, were controlling Joe Biden. “People that are in the dark shadows. They’re people that are on the streets. They’re people that are controlling the streets. We had somebody get on a plane from a certain city this weekend, and in the plane, it was almost completely loaded with thugs wearing these dark uniforms, black uniforms with gear and this and that. They’re on a plane.”</p>
<p>Clearly, the man doesn’t want to alarm anybody.</p>
<p>It’s no accident that Mr. Woodward called his first volume on Mr. Trump’s monumental incompetence “Fear,” because when he asked Mr. Trump to define power for him, Mr. Trump answered, “Real power is – I don’t even want to use the word – fear.”</p>
<p>The hard truth is, Mr. Trump doesn’t mind panicking people if it adrenalizes his chances of retaining power; he’s only hesitant when it will clearly have the opposite impact, no matter how many people such hesitation might endanger, no matter how many weeks (25 in a row right now) more people file first-time jobless claims than ever before, no matter how many people who were alive when he knew what he knew in February have to die.</p>
<p>Ironically and tragically, the people whose safety he is least concerned with are his own loyalists. They’ve got to sign waivers when they come mask-less to his rallies, no social distancing necessary. These are rallies where he never mentions the “deadly stuff” he’s known full well about since January when he was briefed by the CIA. Herman Cain went to one in Tulsa. Indoors.</p>
<p>Herman Cain is dead. Along with nearly 200,000 others.</p>
<p>Former CIA director John Brennan, hearing Mr. Trump’s voice on Mr. Woodward’s recordings, blurted the inescapable 21st century conclusion: “In his comments to Bob Woodward, Donald Trump reveals what an absolute abomination he is. If he had a conscience or a soul, he would resign. Tragically for us, he has neither.”</p>
<p>I doubt that like Mr. Nixon, Mr. Trump will ever resign. Too many “smoking guns” and “bombshells” that have practically gone off in his hair have failed to alter our modern American dynamic, to which we always quickly return.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump does the lying. We do the dying.</p>
