<h1>Find your getaway cabin or cottage at Home &amp; Garden Show</h1>

<p>If Frank Lloyd Wright added a fishing cabin behind Fallingwater, it might look like this.</p>
<p>Real boulders, trees and flowers surround the 26-by-20-foot structure that stands on the second floor of the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, but it’s still a fantasy.</p>
<p>“This is a getaway house,” says designer Nancy Sakino Spears of Savoy Interior Design. “We want people to say, ‘I could buy a piece of property and do this.’”</p>

<p>The Cabin in the Woods built by Weaver Barns of Sugarcreek, Ohio, is one of the bigger features at the Duquesne Light Pittsburgh Home and Garden Show, which opens Friday and continues through March 15. Nearby is the smaller Lakeside Cottage built by JDM Structures of Millersburg, Ohio. Both suggest&nbsp; second homes, a common dream among the thousands of visitors who come to browse products and services spread over 10 acres on two floors of the convention center Downtown.</p>
<p>Ms. Spears and other members of the Pittsburgh chapter of the American Society of Interior Designers spent two days decorating a 520-square-foot modern cabin with a 20-by-14-foot great room. Part of a black walnut tree stretches from the top of the fireplace mantel to the peak of a 21-foot-high shiplap ceiling, and the same wood was milled to make the mantel of the LED fireplace. The walls are painted in deep blue Naval, Sherwin-Williams 2020 color of the year. It makes a dramatic backdrop for a white leather sofa, glass pub table and lime green Eames-style chair.</p>
<p>The adjacent kitchenette features white GE Cafe appliances and custom charcoal cabinets with bronze pulls. The bathroom also has charcoal cabinetry and walls painted in First Light, Benjamin Moore’s color of the year. The 13-by-13-foot bedroom has walnut furniture and blue walls in Chinese Porcelain, PPG’s color of the year. The cabin shell is priced at $44,000 at the show.</p>
<p>On the way in and out, check out the evergreens, rhododendrons, ornamental grasses, hyacinths and daffodils planted by Patricia Conley, a horticulture graduate of Bidwell Training Center who manages and designs for Wild Rose Landscape Design in Bethel Park. Her brother, John Beck, and cousin, Michael McGee, work with her to make sure the live plants and moon gate will look good throughout the 10-day show.</p>
<p>For another take on second homes, check out the nearby Lakeside Cottage by JDM Structures. The builder partnered with S. Flynn Designs, also of Millersburg, Ohio, to decorate its Skyline model. The 16-by-10-foot cottage arrived fully assembled and is shown with a cedar pergola and low-maintenance outdoor furniture made from recycled plastic. All are available at JDM and Pittsburgh Structures’ five area retail locations.</p>
<p>Sales manager Alvin Yoder said the company is especially proud of its buildings’ durability. The siding and floors are made from engineered wood, and there is a 15-year warranty on the siding’s baked-on paint. JDM is giving away a barn during the show at its main booth on the lower level.</p>
