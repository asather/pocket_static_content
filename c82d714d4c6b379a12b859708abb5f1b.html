<h1>QB Devin Whitlock and stout defense lead Belle Vernon to shutout over McKeesport</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With many starters graduated from a team that played for a WPIAL championship last season, Belle Vernon had some questions heading into Friday’s lid-lifter. One game does not a season make, but these Leopards can be pretty certain about a couple things after a cat fight with the McKeesport Tigers:</p>
<p>The smallest guy on Belle Vernon’s offense has terrific big-play ability, and Belle Vernon’s defense is excellent.</p>
<p>That was obvious after Belle Vernon beat host McKeesport, 20-0, in a WPIAL Class 4A Big Eight Conference game on George L. Smith Field at Weigle-Schaeffer Stadium.</p>
<p>Devin Whitlock, Belle Vernon’s 5-foot-8, 155-pound junior waterbug quarterback, rushed for 224 yards on 18 carries, and his touchdown on the third play of the game was all the scoring until the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>On defense, Belle Vernon, the Post-Gazette’s No. 2 Class 4A team, shut down McKeesport’s vaunted flexbone triple-option offense and handed the third-ranked Tigers their first shutout defeat since Penn-Trafford beat the Tigers, 28-0, in 2014.</p>
<p>“I think you could say we were hoping for this, but we didn’t necessarily know it,” Belle Vernon coach Matt Humbert said.</p>
<p>The win kicked off a season that will undoubtedly be unlike any other for all high school football teams in Pennsylvania because of COVID-19. Many schools did not allow fans at games Friday. McKeesport allowed two tickets to each football player, band member and cheerleader. McKeesport also gave Belle Vernon a limited amount of tickets for players’ parents, and the Belle Vernon fans sat on the opposite side of the stadium. By halftime, there were about 130 fans on McKeesport’s side and 75 on Belle Vernon’s side.</p>
<p>But the McKeesport fans never had much to cheer about as the Tigers’ running game accounted for only a little more than 100 yards. McKeesport also completed only 2 of 7 passes. Belle Vernon’s front four of Anthony Evans, Nate Farley, Tommy Kovatch and Dakota Marion were impressive and the defense also accounted for a touchdown.</p>
<p>“Our defense was stellar,” Humbert said. “The biggest key was could we match their speed? I was very happy to see kids being able to track plays on the perimeter because that was our biggest fear.”</p>
<p>McKeesport had trouble tracking down Whitlock. A year ago as a sophomore, Whitlock played mostly slotback. But with quarterback Jared Hartman graduated, Whitlock was moved to QB. His first start went well, even if it came in strange surroundings because of the limited amount of fans.</p>
<p>“I can’t say it was strange because I just tried to think there was nobody in the stands,” Whitlock said. “I came in here to do one job and that was to get the ‘Dub’ for my team.”</p>
<p>Nine of Whitlock’s 18 carries went for 10 yards or more. He had a touchdown pass called back because of a penalty.</p>
<p>“He’s electric,” Humbert said. “Offensively, you can see we can move the ball, but we couldn’t get out of our own way because of penalties and missed assignments here and there. That’s what we need to clean up.”</p>
<p>Whitlock scored his 73-yard TD on his first carry of the game.</p>
<p>“I was anxious to get the ball and show what I can do,” Whitlock said. “That first play, though, whenever I took off and saw a lead blocker in front of me, it felt like Christmas because of how big the hole was.”</p>
<p>Belle Vernon took a 6-0 lead into halftime. McKeesport did have one good scoring chance in the first half. On a fourth-and-2 play, Keyshawn Humphries ran for 18 yards to the Belle Vernon 9. But a personal foul penalty pushed the Tigers back to the 24. Three plays gained only 4 yards, and quarterback Terrance Glenn was sacked on fourth down by linebacker Cole Weightman.</p>
<p>Belle Vernon didn’t score again until Dane Anden’s 2-yard touchdown run with 9:45 left in the game. On McKeesport’s ensuing possession, Logan Cunningham intercepted a pass and returned it 60 yards for a touchdown.</p>
