<h1>UPMC closing ambulatory surgery centers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>UPMC is closing several ambulatory surgery centers and “moving medically necessary surgeries and procedures into hospital locations,” spokesman Paul Wood said Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Wood said the move “will help us to protect staff and preserve protective equipment.”</p>
<p>Affected include five facilities in Pittsburgh: UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh North; UPMC Digestive Health and Endoscopy Center; UPMC St. Margaret Harmar Surgery Center; UPMC Center for Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility; and UPMC South Surgery Center.</p>
<p>Closures outside the Pittsburgh region include the UPMC Altoona Surgery Center and UPMC Hamot Surgery Center in Erie as well as seven facilities in the central part of the state: West Shore Surgery Center and UPMC Pinnacle Procedure Center in Mechanicsburg; UPMC Specialty Care York Endoscopy; Hanover Surgicenter; UPMC Leader Surgery Center in York; Susquehanna Valley Surgery Center in Harrisburg and Carlisle Outpatient Surgery Center.</p>
<p>UPMC has resisted recommendations from county and state health officials who have urged hospitals to postpone non-emergent procedures to conserve resources for an expected surge in seriously ill patients from the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>But Mr. Wood insisted Sunday that UPMC is in compliance with state and federal guidelines regarding elective procedures.</p>
<p>“As the dominant provider in our region,” he said, “UPMC is fully prepared to meet the needs of our community now and in the future, even if COVID-19 cases grow exponentially as many anticipate.”</p>
