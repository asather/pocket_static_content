<h1>Peduto condemns protest demonstration outside his house </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto on Wednesday condemned the actions of protesters as&nbsp;“unacceptable” after a handful of demonstrators&nbsp;spent the night outside his house Tuesday evening, and some “harassed” neighbors and blasted siren noises.</p>
<p>“I woke up around 6:30 a.m. [Wednesday] and heard siren sounds going off,” said&nbsp;Jim Niesen, 74, who lives across Hastings Street from Mr. Peduto and has lived in the neighborhood for three decades. “[Protesters] were upset because this is the third time they’ve come here and [Peduto] has not come out to talk to them. This one was specifically triggered by what happened this weekend.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neighbors said the so-called “harassment” included some protesters throwing profanity at them and calling them&nbsp;“hypocrites” for not being on the street and physically involved in demonstrations. Protests were otherwise peaceful, neighbors said.</p>
<p>“We definitely support the cause, but we chose not to get in the mix of people protesting because we are older and some of us have underlying health conditions,” Mr. Niesen said.</p>
<p>The demonstrations outside Mr. Peduto’s house have continued since Sunday, a day after plainclothes officers in an unmarked white van arrested a man during a Black Lives Matter protest in Oakland. Protest leaders called the act a “kidnapping,” but police alleged that the man repeatedly blocked traffic for the protesters, creating hazardous conditions and repeatedly refusing officers’ directions to stop, officials said.</p>
<p>In response to the arrest,&nbsp;captured on cellphone video,&nbsp;around 100 people gathered Sunday at Mellon Park to peacefully march and protest in front of Mr. Peduto’s house. Protesters wore black and held signs calling for defunding the police. Protest leaders expressed their frustration with Saturday’s arrest, and many described that day’s protest — a weekly occurrence referred to as “Civil Saturdays” — as peaceful before the arrest.</p>
<p>By Tuesday evening, a handful of protesters that had gathered outside Mr. Peduto’s home spent the night and slept outside on air mattresses into Wednesday morning. Some protesters used a megaphone to blast siren noises in the morning. Other protesters also questioned the sincerity of Black Lives Matter signs posted in various neighboring yards, neighbors said.</p>
<p>City police deemed the gathering an&nbsp;“unlawful assembly” and dispersed the small crowd by 9:30 a.m. Wednesday, police said.</p>
<p>Colorful chalk messages supporting the cause also were removed from Hastings Street after 10 a.m.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Peduto on Wednesday said he supports the right to peacefully protest, and that he believes Black Lives Matter. “... We are in a historic fight for civil rights in this country,” he said.</p>
<p>“What I cannot defend is any neighborhood in our city — and their residents and families — being disturbed through the night and morning, and a peaceful protest devolving into unacceptable conduct in which residents are being harassed and threatened,” Mr. Peduto said. “This crosses a line that cannot be allowed to continue, causing those committing crimes against residents to face possible legal consequences for their actions.</p>
<p>“Using protests to create conflict and division, as some are doing, only impacts the ability of others to exercise their constitutional rights safely.”</p>
<p>Another neighbor, Emanuela Grama, 44, criticized Mr. Peduto for not talking to protesters.</p>
<p>“Peduto had a second chance to clarify his silence and inaction regarding the kidnapping of an organizer that had occurred a few days ago,” said Ms. Grama, a four-year resident who lives several houses down from Mr. Peduto. “But he chose to do nothing. He did not talk to the protesters nor did he acknowledge their rights to protest on a public street. Instead, he sent out the police and had their messages on the street literally erased.”</p>
<p>“He’s a good guy,” said Mike Kuchera, 49, who lives directly next to the mayor. “[Protesters] wanted to hold [Peduto] accountable for the actions of police, and I get it. But he has worked really hard to provide open spaces and connections with people to express their concerns, and avenues for change. I know people are upset, but he is not against them.”</p>
<p>Mayor Peduto acknowledged that&nbsp;“people are feeling fear, pain and anger,” but&nbsp;“I will not accept unjustified actions that threaten neighbors in any part of the city.”</p>
<p>No arrests were made Wednesday.</p>
