<h1>Tuned In: KDKA wins most firsts, WPXI shows most improvement in February ratings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Long a competitive local TV news market, February saw a few shakeups from the ratings status quo.</p>
<p>Sure, KDKA-TV dominated in household ratings as is often the case, but WPXI-TV made real strides in demographic ratings â€” showing improvements among viewers ages 25-54 in every weekday newscast time period.</p>
<p>And while WTAE remained No. 1 in household ratings on weekdays at 5 and 6 a.m., WPXI pulled into first place in those same time periods in the demo.</p>
<p>Ratings released Thursday by Nielsen include both household ratings that reflect a measure of overall popularity and demographic ratings that are the basis for setting advertising rates. TV commercials are generally sold on demos, which can be sliced and diced in assorted ways (men, women, age, income), but viewers ages 25-54 are one of the key demographics used to sell ads in a newscast.</p>
<p>At noon KDKA, WPXI and WTAE all saw demo ratings increases.</p>
<p>WTAE saw household and demo ratings improvements at 5 and 6 p.m. WPXI and KDKA saw demo ratings rise in the same time period while KDKA was flat in households and WPXI declined in households.</p>
<p>At 11 p.m. WPXI ranked No. 1 in the key demo (KDKA was No. 1 in households).</p>
