<h1>Analysis: Why the Penguins shouldn't overlook Montreal in play-in round</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the Penguins, the path toward another Stanley Cup will be one round longer this summer (or perhaps fall) should the NHL and the NHL Players’ Association find a way to play out the rest of the season safely and responsibly.</p>
<p>But their play-in opponent, based on what we saw before the COVID-19 pandemic halted play, is one of the weakest teams of the 24 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/22/Penguins-vote-yes-to-24-team-playoff-format/stories/202005220143" target="_blank">in an expanded field</a>.</p>
<p>The Montreal Canadiens certainly didn’t expect to be in the playoffs three months ago, when they were sellers before the NHL’s Feb. 24 trade deadline.</p>
<p>Their general manager, former Penguins prankster Marc Bergevin, was gearing up for a critical offseason for a franchise with aging and expensive cornerstones in Carey Price and Shea Weber and one the league’s top farm systems.</p>
<p>After getting rid of five players, including Ilya Kovalchuk, the Canadiens had lost three in a row when the season stopped March 12. They were 12th in the Eastern Conference at 31-31-9. Statistical projections gave the Canadiens, who with 11 games left were 10 points out of a playoff spot, less than a 1% chance of getting in.</p>
<p>A recent column from The Athletic in Montreal actually argued that the Canadiens being included in the expanded field would be the “worst thing imaginable” for the franchise because they had no chance of winning the Cup and could only hurt their chances of scoring presumed No. 1 pick Alexis Lafreniere.</p>
<p>Finances were no doubt a major factor in the NHL and NHLPA picking a 24-team playoff format that made sure to include heavyweight hockey markets in Chicago, New York and Montreal. It’s impossible to argue the Canadiens, whose minus-9 goal differential would be last in the playoff field, deserved to get in on merit.</p>
<p>But guess what? They’re in anyway. And the Penguins have to beat them.</p>
<p>They should. On paper, the Penguins have the brightest stars, a deeper lineup and more playoff experience. Plus, with Mike Sullivan, they probably have the edge behind the bench, though Claude Julien has a Cup on his resume, too.</p>
<p>Still, no one around Pittsburgh should assume the Canadiens will be playoff pushovers, especially in a five-game series that would slice the Penguins’ margin for error.</p>
<p>Much has been made on talk radio and on the blogosphere about Carey Price, the Hart Trophy winner between the pipes. He remains a popular pick for top goalie in NHL player polls and is hockey’s highest-paid netminder. The Canadiens pay him nearly $2 million more than Sidney Crosby makes in a season.</p>
<p>But the 32-year-old goalie has not played at an elite level since 2016-17, when he was a finalist for the Vezina Trophy for the second time in his career.</p>
<p>Over the last three seasons, Price has posted a save percentage of .910 that ranks 26th among qualifying goalies. Matt Murray, who is expected to start in goal for the Penguins in Game 1 of the playoffs, is right behind him at .909.</p>
<p>This season, Price posted a save percentage above .900 in just 56.9% of his starts. That was 35th among qualifying goalies. Murray ranked 44th at 52.6%.</p>
<p>Of course Price still has the ability to steal a series, especially a shortened one. So do another dozen goalies who will strap on the pads for playoff teams.</p>
<p>There are few household names, at least in homes south of the border, skating in front of Price. At 34, Weber is still a strong defender but is three years removed from his last Norris Trophy vote. Jonathan Drouin is a highlight-reel playmaker. Fellow forward Tomas Tatar leads the Canadiens with 61 points.</p>
<p>Despite that lack of elite talent, the Canadiens could pose some problems.</p>
<p>They have four solid lines to roll through, and they are a pretty fast squad. Their wheels had the Penguins on their heels last season, though general manager Jim Rutherford did well in the offseason to restore some team speed.</p>
<p>Under Julien, the Canadiens try to create odd-man chances by flustering their opponents with the forecheck and mucking up the neutral zone. When defending inside their blue line, they pack it in around Price. Pretty standard stuff.</p>
<p>The New York Islanders, another team with a bunch of relative no-names, swept the Penguins out of last year’s playoffs with a similar style. These Canadiens have not consistently been as structurally sound as that Islanders club was last April. They are giving up 3.1 goals per game, which ranks 19th in the NHL.</p>
<p>But more advanced statistics suggest the Canadiens might be the victims of unfavorable puck luck and are a bit better than their record indicates.</p>
<p>This season, they generated 54.6% of the high-danger scoring chances at 5-on-5, per Natural Stat Trick. That percentage, three points higher than the Penguins, is third in the NHL. Their shooting percentage was just 7.5%, though.</p>
<p>Combine that lack of finishing at 5-on-5 with subpar special-teams performance and inconsistent goaltending from Price, and you get a 31-31-9 team.</p>
<p>The Penguins shouldn’t fear the Canadiens. They shouldn’t look past them either.</p>
<p>Much is left to be determined before we actually see the Penguins face off against the Canadiens. Friday’s vote was simply to select a return-to-play format.</p>
<p>ICYMI, the NHLPA’s executive board, made up of a player rep from each of the league’s 31 teams, voted to move forward with a framework of a 24-team playoff that begins with 16 teams playing a five-game play-in round.</p>
<p>Reportedly, 29 of the 31 teams approved the plan. The Penguins, whose player rep is All-Star blue liner Kris Letang, were among those saying yes.</p>
<p>We don’t know when or where the puck would drop on these playoffs and what it will take for the players, coaches, officials and every other essential person in the league’s orbit to feel safe enough for games to go on. There remains a chance the global health crisis could still wipe out the rest of the season.</p>
<p>At least we know what the playoffs will look like if hockey starts back up.</p>
