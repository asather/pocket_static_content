<h1>All administration witnesses — including Fauci — will testify remotely, senator confirms</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All of the witnesses set to participate in <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/09/politics/hahn-redfield-testify-senate-health-committee/index.html" target="_blank">a Senate committee hearing on the novel coronavirus</a>&nbsp;this week, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, will testify remotely, the panel's chairman announced Sunday.</p>
<p>The Tuesday hearing by the Republican-led Senate Health Committee was already going to feature remote testimony from <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/09/politics/robert-redfield-cdc-director-self-quarantine/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Robert Redfield</a>, the head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/09/politics/fda-chief-stephen-hahn-coronavirus-self-quarantine/index.html" target="_blank">Dr. Stephen Hahn</a>, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, both of whom are self-quarantining following <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/10/politics/kevin-hassett-white-house-coronavirus-cnntv/index.html" target="_blank">potential exposures</a> to the virus last week.</p>
<p>The other two witnesses — Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and Dr. Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and Human Services — had been planning to appear in person but will now do so remotely.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The Washington Post&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/seungminkim/status/1259530823029661698?s=20" target="_blank">first reported</a> the change of plans for the two officials.&nbsp;Fauci had said he would wear a face mask and observe social distancing requirements when he answers questions from senators.</p>
<p>The shift comes hours after Fauci told CNN's Jake Tapper <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/09/politics/fauci-modified-quarantine-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">he would begin a "modified quarantine"</a> after a potential exposure to the virus.</p>
<p>"After consulting with Dr. Fauci, and in an abundance of caution for our witnesses, senators, and the staff, all four Administration witnesses will appear by videoconference due to these unusual circumstances," said Chairman Lamar Alexander, a Republican from Tennessee, in a statement.</p>
<p>Alexander said he consulted with White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Saturday about making a change to administration policies. The administration had previously opposed having its officials testify remotely.</p>
<p>The upcoming hearing will give senators on the panel a chance to hear "about what federal, state and local governments are doing to help Americans go back to work and back to school as rapidly and safely as possible," <a href="https://www.help.senate.gov/chair/newsroom/press/alexander-statement-on-administration-witnesses-for-upcoming-hearing-covid-19-safely-getting-back-to-work-and-back-to-school" target="_blank">according to a release from the committee</a><em>.</em></p>
<p>Fauci’s appearance will mark the first time he has been seen by the vast majority of Americans since Trump effectively scrapped his daily nationally televised press conferences.</p>
<p>He admits having what he calls “low risk” contact with Katie Miller, the spokeswoman for Vice President Mike Pence who tested positive on Friday.&nbsp;The CDC and FDA heads also are both staying home due to the same supposedly low-risk contact with Katie Miller.</p>
<p>Fauci, who has tested negative for COVID-19 so far, says he will mostly work from home for the next two weeks and will only go into work at the National Institutes for Health if he is alone in the office.</p>
<p>Katie Miller’s husband, White House aide Stephen Miller, will stay out of the White House until his coronavirus infection status can be determined.</p>
<p>A military officer who works as a valet to President Donald Trump has also tested positive for the deadly virus.</p>
<p>Despite what appears to be a mini-outbreak in the White House, Pence and Trump are taking no new precautions and will not be isolating from aides or one another in any way. Some health experts question if it is wise for the two most powerful men in the nation to have extensive contact with one another during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The White House wants to focus more on reopening the economy and hopes to distract attention from the sharply rising death toll from the still-spreading pandemic, which has already killed 80,000 Americans and counting.</p>
