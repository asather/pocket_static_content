<h1>Donating cookies helps the Girl Scouts and first responders </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the many things the COVID-19 crisis shut down was the spring booth sales of Girl Scout cookies set up at shopping plazas and the like. But Girl Scouts Western Pennsylvania have come up with a sweet little way for people to donate money to help the organization raise funds while its troops treat hard-working first responders to some of the remaining cookies.</p>
<p>The organization is calling the initiative “Hometown Heroes.” Troops in the group’s 27-county area — there are 20,000 girls and 10,000 more adult members — are giving unsold cookies to medical professionals, first responders, nursing home staff and the Army National Guard, “who must continue to work to maintain the safety and health of others.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, GSWPA is inviting people to make donations to the group -— for $5 a pop -— to limit the impact of those lost sales and fund girls’ programs. Donors can think of the donations as paying for a box of cookies, but they aren’t actually buying cookies and they do not get to choose who receives cookies. That’s up to each local troop. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The site’s address is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gswpa.org/en/cookies/hometown-heroes.html" target="_blank">https://www.gswpa.org/en/cookies/hometown-heroes.html</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spokeswoman Stephanie Marshall says that while Scouts did get to deliver cookies to consumers who ordered them, booth sales were shut down two weeks before they were to conclude on March 22. The Hometown Heroes program started on April 1 and does not have a set end date.&nbsp;“It’s starting to get its wings a little bit,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giving helpers cookies is&nbsp;“a very natural opportunity for Girl Scouts who want to be there to help their communities,” she said. “We’re just adding another philanthropic lesson.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, GSWPA is offering online programming for all girls on its Facebook page and archiving those videos on its YouTube channel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We get to lift up the curtain a little bit,” Ms. Marshall says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And here’s a tidbit she was happy to share: Once COVID-19 restrictions are lifted, the region’s Girl Scouts plan to have an&nbsp;“encore” round of booth sales where consumers will be able to purchase more cookies.&nbsp;</p>
