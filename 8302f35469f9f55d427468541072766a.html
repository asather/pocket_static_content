<h1>More frequency, better connectivity cited by Allegheny County residents as goals for NEXTransit campaign</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County residents told Port Authority consultants on Monday they want to see more frequent bus stops and better access to the county’s new job hubs.</p>
<p>Residents were able to offer their opinions Monday to the authority in the first of several public input sessions, all part of its NEXTransit campaign. Monday’s session was broken into five different brainstorming groups for different areas of the county — north, south, east, west and central — where residents’ needs might be different.</p>
<p>For example, residents in the north group said they wanted more frequent and more reliable stops from Port Authority’s bus network, including improved bus shelters; residents in the western group reported wanted an easier transit route to Pittsburgh International Airport and to job opportunities such as at the new Amazon Fulfillment Center in Findlay.</p>
<p>Port Authority is currently working to identify “transit gaps” in its network. These can be areas that either have no transit service or service that is not safe or convenient for riders, a crucial element of one of the themes of the campaign, titled “Where do you want to go?” From there, officials will work to determine how transit in these areas can be improved.</p>
<p>The NEXTransit campaign is a long-range transportation plan that will guide Port Authority transit through 2045, said Port Authority CEO Katharine Kelleman in a pre-recorded opening video.</p>
<p>“A long-range transportation plan is critical to steer long-range investment plans over the next 10, 15 and 20 years,” Ms. Kelleman said, emphasizing the role that public input has on the project.</p>
<p>“Your voices guide how this will work. Again, your voice is going to shape your plan that is going to take us into the future,” she said.</p>
<p>“This is not a bus rerouting plan,” said Janai Smith, managing director at E. Holdings, Inc., a Pittsburgh-based planning and consulting firm working with the Port Authority during the initial group session.</p>
<p>Ms. Smith identified five goals for the NEXTransit plan: to engage the public, to analyze system conditions and performance, to plan for choices that connect people and places, to promote economic vitality, and to prioritize future efforts.</p>
<p>“Living life shouldn’t require the use of a car,” said Justin Miller, a project manager with Michael Baker International, which also is working with Port Authority on the plan. He and Ms. Smith identified several “cluster” areas that NEXTransit is targeting to improve connections to.</p>
<p>“Where do you go most often when you take transit in normal circumstances?” Ms. Smith asked those at the meeting.</p>
<p>Problems lurk even in dense areas such as the Strip District, where transit gaps exist even in close neighborhoods, Mr. Miller said. He said an incline once connected the Strip District to the Hill District. Without those direction connections, taking public transit can take much longer than driving.</p>
<p>This was a topic of discussion for some residents, who reported that they could take two hours taking public transit for a trip that would take 15-20 minutes by car. These comments were noted by the session leaders.</p>
<p>Another option discussed in the western session was light rail expansion from Downtown to the airport. This is seen as a more reliable, straightforward option over buses, albeit a more expensive one.</p>
<p>“Light rail is something to explore. I do know that has been one of the conversations that has been going on for a light rail system to the airport from downtown,” said Peter Quintanilla, an urban design studio leader with Michael Baker. “In terms of cost, how much does it cost versus a dedicated bus service?”</p>
<p>Five more virtual sessions are planned:</p>
<p>• Monday, July 27, at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>• Aug. 6, at 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>• Aug. 25, at 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.</p>
