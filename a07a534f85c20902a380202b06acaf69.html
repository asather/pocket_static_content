<h1>Incumbent Adam Ravenstahl loses Dem nod in House District 20 to newcomer Emily Kinkead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Adam Ravenstahl’s tenure as state representative for much of the city and several communities in the northern suburbs since 2010 will be over at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenstahl’s race for the Democratic nomination in House District 20 with North Side attorney Emily Kinkead was too close to call Tuesday night, but when Allegheny County’s election division finished counting all votes received Wednesday, Ms. Kinkead was ahead by 1,250 votes. Although there still could be some mail-in ballots that arrive before the June 9 deadline, that lead is considered insurmountable.</p>
<p>Ms. Kinkead, 33, said running her first campaign during a pandemic taught her two things that pay off: hard work and&nbsp;“a really great staff.” Since she has no Republican opponent in the fall, she said she’s looking forward to helping other Democrats win and planning what steps the state Legislature can take to improve the minimum wage, sick and family leave policies, and unemployment compensation.</p>
<p>“I think the thing we need to build up is our social safety net, which I think was exposed as lacking in the virus,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenstahl of Ross served in the House since winning a special election in May 2010 and is the brother of former Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. Ms. Kinkead said she spoke with Mr. Ravenstahl Wednesday and thanked him for his service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district includes Pittsburgh’s North Side, Strip District, Polish Hill and Lawrenceville as well as suburbs Avalon, Bellevue, West View and part of Ross.</p>
<p><strong>District 30</strong></p>
<p>Democrat Lissa Geiger Shulman of Hampton will square off with one-term incumbent Republican Lori Mizgorski of Shaler in November.</p>
<p>Ms. Geiger Shulman, who is public policy director for an educational nonprofit,&nbsp;defeated attorney Marco Attisano of O’Hara by 829 votes with some mail-in ballots still to be counted.</p>
<p>“Certainly, we’re starting to look to November,” Ms. Geiger Shulman said.&nbsp;“What I brought is a really clear vision and a solid set of skills in a number of areas.”</p>
<p>The district covers&nbsp;Shaler, O’Hara, Hampton, Fox Chapel and Richland.</p>
