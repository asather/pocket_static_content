<h1>Bethel Park schools to go hybrid Oct. 5</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Bethel Park School District will be going to a hybrid learning model starting Oct. 5, meaning students whose parents choose to send them will be able to go to school in-person for two days per week.</p>
<p>The school board voted 8-1 Tuesday to approve the district’s revised phased school reopening health and safety plan.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Bethel Park began the school year in a fully remote fashion.</p>
<p>Board members Pamela Dobos, Barry Christenson, Connie Ruhl, Darren McGregor, Jim Modrak, Ken Nagel, Russ Spicuzza and Vince Scalzo voted in favor of the plan. Kimberly Turner dissented.</p>
<p>Students will be split into two groups. Group A will attend class in-person on Mondays and Wednesdays, while group B will attend on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>
<p>When not in class in-person, students will be at home learning remotely with their teacher in a synchronous fashion, meaning their teacher will be teaching the students who are in the physical classroom as well as students who are at home at the same time.</p>
<p>Friday will be an asynchronous learning day for students and a “deep clean” day for the schools’ custodial staffs.</p>
<p>Kindergarten students, starting Oct. 26, will be able to report to their school for in-person learning four days per week.</p>
<p>“As we move forward, we are constantly striving to give the best possible education to the students of Bethel Park,” said Janet O’Rourke, assistant superintendent for curriculum and special services.</p>
<p>Ms. O’Rourke stressed “this is a fluid process” and things could change based on Allegheny County’s COVID-19 numbers.</p>
<p>Parents will still have the option of keeping their children at home and having them participate remotely with their teachers or attend the Bethel Park Cyber Academy, which is not taught by Bethel Park teachers.</p>
<p>If Allegheny County’s COVID-19 percent positivity rate, which is currently in the moderate range, falls to the low range, the district hopes to bring students back to traditional five-days-per-week in-person learning by mid-November.</p>
<p>The school district is asking parents to do symptom checks on their children before sending them to school each day, including a temperature check.</p>
<p>“If you have symptoms, stay home,” said Zeb Jansante, assistant superintendent for administration, who added students who are well enough can still participate in their studies remotely, so they do not lose instruction time.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mr. Jansante said children who have traveled to COVID-19 “hotspots” are required to quarantine for 14 days before coming to school in-person.</p>
<p>“We ask you to be honest about travel,” Mr. Jansante said.</p>
<p>All students and school staff will be required to wear masks with minimal exceptions such when eating or drinking. Bus drivers will also be required to wear masks.</p>
<p>Ms. Turner, who voted against the plan, said she was concerned about how the hybrid model will work for the kindergarten through second-grade students. She said the teachers she has talked with “don’t know how they’re going to do this,” referring to teaching students who are both in the classroom and at home.</p>
<p>Interim superintendent Joseph Dimperio said the hybrid plan is “a result of teacher input and agreement.”</p>
<p>He said as far as having kindergarten, first and second-grades in school full-time or four-days-per week is not feasible at this time if the schools want to follow the proper health and safety guidelines as far as social distancing.</p>
<p>The board read several public comments aloud at the meeting.</p>
<p>Parent Candace Bush said she was “pleased” to hear about the new plan from the school district. She said she teaches in a neighboring school district.</p>
<p>“My district is making it work. Children and families cannot continue to struggle with completing assignments without teachers on asynchronous learning days,” Ms. Bush said.</p>
<p>Parent Brian Ripley cautioned the district on reopening too quickly.</p>
<p>“I feel that any risk should be considered before we reopen,” he said. “Who will be held accountable if the unthinkable happens and we lose a child, parent or teacher?” he added.</p>
<p>John Roberts added having teachers to teach both in-person and remote students at the same time is “too big of an ask.”</p>
<p>“I’m having a hard time imagining how this is going to work,” Mr. Roberts said.</p>
<p>Bethel Park is planning to put together a video on the hybrid plans, which will be available on the district’s website, <a href="https://www.bpsd.org/" target="_blank">www.bpsd.org</a>.</p>
