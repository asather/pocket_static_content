<h1>WPIAL football championships might not be at Heinz Field this year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No WPIAL football championships at Heinz Field in November. All fall high school sports will have shortened seasons and will conclude by Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Those scenarios are now very possible due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>That’s what came out of a daylong workshop and meeting of WPIAL board of directors Monday at the Chartiers Valley School District administration building. Part of the workshop was a Zoom video meeting with PIAA director Bob Lombardi, who discussed what protocols the PIAA might release Wednesday for the startup of fall sports. Lombardi told the WPIAL that the PIAA might require all fall sports to be concluded by Thanksgiving. That would possibly require districts to shorten their regular seasons and playoffs.</p>
<p>The WPIAL had hoped to finally vote Monday on a football playoff format for this season. But that vote was tabled because of the PIAA board of directors meeting Wednesday. While a handful of states across the country have moved their fall sports to the spring (Virginia voted Monday for the switch), the PIAA is moving forward with planning fall sports, unless Gov. Tom Wolf puts a stop to them.</p>
<p>The PIAA plans to release protocols to all schools and the media Wednesday. The WPIAL board of directors has planned another meeting Thursday to hopefully vote on a football playoff format. But PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said if the PIAA board votes to shorten the fall sports season, new state playoff brackets won’t necessarily be released Wednesday. That might mean the WPIAL will wait longer to decide its playoff format.</p>
<p>“I think what the [WPIAL] board is looking for are parameters from the PIAA, as far as when schools will qualify or when we have to be done with our playoffs,” WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “We had a recommendation from our football committee [for a WPIAL playoff format], but we just didn’t want to act on it because, literally, in two days we could be turning around and saying this is not what it’s going to be.”</p>
<p>Added Lombardi: “What I believe will be released Wednesday will be the return of competition guidelines for fall sports. … Districts have already been alerted around the state to start thinking about some of these things that we’re looking at, like a shortened playoff scenario. There are a lot of moving parts. That’s why the (PIAA) board convened all the steering committees of all fall sports to get together last week.”</p>
<p>A shortened season would be one of the reasons the WPIAL might not have any championship games at Heinz Field. The other is money. The state is still under Gov. Wolf’s rule of no gatherings of more than 250 people.</p>
<p>“Everyone has a 250-person limit. We’re no different,” Scheuneman said. “We can’t even pay the bill for the lighting at Heinz with 250 people.”</p>
<p>If Heinz Field is not used, it will break a 37-year tradition of staging title games at the home of the Steelers. The WPIAL has played at least two championships at Heinz Field or Three Rivers Stadium every year since 1983. Four games have been held at Three Rivers or Heinz every year since 1986.</p>
<p>When asked if it’s likely there will be no games at Heinz Field this year, Scheuneman said, “Everything is a possibility. I don’t want to say whether or not it’s going to happen. There are a lot of things that factor into it. … Heinz Field is open to having us. It’s just a matter of how it plays into what we’re going to be subject to.”</p>
<p>Even if the PIAA calls for fall sports to end by Thanksgiving, the PIAA would still have state playoffs. Football is the only fall sport in Pennsylvania that goes beyond Thanksgiving. But the PIAA might call for a reduction of state playoff qualifiers in other sports, including soccer and volleyball.</p>
<p>“Everything is still on the table,” Lombardi said. “I think we’re a long way away from a final decision on some things. We’re still cautiously optimistic to get this thing off the ground.”</p>
<p>Added Scheuneman: “We’re all talking about November. We have to get past August first.”</p>
<p><strong>Eligibility rulings</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL reviewed paperwork on 41 transfers and denied eligibility to only Jordan Mayer, who transferred from Ringgold to Thomas Jefferson. Scheuneman said the decision was because Ringgold did not sign off on the transfer.</p>
<p>However, the WPIAL also ruled 12 transfers ineligible for the postseason for the 2020-21 school year because of a new PIAA rule that went into effect two years ago. The rule states a student-athlete is ineligible for the postseason at the new school if the transfer occurs after the start of a sport during an athlete’s sophomore year.</p>
<p>Those ruled ineligible for the postseason are Chase Barney and Christian Williams of Penn Hills; Collin McCorkle of North Allegheny; Jabarhi Cleckly of Aliquippa; Matthew Aulicino and Langston Moses of Winchester Thurston; Luke Brandner of Connellsville; Matt Metrosky of Greensburg Central Catholic; Thomas Burke of Leechburg; Haley Morgan of Mount Pleasant; Samuel Laure of Rochester; and Andre Porter of Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball championships</strong></p>
<p>The WPIAL reached a deal with the Washington Wild Things to continue playing the baseball championships at Wild Things Park for the next four years.</p>
