<h1>National Guard's flyover a show of support for frontline healthcare workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After returning from a dispatch call, paramedic Angela D’Amico arrived just in time to watch planes from the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 171 Air Refueling Wing and 193rd Special Operations Wing fly over Allegheny Health Network’s Forbes Hospital on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Over 70 of AHN Forbes employees from all different professions gathered on the Monroeville hospital’s helicopter pad to await the planes, which were part of an initiative called Operation American Resolve to honor frontline healthcare workers.</p>
<p>At around 12:15 p.m., the two planes —&nbsp;a KC-135 Stratotanker and an EC-130J Commando Solo — peaked through the clouds and <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/photos/2020/05/19/operation-american-resolve-flyover/" target="_blank">flew past the hospital</a> towards Downtown. The view of the planes lasted for only a couple of minutes, but it was enough to spark smiles, waves, cheers and laughter from doctors, nurses, emergency medical service workers and many more.</p>
<p>“We made sure we were back here to appreciate the flyover and to thank them for thanking us,” said Ms. D’Amico, who is part of AHN’s emergency response program.&nbsp;“EMS as a whole is often forgotten about. People don’t really think about us until they need us. Over the past few months, the outreach and support from the community and the Armed Forces has been something I’ve never seen in my 14 years of being an EMS. It’s nice to be thought of and appreciated even during these times.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flyover —&nbsp;provided with no additional cost to taxpayers, according a press release from the National Guard — comes as an extra gift for Ms. D’Amico and her fellow coworkers, as this week is the hospital’s EMS Appreciation Week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Normally, there are cookouts at each of AHN’s facilities to honor its EMS workers. Due to the pandemic, AHN will instead provide boxed lunches for workers.</p>
<p>“They’re still trying to make EMS Week as special as they possibly can,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mark Rubino, president of Forbes Hospital, said the flyover is just another example of the community’s support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s been a tough few months,” he said. “The threat of this virus — they’re real, they’re substantial. And I think to have our staff not hesitate, do what they had to do, just to respond to the needs of the hospital and respond to the needs of the community and be there for the patients they serve– to me it was just truly amazing.</p>
<p>“I’m very proud of the fact that people didn’t call off, they didn’t refuse to come to work,” he said.&nbsp;“And that included the people that serves our meals, cleans the rooms, takes care of them at their bedside. And to have the recognition of all those efforts I think is really something special.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Rubino said his hospital has been&nbsp;“very blessed” that none of his staff have become sick from the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Despite taking care of a substantial amount of patients, our staff have not fell ill to the virus. And I think that says a lot about having the protective equipment that they needed and being trained well,” Mr. Rubino said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Rubino said he wants the community to know that his hospital has appreciated all the cards, food, and financial support. Other investment has come from Highmark and AHN.</p>
<p>“We’ve really been prepared to take on 120 Intensive Care Unit-type beds,” he said.&nbsp;“And really, it takes a lot of investment to gear up and have that ready. Luckily, we didn’t need it, but we have it now. And we know we can get there in the future if that level rises in the future.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few minutes after the Monroeville fly-by, Leanna McKibben watched the planes with her coworkers&nbsp;at UPMC Mercy in Uptown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To think of our service men and women making that kind of show of support for us in the hospital it’s incredibly humbling,” said Ms. McKibben, the hospital’s chief nursing officer and vice president of care services. “We’re so appreciative of the communities support, certainly of this recognition. It’s really heartwarming and just gives you a sense of recognizing we are in this together as a community.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. McKibben said her hospital continues to receive an outpouring of support, which also included a motorcade event by the city and other first responders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re just so thankful to know that folks are thinking about us and the work we’re doing here,” Ms. McKibben said. “Ideally, we don’t want anyone to ultimately need our services. We want everyone to continue to stay safe and healthy, so we’re&nbsp;so appreciative of everyone trying to stay safe out in the community.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. McKibben also has seen support internally among her coworkers, whether it be sharing the best practices of taking care of patients, providing an ear for each other to talk about their day, or even providing childcare.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some of our staff that had college-aged children or teenage children who were able to then help take care of our staff who had younger children. Just those simple mechanisms of making sure we come together as a team,” Ms. McKibben said.&nbsp;</p>
