<h1>Panel explores impact of pandemic, police violence on Black youth</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The closure of schools to stop the spread of COVID-19 created challenges for students across the country.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pair that with the recent killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery and the social unrest that followed, this time has been especially strenuous on Black students.</p>
<p>The impact of the dual crises on Black students was the topic of conversation Thursday during a virtual panel discussion convened by the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Urban Education. The&nbsp;“Teach the Teachers Youth Panel,” moderated by journalist Marc Lamont Hill, was the first in a series of summer education forums organized by the Center for Urban Education.</p>

<p>“What we’re hoping at the end of these conversations is that what we’ll be able to put forth to Pittsburgh and the rest of the country is a mapping of the people and the principles that need to be involved in education change and transformation,”&nbsp;T. Elon Dancy II, director of the Center for Urban Education, said in an interview before the panel discussion.</p>
<p>The six student panelists ranged from the eighth grade into college and had taken leadership roles at their schools and in their communities. They spoke about the hardships they faced during the pandemic shutdown, their relationship with police, and the trauma they deal with in their communities before they even arrive at school.</p>
<p>Aaliyah Brown, a rising senior at Woodland Hills High School, said her school had to raise money to buy Chromebook laptops for students when the shutdown began. Even once all students who needed a device had one, she said, the transition to remote learning was not easy because students had to be ready when their teachers were available.</p>
<p>“You had to make sure you got up every day and timed it ... or else you were going to fall behind, which made it a little harder for people because they were lazy and they didn’t want to do it,” she said.&nbsp;“I also knew that I really wanted to get this done because I didn’t want to be left behind.”</p>
<p>Nekiya Washington-Butler, an upcoming freshman at Pitt, described a distressing experience she had at the age of 9 when police came into her house and pointed a gun at her because they were looking for her father.</p>
<p>She said she was upset at her father for years because he went in and out of jail throughout her childhood. But a good teacher in her senior year of high school had her read a book that helped her understand the reasons behind her father’s recidivism.</p>
<p>“My 12th grade year I had, like, the best history teacher ever, and we read ‘The New Jim Crow,’” she said. “That opened up my eyes completely to how the system works and why it works the way it does and why my dad keeps going back and forth into prison&nbsp;… And I’m like, ‘OK, now I can’t be mad at you, Dad, because I understand.’”</p>
<p>The panelists were also asked to give advice to white teachers who want to be more sensitive to the needs of Black students.</p>
<p>“I think white teachers — all non-Black people — if you’re showing up and being an ally to Black people, it’s not enough for you to say I’m against racism. You have to be anti-racist,” said Chrissy Carter, a 19-year-old queer Black activist and student at Point Park University. “That is something that you do every single day. You have to be doing this actively ... you need to be talking about your internalized racism, you need to be talking about how your implicit biases are impacting your Black students.”</p>
