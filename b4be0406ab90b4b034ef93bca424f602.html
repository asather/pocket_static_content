<h1>In a time of social distancing, social media is spreading false and misleading information about COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mixed signals from the White House, a scattershot response and uncertainty about how dire the COVID-19 pandemic will become are a dangerous brew that has made for a confused and anxious public.</p>
<p>And that, in turn, makes people all the more susceptible to false claims of home cures for the novel coronavirus, untrue plans for an extraordinary government response, baseless pandemic predictions and inflated reports of deaths and infections.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, unlike in previous health crises, social media has an unprecedented dominance and power in society worldwide, enabling the exponential spread of bad information that far too often, and sometimes dangerously, is taken as fact by scared citizens looking for safety. Exacerbating that problem is that older Americans, who are most vulnerable to contracting the disease, also appear to be more susceptible to accepting fake news as fact and sharing false or misleading information with others.&nbsp;A 2019 study showed fake news is more likely to be shared by older Americans on Facebook than younger counterparts</p>
<p>Kate Bird, an expert in “crisis informatics” -- the study of how information flows during crisis events, especially on the internet and social media -- at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington, wrote last week that World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus “noted that we are not just fighting an epidemic, but what he called an infodemic.”</p>
<p>She said that crisis events -- natural disasters, industrial accidents, terrorist attacks, and emergent pandemics -- often create high uncertainty about what is happening, what to do.</p>
<p>“When information is uncertain and anxiety is high, the natural response for people is to try to ‘resolve’ that uncertainty and anxiety” through phone calls and social media in an effort to “make sense” of the situation.</p>
<p>“However, the sensemaking process can also produce rumors, including rumors that turn out to be true and rumors that turn out to be false,” she wrote. “False rumors (or misinformation) are dangerous because they can cause people to make the wrong decisions, including decisions that endanger themselves or others.”</p>
<p>And that is what is happening now, now just in the U.S. but worldwide.</p>
<p>Politico reported late Monday that “as the novel coronavirus spreads across the globe, a wildfire of false and unverified information about the pandemic is following in its wake.</p>
<p>“Well-intentioned but fearful individuals are forwarding messages with misleading or doctored information. Other cases range from warnings over made-up extraordinary measures governments might take to keep people in their homes to false numbers of deaths and the level of preparedness of medical services.”</p>
<p>BuzzFeed reported Monday that “US authorities have been cracking down on fake cures for COVID-19 — including colloidal silver, vitamins, teas, and essential oils. None of these are approved treatments or preventative measures against the disease.”</p>
<p>And the Associated Press reported that on Sunday, “federal officials began confronting what they said was a deliberate effort by a foreign entity to sow fears of a nationwide quarantine amid the virus outbreak.”</p>
<p>Medical experts have debunked and issued warnings about a viral post claiming stomach acid will kill the coronavirus; a Facebook-spread falsity that eating garlic will prevent infection; a YouTube video reporting that a coronavirus cure is inhaling hot air from a hair dryer; erroneous online messages, purporting to be from Unicef, claiming that avoiding ice cream and other cold foods can aid in prevention; and a viral WhatsApp post falsely claiming four people sick with COVID-19 got worse after taking anti-inflammatory drugs.</p>
<p>There also have been false emails purporting to be from HR departments, executives, and health organizations sent by hackers seeking to exploit the virus to access computers in order to steal credentials.</p>
<p>It’s all so overwhelming in a time when many are so overwhelmed. But just as medical experts are recommending common sense, fact-based procedures -- washing hands, social distancing, for example -- in lessening the spread of COVID-19, so too should people practice common sense, fact-based procedures for lessening the social media spread of false or misleading information about the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Among the recommendations of experts:</p>
