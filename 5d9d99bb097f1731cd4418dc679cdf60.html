<h1>Penguins put on a show in Sidney Crosby's return, crushing Wild</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>He’s back. And he’s still pretty good.</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby made his much-awaited return Tuesday, scoring a goal and piling up four points in a 7-3 win over the Minnesota Wild at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>Crosby had not played since Nov. 9 and had sports hernia surgery Nov. 14, exactly two months to the day before the captain returned to the Penguins lineup. It was the fourth time in his career that he missed more than 20 games in a row.</p>
<p>The Penguins posted an 18-6-4 record without Crosby, including their recent road trip that saw them sweep top Western Conference teams in Vegas, Colorado and Arizona. They had a league-high .714 points percentage over that span.</p>
<p>“The team’s played great,” Crosby said after the team’s morning skate, when he declared that he was ready to roll. “And I just want to come in and help.”</p>
<p>They played great again Tuesday. And the superstar center did just that.</p>
<p>Crosby’s line, which had Jared McCann and Dominik Simon on his wings, took the opening faceoff. Needless to say, when public address announcer Ryan Mill belted out the starting lineup, vocal cords were strained inside PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan said those fans are day-to-day with upper-body injuries.</p>
<p>The Penguins got a power-play goal 7:57 into the game. Crosby crossed the blue line with speed, putting penalty-killers on their heels. Three passes later, Evgeni Malkin poked the puck into an open net. It was Crosby’s first point since Oct. 29.</p>
<p>With one of their prettiest passing plays of the season, they pushed their lead to 2-0. McCann sent a pass over to Simon, who returned the favor with a tap-in.</p>
<p>“It was fun to compete,” Crosby said, adding, “And with the way we work, too, just being out there on the bench and seeing it shift after shift. That’s a great way to play. Everyone is involved. I think that’s tough for teams to play against.”</p>
<p>Bryan Rust made it 3-0 in the second after a no-look drop pass from Malkin.</p>
<p>“Out of this world,” said Rust, who on Tuesday set single-season career highs with 19 goals and 40 points. “I mean, he somehow sees me following up the play. He draws in both defenders, spins around and puts it right on my tape.”</p>
<p>Moments later, Crosby tallied another assist when the Penguins got their second power-play goal. Malkin, who had three points, was credited with that one.</p>
<p>Of course, Crosby, who has always had a flair for the dramatic, got one himself.</p>
<p>In the third period, he tried to send a pass across the crease. It hit Wild blue-liner Matt Dumba’s stick and changed course through Devan Dubnyk’s legs.</p>
<p>Before the memorable night was over, Crosby swooped behind the net with Ryan Donato on his tail. He hit the brakes, banked the puck off the back of the net and turned the other way. He spotted Simon, who wasn’t missing that.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have to call for it. He found me there with a really nice pass,” said Simon, not the most feared finisher. “It wasn’t too hard for me to put it in.”</p>
<p>It was the 33rd four-point night of Crosby’s career, tops among active players.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to get surprised by what Sid accomplishes on the ice,” Sullivan said after their fourth straight win. “When you watch what he’s been able to do, and certainly in my time here, it’s just hard to get surprised. He’s just so capable.”</p>
<p>Crosby getting another point on that play was nice. But it was also encouraging, given how tricky the recovery process after sports hernia surgery can be, that he shielded the puck as he stopped on a dime before darting the other way.</p>
<p>He began skating in an individual setting about five weeks ago. His first practice with the team was Jan. 1. He’s been ramping up his participation ever since.</p>
<p>The Penguins brought him along on their recent road trip. During their week out west, Crosby got in three on-ice workouts, one in a team setting. That practice Saturday in Arizona was his first without contact restrictions. Crosby, after some consideration, was ruled out for Sunday’s 4-3 shootout win in Arizona.</p>
<p>“He’s had a couple of really strong practices. So we knew he was real close,” Sullivan said. “He works so hard. His fitness level is so good. It’s pretty difficult to simulate the intensity of NHL game situations. I’m sure that was an adjustment for him. But it sure didn’t appear to be an adjustment for him to the rest of us.”</p>
<p>He logged just under 18 minutes before calling it a night with the Penguins up big. Heck, Alex Galchenyuk even added his fifth goal of the season late.</p>
<p>“Still a couple shifts, I felt, that were pretty tough,” Crosby said. “As far as getting a rhythm, it helps to get on the power play and get your feet under you a bit.”</p>
<p>Tristan Jarry, starting his second straight game, made 26 saves in the win.</p>
<p>The Penguins will visit Boston on Thursday, then Detroit the following day.</p>
