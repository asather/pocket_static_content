<h1>Mayor Peduto to create permanent LGBT Commission</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said Tuesday that he will ask&nbsp;City Council to form a permanent commission to advise the city on gay, lesbian and other related issues.</p>
<p>The commission will replace the LGBTQIA+ Advisory Council that the mayor created in 2016.</p>
<p>The mayor’s office said the new commission would have 11 members, meet monthly and provide policy recommendations to city government on ways to address challenges that the Pittsburgh LGBTQIA+ community faces.</p>
<p>The group’s acronym stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer or questioning, intersex and asexual. The “+” symbol typically signals further inclusiveness.</p>
<p>“The City of Pittsburgh has long been a leader in protecting and preserving LGBTQIA+ rights, but our city, state and country still have a long way to go. Placing this commission into City Code will re-emphasize our commitment to fighting for the human rights deserved by all,” Mr. Peduto said.</p>
<p>The commission’s role would include regularly engaging with Pittsburgh’s LGBTQIA+ community and developing outreach and advocacy programming.</p>
<p>The group would also assist in the creation of cultural competency training opportunities for city departments.</p>
<p>If the commission is approved by the council, the mayor will ask residents who are interested in joining the commission to contact his office.</p>
