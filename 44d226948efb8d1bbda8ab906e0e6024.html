<h1>Brian O'Neill: Defund the police? No. Reform? Yes. </h1>

<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/15/Pittsburgh-groups-demands-police-reform/stories/202006150065" target="_blank">“Defund the police”</a>&nbsp;might be the worst marketing slogan since&nbsp;“New Coke,” but that doesn’t mean the current makeup and practices of policing are the&nbsp;best way&nbsp;“to protect and serve.”</p>
<p>Some of what police cover now are nonemergencies having to do with homelessness and drug addiction, and at least some of that work would be better handled by social workers. “Defund the police” is no way to begin that conversation. Most people take that to mean stopping funding altogether. It doesn’t matter if that’s a mischaracterization. It scares the hell out of a lot of good people.</p>
<p>They’re scared because, while every country can produce lunatics, sociopaths and garden-variety crooks, ours remains intent on ensuring they have easy access to high-powered weaponry. The<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2019/02/10/Brian-O-Neill-Slavery-root-of-the-Second-Amendment/stories/201902100107" target="_blank">&nbsp;“well regulated” part of the Second Amendment</a> has been said not to mean what most think it means, and here we are.</p>
<p>If an armed scoundrel tries breaking into my house and I call 911 looking for help, I need armed cops to pull up. To take only the most prominent example, Pittsburghers haven’t forgotten the bravery of the police,&nbsp;three of whom were shot and three others injured, while capturing the gunman who <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">killed 11 people</a>&nbsp;at the Tree of Life Synagogue on Oct. 27, 2018.</p>
<p>More than half of the city’s budget goes into public safety, and Mayor Bill Peduto has said he’s not looking to cut funding for law enforcement. He announced last week the&nbsp;formation of a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/17/Pittsburgh-mayor-Bill-Peduto-names-police-reform-task-force-police-social-justice/stories/202006170107" target="_blank">community task force</a> that will deliver recommendations for police reform by the fall, and also wants state law changed so cities can quickly release footage from police body cameras. Councilman Ricky Burgess earlier introduced&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/06/09/Pittsburgh-City-Council-discussion-police-reform-black-lives-matter-protests-burgess/stories/202006090093" target="_blank">four reform bills</a>, including one to move $250,000 in police salaries to a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/01/08/Anti-gun-violence-coordinator-Burgess-shootings-murders/stories/201901080124" target="_blank">gun-violence prevention fund</a>.</p>
<p>I’d rather see that go into social services, and an experience I had last November might explain why: One morning, I looked out my bedroom window and saw a man in a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2019/11/28/Commentary-The-dilemma-of-a-broken-wheelchair-on-a-rainy-morning/stories/201911280030" target="_blank">broken wheelchair</a>&nbsp;in the rain.</p>
<p>A good Samaritan had gotten out of his Jeep to aid the man and, when I got out there, we helped Keith Adams out of his mechanized chair into the Jeep. With no good way for two old men to lift the 350-pound chair into the Jeep, we called 911 and waited in the vestibule of my row house. And waited. And called again.</p>
<p>After about 35 minutes, a police vehicle pulled over a few houses down my North Side street. I hustled off my stoop toward the officer but the Samaritan, a black man in his 60s, said quietly to my partner,&nbsp;“Can’t approach the police car. Wait till he gets out of the car.”</p>
<p>That never occurred to me, and we’re about the same age living in the same city.</p>
<p>The Zone 1 officer said ambulances don’t come for nonemergencies like ours, but he had no shot at hefting the wheelchair either. The Samaritan had to leave so we got Mr. Adams back in his chair, and my partner and I tag-teamed with an umbrella over him while the officer drove off for Zone 2 in the Hill District. That’s where the department’s only wheelchair van is kept. It arrived with another officer. He and the first one got Mr. Adams in the van, driving off an hour and 45 minutes after my 911 call.</p>
<p>The city deploys the wheelchair van about 43 times a year. I suggested then that such 911 calls should go directly to Zone 2, but I’d also suggest that police officers no longer do this particular work. They don’t seem to like the chore and are less than enthusiastic about doing it. That wasn’t my first chair rodeo.</p>
<p>At least five years ago, I came upon another man whose chair had broken down. It was a hot summer afternoon on Brighton Road, 50 yards or more south of its corner with North Avenue, where the man lived in a senior high-rise. There was a bit of hill and I couldn’t move the chair after a while, so I called 911.</p>
<p>An officer came and we were struggling with the chair when another police vehicle pulled up with two officers. Great, I thought, more help. But the officer on the passenger side stayed in the car and took a photo of the younger officer pushing the chair, talking to him but never acknowledging me or the man in the chair. Then the vehicle drove off.</p>
<p>I got the impression they thought it was funny. Protecting and serving, it wasn’t.</p>
<p>A lot of what police officers are called to do they don’t want to do, and so don’t do it well. Let’s augment the force with people who do.</p>
