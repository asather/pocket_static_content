<h1>Mt. Lebanon zoning plan may include town homes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Commissioners in Mt. Lebanon are mulling the addition of town homes as a permitted use in the municipality’s R7 zoning district.</p>
<p>At a public hearing March 10, Steven Victor, of Victor Wetzel Associates, presented information to the board and residents regarding a proposed amendment to Mt. Lebanon’s zoning ordinance.</p>
<p>In Mt. Lebanon, only one section is zoned R7 — for high-density, high-rise, multifamily and limited commercial use. That area comprises about three blocks off the western side of Washington Road near Kenmont and Lavina avenues.</p>
<p>The proposed amendment would add town homes, built on a minimum lot width of 75 feet and a maximum building height of 35 feet.</p>
<p>The board will vote on the proposal at an upcoming meeting.</p>
<p>In other matters, commissioners approved a contract with T.A. Robinson Asphalt Paving Inc., of Pittsburgh, for $233,270 for the reconfiguration of the municipality’s Overlook parking lot on Overlook Drive.</p>
<p>The project, which will add eight spaces to the lot, will also include the addition of Americans with Disabilities Act parking stalls as well as repaving of the lot and installation of storm drainage and landscaping. The project will also entail paving and drainage improvements to the adjacent road, Volta Way.</p>
<p>Construction on the lot will begin sometime this summer after school is out since the lot is near Lincoln Elementary.</p>
