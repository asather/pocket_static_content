<h1>Pitt picks up two for 2021 class, including Central Valley safety</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt’s 2021 recruiting efforts have garnered attention for making strides in areas of the country rarely represented on the roster.</p>
<p>The Panthers have four verbal commits from the state of Virginia, with three scholarship players from Old Dominion on the 2020 team. On May 10, two Detroit natives committed without an offensive or defensive player from Michigan in the program. They have commits from Philadelphia, Austin, Texas, and small town Georgia.</p>
<p>But as Pitt’s class continued to grow (and rise up national recruiting rankings), West Mifflin pass-rusher Nahki Johnson, who committed last June, remained the only WPIAL player of the bunch. That changed Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stephon Hall, a Central Valley safety, verbally committed to the Panthers, becoming the 15th member of Pat Narduzzi’s 2021 class. And hours later, a 16th commit joined the class when Khalil Anderson, a three-star cornerback from Atlanta, committed via Twitter.</p>
<p>Anderson, a 5-foot-11, 175-pound prospect, joins linebacker Preston Lavant as Georgia natives in this class. Should they ultimately sign with the Panthers, they'll be the fourth and fifth Peach State players to do so in the last two years. Thanks to defensive backs coach Archie Collins, Pitt beat 15 other programs, including Michigan State and Kansas State, for Anderson's commitment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hall — a 6-foot-2, 180-pound safety — chose the Panthers over 17 other programs, including Boston College, Syracuse, Wake Forest and West Virginia.</p>
<p>“He’s a lengthy safety. I think that’s what attracted everyone from the college game to him,” Central Valley head coach Mark Lyons said of Hall. “He’s physical. You can see when he arrives at the ball. Not too many guys are running out of his tackles.</p>
<p>“I think his ability to play safety with great angles and understanding angles is probably a hidden forte. Everyone thinks safeties are ball hawking ... but you have to be complete in your support of the run game. And Steph has done that.”</p>
<p>That’s apparent in his stats alone. Hall tallied 103 tackles and three interceptions in 16 games last year, helping Central Valley to a 14-2 record in his junior campaign.</p>
<p>Lyons said Hall was “extremely important” to Central Valley’s WPIAL Class 3A title win over Aliquippa, combining on a game-clinching tackle in overtime. He was also integral to the Warriors’ push to the PIAA finals, where they lost to Wyoming Area, 21-14, in December of last year.</p>
<p>Lyons called Hall “the epitome of lead by example,” a quiet, confident and, perhaps most importantly, reliable kid. “As games got bigger, his game got bigger,” Lyons added. “He elevated himself on the biggest stages. To me, that’s impressive.”</p>
<p>After trying to repeat as WPIAL Class 3A champs in 2020, assuming he stays committed, Hall will follow in the footsteps of former Central Valley standout Jordan Whitehead and five other WPIAL defensive backs — Dane Jackson, Damar Hamlin, Paris Ford, Therran Coleman and Bricen Garner — in joining Pitt.</p>
<p>Lyons said he believes Hall will, much like Whitehead, Hamlin and Ford, “fit the style of what Pitt asks of their safeties.”</p>
<p>“Kids need to understand how their game fits at the collegiate level. And I think Steph recognizes that,” Lyons said. “He’s got a lot of confidence in himself that he can do the things that he’s asked. He expects a lot out of himself.”</p>
