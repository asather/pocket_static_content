<h1>Steelers' draft picks continue to shine in training camp</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin called this week of training camp a “lean-in week.” Translation: It’s nut-cutting time for some young players if they want to have roles when the regular season begins in three weeks.</p>
<p>“If guys are going to make a move, now is the time,” Tomlin said Monday afternoon following practice at Heinz Field. “They got acclimated to the environment, how we go about our business. It’s really time for the talents to start to show for there to be fluidity in play. Those are some of the things we’re looking for. We’re thoughtfully constructing some of that in competition. We’re asking for specific matchups. We want to see who can compete against varsity-like guys.”</p>
<p>On Monday afternoon, two rookies continued to make a strong push for playing time. Receiver Chase Claypool and outside linebacker Alex Highsmith — the top two Steelers draft choices — were among the players Tomlin wanted to get a longer look at in practice Monday, and they did not disappoint.</p>
<p>“To be succinct, they’re proving they belong,” Tomlin said. “Both guys have distinguished themselves against JV competition over the course of camp. They’ve gotten more opportunities against known veteran guys. And really, they don’t appear to be out of place in that company. So far, so good.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>Right guard David DeCastro returned to practice after missing last week with an undisclosed injury. Right tackle Chuks Okorafor, who is batting for the starting right tackle job, missed with a groin injury. Tomlin said he is “day-to-day.” Defensive lineman Chris Wormley and running backs Wendell Smallwood missed with shoulder injuries.</p>
<p>Offensive lineman Derwin Gray (knee) and receiver Anthony Johnson (knee) returned after their injuries, as did outside linebacker Bud Dupree (undisclosed injury).</p>
<p>Quarterback Ben Roehtlisberger and receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster were given the day off.</p>
<p>“It provides opportunities for others,” Tomlin said. “That’s what we focus on — the younger guys that get an opportunity to ascend within the competition and get a chance to compete against veteran players and show their mettle.”</p>
