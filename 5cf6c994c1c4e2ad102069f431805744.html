<h1>Oscar Marin on the state of Pirates pitching: Part II, bullpen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are two ways of looking at the Pirates bullpen for pitching coach Oscar Marin.</p>
<p>On one hand, it has been decimated. Because of suspension (Edgar Santana) or injury, the Pirates have missed many of their best back-end options.</p>
<p>The constant need to plug holes has been frustrating, but it also has created opportunity for others. Surprisingly, it has yielded better year-over-year results; after finishing 23rd with a 4.91 ERA in 2019, Pirates relievers are 19th with a 4.72 ERA in 2020.</p>
<p>“That’s been a big part of the season, especially because of maybe not having the bullpen we thought we were going to have earlier on and some other guys stepping up,” Marin said. “It’s been a bunch of teaching points, and because of those teaching points, these guys are getting better each time out.”</p>
<p>As the second part of this series on Pirates pitching, here’s a look at some important developments in the bullpen.</p>
<p><strong>Clarity matters</strong></p>
<p>The biggest bright spot might be Geoff Hartlieb, who began Sunday’s game having stranded 16 of 18 inherited runners. The right-handed sinkerballer has become an excellent fireman, routinely extracting the Pirates from jams.</p>
<p>Marin and bullpen coach Justin Meccage sat down with Hartlieb prior to this season and convinced him to use his sinker exclusively, pairing it with his slider and ditching his four-seam fastball.</p>
<p>“He got to the big leagues with a heavy, power sinker,” Marin said. “Just showing him different ways of using it, different locations where he was getting beat and also identifying what we wanted to do with his slider.”</p>
<p>Marin and Meccage also worked with Hartlieb on his arm slot and body position while throwing the sinker and slider, getting the two pitches to look similarly deceptive; it’s part of a process in pitching called tunneling.</p>
<p>“He’s really bought into it,” Marin said.</p>
<p>Hartlieb has cut his ERA from 9.00 to 2.20, while his ground-ball rate has jumped from 46.5% in 2019 to 57.1% this season. Opponents are hitting just .211 off him versus .340 last summer.</p>
<p>“I think clarity for him of what makes him good has been the biggest difference-maker,” Marin said.</p>
<p><strong>Maximizing strengths</strong></p>
<p>Few observers had Sam Howard pegged to make 14 appearances in a 162-game season let alone 14 so far in a shortened one. But the left-hander has been one of the Pirates’ more reliable options.</p>
<p>He has a 2.45 ERA with 18 strikeouts against just seven walks in 14 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Especially important for Howard has been his slider, which he throws 62.8% of the time. Opponents are hitting just .154 and slugging .269 off the pitch, while Howard is generating a 41.7% whiff rate with it.</p>
<p>“Throwing the breaking ball a lot more, that's been [Howard’s] development,” Marin said with a laugh. “One of the things we try to do with our guys, right from the beginning, you want to maximize somebody's strength, even if they don't know they have it.</p>
<p>“[The slider] is really good, and when he does throw his fastball, it plays up.”</p>
<p><strong>Buying in</strong></p>
<p>Dovydas Neverauskas probably isn’t the Pirates pitcher many think of when talking about development and key steps forward for the bullpen, but he has strung together four consecutive scoreless appearances.</p>
<p>Marin said a key point for Neverauskas has been slowing down his delivery, which has him more in sync.</p>
<p>The right-hander from Lithuania is also throwing his curveball about 10% more this season.</p>
<p>“He’s been doing a good job of buying into using more than just his fastball,” Marin said. “That’s helped him.”</p>
<p><strong>Coming soon</strong></p>
<p>It sounds like it won’t be long before we see hard-throwing relief prospect Blake Cederlind.</p>
<p>Cederlind was recently with the Pirates on their taxi squad, and Marin watched him throw a couple times, including a live batting practice session.</p>
<p>Marin was obviously impressed.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to see him at some point and see what he's going to do against [big league] competition,” Marin said. "He looked pretty crisp when we saw him in the live BP."</p>
<p><strong>Crick is fine</strong></p>
<p>Marin insists he’s not worried about Kyle Crick, whose average fastball velocity is down about 4 mph from last year, though the Pirates don’t know exactly why Crick isn’t throwing as hard as he used to.</p>
<p>The setup man missed time this season with a right lat strain, although they’re not convinced that’s the reason.</p>
<p>“Maybe it's the layoff, maybe it's the small injury he came back from, we don't really know,” Marin said. “I think it will [come back]. The spin on the slider is still there. The spin on his four-seam is relatively close to what it has been before.</p>
<p>Marin is mostly right. Crick’s four-seamer has had a spin rate of 2,368 rpm each of the past two years, while the spin rate on his slider — less concerning velocity-wise — has dropped from 3,246 rpm in 2019 to 3,075 this season.</p>
<p><strong>Check the video</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates have had to bring plenty of guys up from Altoona, where they’ve struggled to recreate actual games due to logistical issues.</p>
<p>The good news is that Marin said they’re keeping numbers on guys and do not feel as though they’re losing out on valuable development time.</p>
<p>“Every live BP, every side that they’re doing on the mound, we get to see on video,” Marin said. “It’s been awesome doing that. That’s why it’s been better for the guys that come over Altoona to transition to what we’re doing here.</p>
<p>“The constant communication within that group is probably the most beneficial for those young guys, as well.”</p>
