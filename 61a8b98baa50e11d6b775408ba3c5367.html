<h1>'Don't pick on us,' Punxsutawney Phil's ex-handler says after PETA calls for animatronic replacement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a video posted to The Groundhog Club’s Facebook page Thursday, members of the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle addressed PETA’s statement made earlier this week that the live woodchuck should retire and an animatronic one be used instead.</p>
<p>Groundhog Club President Bill Deely and co-handlers A.J. Dereume and John Griffiths can be seen in the video holding the groundhog who plays Punxsutawney Phil — a weather-forecasting marmot whose fear of his own shadow supposedly leads to dubious predictions.&nbsp;Mr. Griffiths said despite PETA’s request, “excitement is mounting” for this weekend’s Groundhog Day occasion at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, Pa.</p>
<p>“We’ve had some questions about changing things to animatronic, and we actually took some old bicycle parts, some innards out of an old Pac Man game, and this is what we came up with,” Mr. Griffiths said sarcastically as the club president began making robotic hand movements.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Lottery’s spokesgroundhog, Gus, who claims to be the “second most famous groundhog” in the state as a nod to Phil, was formerly animatronic himself. He is now a fun-loving, clothes-wearing personality who is still popular, although online-only.</p>
<p>A statement released by PETA just a few days ahead of Groundhog Day on Tuesday, suggested the Punxsutawney Groundhog Club release its woodchucks to a “reputable sanctuary” and use a fake groundhog that would predict weather using artificial intelligence.&nbsp;PETA president Ingrid Newkirk said Phil’s retirement was&nbsp;“long overdue,” specifying that the excitement of the special day may be too much for the animal.</p>
<p>But PETA officials may not be aware of just how good Phil has it, according to Ron Ploucha, retired co-handler&nbsp;and “Stump Warden” of the Groundhog Club’s Inner Circle. He said PETA’s goal is honorable, but added, “don’t pick on us.”</p>
<p>“They’ve never seen how well Phil is taken care of,” Mr. Ploucha said. “We take better care of Phil than some people take care of their pets. He has to go to the vet once a year and there are other protocols in place to ensure he’s cared for.”</p>
<p>The marmot lives in a habitat-regulated zoo that is connected to the Punxsutawney Memorial Library&nbsp;when he’s not participating in Groundhog Day festivities, or traveling about as a celebrity guest across the state.</p>
<p>The day begins early Sunday at Gobbler’s Knob in Punxsutawney, and is comprised of cameras and people from all over who have come to celebrate and witness the occasion. Cheryl Ploucha, a volunteer at the Groundhog Club and wife of Mr. Ploucha, said Friday that the special day “breathes the town to life.” People coming from South Carolina, Mexico and Louisiana just for the occasion are just a few examples, she said.&nbsp;Mr. Ploucha added that many foreigners attend.</p>
<p>“People are booking hotels that are about an hour, to an hour and a half away,” Mrs. Plaucha said. “A lot of people who booked last year booked ahead for this year. Some people even rent out rooms in their houses because there are people who will need places to stay.”</p>
<p>People arrive as early as 3 a.m. on Feb. 2, although space for parking quickly runs out. Shuttles are available to take people to and from their parking spots at Gobbler’s Knob.&nbsp;The furry celebrity will be pulled from his stump shortly after 7 a.m., and will unveil weather predictions in “groundhogese,” a language interpreted only by handlers.</p>
<p>Despite skepticism over Phil’s predictions due to many wrong forecasts in the past, “he has never ever been wrong,” Mr. Ploucha said.</p>
<p>“There have been times when the handler has made mistakes by misunderstanding Phil’s interpretation,” he said.&nbsp;“One year was really bad when he predicted spring and we were hit hard with snow.”</p>
<p>“We love Punxsutawney Phil,” said Mary Anne Jacobson, head clerk of Punxsutawney Phil’s Official Souvenir Shop. “Our whole store is all Phil souvenirs.”</p>
<p>The woodchuck is cared for&nbsp;“better than some people’s children,” Ms. Jacobson said.</p>
<p>Mr. Ploucha, whose “Stump Warden” title alludes to one who “protects,” said he retired from the handling job because of its high demand. It’s a lot of work to care for Phil, he said.</p>
<p>“I gave up the handling job because it’s a job,” Mr. Ploucha said. “It’s 365 days a year because Phil is in high demand. It takes a lot of time. I had fun, but I thought it was time to pass the title along.”</p>
<p>The annual occasion has many events and tourist attractions in the area for people to engage. Last year, the group added an event called “Hogspitality,” where people gather under a tent for food and drinks.&nbsp;For the last 10-15 years, Gobbler’s Knob maintained a no-alcohol policy, Ms. Ploucha said.</p>
