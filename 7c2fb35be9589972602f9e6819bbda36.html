<h1>Wall Street faces more turmoil as stocks waver</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stocks fell again Thursday, even as policymakers in the United States and Europe took more steps to offset the sharp decline gripping their economies.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 fell more than 3% in early trading, and shares in Europe and Asia were also lower.</p>
<p>The losses followed a steep drop across financial markets Wednesday and came as investors faced fresh evidence of the downturn.</p>
<p>In the United States, the number of workers filing first-time claims for unemployment insurance surged, government data released Thursday showed. Those figures don’t reflect the sharp cutbacks that have taken place in the past few days as companies quickly scale down operations as efforts to contain the coronavirus keep consumers at home and force factories to close.</p>
<p>Overnight, the European Central Bank unveiled a huge bond-buying program aimed at preventing economic calamity, and the Fed presented a plan to support money market funds, which are threatened when there is a rush for cash. U.S. officials also neared passage of stimulus efforts to keep the economy running.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that the White House’s economic relief plan includes sending checks to the public of $1,000 for every U.S. adult and $500 per child within three weeks. If the crisis continues, the plan would be to send checks of the same amounts again in May.</p>
<p>But news of efforts to bolster the economy has been matched by a sharp escalation in the number of coronavirus cases in Europe and the United States, and fresh evidence of the impact on businesses. On Thursday, Ford Motor said that it would suspend its dividend payment and draw down about $15 billion from two lines of credit to help offset the impact of coronavirus-related production shutdowns, becoming just the latest company to take such measures in order to cushion itself.</p>
<p>Ford’s shares fell by more than 7% on Thursday.</p>
<p>The waves of selling in the past month have left the Dow Jones industrial average back where it stood in January 2017, as President Donald Trump took office — erasing the gains that had become one of his primary measures of success in the White House.</p>
<p>Economists in recent days have made increasingly dire predictions about the likely damage to the job market, with many predicting that the unemployment rate will quickly surpass the 10% level it hit in the worst of the last recession.</p>
<p>“This is a body blow to the economy unlike anything we’ve experienced in recent memory,” said Patrick Anderson, an economist in East Lansing, Michigan. “Even the Great Recession did not include shuttering of businesses by government order at the same time that people were being told to say home and distance themselves.”</p>
<p><strong>Worker Claims for Unemployment Benefits Surged Last Week</strong></p>
<p>Layoffs rose sharply last week as the effects of the coronavirus pandemic began to ripple through the economy. The worst is yet to come.</p>
<p>Some 281,000 Americans filed first-time claims for unemployment insurance, up by 33% from 211,000 the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. On a percentage basis, the increase was among the largest one-week spikes on record.</p>
<p>The Labor Department said the increase was “clearly attributable to impacts from the COVID-19 virus” and noted that many states reported a rise in jobless claims from workers in food services, accommodation and travel.</p>
<p>Still, the data released Thursday was for claims filed from March 8-14, before the outbreak began to shut down restaurants, bars and retail stores in much of the country. The next report, which will reflect the first wave of closings, will almost certainly be much worse. Individual states from California to Rhode Island have released their own data showing enormous spikes in jobless claims; on Monday, the website to apply for benefits in New York state crashed amid the crush of inquiries.</p>
