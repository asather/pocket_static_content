<h1>Allegheny County adopts $15 demolition fee</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A fee will now be imposed on real estate transactions in Allegheny County to help fund the demolition of derelict buildings.</p>
<p>The state-enabled legislation to impose a $15 fee on all new or transferred mortgage and deed recording transactions became effective immediately upon county council’s unanimous vote of approval Tuesday.</p>
<p>The county estimates that the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/02/17/Allegheny-County-fee-raise-money-demolition-tear-down-blighted-properties-Mon-Valley/stories/202002130148" target="_blank">fee could raise roughly $2 million a year</a> to demolish vacant and run-down properties.</p>
<p>Adoption at the county level is enabled by Pennsylvania’s Act 152, effective January 2017, which allowed counties a 10-year window to collect the special demolition fee.</p>
<p>As of August, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2019/08/05/Demolition-blight-abandoned-houses-Allegheny-county-Westmoreland-Cambria-Lawrence-Rich-Fitzgerald/stories/201908010142" target="_blank">19 counties had passed enabling legislation to collect the fee</a>. Armstrong, Beaver, Butler, Fayette and Westmoreland counties were among them.</p>
<p>The opportunity to collect the money expires in 2027.</p>
