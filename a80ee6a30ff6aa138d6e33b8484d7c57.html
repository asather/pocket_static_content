<h1>PA CWD plan wins support of deer management group</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A national wildlife management organization has endorsed Pennsylvania’s plans to slow the spread of chronic wasting disease.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://nationaldeeralliance.com/" target="_blank">National Deer Alliance</a>, a self-described nonprofit “guardian of wild deer conservation,” recently announced its support for the state Game Commission’s draft <a href="https://www.pgc.pa.gov/Wildlife/Wildlife-RelatedDiseases/Documents/Draft%20CWD%20Response%20Plan.pdf" target="_blank">Chronic Wasting Disease Response Plan</a>.</p>
<p>Written to replace current CWD protocols, the draft plan aims to slow the disease’s spread by aggressively reducing deer populations in infected areas, creating buffer zones that are relatively CWD-free.</p>
<p>In addition to imposing mandatory deer-feeding bans in CWD control units, the plan would encourage hunter participation through increased antlerless permit allocations, expanded hunting seasons, removal of antler-point restrictions, mandatory harvest sampling and harvest incentive programs.</p>
<p>The plan’s most controversial provision includes “targeted removal,” the use of paid shooters to exterminate deer in some infected areas. A public comment period ended weeks ago. Game Commissioners are expected to soon put the plan to a vote.</p>

<p>The National Deer Alliance is active in CWD abatement programs threatening whitetail and mule deer populations throughout the American West and Midwest. Nick Pinizzotto, president and CEO, said Pennsylvania has shown leadership in its fight against chronic wasting disease.</p>
<p>“We appreciate the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s hard work on this issue, and we fully support the agency’s efforts to create the draft CWD Response Plan, which relies heavily on hunters to help slow the spread of the disease,” he said in a statement. “I can’t think of a less popular issue with sportsmen, and it would be easy to simply rely on hope that CWD goes away. The agency is hitting the disease head-on, and we appreciate that level of leadership.”</p>
<p>Chronic wasting disease infects wild and captive deer, elk and moose and is always fatal. It has been confirmed in 26 states and three Canadian provinces. First confirmed in south central Pennsylvania in 2012, CWD has spread. A Disease Management Area was expanded as far west as Westmoreland County this year. Game Commission data suggests that if no changes are made, parts of Pennsylvania could eventually reach a 30% CWD prevalence rate.</p>
<p>The NDA endorsement stated that the group’s leadership believes the Pennsylvania Game Commission’s draft CWD Response Plan is “based on the best available science.”</p>
<p><strong>Deer management</strong></p>
<p>Another nationwide nonprofit conservation group is expanding its presence in Pennsylvania. The <a href="https://www.qdma.com/" target="_blank">Quality Deer Management Association</a>, which endorses science-based wildlife management strategies and hunter ethics, has scheduled an educational and fundraising banquet in Hampton on March 28. Dinner, games, a silent auction and gun raffle will be held at Hampton Banquet Hall, 5416 Route 8,&nbsp; starting at 5 p.m. Information: <a href="https://www.qdma.com/" target="_blank">qdma.com</a>&nbsp;or 724-968-6755.</p>
<p><strong>School of fishing</strong></p>
<p>During the 50th BassMaster Classic last week in Birmingham, Ala., Austin Aikins, an 18-year-old senior at Oakland’s Central High School, signed a full athletic and academic scholarship with Bethel University’s bass fishing team. The college in St. Paul, Minn., was the first to recognize bass fishing as an organized sport and is a two-time winner of the scholastic bass fishing national championship.</p>
