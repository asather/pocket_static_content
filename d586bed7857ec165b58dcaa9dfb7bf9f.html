<h1>Wilkinsburg mass shooting jury seeks details about witness testimony</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jurors on Wednesday asked to examine testimony by the detective whose initial observations helped lead police to the man on trial for multiple murders in the 2016 Wilkinsburg mass shooting.</p>
<p>Entering its second day of deliberations, the panel asked the judge presiding over the trial of Cheron Shelton for a copy of a defense document that was used to cross-examine Wilkinsburg Detective Michael Adams on the first day of testimony.</p>
<p>Detective Adams testified Feb. 3 that as he responded to the March 9, 2016, shooting at 1304 Franklin Ave., he came across a man getting into a white Lincoln and made a mental note of the license plate number.&nbsp;That number came back to a car registered to Shelton’s mother and one of his sisters.</p>
<p>Prosecutors claim that Shelton drove the distinctive vehicle to and from the shooting, which left five adults and an unborn child dead and three people wounded.</p>
<p>Randall McKinney, one of Shelton’s lawyers, attacked the detective’s story and tried to raise doubts about his testimony, telling the jury in his closing argument that his account “makes absolutely no sense.”</p>
<p>During more than an hour on the witness stand, Detective Adams told the jury that he pulled up alongside the vehicle and looked at the driver for about five seconds. He later identified the driver as Shelton.</p>
<p>But during a pre-trial hearing on July 9, 2018, the detective testified that he peered at the man for about a minute, and Mr. McKinney tried to use those words against him.</p>
<p>The discrepancy — five seconds versus 60 seconds — was notable enough that Mr. McKinney referenced it in his closing argument and stood silent for a short time, though not for a full minute, to underscore a point.</p>
<p>“Do you see how awkward that felt?” Mr. McKinney asked the jury. “And that was 10 seconds.”</p>
<p>The prosecution, too, deemed the detective’s testimony important enough that Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky devoted the first portion of his closing argument to defending Detective Adams and rebutting Mr. McKinney’s argument.</p>
<p>The jury was seeking a copy of Detective Adams’ pre-trial testimony.</p>
<p>But Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski denied the request. He said that the testimony was used by Mr. McKinney for purposes of cross-examination but was not entered into evidence.</p>
<p>The judge also reminded jurors that he had instructed them to rely on their memories and any notes that they took. He said it was not his practice to read back what was said in open court because “we’ll be here all day reading back testimony.”</p>
<p>But the judge said he would make an exception and instructed the court reporter to read back a portion of Mr. McKinney’s cross-examination from Feb. 3.</p>
<p>Detective Adams testified that he was responding to the sound of gunfire around 10:53 p.m. when he saw a man getting into a car. He said that he pulled his police car alongside the vehicle, with the driver’s side doors facing one another, about six to eight feet apart. The driver stared straight ahead and did not roll down his window, nor did the detective ask him to do so.</p>
<p>“Did it ever occur to you at that point that this individual could have been involved in the shooting,” Mr. McKinney asked.</p>
<p>“Not necessarily,” the detective answered. “I was expecting him to roll his window down, and he just sat there.”</p>
<p>The car was parked on Franklin Avenue about five to eight houses away from the crime scene, he said. The detective confirmed that he never stopped, questioned or made eye contact with the driver.</p>
<p>“His eyes were open, and he was staring straight through the windshield of the car,” Detective Adams said.</p>
<p>The detective waited for him to start the car and roll down the window, but he never did. At this point, Mr. McKinney confronted the detective with his past testimony about watching the driver for a full minute.</p>
<p>“At this particular moment it’s hard to remember exactly how many seconds it was,” the detective said. He noted that he wrote down the car’s license plate, because he was trained to take down information in case it was needed later.</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney asked if the detective thought the driver was acting suspiciously.</p>
<p>“It was weird. We have many shots fired calls. People react differently,” he testified. “I started thinking, ‘This guy’s going to work or has something on his mind ... He wasn’t sweating. He wasn’t making any weird movements.’ ”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he didn’t know if the driver might have been involved in the shooting. “I thought I can’t sit here all day with this guy,” Detective Adams said. Then the radio crackled with an update, and he drove away.</p>
<p>During his closing argument Monday, Mr. McKinney asked jurors to consider whether it made sense for Detective Adams to not have detained or interview the driver of the Lincoln. He questioned whether it made sense for someone to be suspicious enough to note their license plate but not to talk to that person.</p>
<p>“Just use your common sense,” Mr. McKinney said. “Does Detective Adams' testimony make any sense to you?”</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney also tried to raise doubts about what happened to the piece of paper that the detective said he wrote the plate information on and handed to investigators. It's not clear to whom the paper was given or to whom Detective Adams spoke, Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>"There's absolutely no corroboration of Detective Adams' testimony," Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky bristled at the suggestion that his witness was lying. During his closing argument he leaped to the detective's defense.</p>
<p>"So now they have to go after Detective Adams. I don't want to get too high and mighty. But how dare they," Mr. Chernosky said.</p>
<p>Referring to Mr. McKinney, he said, "He wants you to buy in to some vast conspiracy," involving the detective fabricating Shelton's identification. "You know how many people that would take to pull off a conspiracy like that?"</p>
<p>Mr. Chernosky told the jury that Detective Adams was focused on the gunfire coming from down the street.</p>
<p>"His sole focus is getting to wherever this shooting might be. So he does what he can. He gets a plate."</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the jury asked two questions. They resumed deliberations after the testimony was read back to them.</p>
