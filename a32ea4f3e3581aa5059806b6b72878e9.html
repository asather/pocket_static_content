<h1>Pittsburgh all-stars join forces for Earth Day Anthem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An all-star cast of Pittsburgh musicians have joined forces for a “We Are the World”-style version of the Earth Day anthem “(Lay Down) Candles in the Rain.”</p>
<p>Celebrating Earth Day’s 50th Anniversary, the Pittsburgh recording features Michael Glabicki and Jenn Wertz (Rusted Root), Scott Blasey (The Clarks), Kelsey Friday (Brownie Mary), Clinton Clegg (The Commonheart), Joe Grushecky (Houserockers), Melinda Colaizzi (Women who Rock), Jeff Jimerson (Airborne), Anthony Rankin, Stevee Wellons, Mia Z (“The Voice”), Bria Zegarelli and Ronda Zegarelli, backed the Deryck Tines Choir.</p>
<p>The song is available to stream at <a href="https://pittsburghearthday.org/" target="_blank">PittsburghEarthDay.org</a>.</p>
<p>“This is a special song that still resonates today for Earth Day and also in these times of crisis,” Wertz said in a statement. “Our Earth is in crisis, our systems are in crisis, so it’s wonderful to be a part of this project that will hopefully inspire a feeling of togetherness during this time of being apart. And it’s just so appropriate that we are all being still during Earth Day this year. Maybe Mother Earth needed a break from all of our normal human&nbsp;activity.”</p>
<p>Melanie Safka, who recorded as Melanie, released the song in 1970, inspired by her appearance at Woodstock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh version was recorded in January at the Church Recording, produced by Rick Witkowski and Dana Cannone. Ronda Zegarelli, a local musician and owner of creative and events agency Acrobatique, set up the project.</p>
<p>“In looking at the past for inspiration, I stumbled upon a song that I recognized from years ago as a little girl. I recalled being moved and singing along with the anthem style chorus,” said Zegarelli. “When I was asked to evolve Earth Day programming for the 50th Anniversary, I felt music would be the unifier to inspire a community of like-minded people. People who want to change behaviors as those before us had done 50 years ago. I hope that the song resonates and enlightens everyone's hearts, souls as we come together in celebration of Earth Day during an unprecedented new world.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Earth Day has partnered with Earth Day Global Network to present <a href="https://pittsburghearthday.org/candles-in-the-rain/" target="_blank">a video of the song</a> featuring the network’s “Earth Day Challenge” which offers 22 action-oriented items to support the earth that people&nbsp;can participate in right now, from the comfort of their own homes.</p>
<p>Acrobatique’s Earth Day activities have been rescheduled for August.</p>
