<h1>Pitt kicker Alex Kessman shakes early season struggles to help deliver a win against Louisville</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For Alex Kessman, something needed to change.</p>
<p>The Pitt kicker, blessed with a big leg but plagued by erratic accuracy, had struggled in his first two games, missing all three of his kicks, all of which were 45 yards or shorter.</p>
<p>In a 23-20 victory Saturday against Louisville, Kessman stood not as a cause for concern on an otherwise positive day for his team, as it had been after the first two contests, but as one of the biggest reasons why the Panthers emerged with a win. The senior made all three of his field-goal attempts -- from 45, 41 and 42 yards, in order -- helping get points for an offense that would march down the field but occasionally stall. The nine points he accounted for on field goals alone were the difference between a 3-0 start that included a triumph against a ranked team and an agonizing loss to an opponent it spent much of the day overpowering and outmaneuvering.</p>
<p>It was, for Kessman, a joyous culmination of a difficult-yet-rewarding week of introspection and improvement.</p>
<p>“I stopped being so robotic,” Kessman said. “I stopped thinking. I just went back to my natural kicking style. I reflected on those two games and put them behind me. I don’t know. I just cleared everything out. I know how to kick a ball. I told myself ‘Just go out and kick the ball.’”</p>
<p>At one of the sport’s most mentally taxing positions, little of what Kessman sought to change dealt with the more technical elements of kicking.</p>
<p>It began with seeking help. Beginning his sophomore year, Kessman said he would meet with a sports psychologist, about once every two weeks. This season, however, he hadn’t, something he changed this past Wednesday. Though he only went into so much detail about what they discussed, Kessman said the psychologist told him much of what he espoused after Saturday’s victory. <em>Stop thinking so much. Trust yourself. Go out there and just kick.</em></p>
<p>It was a message Kessman said will “stick with me for a while, probably a long time.”</p>
<p>“I think I just really needed somebody that knows what they’re talking about,” he said. “He knew exactly what my mindset was and where I was mentally and physically. I think he just brought me back and recentered me.”</p>
<p>The Clarkston, Mich. native also leaned on meditation, using an app on his phone that provides him with guided, 30-minute meditations to help him relax and clear his mind.</p>
<p>“I think the world right now is too fast,” Kessman said. “People need to slow down and reflect on themselves.”</p>
<p>Kessman’s made kicks, including two extra points, gave him 261 career points, moving him to sixth on the program’s all-time scoring list and his three made field goals moved him up to 49 for his career, which is behind only Chris Blewitt (55) and Conor Lee (50).</p>
<p>On Saturday, those conversions not only gave his team a win, but it dug him out of a harmful spiral, at least temporarily, and rewarded the public confidence of a coach in Pat Narduzzi who supported him through his struggles.</p>
<p>“I’m proud as heck of Kessman,” Narduzzi said. “We have a lot of faith in him.”</p>
<p><strong>A team from a city in the national spotlight returns to the field</strong></p>
<p>For much of this past week, the word ‘Louisville’ has been associated not with a college football team looking to rebound from a loss last Saturday against Miami, but with a community grappling with a ruling from a local grand jury Wednesday that charges would not be brought against any police officers for their role in the shooting death of Louisville resident Breonna Taylor in March.</p>
<p>Taylor’s death had been one of several high-profile instances of Black men and women being killed by police this year, a series of events that ignited one of the largest, most sustained pushes for social and racial justice in recent history.</p>
<p>After nearly 120 consecutive days of protests in the city, a grand jury charged detective Brett Hankison with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment for firing into a neighboring unit of Taylor’s, but no charges arose from Taylor’s death. That decision came after the grand jury was presented with findings of an investigation by Kentucky attorney general Daniel Cameron, a former Louisville football player.</p>
<p>Following the announcement of the ruling, and with emotions heightened, protests and demonstrations have continued in Louisville. Louisville players said that everything transpiring in the city they now call home has affected them only so much.</p>
<p>“For the most part, we’re pretty isolated and away from those outside distractions,” defensive back Marlon Character said. “Coaches pretty much protect us from all of that. When we’re at the field, at the facility, we just focus on what we’re doing and go home.”</p>
<p>Only two of the team’s 22 listed starters and 17 players total are from Louisville, with two others from Jeffersonville, Ind., which is right across the Ohio River from Kentucky’s largest city.</p>
<p>A group of Louisville athletes and citizens, including members of the school’s men’s and women’s basketball teams, marched Friday as part of a demonstration near the university’s football stadium. Members of the Cardinals’ football team were not present for that, being out of town for their game at Pitt, but they believe their concerns and feelings are met with an open, welcoming ear by the team’s coaches.</p>
<p>“They address it,” running back Javian Hawkins said. “They’re for us. However we feel, they feel. We talk about it. They ask us if we’ve got anything to say. We leave it from there. If we don’t have anything to say, they’re good, but if we do, they hear us out and we work with it.”</p>
<p><strong>Louisville quarterback moving after being carted off</strong></p>
<p>Following a fourth-down interception in the final two minutes that effectively ended the game, Pitt’s celebration was abruptly halted by a scary, sobering scene.</p>
<p>Louisville quarterback Malik Cunningham, who was tackled from behind by Panthers defensive lineman Calijah Kancey shortly after releasing the pass that was eventually picked, remained motionless and face down on the turf well after the play had ended. Players from both teams gathered on the field and knelt as Cunningham was tended to by trainers. He was eventually brought off the field on a cart, raising his thumb on the way out of the stadium to indicate he could move.</p>
<p>After the game, Louisville coach Scott Satterfield said his quarterback had feeling in all parts and extremities of his body and was able to move all of those body parts</p>
<p>“The medical team takes every precaution we need to take,” Satterfield said. “That’s why they took him in to further evaluate him. I have not gotten an update on that, so anything else would be speculation.”</p>
