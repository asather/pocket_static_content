<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 01.28.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Good morning, everyone. It's a fun time in high school basketball season. Near end of year. But so strange. This feeling hangs over basketball everywhere because of Kobe. Heck, not ashamed to admit I cried a few times last few days. But let's talk if anyone wants to.</p>
<p><strong>White Mamba</strong>: Does Butler clinch their first section title in 20+ years today? and will you be there? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I will not be there. And yes, Butler clinches section with a win. Butler's last section title was in 1992. But I expect another close one.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: It looks like the 6A top three seeds for basketball are pretty well defined in the undefeated section leaders: Lebo, FC and Butler.... Who is your pick or best guesses for the 4th seed and bye? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Right now it would probably have to be Pine-Richland because they beat Upper St. Clair. Unless Pine would lose a few more games. Don't forget. If there are more than 12 teams, there might not be four byes.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, In the context of next year only, don’t ya think Quips can definitely hang in their 4A conference? McKeesport interesting challenger to TJ? CV and Pine overwhelming favorites entering the season in 3A and 5A? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, Aliquippa will be fine in its 4A conference. And Central Valley has to be No. 1 going into year in 3A. Is Pine No. 1 in 5A? Probably. But remember. Gateway has a lot back from a championship team. Peters Township has a lot back from a team that lost in 5A championship. 5A is pretty darn good. A lot more interesting than 6A. Honestly, 6A will be somewhat boring. Best part might be the non conference games.</p>
<p><strong>NorthSouth</strong>: Have you heard any rumors of the Peters Township Boys BB job opening up? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Pghcoach</strong>: 6A girls looks pretty open for at least four teams (NA, MTL, BP &amp; Norwin). Do you have favorite for WPIAL champ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Can't pick one prohibitive favorite. It's those four teams.</p>
<p><strong>Basketball Fan</strong>: Butler Pine again tonight in hoops. Can you think of a better rivalvary in the past 4 or so years then this one? Every game is a great atmosphere, and every game seems to get somewhat heated. Who you got tonight? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Is it a rivalry, I don't know? It's only the past four years where they've been knocking heads and meeting in big games. And atmosphere is great. But it's not only good rivalry in WPIAL. St. Clair and Mt. Lebanon has been pretty good lately also. Even Lincoln Park-Aliquippa past few years.</p>
<p><strong>Big Jerri</strong>: What is going on at West A? Have you heard anything on your end? Seems like the place is on fire <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'm not a fireman.</p>
<p><strong>Parkway</strong>: Mike- always enjoy your articles and coverage thanks. Do you foresee more wpial football jobs opening up within the next month now that realignment is finished and banquets are over? Also any rumors on West A potential candidates? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes I would bet more jobs will come open. I have no idea what's going on at West A except that Chris Lucas left after only one year -- and please don't expect Bob Palko to come back.</p>
<p><strong>8/24</strong>: Will PR ever get a bigger gym? for one of the biggest schools in the WPIAL its mind boggling how few fans they can fit into that gym <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Don't know. I'm not on buildings and grounds committee at Pine. They built a new stadium years ago and renovated schools. Yes, you'd think they have a bigger gym but that's not always as easy to do as you think. Takes money.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Henne</strong>: What did you think of coach Tim McConnell's 600th win on January 27th, 2020? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: The guy is one of the best coaches in the history of the WPIAL IN ANY SPORT!!!!! 600 wins in 27 seasons? That's unreal. And a winning percentage of .804. Geez. I expect the CV girls to break the WPIAL girls winning streak record. And speaking of McConnell, I've heard that two years ago a Char Valley administrator suggested to him that maybe he step away or take a year off because maybe he lost his passion some. One of the biggest jokes I've ever heard. He lost his passion? McConnell won't talk about whether that happened.</p>
<p><strong>SR Coach</strong>: i knew something bad happened by the look on your face,when you told me Kobe was Tragically Killed, the game became meaningless for the moment,when the game was over i gave my son the biggest hug. Your articles were a great tribute <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Thank you very much SR coach. I've said to myself the last few days, "Why have I cried 4 or 5 times the past few days?" It's a strange feeling. What was so strange about Sunday was that I had just tweeted "horrible news." It was about the death of former Penn-Trafford star pitcher Maclean Maund in a car accident. It couldn't have been more than 5-10 minutes when I checked my phone and someone tweeted back at me "you think that's horrible? Kobe Bryan is reported dead." Terrible day.</p>
<p><strong>Gian Cuchapin</strong>: What was your favorite memory of Kobe Bryant when he was in high school? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well it wasn't like now when you could see highlights or games on internet. I only saw him play twice. Once in the state championship. Then in the McDonald's game. Like I wrote in a column, my favorite memory was sitting down and talking to him for a good while for a big story I was doing. This was after a McDonald's practice while we ate McDonald's for lunch at the Pitt Field House. It was just me and him. Like I have said. He seemed so genuine. So articulate. So intelligent. So loving for kids. I remember asking him, "You're 17. How'd you get this way?" He said something to the effect of his upbringing and "it's the way you're supposed to act." <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It's not like I knew Kobe well, but my two favorite memories were probably after he won the state championship, him running behind the bench and him hugging his father for what seemed 30 seconds. The other was at the slam dunk contest for McDonald's game. It was the night after he and I spent a while talking for a story I was doing. I brought my two oldest sons (Mike and Sean were only 8 and 5 at the time. My youngest Danny had just been born two weeks earlier). After talking earlier in the day, I had my sons with me and he came right up to them just to say hello. He was charming. And he hugged them for a picture. My son still has that picture in his phone.</p>
<p><strong>Lindsey Misci</strong>: Do you think Chartiers Valley Boys basketball team can really win the section this season? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well they're in first place and have a two game lead over anyone else. It's probably just me, but I'd go out on a limb and say yeah they can really win the section this season.</p>
<p><strong>Nicole Bohatch </strong>: Who would you say is the best duo in both WPIAL Girls and Boys basketball? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: For boys offensively, I'd say Ethan Morton and Devin Carney of Butler and Jake DiMichele and Dante Spadafora of OLSH. For girls, you'd have to look at McConnell and Malcolm at Char Valley, Westphal and Dziezgowski at Bethel, Myers and Lewandowski at North Catholic, although I don't know why but it seems Lewandowski isn't scoring as much this year. I don't know the situation there. Has she been hurt?</p>
<p><strong>Corbin Miller</strong>: What was your favorite memory of Penn-Trafford standout pitcher, Maclean Maund? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I really didn't know Maclean. But from all reports, was a wonderful kid. Such a sad story also.</p>
<p><strong>Jared Mero </strong>: I think Fox Chapel's Boys basketball team is still undefeated at 17-0. Can they make a serious run to win 6A? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No. They are 17-0 but can't make a run at a championship. C'mon, man. Obviously they are very good. Will they win it all? I've said all along I think there are probably 5 teams that have a legitimate chance to win it all. They are one of them. Fox Chapel's section is weak, but so what? Doesn't mean Fox Chapel is weak. But I don't know yet who I would pick to win it all. I want to see the last few weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Caroline Kucko </strong>: We still need to finish this WPIAL basketball season, but is there an eighth grader that you happened to hear about that can be "The Next Big Thing" next season? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, a kid named Lew Alcindor. He's supposed to be like 6-9 already. Not sure what school he goes to. Somone told me Power Memorial Charter.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly Pecora </strong>: Central Catholic's Boys basketball player, Ben Sarson, is the main attraction on the team. If he went to public school, where would he have gone? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have no idea. Why does it matter?</p>
<p><strong>Kaleigh Flavin</strong>: Can Mars boys basketball team still have a shot in winning <span style="font-weight: bold;">WPIAL Class 5A Section 3?</span> <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Mars is one game behind Shaler with a few left to go. So call me crazy but I'd say Mars still has a shot to tie for the section title.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Dominick</strong>: I feel that my boys from TJ have been playing well with two section losses against CV and a section loss against South Fayette. What can they do to win the section? What help do they need? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Daniel, your TJ boys are two games behind Chartiers Valley with four games to go. So I'd say your boys need a lot of help.</p>
<p><strong>Zach "The GOAT" Bainbridge</strong>: What do you expect from the Butler and Pine-Richland matchup tonight? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Another close game. I think a lot will depend on how well each team shoots it from 3. They both rely a lot on shooting. But Butler has the X factor -- The Big E.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Do you see John Miller taking over the varsity job at NA? He is currently the 9th grade coach and the varsity is performing poorly. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Who said Keith Noft is leaving? And yes I know John Miller is coaching 9th grade. Truth be told, my 9th grade team played him. But if that job did come open (and I like Keith Noftz), don't look for John Miler to take over. When I asked him if he would coach again in high school, he said, "Are you crazy. I'm 78 years old?"</p>
<p><strong>jimmy G</strong>: Where do you rank Ethan Morton among the all time great WPIAL players? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Right now I think he is one of the best point guards to come through here in past 25 years. Might be best passing point guard in Western Pennsylvania in 25-30 years. Where does he fit all time? I'll reserve judgment on that. We've had so many good ones from way back. Plus, his legacy will still be determined. You have to wait and see what he does the rest of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Green Tree </strong>: Random question.. I know most high school coaches have day jobs other than to coach but what are some of the most interesting occupations you can remember a coach having? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Policeman. Heck, TJ football coach Bill Cherpak was an undertaker. Lou Cerro used to drive a break truck. Steve Bucci is a baseball coach. Won WPIAL at South Park. PIAA at Canon-McMillan. He's a jail guard at Allegheny County jail. Those are a few that stick out.</p>
<p><strong>Emma Van Wicklen</strong>: I have heard rumors that Devin Carney could be on the move next year. Do you have any idea that it is true or I am listening to the wrong people? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No idea. He came into Butler as a freshman. So he has moved before. We'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Who do you like in the Norwin vs. NA girls rematch tonight? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: NA</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Any thoughts on the CV vs Thomas Jefferson girls game from the other day. TJ took the lead with 3 seconds to go and CV took a time out. The added time to the clock for no apparent reason and then missed the call at the end that should have waived off the basket because of time. I guess when you are number 1 in state and a McConnell you get those calls. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hold on. I don't know about adding time back on. I've seen pictures of the last shot. It is still on fingertips of CV player when clock says 0.0. But that is so close to call. Officials going by sound of horn. They have no replay. You know how tough it is to call that? On top of that, I've talked to someone who knows and says there is a slight delay on buzzer and clock at TJ's gym from when clock reaches 0 and buzzer goes off. I watched the video before I saw picture. I thought she got it off before buzzer sounded. That's a really hard call to make.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: Looking at 4A Section 2, kind of a dog fight. What are the chances that Central Valley gets to that fourth place playoff spot coming from way behind? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Central Valley is two games behind Quaker Valley for the fourth playoff spot. Best scenario for Cen Vall. is to win out and QV still has to play New Castle, Ambridge and Blackhawk. CV needs two losses by Quaker Valley. If Central Valley and Quaker Valley tie for fourth, they would both go because they split two games.</p>
<p><strong>Pghcoach</strong>: Do you think the demise of the local catholic grade schools will impact the catholic high school hoop teams? The grade schools used to produce good talent in 70s and 80s. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Good question Pghcoach. I would say yes. But on the other hand, you still have kids from public schools going to Catholic high schools.</p>
<p><strong>Savannah Zarna </strong>: Defending PIAA 5A Boys basketball team, Moon, has been struggling. I didn't expect them to win a state championship, but they look like they will not make the postseason at all. What has happened to that team? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They're not that good. They lost everything from last year. It's pretty simple. Just don't have the talent. Yes, Moon had Puff Johnson but I don't think people realized how good the Ryan twins were and also the Smith kid. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Correction, that's "Kenny The Horse." Yes, Kenny was in Hershey for the Kobe game. He is my partner every year for state hoops.</p>
<p><strong>Stang gang </strong>: is rodney gallagher the best player in the WPIAL this year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Please.</p>
<p><strong>Luke Reed</strong>: Mike, if Pine-Richland loses tonight against Butler and Central Catholic defeats North Allegheny tonight, does that mean Central would be 2nd in WPIAL Class 6A Section 1? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Central and Pine would be tied for second in that scenario. They have to play next week. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: There's only one Deuce and at times I miss him at these "frays."</p>
<p><strong>Dr. Steve</strong>: Rochester, Propel Montour, and Mapletown still have not won a game in WPIAL Boys basketball. Do you think one of these teams can go winless once the regular season ends? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well if they have not won a game yet I'd say there is a chance they can go winless.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck </strong>: What 5A teams do you think have the best shot of winning it all? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't think 5A is all that good this year in terms of depth of quality teams. I'd put Penn Hills as the favorite right now but they aren't a prohibitive choice. Shaler and Mars will be in the thick of it and don't forget Char Valley.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, hope this is not a too personal question, but how old were you when you started covering sports for P-G. While in college? Hope you keep doing it for awhile yet, there is no close second to you as an authoritative source on it. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Why thank you very much Zman. Honestly, I started at the Post-Gazette the summer before my senior year in high school. And get this: Mark Madden helped get me in. Ol' Flounder was working part time there then. The first job I had at P-G was addressing envelopes to athletic directors in 1979. I started writing for the P-G and covering high schools in the spring of 1980 and worked there part time all through college. So I guess it's been 40 years. Good Lord. I'll never say I'm old. Just getting older.</p>
<p><strong>Alexander Madrigal</strong>: Shaler has a stud senior in Mekhi Reynolds. I really like his style of play. Has that man had any college basketball offers? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: He is very good. Just got an offer recently from Clarion.</p>
<p><strong>‘T’ from Green Tree</strong>: Great story on Kobe-brings back a lot of memories! Really miss having all those great players coming to Pittsburgh! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Thank you T. He was here for the McDonald's game. All those great players used to come here for the Dapper Dan Roundball Classic.</p>
<p><strong>hoop junkie</strong>: You have expressed this twice in this column, but to be clear. Playoffs go to top 4 teams in every section. If a two or more teams are tied, it goes to head to head record. If this is split, there could be 5 teams from one section making the playoffs. Is this correct? Are there any other tie breakers besides head to head record? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You are correct. If there are, say, three teams tied for third. In head to head competition, one team is 3-1. They get third. The system then reverts back to head to head for the two teams that are left. If one of those two teams left was 2-0 against the other, then the 2-0 team goes and the 0-2 team is out. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: OK everyone, time's up. Enjoyed it. And everyone be good.</p>
