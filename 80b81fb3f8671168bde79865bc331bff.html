<h1>Pitt WR Cameron O'Neil enters the transfer portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt wide receiver Cameron O'Neil has entered the transfer portal, sources told the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>O'Neil, a member of Pitt's 2018 recruiting class, redshirted as a freshman and then did not play for the Panthers in 2019. Entering his redshirt sophomore season, the Alabama native will need to sit out if he transfers to another Football Bowl Subdivision program.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-1, 205-pound receiver could technically stay at Pitt even after entering the portal, though that's unlikely.</p>
<p>O'Neil's decision isn't a surprise. The wideout did not have a clear path to playing time next season.</p>
<p>O'Neil didn't show up on Pitt's depth chart throughout the 2019 campaign, and Pitt returns three of its top four receivers (losing Maurice Ffrench, keeping Taysir Mack, Shocky Jacques-Louis and Jared Wayne) in 2020.</p>
<p>The Panthers also signed three receivers in the 2020 recruiting cycle: Jordan Addison, Aydin Henningham and Jaylon Barden.</p>
<p>O'Neil — who compiled 44 receptions, 705 yards, 10 touchdowns as a senior at the Glenwood School in Phenix City — was a three-star prospect. His offer sheet included Illinois, Memphis, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to Rivals.</p>
