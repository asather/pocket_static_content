<h1>As demand surges, Parkway Center Mall Giant Eagle to handle only pick-ups and delivery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Giant Eagle plans to temporarily close to the public its Parkway Center Mall store and convert it to handle curbside grocery pick-ups and fulfill delivery orders as demand spikes during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Parkway Center Giant Eagle will close to in-store shopping on Friday, May 1, as the O’Hara-based grocery chain shifts operations at the supermarket.</p>
<p>Giant Eagle had made the same move at two stores in Ohio this month. Grocery chain Kroger also is among the food retailers to make similar conversions.</p>
<p>“As we’ve been piloting creative solutions to increase our curbside pickup and delivery capacity, we have been very pleased with the results of our recent supermarket to pickup center conversions in our other markets,” said Jannah Jablonowski, a spokeswoman for Giant Eagle. “There continues to be an unprecedented demand for grocery pick-up and delivery options, and we are very excited to bring this curbside pick-up center model to Pittsburgh to make thousands of additional spots available to our guests each week.”</p>
<p>The surge in demand has lead to inventory shortages of certain items, like toilet paper and hand sanitizer, as well as delays in deliveries and pick-up slots among <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/04/10/grocery-stores-pickup-delivery-services-demand-surge-coronavirus/stories/202004090048" target="_blank">retailers across the country</a>.</p>
<p>Online sales through pick-up and delivery over a 30-day period grew 233% (from $1.4 billion in August 2019 to $4 billion) in March 2020, according to Barrington, Ill.-based advisory firm Brick Meets Click.</p>
<p>The Parkway Center Giant Eagle will close to the public on May 1 at 9 p.m. and complete the temporary conversion May 3.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Parkway Center in-store pharmacy will continue to operate for prescription pickup or drop off both inside the pharmacy and at a walk-up pharmacy window.</p>
