<h1>Stick taps, chirps and observations from Penguins-Canadiens Game 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>In a game that featured two penalty shots, an overtime period and a standout performance by Montreal Canadiens goalie Carey Price, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/01/penguins-canadiens-game-1-recap-overtime-penalty-shots/stories/202008010068" target="_blank">the Penguins dropped Game 1</a> of their best-of-five qualifying-round series, 3-2.</em></p>
<p><strong>It was over when:</strong> With just over six minutes left in overtime, Montreal defenseman Jeff Petry scooped a loose puck, side stepped Brandon Tanev’s block attempt and ripped a shot past Matt Murray.</p>
<p><strong>Turning point:</strong> The Penguins led considerably in shot attempts but trailed 2-0 on the scoreboard midway through the second period. It looked like Price would steal Game 1, but then Sidney Crosby tossed a puck on net from below the goal line and in. It didn’t change the result, but it changed the momentum.</p>

<p><strong>Chirps:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thoughts from the Twitter machine:</strong></p>
<p><strong>They said it:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>“We need to get to the net more consistently and take the goalie’s sight lines away. We had moments where we were in front of the net, but we can get better at that.” —&nbsp;Mike Sullivan.</p>
<p>“Luckily, it’s not a single-elimination tournament. We’ve got to heed the lessons. We did some really good things.” — Bryan Rust</p>
<p><strong>News, notes and observations:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Next up:</strong> In a shortened, five-game series, every game is more critical. The Penguins will try to even the series at 8 p.m. Monday or else face desperation.&nbsp;</p>
