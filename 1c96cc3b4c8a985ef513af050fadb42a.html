<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 09.09.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello, everyone, and welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. Thanks for stopping by. We’ll get going at noon, but you can leave your questions now. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And away we go ... with a little Rockin’ the Rhein playing in the background.</p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: When is the great Neverauskaus experiment going to end/ Coud be the worst pitcher of all time? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Worst pitcher of all-time? I think that may be a little strong, Jake. But I agree with you: It’s frustrating to watch, and I don’t think there’s anything there. I think the Pirates should get credit for making something out of Hartlieb, Howard, Turley, etc. They’ve found some pieces in the bullpen. But to trot out Dovy and keep Cederlind in Altoona, I don’t understand that one.</p>
<p><strong>nivek morris</strong>: Do you have any idea what’s going on with Bryan Reynolds? He seemed to have one of the purest swings I’ve ever seen, but .185 with .331 slugging is scary bad for a fourth of the way through a typical season. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Couple things with Reynolds. One, what he didn’t last year wasn’t sustainable; he had a BABIP of .387. That’s really high and not sustainable. Two, teams are also shifting him more when he’s batting left-handed. That has contributed to some outs. Three, he’s human. His wife has been pregnant. There’s COVID. No making excuses, but I’m sure that was wearing on him. Then you add in a sophomore slump, knowing you’re going through it and trying to dig yourself out. Again, they get paid quite well, and nobody is making excuses here. But these guys are still human beings.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Is today’s celebration/recognition of Roberto Clemente, especially in allowing players to wear his number, the first step in making number 21 retired throughout baseball like Jackie Robinson’s number 42? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it should be. But that’s just me. I know Ron Cook wrote today that he kinda likes No. 42 being the only retired number. I get hat argument, too.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Hi Jason-- With the season wrapping up in a few weeks two moves I’d like to see are Neverauskas DFA with Cederlind recalled and Riddle DFA with Will Craig recalled. I don’t expect Craig to be a star but he’s a former first rounder pick, plays strong defense at 1b (passable in RF i’m guessing), and could supply some power. Like to see him take the Osuna role over. What are your thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Exactly yours. I see no reason in the world to continue to play Riddle or allow Neverauskas to pitch. As we’ve seen with Hayes, the Pirates actually have some future pieces that are intriguing. Let’s see ‘em. I would expand this to include Oliva and Cruz, although I understand that, as of now, rosters haven’t expanded. So, you don’t wanna do anything stupid business-wise because you wanna see Oneil Cruz get a dozen at-bats.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: So what is the thinking behind Shelton pulling the starting pitcher out with a one hitter after 4 innings ? I’ve watched him do it a handful of times and instantly give up the lead ! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Last night it was because Musgrove is still working his way back from injury (right triceps). Basically in normal times, guys can go to the minors and make rehab starts. They can’t do that now because there are no minors. This functions as that. With Kuhl, the other recent quick hook, Shelton said they wanted to be careful with Kuhl’s workload coming off TJ. I get that. I don’t like it, but I get it. If you think about the Pirates’ prospects, what makes more sense to them: To have Kuhl healthy and productive in two years, when they might be good, or run him until the wheels fall off like Mike Tomlin might say when they’re 13 games under .500 or whatever it is?</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Derek Shelton is Clint hurdle 2.0 when it comes to overmanaging his pitching staff. I can’t believe these pitchers like being pulled out of a shutout. Is there any science supporting “ saving” their arms ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t know if there is or not. I’m not a doctor, and I’m not trying to defend his decisions good or bad. My first reaction to your comment is amazement that we somehow have the book on a guy after 40 games. We don’t. ... I agree, he takes pitchers out early. There are also way different circumstances at play. See my answer above about Musgrove and Kuhl.</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Do you think GMBC will start to mold the 40 man roster into his vision this winter? I’m thinking there could be a lot of turnover and guys like Feliz, Holmes, Kramer, J. Martin, Frazier, etc could either be traded or non-tendered. first year was an evaluation period but now Ben begin to bring his guys in. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: His guys? Who are his guys? I think Ben started to mold the 40-man last offseason and will do it again this winter. But I don’t know what you mean by bringing in “his guys.” Not like the Pirates have a bunch of Cherington disciples they’re gonna sign. They’re gonna try to develop what they have and acquire more talent from the draft, via trades, international, etc. I think until they have guys pushing those you mentioned out of spots, they’ll stay. If you can trade ‘em for something, do that. But you’re not gonna see Ben just lopping people off the 40-man because he has these mythical baseball figures he’s been hiding under a pillo. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: pillow*</p>

<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: Where is Cederlind? I can’t believe they don’t think he’s better than some of these relievers <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Fair question. Their bullpen has actually been decent lately. Something like the third-lowest ERA in baseball over the past 20 games. But, yeah, Cederlind should be here. I don’t understand why he’s not. I’ll ask Shelton about it today.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates</strong>: When do you except Cruz and Gonzales up? Will either be in next year opening day lineup <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not opening day lineup. I think that’s too soon. I would think maybe middle of next season best-case scenario? I’m curious to ask Ben and hear how close they think Gonzales is. I have not seen him. When I saw Cruz in spring training, while he has all kinds of physical tools and gifts, he’s not ready. A late-season promotion would be merely to hit and maybe send him into the offseason feeling good. But I haven’t seen him this season, so I’m curious what his development has looked like.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates</strong>: Thoughts on Hayes so far <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Tremendous. Speed has surprised me. He’s one of the smoothest-fielding third basemen I’ve ever seen. Throws are hard, accurate, on a line. Sneaky amount of power. Could not be more impressed. I wanna see him playin every day, but I think they got a really good one here.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: What will be the highest pay the pirates give to a free agent this year? Over under 4 million <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would go under. Until Cherington does more development and talent acquisition, I don’t think it’s their MO to throw money after FA. Now, when other processes are corrected, that’s when I think it will get interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Boi</strong>: How do you except trades this off season <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Umm ... I think they could revisit one with Frazier. Also, guys like Williams and Musgrove, maybe that conversation happens again. I’d keep Gonzalez, although I suppose I would listen on an offer. I’m not sure I see anyone who’s terribly tradable at this point. Maybe Rich Rod.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: Why do I continue to watch Dovy pitch when Blake Cederlind (or even Gustave) are waiting at Altoona? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t know, honestly. They like Dovy, to be fair. (Not defending it. Just answering your question.) But I don’t get it. Give the reps to those two guys. I’d be fine with that. At least you’re working toward something. I like the sound of Gustave, too. He’s supposed to have some really good stuff. Has just never been able to put it all together.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: I think Shelton’s in game decision making has been much better as the team has had more success. I guess it helps when the bullpen is pitching very well but what are your thoughts on Shelton as the season has passed the 2/3 mark? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Still TBD for the reasons you’ve said. It’s amazing how much smarter a manager looks when his players perform, huh? I just can’t judge the guy on that stuff based on now. And also, sure, he’s made some head-scratchers, but it’s his first managerial job, too. I think a lot of people -- me included -- lost sight of that when things were really bad. But I like him a lot as a person. I think the players do, too. It’ll be interesting to see what happens over the final 20 games here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Is there anything worse that having two, gorgeous, weekend weather days in a row ( a true rarity in The Burgh) like we had this past Saturday and Sunday and having no one in the stands to watch the Bucs? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’ve thought about that a lot this season. Just an unbelievable summer with weather. During a time where we can’t all enjoy it together. Stinks.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M</strong>: Jason. After watching Ke’Bryan Hayes it’s not a stretch to think he was held down because of service time and super 2 arbitration issues. He had been clear of COVID for a while. I’m tired of criticizing the Pirates for that. It’s the system they have to work within. Do you think there’s any chance the players union will fight for changing the 6 year service/super 2 arbitration in ‘21? It would be nice if there was an incentive to just simply put the best players on the major league roster. <br> <strong>Danny</strong>: Any chance you see the Pirates exploring brining back Kela this offseason so he can try and rebuild his value coming off of two injury-plagued seasons? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: This is a good one. First blush and if I had to pick one: no. But, I’ve been thinking more about this: maybe. And here’s why: The Pirates clearly had nothing available for Kela. If they had, it makes no sense to turn it down. Even international bonus pool $$$ would’ve given them something. So you take it. If that continues, if no one wants Kela for whatever reason, I suppose they could. I think they would know him better than most and thus might be willing to assume the risk on a prove-it deal; the benefit is they could get someone on the cheap who clearly has ability and might be highly motivated. I don’t think Kela is terribly keen on returning, though.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Dumb question/request: Will they ever get rid of that Pirate Charities sign in right field that detracts from the original design, structure and beauty of the stadium? It was put up for the all-star game signage and then replaced by the current sign. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t understand the uproar there. Pirates Charities exists. It’s a real thing. PNC Park is a beautiful ballpark. We’re really gonna say that one sign detracts from that? C’mon. The Pirates do plenty of stuff that’s dumb and warrants criticism. They should spend more money. But I’m not gonna flip out over them putting a sign celebrating their charity work in the outfield. I’d rather be happy that hopefully some peoples’ lives are made better because of what they do. I think I’m still capable of enjoying PNC Park.</p>
<p><strong>Fred</strong>: 1) How would you access the impact jarrod Dyson had in the locker room and community? It’s a shame one of the only veteran leaders was traded away.<br> <br> 2) Any chance they bring him back in the offseason? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Fred</strong>: What is the deal with will craig not being given a chance? Clearly he can hit for plus power (55-60 FV), why keep him out of the lineup for guys like Moran where you know how they’ll produce. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: To be fair, dating back to spring training, with a bat in his hands, Will Craig has done next to nothing. I remember one ball that he’s hit hard -- for an out in St. Louis. He hasn’t exactly forced anybody’s hand. Now, I like Will. He’s great defensively, and he probably should be given more of a shot. But he hasn’t helped himself, either.</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: 2023(?) Pirates: C: ? 1B: Martin 2B: Gonzales SS: Peguero 3B: Hayes LF: Reynolds CF: Swaggerty RF: Cruz. SPs: Keller, Priester, Malone, Thomas, Bolton. Obviously a lot can change between now and then but the future isn’t bleak on paper <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: So much can change. Those exercises are mostly futile to me. Like, where did Tucker go? What about their 2021 first-round draft pick, which could be Kumar Rocker? Easily could be ready. But, yeah, I certainly get what you’re saying. There are reasons to be optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>KB Hayes</strong>: Bet the general yinzer population did not expect me to hit like this, no? All the talk was about my glove. How quickly before the league strikes back? According to some of my teammates whose names I won’t mention, probably in the near future. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Your teammates are telling you the league is gonna strike back? Ha. We’ll see. A lot of guys have had two good weeks. I like what I’ve seen thus far. Curious if you’ll be able to adjust.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: I am not criticizing the Pirates or the charitable works that they do, just the sign! That said, true charity does not need to be advertised! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: So you’ve never seen a United Way, Red Cross, Salvation Army, YMCA, Boys &amp; Girls Club or Habitat for Humanity advertisement then, right? I’m not putting Pirates Charities on that level, but what the living hell does a sign, a T-shirt, a bag or anything like that have to do with charity work?</p>
<p><strong>Danny</strong>: What’s wrong with Trevor Williams? It looked like he was having a bounce back season that is now imploding. How concerned should the Pirates be? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yeah, this is an important thing happening right now. It’s not good. I feel like a lot of us just sort of assume he’ll be part of things. Well, I like Trevor, but he has, what, a 5.80 ERA? Second consecutive year over 5? That makes it hard to say he’ll be part of trade discussions or a future building plan. Pitching-wise, he’s missing big. Meaning when he throws something hittable, it’s really getting whacked. But he’s also been getting dinked and dunked quite a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: WOW! What the “living hell” are you so upset about regarding a simple question regarding a sign? I have nothing against Pirate charities or any charity for that matter. In my opinion, the sign looks dumb and out of place out there in right field. If you disagree, fine. I certainly do not agree with everything that you write but am sure as living hell not going to get upset it! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m not upset about anything, Matt. It was language used for emphasis more than anything else. I’m sorry that did not translate. But I’m not upset at all.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I would be careful about dumping a younger player who has “great stuff.” We have a history of doing that and watching them pitch in World Series after World Series. Watching Daniel Hudson end last year’s series was the ultimate “Stop Driving Guys Out of Town” message to Pirates fans. We’re so desperate for a winner that we forget that it takes time to form superstars, especially hitters. When my wife had our first son, I am sure I was half as good at what I was doing too. Give them some time. We are not winning the World Series this year or next. Stop driving guys out of town until they get a chance to figure it out, even if that is at the alternate camp. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Valid points here. I think there’s an important balance between the two. Sometimes you have to deal guys, hopefully from a position of strength to address other needs. And the whole ecosystem sort of breaks down when you aren’t developing guys, which you can legitimately say about the former regime. I do get wanting to trade guys because fans invest time and money and energy, and they want to see that reciprocated; trades are the easiest way of showing that. Sometimes they make sense, too. But you just need to differentiate between those that make sense and those that are reactionary because you’re pissed.</p>
<p><strong>Neal H</strong>: Hello Pittsburgh! I just wanted to point out, for no particular reason, that one Austin Meadows is hitting .203. Some had his plaque ready in Cooperstown. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi, Neal. Good find in Gonzalez, too. You haven’t gotten enough credit for that. I hope you’re well.</p>
<p><strong>C Archer</strong>: I just wanted to say that Neal H made a fine point. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Arch. Hope you’re enjoying North Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>Joel</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Is there any talk of the Pirates changing their Dominican/Latin model and starting to compete at the upper levels of the talent pool? I am tired of seeing other teams with Latin players making huge splashes at young ages, while the Bucs take the quantity not quality approach. The Bucs’ have one of the biggest Latin bonus pools and they should start competing for the next Soto or Tatis.</span> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: We haven’t been told a bunch about their specific direction, plans or outlook. But I would have to imagine Cherington will prioritize finding those players. And remember, this is an area he’s hit on throughout his career. I don’t think it has to be an either/or proposition; you can do both. Simple fact is that the Pirates need to do a better job than they have done mining that area for talent.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Jason, why are the Bucs winning now? We need the top draft pick. Wins are meaningless now. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think you answered your own question, Mark. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. That’s gonna do it for this week. Thank you, as always, for participating. Have a couple things to do before heading to the ballpark. Talk to you all next week.</p>
