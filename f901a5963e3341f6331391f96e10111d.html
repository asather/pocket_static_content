<h1>PA Turnpike employees receive new four-year contract</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nearly 1,400 union workers at the Pennsylvania Turnpike will receive raises of $2.55 an hour over the next four years, but for the first time they will have to pay a portion of their health care costs.</p>
<p>The turnpike released details Wednesday of the new agreement with Teamsters Locals 250, representing employees in the western part of the state, and 77, which represents members in Eastern Pennsylvania. The unions cover&nbsp;1,395 maintenance, fare collection, trades and clerical employees.</p>
<p>The contract calls for a retroactive raise of 75 cents an hour from Feb. 20; 60 cents an hour Oct. 1; and 55 cents an hour in October 2021 and 2022. Employees will pay $17.85 every two weeks to help pay for their health care.</p>
<p>“It’s acceptable. Our people voted for it,” said Dan Kozel, business agent for Local 250 in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The agreement also establishes a severance package for toll collectors who may lose their jobs when the agency goes to cashless tolling in the fall of 2021. The turnpike has offered retraining and transfers to other agency or state jobs to about 600 whose jobs will be eliminated, but also offers $700 a year with a maximum of 20 years for those who don’t get another job.</p>
<p>Mr. Kozel said he expects more than 400 across the state to not get other state jobs and take the severance package.</p>
<p>“I think they’ve pretty much absorbed what they can,” he said.</p>
<p>Once toll collectors are eliminated, motorists will pay fees either through the prepaid E-ZPass system or through bills mailed to them based on photos taken of their license plate when they enter and leave the turnpike.&nbsp;</p>
