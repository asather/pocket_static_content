<h1>Bethel Park School Board removes referendum question from ballot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Bethel Park School Board unanimously voted to remove a referendum question from the June 2 primary ballot that would have asked voters to support a tax increase.</p>
<p>The vote to remove the referendum question occurred at a Tuesday meeting that was conducted online.</p>
<p>“After a great deal of thought and re-evaluation in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the challenges and uncertainties it has imposed on our friends, neighbors and families, the Bethel Park Board of School Directors has decided that it is in our community’s best interest that the referendum question be removed from the June 2 primary election ballot,” said board President Pam Dobos.</p>
<p>The board voted in January to place a referendum on the ballot that would set the district’s millage rate to the 2018-19 school year rate of 22.8763 after the outgoing board voted last year to decrease the millage to its current rate of 21.65 mills.</p>
<p>“Now is the time to focus our efforts on weathering the uncertain economic storm and supporting our families in every way possible,” Ms. Dobos said. “We recognize the economic struggle so many are facing, and now is not the time for the public to consider this particular referendum issue.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dobos said the board will absorb any budget shortfalls and balance the 2020-21 school year budget with withdrawal from the district’s fund balance.</p>
<p>“Because of the millage reduction that was approved last year, this puts us in an incredibly difficult position,” board member Barry Christenson said. “It’s the right thing to do right now, but we will have collateral damage to deal with when we get to the budgeting phase.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dobos added that for those who are voting by mail, the question will still be on those ballots, but it will not be tabulated.</p>
<p>In other business at the meeting, Joseph Dimperio, interim superintendent, reminded residents that anyone age 18 and under is eligible for daily free breakfast and lunch from the school district.</p>
<p>Mr. Dimperio said parents who want to obtain the free meals for their children must go on the school district’s website, www.bpsd.org, by 6 p.m. to place their order for pickup the following day. The online form must be completed every time meals are needed so that staff knows how much food to prepare. Phone orders are not being accepted.</p>
<p>Pickup is 11:30 to 1 p.m. at the main entrance of Bethel Park High School. Meals will be offered Monday through Friday. Breakfast consists of cereal, juice and milk and lunch is a sandwich, fruit, snack and milk.</p>
<p>“We have plenty of food to prepare for you,” Mr. Dimperio said.</p>
<p>He added that distribution has gone up this week. He said the district served 300 breakfasts and 300 lunches Tuesday - up from about 150 last week.</p>
