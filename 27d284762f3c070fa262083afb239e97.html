<html><head><title>One page a day: After 7-plus years, groups in Squirrel Hill, elsewhere celebrate complete Talmud study</title></head><body><p>At 6 a.m. on Friday, before daylight had reached the rainy streets of Squirrel Hill, a half-dozen men sat indoors beneath fluorescent lights at a long table in a study hall at Shaare Torah Congregation.</p><p>The scene hardly looked like a part of what’s been billed as the world’s largest and longest-running book club.</p><p>Yet there they were, studying the Jewish Talmud along with countless thousands of Jews the world over — all of them literally on the same page.</p><p>Teaching the small group from the head of the table was Rabbi Daniel Wasserman of Shaare Torah, who fluidly shifted from English to Hebrew to Aramaic as he expounded on complicated texts about ritual purity.</p><p>Large books sat open in front of the men, with just a couple of pages on the left side — an indication that they were near the end, not the beginning of the book, given the right-to-left direction of the writings.</p><p>The participants were approaching the end of a project that is about 7½ years in the making — to study one page per day from the dozens of volumes of the Talmud, a centuries-spanning compendium of Jewish scholarly debates over law, lore, philosophy, ritual, ethics and spiritual practice.</p><p>The participants, and others worldwide, planned to celebrate the end of the cycle on Saturday night with dancing and festivities, and to return on Sunday to the first page of the first volume for another cycle.</p><p>The project is called Daf Yomi (literally meaning “a page at a time”), launched in 1923 by Polish Rabbi Meir Shapiro. The idea quickly spread, the cycles continuing even through the devastation of the Holocaust, a signal that “we’re still here, we’re still going and we’re still studying,” Rabbi Wasserman said.</p><p>At least three Pittsburgh groups have been studying under the Daf Yomi schedule, including those at Shaare Torah, Young Israel of Pittsburgh and the Kollel Jewish Learning Center. All three are Orthodox.</p><p>Among those regularly attending the roughly hourlong studies at Shaare Torah is Cesar Gabriel Cedeno, who is in the process of converting to Judaism.</p><p>“The Talmud actually provides the best deep dive into Judaism, because you see what the halacha [religious law] is, how it was discussed over the years,” he said.</p><p>“There are circumstances where it's not clear always what to do,” Mr. Cedeno added, so it’s beneficial to read how the rabbis debate and don’t always come to agreement.</p><p>“It shows you that this is not a straitjacket,” he said of Jewish observance. “It is actually more flexible.”</p><p>Mr. Cedeno’s path to Judaism, and to the study table, had a dramatic turning point. He moved to Squirrel Hill in 2015 and was deeply influenced by the Jewish practices he saw around him. “I realized it’s the truth. It resonates a lot more with my heart.”</p><p>But on Oct. 27, 2018, with the fresh shock of the anti-Semitic murders of 11 worshippers at the nearby Tree of Life synagogue, he realized there were many determined to do harm to Jews. “That's when I had a moment of clarity: ‘I'm not going to let an anti-Semite tell me how to live my life. I'm converting.’”</p><p><strong>Response to tragedy</strong></p><p>For Sandy Glick of Squirrel Hill, participating regularly in the Talmud study similarly emerged as a response to tragedy.</p><p>About a decade ago, he lost his son at age 36. Another son put him in touch with Rabbi Wasserman, and he began coming regularly to Shaare Torah to say the mourner’s kaddish for his son and then other relatives who had died.&nbsp;</p><p>“If it wasn't for him, the rabbi,&nbsp;I don't know how I would have got through all this,” he said.</p><p>He began attending the last years of the previous Daf Yomi cycle, and this is the first full cycle he is completing — done in honor of his son. He also regularly takes part in the morning prayer that follows the study.</p><p>Before, he said, “I was one of those idiots ... you get up early, you're going into work and you come home. But I stayed here,” and now he has a spiritual rhythm to his daily routine.</p><p>Some participants use only the Hebrew and Aramaic texts, while others less proficient in the language have an English translation.</p><p><strong>Fundamental principles</strong></p><p>The complexity of the Talmudic topics can make the studies seem daunting to a visitor (and the generic term “talmudic” is sometimes used to describe a hair-splitting argument). A typical page of the Talmud includes expositions by ancient rabbis on passages from a still-more-ancient text known as the Mishnah, surrounded by later commentaries dating into medieval times. The pages thus are the fruit of cross-generational scholarly crowd sourcing.</p><p>Still, the studies do regularly return to fundamental principles.</p><p>At one point, the Friday discussion at Shaare Torah veered toward the perennial disputes between two ancient contemporary rabbis, Hillel and Shamai, who founded opposing schools of thought.</p><p>“Were they good friends?” someone asked Rabbi Wasserman.</p><p>“Yes, they worked together hand in glove, even though their approach to things was completely different,” Rabbi Wasserman said. Their disputes were “for the sake of heaven,” so both have an enduring place of prominence in the Talmud’s pages.</p><p>Although the Shaare Torah study is regularly attended by men, Rabbi Wasserman said it’s open to women as well.</p><p>As the new Daf Yomi cycle begins on Sunday, a group of local non-Orthodox Jews, men and women, are planning to embark on a study of their own.</p><p>While not all will necessarily meet daily, they will keep up a regular dialogue on their individual studies, said Rabbi Amy Bardack, an organizer.</p><p>“I always knew I’d want to do” the Daf Yomi cycle, she said, and set 2020 as her goal to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Rabbi Bardack, who is director of Jewish Life and Learning at the&nbsp;Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh, said the participants can also draw on resources such as an Israel-based podcast with women’s perspectives on the Talmud.</p><p>Some Talmudic texts, such as those dealing with marriage and with purity rules regarding women’s biological cycle, can be challenging for women readers today given the texts were written from an ancient patriarchal perspective.</p><p>“For some of us, we have to acknowledge that and name that,” Rabbi Bardack said.&nbsp;“At the same time, we are committed to” the Talmud and its central role in Jewish life.</p><p>“My approach is this is a record of people trying to figure things out,” she said.&nbsp;“You can say there is something spiritual about it because it’s a record of conversations that Jews have been studying for 1,500 years.”</p><p><em>Peter Smith: petersmith@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1416; Twitter @PG_PeterSmith.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2020/01/04/Daf-Yomi-celebrating-Talmud-study-squirrel-hill-pittsburgh/stories/202001040005</original_url>
