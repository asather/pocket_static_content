<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nine people have been indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of dealing fentanyl, heroin and cocaine in Butler County shipped from Philadelphia.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said in a statement Wednesday that federal agents and police have "dismantled a significant Philadelphia-to-Butler drug organization" that brought the drugs into Butler's small-town and rural communities, including locations near schools and playgrounds.</p>
<p>The nine defendants, led by Qureem Overton, 39, were indicted under seal on June 9. The case was unsealed Wednesday as law officers served arrest warrants.</p>
<p>The FBI worked with state police and the Butler County District Attorney's Office in developing the case.</p>
<p>"We want drug dealers to know there is nowhere for them to set up shop in western Pennsylvania," Mr. Brady said.</p>
<p>Richard Goldinger, the district attorney in Butler, said the case will put a "serious dent" in drug trafficking in his county.</p>
<p>Besides Mr. Overton, who has maintained residences in Butler County and Philadelphia, the defendants are Bobby Askew, Jasmine Cook, Damion Fray, Ricardo Glenn, Jamir Hughes, Nasir Sharpe, Dwayne Smallwood and Braden Yartz.</p>
<p>All are charged with drug trafficking from January 2017 until this month.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Mr. Overton, along with Mr. Askew, 38, Mr. Fray, 22, Mr. Glenn, 28, Mr. Sharpe, 22, and Mr. Smallwood, 41, have had addresses in Philadelphia and Butler.</p>
<p>Ms. Cook, 30, is from New Kensington and Mr. Yartz, 28, is from Lyndora, Pa.</p>
<p>All are facing at least five years in federal prison if convicted.</p>
