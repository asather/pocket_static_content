<h1>2020 Blue Chip Chat: Upper St. Clair's Ethan Dahlem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>ETHAN DAHLEM</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>School:</strong> Upper St. Clair</p>
<p><strong>Position:</strong> QB</p>
<p><strong>Year:</strong> Senior</p>
<p><strong>Height:</strong> 5-10</p>
<p><strong>Weight:</strong> 175</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>THE SCOOP</strong></span></p>
<p>One of the best dual-threat quarterbacks in the WPIAL. Last season was Dahlem’s first as a starter and he was splendid, averaging 264 yards of offense a game. He completed 142 of 210 passes for 2,218 yards and 17 touchdowns and also ran for 951 yards on 211 attempts and scored 15 touchdowns. Dahlem has good bloodlines. His father, Eric, was a former quarterback at Clearfield and uncle Wes (Eric’s brother) was a record-setting receiver at Clearfield who went on to Penn State. Ethan has grown some in the past year and expects a big season. He also was the starting point guard on Upper St. Clair’s basketball team that made the WPIAL semifinals last season.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>COLLEGE TALK</strong></span></p>
<p>Division II and III schools are showing interest in Dahlem. Many coaches believe Dahlem is not recruited by Division I schools because of his size. But Dahlem is big for Upper St. Clair. Dahlem said he most likely will move to receiver in college.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>OUR QUESTIONS, HIS ANSWERS</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>You had a great season last year, but what would you still like to improve on?</strong> Reading defenses. I’ve gotten better at it. It’s easier in practice this year to tell someone is open, based on reads.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the strangest thing you’ve had to deal with as a player because of COVID-19?</strong> Wearing a face shield on our helmet. We have been all wearing them. But the problem with it is it fogs up. You have to take it off.</p>
<p><strong>You’re a quarterback in football and point guard in basketball. What is something important you need to be a good leader in high school?</strong> I’d say to be competitive all the time because younger kids look up to you and see how you play. They want to do the same thing you do.</p>
<p><strong>Do you mean competitive, as in winning?</strong> Yeah, I hate losing. That goes even in practice.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a favorite quarterback?</strong> I’ve always liked Drew Brees growing up.</p>
<p><strong>Upper St. Clair should be very good in football, but what about basketball?</strong> In basketball, I think we should be the best team in the WPIAL, and even the state.</p>
<p><strong>What about football?</strong> We still have some things to prove. Last year, we did good things, but we still have to prove ourselves and build on last year.</p>
<p><strong>Your dad was a quarterback, but your uncle was a really good receiver. Did you ever want to be a receiver?</strong> I’ve been a quarterback my whole life, but I’m probably going to have to move to slot receiver in college.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about that?</strong> It’s fine with me. In the offseason when we do agility work, I work on running routes with coaches.</p>
<p><strong>People might be surprised to know you ... ?</strong>&nbsp;When I was about 4 years old, I got diagnosed with lazy eye and had to wear a patch for a while. Now I just wear one contact in my left eye.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>AND FINALLY</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Three words to describe (football) coach Mike Junko?</strong> Crazy, energetic, passionate.</p>
<p><strong>How do you think he’ll feel about the crazy tag (laugh)?</strong> He just has another gear and excitement that most people don’t have. Like, we’ll be just stretching before practice, and he’s already screaming, dancing, putting music on.</p>
