<h1>Five things to know about the Lightning, Canadiens and Red Wings, the Penguins' opponents this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Penguins will have their busiest stretch in some time this week when the face Tampa Bay (Tuesday), Montreal (Friday) and Detroit (Sunday) as part of a four-game homestand. Here are some things to know about the teams that will visit PPG Paints Arena.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Tampa Bay’s&nbsp;Ryan McDonagh will be out for a bit —</strong> Coach&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/lightning/2020/02/08/lightnings-ryan-mcdonagh-will-miss-at-least-a-couple-of-weeks/" target="_blank">Jon Cooper said</a> the veteran defenseman will be out for at least a couple of weeks with a lower body injury after blocking a shot with his right leg when these teams met last week in Florida.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McDonagh’s statistical production has slowed a bit from last season, when he set a career high with 46 points. He has just a goal and 11 assists in 48 games. He remains an important piece for Tampa Bay on the blue line, though, averaging a hair under 21 minutes of ice time per game&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. Montreal is hot —</strong>&nbsp;The Penguins’ 3-2 overtime win over the Canadiens at home on Jan. 4 was the fifth of eight consecutive losses for the visitors, a streak that straddled the New Year. That cost them quite a bit in the standings, but they’ve made up a lot of ground lately, winning seven of their last nine games. Four of those wins have come in overtime or a shootout, too, proving this team can compete in tight games the same way the Penguins have for much of the season. They still have a ways to go to get back into serious playoff contention, but they’re worth taking seriously.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Thank Carey Price —</strong> The Montreal bellcow of a goalie is as responsible as anyone for that performance in close ones. He’s allowed two or fewer goals in four of his last five starts, two of which went to extra time. It’s been a promising streak in what’s been a fairly mediocre campaign for the 32-year-old mainstay. He’s 21st in save percentage at .913 and 19th in goals against average at 2.69.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;Ilya Kovalchuk has fit in well —&nbsp;</strong>They well-traveled Russian veteran has looked re-invigorated since signing with Montreal on Jan. 3. He has six goals and six assists in just 15 games, and they’ve come in big spots, too. In just the past week, he scored the game-winner in overtime.</p>
<p>That was Saturday, and followed his shootout winner Tuesday at New Jersey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s like we’ve suddenly been transported back to the 36-year-old winger’s NHL heyday in the late aughts, before his five-season stint in Russia’s KHL and unremarkable tenure with the Los Angeles Kings, which ended in December after he put up just 43 points in 81 games with the club over two seasons.</p>
<p><strong>4. Detroit is really, really bad offensively —</strong> Look, you’d expect any team sporting a&nbsp;14-39-4 record to have its problems scoring. The Red Wings, however, have almost turned their ineptitude into performance art. Their 116 goals on the season are last in the league by a huge margin. The Los Angeles Kings are a whopping 21 goals ahead at 137. The situation has only gotten worse as the season has gone along, too. Detroit is in the middle of a 2-9-1 stretch in which they’ve scored two or fewer goals nine times and have been shut out three times. That’s about all you really need to know about this bunch.&nbsp;</p>
