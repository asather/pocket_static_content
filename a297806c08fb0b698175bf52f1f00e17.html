<h1>MLB schedule released amid increasing concerns over COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Strip sports down to the binary code that makes them what they are, and there’s a unique sort of duality there. Somebody wins, others lose. Boxers tap gloves to show respect, then one tries to knock the other unconscious.</p>
<p>Pittsburghers will wear Steelers jerseys to church, spend three hours every fall Sunday swearing at the television and hoping T.J. Watt or Bud Dupree decapitate an opposing quarterback, and the combatants finish by embracing for a postgame prayer.</p>
<p>It’s not right or wrong, good or bad. It’s just ... sports.</p>
<p>The same dichotomy has been playing out within Major League Baseball over the past couple days. As concerns over the COVID-19 pandemic have grown louder, the league rolled out every club’s 2020 schedule Monday during a live special on MLB Network.</p>
<p>Sixty games? At this point it feels arduous to get through tomorrow without another anvil of bad news dropping on somebody’s head.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping we’re sitting here in September saying, ‘Whew, that was great,’” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said Monday afternoon before offering another yin-and-yang type of take.</p>
<p>“I’m staying optimistic,” Shelton added, “but I’m also staying day-to-day.”</p>
<p>There are multiple reasons why MLB's latest sewing project has started to come apart at the seams, but the biggest one has been ongoing issues with its COVID-19 intake testing, which has gone worse than expected.</p>
<p>The Astros and Nationals canceled their workouts Monday because test results had not come back and they didn’t want to put anyone in harm’s way. The Oakland Athletics, meanwhile, are yet to hold a full team workout for the same reason, with general manager David Forst describing himself as “frustrated.”</p>
<p>Other teams had to postpone workouts, while the Angels made their most recent one optional when those who were supposed to perform COVID-19 tests for the club never showed up for work.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pirates have yet to begin operations at PNG Field in Altoona — their satellite facility for summer camp — because those testing results are not yet complete, either.</p>
<p>“Altoona has probably been more affected than we’ve been affected here,” Shelton said. “We’re still waiting on their results. We still have a couple pending here. I think as we’ve seen, there have been teams that have had [many issues]. We have not.”</p>
<p>As Shelton said, the Pirates have fared better than most. Nobody thus far has opted out, the manager said, while reliever Blake Cederlind and outfielder Socrates Brito are the only two players <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/05/Pirates-Blake-Cederlind-Socrates-Brito-test-positive-COVID-19-Derek-Shelton/stories/202007050138" target="_blank">who tested positive</a> and gave the Pirates permission to share their results.</p>
<p>Neither was expected to start the season with the major league club.</p>
<p>"We’re going to have things that don’t go as well as we wanted here and throughout the league," Shelton said. "And there are going to be things that go really well that we didn’t think about.</p>
<p>“The big thing is, we have to have the ability to adjust, not only here in Pittsburgh but in every single market and the league. As long as we continue to learn, I’m going to stay optimistic about how we’re going to go about it."</p>
<p>In a practical sense, the Pirates will go about it this season against a bunch of familiar opponents and geographical rivals.</p>
<p>They will open the season with a three-game set in St. Louis July 24-26 before returning to PNC Park for the home opener on July 27 against the Brewers. Likely for the entire season, there will be no fans in the stands.</p>
<p>The Pirates, with Shelton taking the reins, don't have it easy. They have the second-toughest start to the season of any MLB team, with their opponents through Aug. 6 boasting a .568 winning percentage in 2019.</p>
<p>By the end of August, the Pirates will have played the Brewers 10 times, plus six against the Cardinals, four against the Reds, four against the Twins and three against the Indians.</p>
<p>The Cardinals, Brewers and Twins were playoff teams a year ago, while the Reds rebuilt in the offseason and Cleveland won 93 games and missed out on the second wild card in the American League.</p>
<p>"Each and every day, you’re playing a big league ball club, so you’ve got to bring it," Adam Frazier said. "In the past, we haven’t done a whole lot against the lesser teams in the standings anyway."</p>
<p>The schedule reveal offered a tantalizing sense of normalcy. There will be a trip to Wrigley Field July 31-Aug. 2, followed by a two-game swing in Minnesota, where Shelton will visit his former employer and good friend Rocco Baldelli, the Twins manager.</p>
<p>The final half of September features 11 straight against division opponents before a season-ending series in Cleveland Sept. 25-27.</p>
<p>There should also be plenty of intrigue within the division, where 40 of 60 games against those teams should theoretically produce plenty of day-to-day movement in the standings.</p>
<p>But all of that feels like eons away given what has transpired since MLB clubs reconvened for summer camp.</p>
<p>Testing has been a disaster. Prominent players such as Ryan Zimmerman, David Price, Felix Hernandez and Nick Markakis have opted out. Ian Desmond did so, too, and provided an eloquent and damning rebuke of baseball in explaining his decision.</p>
<p>Atlanta's All-Star first baseman, Freddie Freeman, tested positive, and we've heard about his journey from his wife, Chelsea, who said COVID-19 hit her husband "like a ton of bricks."</p>
<p>If that wasn't enough to keep the wagon wobbling, one of the game's biggest stars — Mike Trout of the Angels — has expressed skepticism whether this can safely happen, and his mom chimed in via Twitter by urging everyone to wear masks.</p>
<p>Perhaps it will all go away. Hot spots will cool down, and common sense will prevail. But what evidence have we seen to indicate that's how this will go?</p>
<p>To this point, we've seen squabbling over money, not nearly enough thought given to the testing portion of the health and safety protocols and the release of a 60-game schedule that feels more like a wish list than a preview of what's to come.</p>
<p>Then again, with the duality of sports and new stuff happening every 24 hours, it's hard to reach any sort of definitive conclusion.</p>
