<h1>With future in mind, Derek Shelton is giving out opportunities to his players</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Much of the conversation surrounding the Pirates revolves around the future.</p>
<p>This current team was 13-26 entering Tuesday, among the worst records in Major League Baseball. So the obvious question from that is: what’s next? Which players on this roster can contribute to a winning one in years to come, and which can not?</p>
<p>These are calculations the Pirates are making, too.</p>
<p>“It's more (about) shaping the roster, in terms of our expectations of guys, what their functionality is defensively and offensively, and then just continuing to get better,” manager Derek Shelton said Tuesday, prior to the Pirates’ matchup with the Chicago White Sox. “We have to continue to isolate on specific developmental tools for these last 20 games, so we can make decisions and have conversations going into the offseason.”</p>
<p>The evidence of that can be seen before every game, when the Pirates release their lineups. On Tuesday, for instance, usual left fielder Bryan Reynolds started in center. Usual infielder Adam Frazier was in left.</p>
<p>The way Shelton sees it, this gives him the opportunity to both see what they can do at their secondary positions defensively, while also allowing him to start a lineup with Frazier, Reynolds, infielders Kevin Newman and Erik Gonzalez and third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes all at once.</p>
<p>The point isn’t necessarily that any or all of them will be moving positions, but it’s all part of the evaluation process for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Because, sure, there are past sample sizes to work from, and those would tell the Pirates that Reynolds, Frazier and Newman are more valuable than what their 2020 offensive outputs have shown. That would also ignore Gonzalez, though, who has burst onto the scene this season after an injury-plagued 2019. Hayes, who will surely be around for multiple years to come, is his own different animal.</p>
<p>Basically, the Pirates are trying to get as many looks on as many players as possible in 2020, so they can make the most informed decisions about their roster this offseason and beyond. The small sample so far this season isn’t nearly enough to feel confident about much. The full 60-game season might not be, either, but all the Pirates can do is their best to give players opportunities to prove themselves with frequency.</p>
<p>That’s not to mention that they’re trying to win games, too. Shelton emphasizes growth and improvement of his team often, and the only way to know who will and won’t improve the rest of the season is to play the games.</p>
<p>“The one thing that stands out for me is that we’ve played hard for 40 games, or whatever it is,” he said. “That’s one of the things that we continue to talk about and is expected from our group. This group gets after it every night. They put themselves in a position to win almost every game. We’ve talked about finishing games and we're getting closer to being able to do that. ... We're going to play the last 20 (games) and most of the teams we’re playing (will be) fighting for playoff spots. That’s going to be good growth for our players. There's going to be times in the future when we’re that team, and we need to have that intensity, so I think it's going to be really good for our group.”</p>
<p><strong>Brubaker continues to adjust</strong></p>
<p>Those aforementioned opportunities are not limited to position players. Right-handed pitcher JT Brubaker has pitched in just about every role on the Pirates’ pitching staff, beginning the season in the bullpen before moving into a piggyback starter’s situation and now lengthening out to pitch five innings in each of his last two starts.</p>
<p>To this point, Brubaker has been steady. He’s given up some runs and gotten into some jams at times, but in his five starts, he hasn’t allowed more than three earned runs and carries a 3.96 ERA for the season so far.</p>
<p>With the prominent role Brubaker has taken on, it’s easy to forget this is his rookie season.</p>
<p>“I feel like I've done pretty well. It's definitely been a learning curve,” Brubaker said. “That's the one thing I am going to take from this year, just going out there and learning something new and just taking something from each start. Making myself better for the next start out.”</p>
<p>As of now, those lessons have been varied. He’s using his slider more frequently, pairing it with his two-seam fastball to provide different looks to hitters. Plus, he’s recognized that he can get more outs in the zone, giving him the confidence to throw that slider for strikes, as opposed to getting a hitter to chase it out of the zone for a strikeout.</p>
<p>He has paired that with learning major-league habits off the field: weight room adjustments, arm care, etc.</p>
<p>Like the position players, Brubaker is attempting to establish himself as a prominent pitcher with the Pirates in the years to come. Brubaker continues to focus on the develop from start to start, as would be expected. Shelton, though, understands that the development Brubaker has shown so far has already helped him make progress to becoming the best form of himself down the road.</p>
<p>“The opportunities that Brubaker’s gotten going from the bullpen to a piggyback into a starter’s role, and he continues to get better, and we continue to see him make strides going forward or getting better, and by doing that, it’s allowing us to have different teaching points in terms of his maturation,” Shelton said.</p>
