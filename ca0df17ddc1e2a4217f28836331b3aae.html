<h1>Starting nine: COVID testing, Cole Tucker's swing and Steven Brault's shoulder</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here’s a summary of some of the most interesting points from the Pirates players who spoke in Zoom conference calls at PNC Park during summer camp on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>1.&nbsp;</strong>Reports early in the week around Major League Baseball were not promising in regards to the testing being done for COVID-19. The Houston Astros, San Francisco Giants and Washington Nationals all canceled workouts due to a delay in results. Others pushed workouts further back in the day, as teams around the league raised concerns over MLB’s testing policies.</p>
<p>While those things are certainly concerning, the Pirates, at least as far as some players know, have not experienced those problems.</p>
<p>“I asked that question today when we came in,” shortstop Cole Tucker said. “I was like, 'Are we having the same issues that I'm seeing on Twitter?' And from all I've heard, we're doing a really good job and getting them back quickly.”</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Tucker is in a unique spot during this summer camp. While he is well-respected within the organization, he seems to be on the outside looking in with regards to the 2020 starting lineup. Shortstop Kevin Newman is the everyday shortstop for now.</p>
<p>While some have posited that Tucker could or should switch positions to find a hole for him to break into the lineup, that has not yet happened. Tucker says he is still playing shortstop exclusively, though he won’t rule out playing elsewhere as a possibility.</p>
<p>“I still believe I have the tools to be an everyday shortstop, however that may shake out,” Tucker said. “I’m here to help the team win in whatever capacity that is. If they want me to play center field, I’ll play center field. If they want me to be the bat boy, I’ll be the bat boy. And I’m going to try my hardest to be really good at all of those things.”</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;</strong>In that same vein, Tucker was asked if it is weird competing with Newman for the same position, especially since the two Arizona natives have been friends for nearly 10 years at this point.</p>
<p>As one might expect, Tucker shooed this notion away, saying he is capable of being happy for Newman and himself at the same time and that the two still hang out frequently in the offseason.</p>
<p>“It’s a weird concoction of friendship, but we make it work,” Tucker said.</p>
<p><strong>4.&nbsp;</strong>From one of his friends to another, Tucker was also asked to discuss the progress of right-hander Mitch Keller. Specifically, after rising through the minor-leagues with him, Tucker was asked how Keller responded to struggling more than he has in the past during the 2019 season, Keller’s first foray into the MLB.</p>
<p>“I think he was frustrated, and I think he was even more frustrated because he wasn’t pitching as bad as the vanilla numbers looked,” Tucker said. “Like if you looked into his deeper numbers ... he felt like he showed better than what showed up on the scoreboard or on the little ticker on ESPN.</p>
<p>“I think there’s still a ton of reason to have optimism about Keller because his stuff’s crazy, he works his tail off and he’s a great human being. I think the sky’s the limit for him. I’m excited to play behind him and to watch him deal for a really long time. He feels good. He feels healthy. And I’m excited about this summer for him, especially.”</p>
<p><strong>5.&nbsp;</strong>While those friendships are great for Tucker in terms of his comfort in the Pirates’ clubhouse, the reality of summer camp is that the Pirates are trying to get as much work in as possible in a very limited amount of time. That means Tucker (and every other player) is separated from his position group mates frequently in order to get as many reps in as possible during his workout time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, it means that some groups can be a bit shorthanded. On Tuesday, for instance, the Pirates spent a good amount of time drilling the infielders on double plays and relays from outfielders. For the latter part, that meant baseball operations special assistant Jamey Carroll, who joined the Pirates coaching staff for summer camp, was playing left field.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We're just making due and making it happen on the fly,” Tucker said. “And we know it's different for us as Pirates but it's different for the Cubs, the Brewers, everyone else we're ever going to play. So we're all in the same boat and we're just trying to get through it.”</p>
<p><strong>6.</strong> The other potential problem is that it can be hard to build a cohesive clubhouse with players separated most of the time, only interacting with some teammates as they pass by each other on the field, one leaving the park and the other just arriving.</p>
<p>Tucker equated it to elementary school, when teachers switch up seating charts, in part, to ensure students are making new friends with new people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m being asked to branch out and do some more,” Tucker said. “But I think that’s going to make us a better team and a more cohesive team as we get through the season. It’s new, and it kind of has that first-week-of-school feel, kind of like I alluded to earlier, and it’s fun.”</p>
<p><strong>7. </strong>Steven Brault has been using summer camp to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/07/steven-brault-chad-kuhl-pirates-fifth-starter-competition/stories/202007070086" target="_blank">get back to full health</a> after returning from a shoulder injury that took him out of spring training. That is still a work in progress, as are Brault’s mechanics in general. He has made a concerted effort to shift his delivery to take some of the strain off his left throwing shoulder.</p>
<p>He said that after his MRI that confirmed the shoulder strain, he took six weeks to work on getting stronger before he even touched a baseball. From there, it was six more weeks before he began throwing off a mound.</p>
<p><strong>8. </strong>With that, Brault has also taken steps to try to protect his shoulder from repeating the same injury in the future, in addition to simply working on his physical strength.</p>
<p>One of those is shifting his arm angle so his hand is pointing up more than out. He is also trying to keep from leaning over during his delivery and emphasizing a strong front leg, pushing back when he places it down as opposed to falling forward.</p>
<p>All are in an effort to maintain his health as he continues to work toward the season, and Brault said most of his small changes were to his lower body that will hopefully add up to make a big difference for his shoulder.</p>
<p><strong>9.&nbsp;</strong>Many of those adjustments for Brault came during the down time, which he spent in Pirate City, along with several other pitchers and bullpen coach Justin Meccage.</p>
<p>That, really, was a benefit of the layoff for Brault. He wasn’t just rushing to get healthy as quickly as he could for the start of the season. He was learning more about his body and the reasons that some things hurt and others don’t.</p>
<p>“Everything we're doing is trying to prevent it from hurting, because it should, hypothetically, hurt, because it's a dumb movement that we're doing,” Brault said. “... I knew how pitching deliveries worked and I had a general idea of it, but actually learning all the specifics about it was very interesting."</p>
