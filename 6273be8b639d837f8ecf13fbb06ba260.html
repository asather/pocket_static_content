<h1>Vincentian beats Cornell for school's fourth — and final — WPIAL title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two days before playing for a WPIAL championship, the futures of Vincentian’s players were put in doubt after the small, private school announced it would be <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/02/26/WPIAL-basketball-championships-preview-2020-Petersen-Center-Vincentian-school-closing/stories/202002260135" target="_blank">closing its doors</a> at the end of the school year.</p>
<p>Thursday, Vincentian left no doubt as to which team is the best in Class 1A.</p>
<p>Vincentian put distractions aside and extracted its second title in three years and fourth overall by defeating section rival Cornell, 63-51, at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Angelo Reeves (12 points, 17 rebounds) and Ethan Embleton (11 points, 10 rebounds) had double-doubles for Vincentian (21-4), which led Cornell (18-7) by eight points at the half, extended its advantage to 17 points midway through the third quarter and coasted to the win.</p>
<p>Vincentian players were given the news their school would be closing during an assembly Tuesday, one day after the Royals beat defending champion Nazareth Prep in the semifinals. Vincentian, which was founded in 1932, is shutting its doors due to financial struggles.</p>
<p>“Hearing the news at school, it was definitely a shock,” said Embleton, a 6-6 senior forward. “But once we get in the gym, everything clears our heads. We’re focused on one thing and one thing only. Knowing this is going to be the last year Vincentian’s open, we want to go out on a high note, be No. 1 in the state and No. 1 in everything.”</p>
<p>Vincentian reached the PIAA final last year and is ranked No. 1 in the state, but before the Royals shifted focus to a state title run, they took care of WPIAL business against a Cornell team they split a pair of meetings with during the regular season. Cornell handed the Royals their last loss, 66-57, Feb. 7.</p>
<p>In the rubber match, Vincentian used a balanced scoring effort that saw seven players score at least six points. In addition to Reeves and Embleton, Matt McDonough scored 10 points, Nate Cullo nine, Alex Griggs eight, Priest Ryan seven and Trey Champagne six. The Royals used their substantial size advantage to hold a 49-30 rebounding edge. Reeves, a 6-6 junior forward nicknamed “Boom,” threw down three dunks.</p>
<p>“I felt like we were the aggressor all night,” Vincentian coach Tim Tyree said. “Boom did a great job on the boards, Ethan scored inside at will, and I thought we got big shots from Priest, Matt McDonough and Nate Cullo.”</p>
<p>Cornell lacked that balance, with Zaier Harrison and Isaiah Langston combining to score 39 of its 51 points. Harrison had 22 and Langston 17. Kaden DiVito, the team’s leading scorer at 20 points a game, was limited to eight. The Raiders shot just 35% (18 of 51) from the field.</p>
<p>Looking for its first title 2000, Cornell had a famous fan cheering them on courtside — Kentucky coach John Calipari. Cornell coach <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/02/27/John-Calipari-Kentucky-coach-Cornell-Bill-Sacco-Moon-WPIAL-championships/stories/202002270205" target="_blank">Bill Sacco coached Calipari</a> at Moon High School.</p>
<p>“I haven’t talked to him yet. I hope he stays,” Sacco said afterward.</p>
<p>Harrison, Langston and DiVito — all seniors — were in a jovial mood at the post-game media gathering. The three played a major role in the school’s success in basketball and football the past few seasons. Only two public schools in the WPIAL have a smaller enrollment.</p>
<p>“Getting here our last year and being able to experience this, it’s an amazing experience,” DiVito said.</p>
<p>It’s Vincentian’s last year, too, but in a different way. A huge win in the bag, the Royals hope to secure another a few weeks from now at the PIAA championships in Hershey.</p>
<p>“We have an opportunity to go down in history,” said Tyree. “Not just history of you were the 2020 champion. Forever. Because after this season, no one will ever put on a Vincentian jersey.”</p>
