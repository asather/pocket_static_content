<h1>Allegheny County considering modifying bar, restaurant order</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though the surge in COVID-19 cases continues in Allegheny County, the county’s health director is considering some modifications to the existing county order closing bars and restaurants for all but takeout or delivery of food.</p>
<p>“We are reconsidering the order and will make our decision slowly based on what we are seeing in our community,” county Health Director Dr. Debra Bogen said Tuesday during the county’s weekly COVID-19 online news conference.</p>
<p>She said she hoped to have some modifications to the order completed by Wednesday, the day the one-week order closing the bars and restaurants for in-person dining was set to expire. A prior order from a week earlier banning the sale of alcohol at bars and restaurants is also ongoing.</p>

<p>“I am considering modifying the event limits and restrictions for outdoor food and beverage service for restaurants,” she said. “I leave this open to change depending on our cases and the other metrics we consider in making these decisions.”</p>
<p>She would not provide details of what changes she is considering beyond that.</p>
<p>But asked later if there was any way the county could target troublesome locations that have had lots of people report they dined or drank there before testing positive, and letting locations that have no reports stay open, Dr. Bogen would only say she is working on changes to the order.</p>
<p>She and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald both lamented the surge of cases in the county.</p>
<p>“It was only 20 days ago that we had a day with zero positive [COVID-19] cases on one of our days,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>Since then, he noted, “we’ve had three days — including today — that have gone over 200 cases. We had weeks where we didn’t have over 200 cases.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said given the way the prior surge in cases rose over four weeks before it peaked, she said she does not believe the county will see a decline for a couple of weeks.</p>
<p>But the new cases continue to be driven by the same demographic and for the same reasons since the surge began nearly three weeks ago: people between ages 19 and 49 who went out to bars and restaurants or traveled out of state.</p>
<p>While those from 19 to 24 years old represented just 7% of all positive cases three weeks ago, that demographic now makes up 18% of all cases.</p>
<p>Those in the 25 to 49 age range represented just 34% of all cases on June 20, just ahead of those 65 and older, who represented 30% of all cases. But during the current surge, those 25 to 49 represent 39% of the cases. And with few new recent cases in the 65 and older group, they now represent just 20% of all cases.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said the county’s contact tracing teams — who try to interview everyone who has tested positive to find out who they’ve been in contact with and where they’ve been — have found that people have visited other community events or mass gatherings.</p>
<p>But, she said, “None of the other reported activities compare in magnitude to the number of times cases have reported going to bars or restaurants.”</p>
<p>She said last week among 347 new cases for which contact tracers have information, 117 said they visited at least one bar and 50 said at least one restaurant.</p>
<p>By comparison, she said, 36 said they attended a private party, 17 went to a retail store, 13 watched or participated in sports, and 13 had gone to a gym.</p>
<p>As the cases surge, hospitalizations have started to creep up, but not dramatically, and the death count has not yet surged, either.</p>
<p>Asked if she expected the death count to eventually rise along with the case count, Dr. Bogen said: “That is certainly my concern and one of the reasons that we put some of the mitigation effects into effect ... But boy, would I love to be proven wrong because I would love to see no more death from COVID-19 in our community.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen and Mr. Fitzgerald both said the idea of going back to either the yellow or red phases, which would involve completely shutting down wide swaths of businesses, is unthinkable.</p>
<p>“I am cognizant that we must balance the risk of infection with the risks that result from the mitigation strategies themselves,” Dr. Bogen said. “I will continue to apply the most current science and our data to inform our decision-making.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said he fully supports Dr. Bogen’s approach and the effort to do targeted mitigation, rather than a return to countywide restrictions across businesses.</p>
<p>“We’re a social people. We love our summer festivals. We love to be able to go out and have our block parties and all those things that bring people together. And those things have obviously been interrupted,” he said. “I don’t know that we could go back to a yellow or red.”</p>
