<h1>Penguins kick off annual Dads' Trip in Boston</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The faces in the photo are familiar. They’re just, maybe ... aged a bit.</p>
<p>A little graying hair here. No hair there. But you don’t have to squint too hard to see the family resemblance to the Penguins players when their father’s joined them for a team photo at TD Garden Arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>This week, during the Penguins’ two-game road swing to Boston and Detroit, the players will be accompanied by their fathers for the 11th annual Dads’ Trip. For a couple days, the men who sacrificed so that their sons could make it to the NHL will get to live out their son’s dreams in a very real way. They’ll join them for team dinners, sit together on the team plane and take part in some off-ice activities.</p>
<p>On Wednesday night, for example, they dined at Tresca, an Italian restaurant in Boston. Former Bruin Ray Bourque, who is a co-owner, came out to visit with the players and their fathers. Then, on Thursday, the dads traveled to Fenway Park for a tour of the storied ballpark.</p>
<p>“As I said to the players [Tuesday] morning, these guys have been not only their first coach but probably their most important coach all of their lives,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “It’s a great opportunity for us as a group of players, coaching staff and management team to say, ‘Thank you,’ to the dads for everything that they do.</p>
<p>“We all understand that they make huge sacrifices to help us get to where we are. I think it’s great on behalf of our ownership to provide the resources for us to do this every year. I know our players and our coaches really enjoy it.”</p>
<p><strong>Coaching carousel</strong></p>
<p>If this NHL season has taught us anything, it’s that no job is safe.</p>
<p>Just over half way into the season, seven coaches have been fired or forced out. The Golden Knights became the latest team to take a whirl on the coaching carousel. They fired Gerard Gallant less than two years after he led the expansion team to the Stanley Cup Final and won NHL Coach of the Year. He was replaced by Peter DeBeor, who was dismissed this season by San Jose.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s a reality of how competitive the business is,” Sullivan said. “There’s pressure to win in every city. It just seems in today’s game, there’s an elevated form of pressure on everybody that’s involved in the business, whether it’s managers, scouts, coaches, players.</p>
<p>“These guys are all good coaches. They’re well-prepared. I know how invested they are in trying to help their teams win. ... It’s an indication of how high the stakes are and the pressure that’s involved in winning in every respective city in the league.”</p>
<p>Sullivan has a unique perspective on coaching changes. When the Penguins fired Mike Johnston in December 2015, Sullivan was tabbed as the replacement. He took full advantage of the opportunity, helping lead the Penguins to back-to-back Stanley Cups in his first 20 months on the job.</p>
<p>Sullivan said taking over for an incumbent in the middle of the season can be a “challenge.”</p>
<p>“It’s not like you can come in and change everything,” Sullivan said. “I can only speak for myself. My experience was I tried to prioritize how I could affect some change and where I could affect the change. Then, slowly implement the strategies that I felt were best-suited for the personnel that you had.”</p>
<p><strong>Murray staying ready</strong></p>
<p>With Tristan Jarry in goal for Thursday’s game in Boston, Matt Murray is likely to get the nod on the second half of the back-to-back on Friday in Detroit.</p>
<p>The appearance will mark just his sixth start since the beginning of December. In the previous five outings, Murray is 4-1 with a .893 save percentage. Meanwhile, Jarry has taken a stranglehold on the top goaltending job. He leads the league in save percentage and goals-against average while becoming an All-Star for the first time in his career.</p>
<p>“I think Matt has been a great pro,” Sullivan said. “He has a certain maturity about him. I think he understands the business. He controls what he can. He’s got a great work ethic. He’s got a great approach. I think he has a great relationship with Tristan. I think he’s handled the adversities extremely well.”</p>
