<h1>Billy Porter goes for the gold and opening number at 2020 Oscars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was #OscarsSoPittsburgh from the start on Sunday.</p>
<p>The 2020 Academy Awards opened with Janelle Monae walking onto a re-created “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” set, changing into a red sweater and singing, “It’s a Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” Then she threw it off to join with Billy Porter —&nbsp;decked out in a floor-length gold coat and red satin jumpsuit —&nbsp;singing “I’m Still Standing,” before a number that celebrated many of the non-nominees.</p>
<p>The supposedly host-less ceremony at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles then moved into traditional co-host territory with Steve Martin and Chris Rock. Before the awards and opening, came the red carpet. And the most anticipated look came early in the night.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter, the Pittsburgh native who has traversed red carpets and earned wows for the last year, did not disappoint at the Oscars.</p>
<p>Wearing a custom couture creation by British designer Giles Deacon, Mr. Porter was an early arrival at the 92nd Academy Awards Sunday afternoon. Mr. Porter would be working later as a red carpet host for ABC’s broadcast.</p>

<p>The “Pose” Emmy winner told The New York Times that the outfit — which featured a sleeveless bodice with gilded foil feathers and a huge, sweeping printed skirt — was inspired by Kensington Palace and its golden splendor.</p>
<p>Sammy Ratelle styled Mr. Porter, who wore shoes by Jimmy Choo.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter became an instant fashion icon at last year’s Oscars, wearing a velvet tuxedo gown created by Christian Siriano. It put Mr. Porter on the map as the King of the Red Carpet, so dubbed by E! Network commentators early Sunday, and by the millions of people who made it Google’s most-searched fashion moment of 2019.</p>
<p>He went on to be the men’s ambassador to New York Fashion Week and won the Met Gala, according to Vogue, by arriving dressed as a Sun God and carried on a litter by six shirtless golden men.</p>
<p>Still, it was the 2019 Oscars look that started the conversation about Mr. Porter’s gender-fluid fashion and gave him a red-carpet platform to express his activism, particularly for LGBTQ+ causes. The gown and Mr. Porter were back in the news in recent weeks because he was photographed wearing it to film an episode of “Sesame Street” for HBO.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter&nbsp;— the Tony- and Grammy-winning star of “Kinky Boots” and 2019 Emmy winner — also wore a second, more streamlined Siriano look in 2019, to chat up last year’s nominees. He did not change Sunday, going from red carpet royalty to preshow interviewer still wearing Oscars gold.</p>
