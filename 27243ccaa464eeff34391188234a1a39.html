<h1>In COVID-19 response, VA's strengths and vulnerabilities come to forefront</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — As the virus spread, the national health care system sprung into action, inviting retirees back to work, shifting staff among departments, adding 4,000 beds across dozens of facilities and releasing a 262-page <a href="https://www.va.gov/opa/docs/VHA_COVID_19_03232020_vF_1.pdf" target="_blank">COVID-19 response plan</a> rooted in its “fourth mission”: outreach during national emergencies.</p>

<p>Yet the national network, run by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, also confronted&nbsp;long-standing&nbsp;staffing shortages, bureaucratic hurdles and a dearth in medical supplies plaguing the broader health care system. The department has been forced to temporarily pull back on recent efforts to allow some veterans to seek care at facilities outside the VA network.</p>
<p>The mammoth size of the VA’s health care system can be a blessing and a curse&nbsp;— the subject of fierce political debate in normal times. During a global pandemic, the VA is being scrutinized as the second-largest federal agency grapples to stop the virus’ spread among a particularly vulnerable population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, the virus has infected 1,602 VA patients and 419 VA employees, according to the <a href="https://www.publichealth.va.gov/n-coronavirus/" target="_blank">most recent data</a> posted on Wednesday.&nbsp;The Pittsburgh VA Healthcare System has reported two patient cases and one employee case. The first positive tests were&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/28/VA-Pittsburgh-reports-first-positive-test-in-patient/stories/202003280041?cid=search" target="_blank">shared with VA employees last week</a>.</p>
<p>The VA’s supporters tout the department’s agility, sharing workers and supplies among its facilities in ways individual private-sector hospitals cannot.&nbsp;The department deployed Mobile Vet Center units beginning in mid-March for care coordination and relied on tele-health services it developed years ago to connect with hard-to-reach veterans.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and the media “all suddenly discovering the VA” after years of criticism, said Suzanne Gordon, senior policy fellow at the Veterans Healthcare Policy Institute.&nbsp;“It’s good to have a national system in a national emergency.”</p>
<p>Ms. Gordon, who has written books about VA health care, said the pandemic shows the department’s worth after years of pressure to privatize its services and cut funding.&nbsp;She praised the VA’s move to temporarily pause its&nbsp;community care program, which allows&nbsp;veterans to seek care with private-sector doctors if they face long wait times or long drives to reach a VA provider.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The only wise thing the Trump administration has done in this context is to shut down the outsourcing of veteran patients into the civilian system,” Ms. Gordon said. “This kind of emergency just underscores the folly of this approach.”</p>
<p>The head of the Veterans of Foreign Wars said it was the&nbsp;“correct approach” for the VA to limit access for some in-person care at community providers.</p>
<p>“We understand the need for community providers to halt in-person, non-emergent care to veterans, and all patients for that matter, in order to lessen the curve of this virus sweeping our nation,” said B.J. Lawrence, executive director of the VFW Washington Office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Tele-health and telephonic medical sessions are good adjustments to current conditions, but VA must make accommodations for veterans who are unable to access these means of care,” he stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Concerned Veterans for America, a conservative group that has long pushed for privatizing the VA, said veterans would have fewer options.</p>
<p>“The VA should be working to remove barriers between veterans and their health care, not creating new barriers,” CVA Executive Director Nate Anderson said in a statement. “A blanket approach like the VA has proposed does not account for the unique circumstances facing many communities and their respective medical systems.”</p>
<p>Others have pointed out the VA’s staffing shortfalls and supply shortages as major vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Struggling to compete with private-sector pay and benefits, the VA listed 44,131 staff vacancies during the first quarter of 2020, according to the VA’s website.&nbsp;The occupations with the most vacancies were nurses, medical support assistants and medical officers.&nbsp;Last month, the VA put out a call for retired employees to help out with the response.</p>
<p>A VA spokeswoman would not say how many retirees the agency expects back or where the main staffing pain points are.&nbsp;In a statement, VA Secretary Robert Wilkie said called-back retirees would help “give the department surge capacity as needed.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Availability of medical supplies and testing is also an issue.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.va.gov/oig/pubs/VAOIG-20-02221-120.pdf" target="_blank">report last month</a> by the VA Office of Inspector General found 33 of 54 VA medical facilities reported inadequate medical supplies and equipment. The survey, conducted&nbsp;from March 19-24, found 12 facilities anticipated shortages of medication in the next 14 or 28 days. Pittsburgh’s VA facilities were not included in that survey.</p>
<p>More help could be on the way. The federal stimulus bill, signed by President Donald Trump on March 27, allocated nearly $20 billion to the VA. That included $14 billion for medical supplies and $2 billion to enhance its tele-health network.</p>
<p>Congress also has aired concerns in daily briefings from the VA. In a letter last month, the House Veterans Affairs Committee <a href="https://veterans.house.gov/news/press-releases/takano-roe-press-va-for-answers-on-coronavirus-response" target="_blank">posed dozens of questions</a> ranging from test kits to medical supplies and guidance issued to VA employees.</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, a member of the veterans committee, said the VA’s current challenge is not lack of money from Congress.</p>
<p>The VA’s “weaknesses would be the same that are true for every healthcare system right now,” Mr. Lamb said in an interview. “We don’t have enough beds, we don’t have enough ventilators, we don’t have enough masks. If we don’t fix that, and fix that fast, people are going to suffer unnecessarily.”</p>
<p><strong>Worn out workforce</strong></p>
<p>Like private-sector hospitals, the VA has a “workforce that is going to be stretched thin and worn down over time.”</p>
<p>On March 17, five unions representing nearly 350,000 VA workers wrote to Secretary Robert Wilkie, asking the agency to work with union officials to carry out response plans. Marilyn Park, legislative director for the American Federation of Government Employees, said “almost every facility short-staffed” and the VA is “forcing people to work exceptionally long hours without adequate rest.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Randy Erwin, president of the National Federation of Federal Employees, said in a statement, if the VA&nbsp;“cannot protect health care workers from COVID-19, this country will lose the ability to effectively treat the masses of people in this country that may become infected.”</p>
<p>The VA has also faced criticism for not having better plans to work more with the private sector. Its “fourth mission” states that the VA will strive to care for everyone, including civilians, during national emergencies — as it did during the 2018 California wildfires and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico.</p>
<p>But the VA’s inspector general report found fewer than half of the 54 surveyed VA facilities had&nbsp;plans to share ICU beds or personal protective equipment with&nbsp;community providers.&nbsp;</p>
