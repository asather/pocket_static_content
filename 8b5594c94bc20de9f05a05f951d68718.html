<h1>Penguins sign Western Michigan's Cam Lee to entry-level deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins waded into the college free agent market Tuesday, signing Western Michigan defenseman Cam Lee to a two-year, entry-level deal.</p>
<p>The contract begins during the 2020-21 season and will run through 2021-22.</p>
<p>“Cam is a good-skating, offensive-minded defenseman that fits the current style of play in today’s NHL,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “This signing adds more young depth at defense for us. We’re excited to have Cam as a member of the Penguins organization.”</p>
<p>Lee, 23, played four seasons at Western Michigan, tallying 18 goals, 67 assists and 85 points. The 6-foot, 190-pound blue liner ranked first among Broncos defensemen in points in each of the last two seasons, including this year when he posted 21 points in 26 games.</p>
<p>Originally from Ferguson’s Cove, Novia Scotia, Lee has a distinguished hockey bloodline. His uncle is former NHL goalie Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who appeared in more than 500 games and won the Stanley Cup with Anaheim in 2007.</p>
<p>“Dream come true!” Lee tweeted shortly after the announcement. “I am feeling so grateful to have this amazing opportunity with the Penguins organization. Thank you.”</p>
<p>The move should add some defensive depth to the Penguins’ prospect pool. The Penguins recently lost their top blue-line prospect, Calen Addison, in the trade that brought Jason Zucker to Pittsburgh. With Addison gone, some of the defensemen who are getting closer to the NHL are P.O. Joseph and Joseph Almari.</p>
<p>Lee becomes the second college free agent that the Penguins have signed this week, joining Dartmouth standout forward Drew O’Connor. This continues what’s been a trend under Rutherford. The Penguins have been willing to trade draft picks to maximize the Sidney Crosby/ Evgeni Malkin window. By picking up free agents from the college market, the Penguins are finding different ways to add depth and prospects.</p>
<p>Some of the other notable free agents who have come through the Penguins system include Conor Sheary, Carter Rowney, Zach Aston-Reese, Casey DeSmith and Jake Lucchini.</p>
