<h1>Key jailhouse witness in Wilkinsburg case received benefits for cooperating not previously revealed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A key jailhouse witness in the prosecution of the Wilkinsburg mass shooting received financial consideration and relocation services from the Allegheny County Police — information which was never before disclosed to the two defendants or their attorneys until Friday, 10 days before trial is scheduled to begin.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys for Robert Thomas and Cheron Shelton have asked the judge presiding over the case to dismiss the charges or find that the prosecution committed a discovery violation for failing to turn over what they believe is key, impeachment evidence to attack the jailhouse witness’ credibility.</p>
<p>The death penalty trial is scheduled to begin Feb. 3. Twelve jurors and six alternates have been selected.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski has not yet made any decision on the issue.</p>
<p>On Friday, he presided over a contentious hearing meant to determine what, if any, promises or guarantees had been made to the jailhouse witness, identified as Witness No. 3, in exchange for his testimony against Thomas at trial.</p>
<p>Casey White, who represents Thomas, told the court that on Monday night, he came across a recorded interview with Witness No. 3 that had been turned over to him in discovery in an unrelated case. In that recording, ATF Agent Neil Carman said to the witness, according to Mr. White’s motion, “’We are going to uphold our end, and we are going to do the best we can. There are guarantees in there ... that have already been talked about, and [sic] are hoping to [sic] more than what is guaranteed, depending on what is needed.’”</p>
<p>Mr. White argued to Judge Borkowski that he could not properly defend Thomas without knowing what a witness against him has been promised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini called to the stand Agent Carman, who testified that the only guarantee he gave the witness was that he would tell the judge about his cooperation upon sentencing.</p>
<p>“So I used the words ‘guarantee’ or ‘promise’ in that interview ... that I give to every one of my cooperating witnesses and informants,” Agent Carman said.</p>
<p>“In this instance, it was no different.”</p>
<p>The agent testified that Witness No. 3 told him he had information regarding the Wilkinsburg shootings on Feb. 15, 2018, as he was being transported to a court proceeding.</p>
<p>“Did you guarantee the witness a reduction in sentence?” Ms. Pellegrini asked.</p>
<p>“Absolutely not,” Agent Carman responded.</p>
<p>During cross-examination, Mr. White asked Agent Carman what he meant during the 2017 interview when he told Witness No. 3 he hoped he could do more for him than what had been guaranteed.</p>
<p>Agent Carman said he was referencing the safety of the defendant and his family members.</p>
<p>Mr. White then asked if the ATF had provided relocation or money to Witness No. 3 and his family.</p>
<p>Agent Carman said his agency had not.</p>
<p>But then he confirmed moments later that the Allegheny County police had.</p>
<p>Defense counsel had never before been provided that information.</p>
<p>At that point, Mr. White, who had been warned earlier in the hearing by the judge to keep his frustration in check, became visibly enraged.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski ordered the prosecution to provide to the defense the details of any benefits Witness No. 3 received from any agency. None of those details was revealed during the hearing.</p>
<p>The hearing then continued with questioning by Wendy Williams, one of the defense attorneys representing Shelton.</p>
<p>She made a motion to withdraw the death penalty against her client, alleging that the prosecution committed a Brady violation for failing to hand over discovery materials in a timely manner. A Brady violation occurs when it is determined&nbsp;evidence is withheld by the prosecution that could be viewed as exculpatory for a defendant or could be used by the defendant to impeach a witness against him.</p>
<p>Judge Borkowski told her to file it in writing.</p>
<p>During cross by Ms. Williams, Agent Carman said that he had written emails on behalf of Witness No. 3, which Judge Borkowski also ordered the prosecution to turn over to defense counsel.</p>
<p>Witness No. 3 faces charges of aggravated assault and other counts related to shooting into a crowd gathered at a Homewood vigil on Sept. 16, 2015. In that incident, a 3-year-old was wounded.</p>
<p>But Mr. White also said Friday that he obtained a recording of a four-minute interview with Witness No. 3 from March 2018, in which the witness admits his involvement in the death of 15-month-old Marcus L. White Jr., who was shot and killed during a family picnic in East Hills on May 21, 2013.</p>
<p>Mr. White told Judge Borkowski he objected to having not been provided that information as he prepares for trial in the Wilkinsburg case.</p>
<p>Ms. Pellegrini responded, “We have provided everything in this case. Other cases [the witness] may or may not have been involved in are not relevant.”</p>
<p>Witness No. 3, who the defense has said is cooperating in at least eight cases, has not been charged in the 2013 homicide.</p>
<p>“Was it promised to not prosecute him for the death of a 15-month-old boy?” Mr. White asked Agent Carman.</p>
<p>“No,” the agent replied.</p>
<p>“Even though he confessed to the murder, do you know why he wasn’t charged?” the defense attorney continued.</p>
<p>Ms. Pellegrini objected before Agent Carman could answer.</p>
