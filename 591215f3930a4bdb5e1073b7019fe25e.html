<h1>Pittsburgh's Favorite Champions voting: Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Pittsburgh’s major pro sports franchises have won 16 championships since the early 1900s. Nearby colleges Pitt and Penn State have contributed a handful of national championships in football through the years, too. So which team is Post-Gazette readers’ favorite? We’ll find out in our Pittsburgh’s Favorite Champions series.</em></p>
<p><em>Today, we take a look at the Pirates’ five World Series-winning squads. Vote for your favorite below, and the winner will go up against readers favorite Steelers, Penguins and college teams in a new poll next week.</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>1909 </strong></span></p>
<p>The most dominant team in club history, and it’s not particularly close. Their club-record 110-42 record put them 6.5 games clear of the Chicago Cubs, 18.5 clear of the San Francisco Giants and at least 33.5 games clear of <em>every other team</em> in the National League that year. They outscored opponents by a whopping 252 runs, and franchise legend Honus Wagner had one of his best seasons, hitting .359 with 35 steals and 100 RBIs with the help of just five home runs. In the first seven-game World Series in history — their 1903 loss to the Boston Americans went eight games in a best of nine — the Pirates outlasted the Detroit Tigers and the notorious Ty Cobb for the city’s first championship of many to come.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>1925</strong></span></p>
<p>If the ’09 squad was the most dominant championship team, the ’25 team had probably the best collection of talent with four Hall of Famers: manager Bill McKechnie, outfielder Max Carey, outfielder Kiki Cuyler and third baseman Pie Traynor. It breezed its way into the World Series, winning the pennant over the Giants by 8.5 games and a plus-197 run differential. Only then did it face adversity by falling into a 3-1 series hole against the Washington Senators. What followed was, at the time, the greatest comeback in baseball history. Wins in Games 5 and 6 forced a decisive Game 7 in which the Senators twice held leads of at least three runs. Fortunately for the Pirates, some shoddy late-inning defense opened the door for Cuyler to drive in the winning runs in the eighth to deliver a 9-7 win that clinched the championship.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>1960 </strong></span></p>
<p>Before Bill Mazeroski’s immortalized himself with his epic walk-off homer in Game 7, the Pirates had been one of history’s great World Series underdogs. The New York Yankees were the dominant team of the era, with 15 series wins from 1947 to 1964. Their roster was stacked with established legends including Whitey Ford, Mickey Mantle and Yogi Berra. And they dominated this particular World Series statistically, outsourcing the Pirates by 28 and out-hitting them by 31. Still, the Pirates were able to keep enough of the games close to give themselves a chance, setting the stage for Mazeroski’s heroics, which tend to blur the reality of what a stunning upset the series really was.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>1971 </strong></span></p>
<p>Roberto Clemente was an important part of the ’60 team, but he tends not to be remembered as its star, as he was only beginning to show his Hall of Fame potential with his first All-Star appearance that season. All of that had changed by ’71. With 11 Gold Gloves and an MVP award in his trophy case, he’d achieved all-time great status and put an exclamation point on it in the World Series against Baltimore by hitting .414 and driving in a crucial run with a homer in the decisive seventh game. Plenty of others, particularly long-time pitcher and broadcaster Steve Blass, made important contributions. But if this season is remembered for one thing, it’s the finest hour of one of the club’s all-time greats.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>1979 </strong></span></p>
<p>They were family, and they had the best of past championship teams’ DNA in them. The dominance of the ’09 team with 98 regular season wins, the most by a championship-winning team since. The resiliency of the ’25 team, evidenced by the comeback from a 3-1 series deficit against Baltimore to win in seven games. And the veteran leadership of the ’71 team, this time shown by Willie Stargell, who hit .400 in the World Series and smacked the series-winning home run in the sixth inning of Game 7. Oh, and their unis were sick.</p>
