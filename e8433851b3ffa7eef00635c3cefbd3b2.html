<p>MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., was placed on lockdown for about an hour Friday morning after reports of an armed suspect outside the base, Air Force officials said.</p>
<p>The base was put on lockdown at 7 a.m. as local law enforcement and base personnel searched the grounds and “isolated the situation” at one of its gates,&nbsp;Lt. Brandon Hanner, a spokesman for MacDill said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No shots were fired and no one was injured, he said.</p>
<p>The lockdown was lifted at 8 a.m. and all gates were reopened except for the one gate, Tanker Way, officials said.</p>
<p>Further details about the incident were not immediately available.&nbsp;Officials said they would release more information later today.</p>
<p>MacDill is the headquarters for U.S. Central Command and U.S. Special Operations Command and home to the 6th Air Refueling Wing. More than 15,000 military personnel report to the base.&nbsp;</p>
