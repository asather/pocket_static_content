<h1>Pittsburgh City Council scrutinizes purchase of crowd control devices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety purchased $25,619 in bean bag rounds, smoke grenades and other crowd control devices at the beginning of June, raising the eyebrows of City Council members who only received the receipt Wednesday.</p>
<p>The department purchased 1,200 bean bags with Kevlar, 192 smoke grenades and 140 vapor grenades labeled CS — commonly referred to as tear gas — and 96 CS&nbsp;“multi” devices for pickup June 2, according to an invoice billed to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Zone 1 station.</p>
<p>The materials were purchased from the Jamestown, Pa.-based tactical munitions manufacturer Combined Systems Inc.</p>
<p>Council members approved the purchase amount in a 7-1 vote. Several council members said they questioned why the receipt was delayed in coming to the legislative body for approval. Councilwoman Erika Strassburger voted against.</p>
<p>Bill Urbanic, Council Budget Office director, said he was told by Public Safety officials that the delay in payment was a&nbsp;“clerical error” and that the department didn’t pay the invoice until Sept. 28.</p>
<p>Public safety officials said this type of purchase is&nbsp;“routine” and that the specific purchase was necessary because the department’s reserve inventory was down 30%.</p>
<p>“Due to a nationwide demand for such supplies and the impact on supply chains due to COVID, the bureau made a decision to purchase the items that were needed to restock the inventory. The supplier was only able to provide half of what was needed,” said Cara Cruz, department spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Such munitions, which can expire, are used in SWAT situations and training, Ms. Cruz said.</p>
<p>The purchase made on a p-card, or departmental debit card outside of any contract, exceeded the $5,000 threshold, which required council to waive the rules on its approval. Council voted 5-3 on the special rule waiver; Councilman Corey O’Connor, Councilwoman Deb Gross and Ms. Strassburger voted no.</p>
<p>“It’s really a question about whether we should be purchasing these things, honestly, and using them on our civilians,” Ms. Gross said.</p>
<p>Crowd control devices, often called less lethal weapons, came under scrutiny after&nbsp;protests and civil unrest swept the nation’s cities following the killing of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer who held his knee on the 46-year-old Black man’s neck for nearly nine minutes.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police deployed crowd control devices at some local protests, including during a May 30 demonstration that turned violent when two police vehicles were set on fire and multiple Downtown businesses were damaged.</p>
<p>An incident in which Pittsburgh police fired teargas crowd-clearing projectiles in East Liberty is the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/03/Pittsburgh-citizen-police-review-board-protest-east-liberty-tear-gas-floyd/stories/202006030102" target="_blank">subject of two investigations</a>. The June 1 demonstration on&nbsp; Centre Avenue was declared an&nbsp;unlawful assembly. Participants who stayed in the area said the demonstration remained peaceful; police said members of the crowd began throwing bottles and rocks at officers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The incident is under review by the Office of Municipal Investigations and the Citizen Police Review Board, which is investigating all police response from May 30 to June 1.</p>
<p>“The use of such materials is under review by the Community Task Force on Police Reform. Until their recommendations are issued and further decisions are made the Police Bureau must keep their emergency inventories supplied,” Ms. Cruz said.</p>
