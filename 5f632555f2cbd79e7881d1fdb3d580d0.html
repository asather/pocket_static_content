<h1>Tom Hanks, Rita Wilson feeling better; 'We can figure this out'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson are feeling better after being treated for coronavirus and Hanks offered some advice to those sheltering in place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The couple were self-quarantined in their home in Australia after being released last week from a hospital there, a representative for Hanks told CNN last Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanks and Ms. Wilson were in Australia for pre-production work on a film about singer Elvis Presley. Hanks is set to play Presley's manager, Colonel Tom Parker, in the film directed by Baz Luhrmann. Production on the project has been suspended.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Ms. Wilson captured some of what she called "Quarantine Stir Crazy" with a video posted to her Instagram of her transitioning from reading the sci-fi novel "Ender's Game" to rapping Naughty by Nature's 1992 hit "Hip Hop Hooray."</p>
<p>They have kept the public informed on their coronavirus experience: <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/15/us/tom-hanks-coronavirus-update-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">thanking the helpers</a> and providing <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/13/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-coronavirus-update/index.html" target="_blank">updates on their condition</a>.</p>
<p>"Well, now. What to do next? The Medical Officials have protocols that must be followed," the <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/11/entertainment/tom-hanks-rita-wilson-coronavirus/index.html" target="_blank">couple posted on Instagram</a> when they were diagnosed. "We Hanks' will be tested, observed, and isolated for as long as public health and safety requires. Not much more to it than a one-day-at-a-time approach, no? We'll keep the world posted and updated. Take care of yourselves!"</p>
