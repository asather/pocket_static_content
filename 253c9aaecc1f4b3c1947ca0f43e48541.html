<h1>Each side blames the other for derailed Levin negotiation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Both parties in the Levin Furniture acquisition negotiations are disputing which of them ended the deal that imperils the jobs of 1,200 employees and has left customers wondering if they will ever get purchased furniture that has not been delivered.</p>
<p>On Friday, Robert Levin, who sold the furniture and home furnishings chain to Michigan-based Art Van Furniture LLC in 2017, said Art Van had decided to close the stores and terminate all employees rather than proceed with a deal to sell the chain and Johnstown-based Wolf Furniture stores to Mr. Levin.</p>
<p>The decision to close the 44 locations in Pennsylvania and Ohio came after concerns about the COVID-19 outbreak had already closed the stores temporarily out of concern for the health of customers and Levin employees.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, a spokeswoman for Art Van said it was Mr. Levin’s representatives who decided not to go ahead.</p>
<p>“Art Van was notified by Robert Levin’s advisors on Thursday, March 19, that he was no longer willing to proceed with a purchase of the Levin business,” said spokeswoman Diane Charles in a statement.</p>
<p>“While we recognize COVID-19 is having a profound and unanticipated impact on all retail businesses, the assertion that Art Van is no longer willing to sell the business on the previously negotiated terms is false. Art Van stands willing to complete the transaction.”</p>
<p>Reached Sunday, Mr. Levin said the Art Van statement was not true, adding that “I am working tirelessly with my team to figure out how to move this forward.”</p>
<p>While Art Van officials and Mr. Levin had executed a Letter of Intent earlier this month, Art Van — which has filed for bankruptcy —&nbsp;is still current owner of the chain.</p>
<p>Ms. Charles later followed up with a second statement that the economic impact related to the COVID-19 outbreak forced the decision to suspend all store sales operations and eliminate some functions at the corporate office in Smithton, Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>“Due to continued concerns related to COVID-19, the closure of stores, and loss of corporate and warehouse personnel, we are unable to keep the Smithton warehouse open for deliveries or customer pick up at this time,” she wrote.</p>
<p>“We will provide further updates to Levin.com once we have them.”</p>
<p>The sudden closing surprised employees and has left many customers wondering if they will ever take delivery on furniture they’ve already purchased.</p>
<p>A sales associate at one of the Levin stores in Ohio, who asked not to be identified, said he learned of the closing Friday after reading a story about it online.</p>
<p>He contacted a supervisor who told him that he will be paid for his work through March 20 — but the check won’t come until March 31.</p>
<p>“It’s really left me out in the cold and I feel very betrayed by the whole thing,” he said during a phone conversation Sunday. “I don’t know where to go from here. I have no job and no money.”</p>
<p>Customers, meanwhile, say they’re running into roadblocks trying to get information about purchases and deposits they’ve made. According to a March 10 report on the law360.com website, the debtor attorney said Art Van held deposits for 70,000 customers totaling $35 million.</p>
<p>Elaine Pedicone of Gibsonia said she paid a $2,000 deposit in February at the Wexford Levin’s store for living room furniture she hopes to have for an upcoming move to a new house in Cranberry.</p>
<p>“I’ve tried all the different numbers and everyone has a recording that says the store is closed,” she said Sunday. “I don’t know who to contact. You’d think they would have a number to call.”</p>
<p>Andrea Turner, who lives outside Kent, Ohio, says she learned stores had closed only after she went online over the weekend to show a relative photos of the new bedroom set she’d made a $684 deposit on in February.</p>
<p>She said the Oakwood Village store’s site only displayed the Levin name.</p>
<p>“I am unable to find out if we can get our deposit back. The phone number for the store does not have a voicemail and the website does not have any contact information on it.”</p>
<p>She’s now disputing the $684 charge with her credit card company.</p>
