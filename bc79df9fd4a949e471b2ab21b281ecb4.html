<h1>I-279 HOV lanes closed because PennDOT doesn't have workers to operate them safely</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The HOV lanes along Interstate 279 between Ross and the North Side will remain closed indefinitely for safety reasons because the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has limited staff available during the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>Steve Cowan, spokesman for PennDOT’s District 11 that includes Allegheny County, said Thursday that operating the lanes requires personnel from the agency’s local traffic center and maintenance department. Traffic personnel are working from home and have limited access to all of the normal traffic cameras, he said, and a reduced number of maintenance crews are in the field due to the virus.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely a traffic safety issue,” Mr. Cowan said.&nbsp;“We need people from both of those staffs to open and close those lanes safely. We decided in the interest of public safety to leave them closed.”</p>
<p>In addition, he noted, the daily volume of traffic has been lower this week as a result of businesses being closed and people working from home.</p>
<p>The lanes, which carry traffic inbound in the morning and outbound in the evening, have been closed since Monday. &nbsp;</p>
