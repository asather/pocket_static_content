<h1>Sidney Crosby returns to Penguins practice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins center Sidney Crosby returned to practice Friday in Cranberry.</p>
<p>Crosby had not practiced with the team since he exited the July 18 intrasquad scrimmage at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex with an undisclosed ailment.</p>
<p>Before Friday’s practice, he got in work with backup goalie Casey DeSmith and skills development coach Ty Hennes on the second sheet of ice inside the team facility. Crosby was pushing himself so hard that the sound of his skates slicing into the ice could be heard inside the building’s main practice rink.</p>
<p>When Crosby walked over and stepped onto the main sheet of ice at the start of practice, Penguins teammates gave him a thunderous round of stick taps on the ice. One suspects the guys were playfully mocking their captain a little bit.&nbsp;He was back between Jake Guentzel and Conor Sheary on the top line at Friday’s practice.</p>
<p>In total, the star center missed two team practices and a pair of scrimmages over a six-day span. He skated on an individual basis Wednesday and Thursday.</p>
<p>Game 1 of the Penguins’ qualifying round series against Montreal is Aug. 1.</p>
