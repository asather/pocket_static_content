<h1>Here's the buzz on the winners of the Carnegie science fair</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The judges who picked winners for the 2020 Pittsburgh Regional Science &amp; Engineering Fair did not get to see the bees buzz or watch ocean agriculture in action. But it all made for fascinating reading.</p>
<p>The young scientists and engineers did not get to show their stuff at the annual fair because of the new coronavirus, but organizers at the Carnegie Science Center determined that some of the best and brightest among 900 student entries would have their day in the spotlight.</p>
<p>After first calling the whole thing off, the judges advisory committee found a way to honor winners and award scholarships in several categories.&nbsp;Among the winners was Aurea Hickenboth, 12, of New Sewickley, who turned her passion for working with her family’s beehives into the top project in the intermediate division.</p>
<p>“The Effect of Insulation on the Internal Temperature of Overwintering Honey Bee Hives” began with the premise that bees thrive in warm weather and their populations have been diminishing in winter due to colony collapse disorder. Her experiment was to insulate one hive and compare it to another that had no insulation in winter.</p>
<p>Her conclusion was that the bees in the warmer hive were more energetic during the winter months, but that bees in both hives were adept at creating warmth on their own.</p>
<p>Aurea, who represented&nbsp;the St. John Paul II Homeschool Co-op, will be honored with the other awardees at the 24th annual <a href="http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.com/carnegie-science-awards/" target="_blank">Carnegie Science Awards Celebration</a> planned for Sept. 17.</p>
<p>The fair is run by the science center's staff, while the judges advisory committee committee oversees the judging.&nbsp;Charles Vuckotich is chairman of the committee, a member of the center's board of directors and a senior project manager at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. He has been involved in administering the fair since 1992.</p>
<p>As he watched COVID-19 cause school and cultural closings, the original thought was that there would be no fair this year.&nbsp;He shared an email that stuck with him as judges and organizers were deciding what to do.</p>
<p>“On the bright side, we had how many students complete projects?” wrote Katie Mercadante, a judge and science teacher in the Montour School District.&nbsp; “These kids DID science. They learned something. COVID-19 WON'T take that experience away from them. Science fair or not.”</p>
<p>So 30 judges decided to look over the projects, 900 of them, in less than 30 days. Entrants provided a written summary, a research plan and, for the senior division entrants, papers on their projects.</p>
<p>"We did not get a presentation. We did not see any project boards. We did not see anything built,” Mr. Vukotich said. “It wasn't feasible with the time we had, and we didn't want to exclude anyone from consideration who did not have access to materials or technology.</p>
<p>“I would have loved to have talked to some of these kids, having just read their papers. The young lady who did the project on the bees — I will get to meet her when we have the Carnegie Science Awards and ask her about it. That was fascinating.”</p>
<p>Mr. Vukotich said the experienced judges looked for “originality, creativity in thinking and something that shows that spark of scientific curiosity and knowledge. All of these kids are good students, but we are looking for the top of the top."</p>
<p>An idea “that stuck out as being unique” and earned a $1,000 scholarship for Bana AlMoussa of Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy was her analysis of men’s roles in menstrual practices in far-west Nepal.&nbsp;Judges were impressed that she took a subject of interest to her and approached it like a social scientist.</p>
<p>“I have some background in oral history and using qualitative data and oral history in combination with statistical data,” Mr. Vukotich said. “She learned the techniques and used them in an appropriate way.”</p>
<p>The other winner of the Robert M. Thompson Jr. and Diane V. Thompson Scholarship was Emma Waldron of Pittsburgh Allderdice High School, who studied the effects of pesticide on the growth of an amphibian fungal pathogen, a microorganism that can cause disease.</p>
<p>Mr. Vukotich also mentioned cancer research by Emily Jeong of Pittsburgh Allderdice and a creative approach used by Andrew Ni and Amish Sethi of Pine-Richland High School to study genetic biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.</p>
<p>Engineers were impressed by the work of Natalie McGhee, a Mt. Lebanon High School 10th-grader who studied ocean hydroponics. Her first two prototypes had problems. “And then she built a third one, which works,” he said.</p>
<p>Natalie said via email that she wanted to take on a potential game-changing challenge.</p>
<p>“”Modern agriculture currently takes up a substantial portion of land and freshwater resources, which will be desperately needed in the coming decades,” she said. “Therefore, I decided to tackle designing a method of ocean-surface agriculture.”</p>
<p>Her prototypes were designed to collect and distill seawater using heat from the sun, trap the distilled fresh water and use it to grow crops hydroponically.&nbsp;The system is designed to work without electricity, so that is friendly to the environment.</p>
<p>“Hundreds of students put countless hours into their projects, which tackled some serious scientific topics like cancer research, cyber security, climate change and so much more,” science fair director Nicki Wood said. “While we’re sad they couldn’t present their research in person due to social distancing restrictions, we’re thrilled to have found a way to virtually judge each project and recognize their hard work.”</p>
<p>Among the awardees were 29 high school students who were offered scholarships totaling more than $400,000 at Carlow University, Gannon University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Saint Vincent College, Seton Hill University and Pitt-Bradford.</p>
<p>The top winners and their projects were:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Maya Gelman, Community Day School (junior division): tested bicycle braking methods to minimize brake overheating.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Aurea Hickenboth, Saint John Paul II Homeschool Co-op (intermediate division): effect of insulation on the temperature of overwintering honeybee hives</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Emily Jeong, Pittsburgh Allderdice High School (senior division): effects of rapamycin and metformin on exosome secretion in cancer cells.</p>
<p>Engineering winners were:</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Natalie McGee, Mt. Lebanon Senior High School: explored sustainable methods of ocean surface agriculture.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Daniela Naumov, Pittsburgh Allderdice High School: impact of klotho methylation and sequence on traumatic brain injury (TBI) outcomes.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Andrew Ni and Amish Sethi, Pine-Richland High School: Functional genetic biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease and gene expression from peripheral blood.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Nicole Shigiltchoff, Winchester Thurston School: determining the loci of genes controlling allorecognition in addition to Alr1 and Alr2 using machine learning.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Annie Wang, Aquinas Academy: generalization of stars and bars for placing identical items into identical bins.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Victor Yang, Fox Chapel Area High School: intelligent device for eye disorder treatment.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; Maxim Yaskolko, Pittsburgh Allderdice High School: modulatory effect of vascular normalizing agents on tumor cells.</p>
