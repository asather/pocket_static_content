<h1>Pirates blow 4-run lead in 9th inning, lose to Brewers in extras</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Colin Moran had seemingly done enough to spur the Pirates to a win Monday.</p>
<p>After a 1 hour, 42 minute rain delay that broke up the second inning, Moran stepped up in the bottom of the second and launched a 1-2 slider deep to right field. For a while, that looked good enough on its own.</p>
<p>Left-hander Nik Turley allowed one run in the seventh inning before stopping the bleeding there. Again, Moran answered, this time sending a homer into the Allegheny River on a hop.</p>
<p>Then the Pirates loaded the bases after Moran’s home run, which led to a two-run single from center fielder Jarrod Dyson. They tacked on another run on a wild pitch. Surely, that was enough.</p>
<p>Once again, it was not.</p>
<p>The Pirates carried a 5-1 lead into the ninth inning, but the Brewers rallied against relievers Michael Feliz and Kyle Crick before Ryan Braun, laced a double down the left field line to tie the game.&nbsp;Right-hander Dovydas Neverauskas pitched a scoreless 10th inning but allowed the runner on second base at the beginning of the 11th inning to score on a double from Eric Sogard as the Brewers capped their comeback with a 6-5 win.</p>
<p>The game was the first glimpse at the Pirates’ piggyback situation in one of their starting rotation spots. Left-hander Steven Brault got the start, and the idea was to let him pitch around three to five innings before bringing right-hander Chad Kuhl out of the bullpen to pitch a few more.</p>
<p>Brault pitched the first two, giving up just one hit and zero runs before the rains came. That did, however, clear Kuhl to take the spotlight after the delay, which was a welcome sight for the Pirates.</p>
<p>The last time Kuhl threw a pitch in the majors was June 26, 2018. He’s spent most of the time since then recovering from Tommy John surgery. In Kuhl’s grand return, he came back in style. He threw 3 2/3 innings, giving up just three hits and no runs, striking out four batters along the way.</p>
<p>With two outs in the top of the sixth inning, Kuhl gave way to right-handed reliever Chris Stratton with a runner on first base. That runner, Brewers outfielder Christian Yelich, attempted to steal and was subsequently thrown out by Pirates catcher Jacob Stallings.</p>
<p>The first bullpen arms to enter the game were all right. Turley made things interesting, but after him, right-hander Richard Rodriguez shut down the eighth. Michael Feliz’s struggles led to Crick’s, though, and Neverauskas did fairly well given the circumstances. The Pirates simply didn’t have another response in them on this night.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like they didn’t have chances, either. The 10th and 11th innings, with a runner starting on second base, yielded some tough at-bats, which included missed bunts for strikeouts and missed opportunities with a runner in scoring position.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it was just that. The Pirates had every opportunity to beat the Brewers but just couldn’t hang on in the end.</p>
