<h1>Ke'Bryan Hayes ecstatic to arrive at MLB level: 'I believe I'm ready'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was all but confirmed Monday, but it was made official Tuesday.</p>
<p>After multiple months — if not years — of anticipation, the Pirates called up third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes to the major league roster. What’s more, he was placed in the Pirates’ starting lineup for their game against the Chicago Cubs, setting up Hayes’ major-league debut on the same day as his promotion.</p>
<p>It has been a bumpy ride over the past few months for Hayes. He joined the Pirates in spring training, was optioned to Class AAA Indianapolis, joined them again in summer camp, tested positive for COVID-19 and spent the last month or so at the alternate training site in Altoona.</p>
<p>None of that matters now. Brian Esposito, the alternate training site coordinator and Indianapolis’ manager, called him after a practice earlier this week and broke the news.</p>
<p>“Brian Esposito called me, and he told me tomorrow I was going to come up here and work out a little bit and get some at-bats against [Pirates right-hander] Mitch Keller, and then he was like, 'And then you're going to stay,’ ” Hayes said Tuesday. “And at first I was like, 'You joking with me?' Because he likes messing around with me a lot because I've had him two years in the minor leagues. But once he told me, I was ecstatic, I got chills in my body. I mean, it's what I worked for my whole life and you can ask anyone back home, I put 100 percent effort into getting where I am today."</p>
<p>Hayes called his mother, Gelinda, first, then his father, Charlie, a former Pirate, to break the good news. He said his mother cheered, and he suspects his father got a bit misty-eyed.</p>
<p>The excitement for Hayes surrounds his status as a prospect. After being drafted with the 32nd pick in the 2015 draft, MLB Pipeline ranks him as the No. 44 prospect in baseball and the No. 2 Pirates prospect, only trailing 2020 first-round selection Nick Gonzales.</p>
<p>The last three seasons, he won three straight Gold Glove awards at third base.</p>
<p>If there is a weakness in his game, it may be his bat. Even if that’s true, he hit .265 with 10 home runs in 110 games in Indianapolis, perfectly respectable statistics, and he feels he’s made strides on that side of the ball.</p>
<p>Hayes admits that his quarantine as a result of his positive coronavirus test set him back a bit. While he got back to 100%, he was unable to play in simulated games with Altoona and instead arrived early to practice to get all of his work in before yielding to the rest of the Altoona players.</p>
<p>“I believe I'm ready,” Hayes said. “When I was down there, my breathing was a little shaky because of being so stagnant in the room, but after a week and a half or two weeks of getting ground balls and that type of stuff, I started getting some at-bats and felt like I was seeing the ball really well. I was making hard contact. I was there for another 2, 2 1/2 weeks, and I was playing good down there, so I think I'm ready to go."</p>
<p>Hayes, the Pirates hope, is the next glimpse into the future. He may be the flashiest one to date, but he isn’t necessarily the only one. He’s come up through the minor leagues with the likes of shortstop Kevin Newman, infielder Kevin Kramer, now-outfielder Cole Tucker and first baseman Will Craig.</p>
<p>What comes to be of that group, and Hayes specifically, remains to be seen. The answer likely won’t be clear after the final 29 games of this season.</p>
<p>Hayes is confident, though. On Tuesday he talked about making a playoff push this season.</p>
<p>For tonight, he’ll just take in his debut. It’s been a long time coming.</p>
<p>“The first time after I got drafted, when I came up here to see the field and I was in the press box up there talking to the reporters and just seeing, I feel like we have the nicest ballpark in baseball,” Hayes said. “That day I just envisioned myself hitting on that field and taking ground balls and I got to do that yesterday for the first time."</p>
<p><strong>Alford added to active roster</strong></p>
<p>Along with Hayes, the Pirates added outfielder Anthony Alford to the active roster on Tuesday. They claimed him off waivers from the Toronto Blue Jays last week.</p>
<p>Before the 2018 season, Alford was a top-five prospect in Toronto’s system. He had some struggles in the majors during parts of the last three seasons, though, and was designated for assignment as a result.</p>
<p>He is still 26, though, so the Pirates have plenty of hope for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think he does have untapped potential,” manager Derek Shelton said Tuesday. “I’m excited for him to start working with our offensive group. He’s a really strong kid, really athletic kid. We’re not going to put any pressure on him. He's going to get the opportunity to play and get some at-bats. We’ll formulate a plan and kind of work from there.”</p>
<p><strong>Musgrove, Reynolds updates</strong></p>
<p>Right-hander Joe Musgrove continues to progress after hitting the injured list a few weeks ago with right triceps inflammation. Shelton hinted last week that Musgrove may ramp up to action in the majors instead of regaining his workload in Altoona.</p>
<p>Now, Shelton seems to believe that Musgrove is getting closer and closer, saying that the two of them will speak and get a status update. What that means for a return date is unclear at this time.</p>
<p>The same can be said for left fielder Bryan Reynolds, though his is an entirely different situation. Reynolds was placed on paternity leave Sunday. On Monday, he and his wife, Blair, welcomed a baby boy, Reese, into the family.</p>
<p>The Pirates are willing to give Reynolds the time he needs to be with his newborn and wife, and Shelton said he will confer with Reynolds on Tuesday to get a sense of his timeline for returning to the team.</p>
<p><strong>Brito update</strong></p>
<p>It’s likely that outfielder Socrates Brito will opt out of this season after his brother recently died from COVID-19. Brito, who had the virus himself in early July, had been working out at the Pirates’ satellite camp in Altoona.</p>
<p>If Brito does opt out, it would mark the second of the season for the Pirates (along with Hector Noesi), who issued this statement on Brito through a team spokesman:</p>
<p>“After the sad news of his brother’s passing, we have worked with Socrates to help him return home to be with his family. We are supporting him in any way we can, including working through the possibility of him opting out for the remainder of the season to give him time to be able to grieve with his family. Nothing has been finalized officially, but [we] will be sure to announce once it is. Our thoughts remain with Socrates and his family during this difficult time.”</p>
