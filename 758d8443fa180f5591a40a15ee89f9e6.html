<h1>Does the Pittsburgh VA have a protective equipment supply shortage?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For weeks, Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Health Care System officials have maintained that the system does not have any personal protective equipment shortages for staff, despite repeated complaints by staff that they are rationing masks, gowns, and even disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer because of the shortages.</p>
<p>“We do not have a shortage of PPE,” Pittsburgh VA spokeswoman Shelley Nulph said twice in the same email response to questions last week.</p>
<p>But <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/va-health-chief-acknowledges-a-shortage-of-protective-gear-for-its-hospital-workers/2020/04/24/4c1bcd5e-84bf-11ea-ae26-989cfce1c7c7_story.html" target="_blank">in a story in The Washington Post on Saturday</a>, Dr. Richard Stone, executive in charge of the Veterans Health Administration, which includes the VA, said supplies are in such short supply in some locations that some hospitals are at “austerity levels.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Asked Monday if the Pittsburgh VA was on austerity levels of supplies, Ms. Nulph would not answer directly, writing instead in an email: “VA is monitoring the supply levels at every facility every day to make sure facilities have adequate PPE for the number and types of patients they are seeing. And if a facility were to fall below stock levels, the facility would be cross-leveled by another VA facility or region.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh VA employees say that “austerity levels” sounds like what they are experiencing, at least at the Pittsburgh VA’s University Drive hospital campus in Oakland.</p>
<p>“They’re rationing everything now,” said one University Drive employee who asked to remain anonymous for fear of retaliation.</p>
<p>Dean Balouris, a union steward and transportation driver, said part of the VA’s restrictions is based on fears they won’t be able to restock.</p>
<p>“They don’t have a clear expectation of what their supplies will be going forward, so they’re conserving everything,” he said.</p>
<p>Jason Gearhart, a nurse’s assistant and union steward at the Pittsburgh VA’s H.J. Heinz campus in Aspinwall, said the equipment restrictions have had a real impact on staff.</p>
<p>“For staff to feel this extra burden of how they’re supposed to work [without proper equipment], it’s tough on people. They wonder: ‘Am I doing something that’s going to infect my family? Am I going to infect a patient? A co-worker?’ ”</p>
<p>The equipment restrictions at University Drive are an effort to make sure, in part, that there is enough protective equipment for staff at Heinz, which is home to the VA’s Community Living Center nursing home that has roughly 150 residents who would be susceptible to the worst impact of COVID-19.</p>
<p>For example, while staff at University Drive are given only one surgical face mask a week — unless it is spoiled or ruined in some way — Heinz staff get one per day.</p>
<p>Providing more supplies to Heinz staff seems to have worked so far: No Heinz residents have yet tested positive for COVID-19. There are 26 patients at University Drive who have tested positive for COVID-19, but the VA says it does not know if any of them acquired it once they were admitted.</p>
<p>The shortages the Pittsburgh VA was trying to avert systemwide by imposing restrictions at University Drive have not worked with gowns.</p>
<p>Late last week, a regional VA officer wrote a memo to Pittsburgh VA staff, obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, telling them that: “Last week at [Pittsburgh VA] there were only 2 weeks of yellow gowns available. The Agency is currently working toward obtaining reusable gowns. However, it is anticipated gowns will be difficult to come by for a significant period of time given the state of availability with gowns and other PPE nationally. At other facilities, nurses are wearing rain ponchos and garbage bags due to having run out of yellow gowns.”</p>
<p>Lori Lydic, president of the union that represents most of the staff at the Pittsburgh VA, said she understands the VA’s position.</p>
<p>The memo came as the Pittsburgh VA ordered that staff no longer wear a yellow, disposable gown when going inside the room of patients with two infectious diseases — VRE and MRSA — as a way to further conserve the dwindling supply.</p>
<p>Staff members and the union were upset with the directive because the Pittsburgh VA has made prevention of hospital-acquired infections like VRE and MRSA a priority in recent years. “Gowning up” — and then disposing of the gown before you left the room — was made a requirement for everyone who went into a room with a VRE and MRSA patient, helping to cut down on the spread of the diseases.</p>
<p>“Half the things they’re doing now, if we did them two months ago, you’d be fired,” one VA employee, who asked not to be named, said of the directive not to wear gowns in VRE and MRSA patients’ rooms.</p>
<p>Staff and the union complained about the non-gown rule — which does not apply to staff who must have close contact with patients, like helping them bathe — but the VA’s response to staff has been the same to them as it was to the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>“We are in compliance with [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidelines” on VRE and MRSA, Ms. Nulph said in an email response to questions.</p>
<p>The VA maintains that its requirement that everyone wear disposable yellow gowns with VRE and MRSA patients went over and above “standard precautions” that staff are required to take.</p>
<p>Ms. Lydic said she understands the VA’s position.</p>
<p>“You don’t need a gown to give a [MRSA] patient water” since you’re not having direct, personal contact, she said, and it did seem to agree with the CDC guidelines.</p>
<p>She said the changes with VRE patients are not as clear, though, and the union is trying to work with the VA on that since the union believes CDC guidelines for VRE are different than for MRSA and would still require gowns to be worn.</p>
<p>The restriction limiting most University Drive staff to one face mask per day — given to employees at the beginning of the week in a brown paper bag in which they’re supposed to keep it between shifts — has been troubling for staff, some of whom have taken to wearing homemade masks much of the week.</p>
<p>The joke around the hospital, employees say, is that after the first day “you’re better off using the brown paper bag as a mask” than the actual mask, because they’re so flimsy and not designed for reuse. Staff who work with COVID-19 patients do get a new face mask each day.</p>
<p>Asked whether the Pittsburgh VA has a face mask shortage, Ms. Nulph referred a reporter, again, to CDC guidelines that say limiting face mask use to some employees is acceptable.</p>
<p>Ms. Lydic said many of the disputes between staff members and VA management are because the VA has been poor at communicating with staff.</p>
<p>“They have made it very difficult,” she said of the Pittsburgh VA’s management. “The union is here to help them. I’ve gotten many questions because the VA hasn’t done a good job of sharing information with employees. And they tell me I’m not supposed to respond to emailed questions, and if I do” she’ll be disciplined.</p>
<p>The restriction on using emails is the result of <a href="https://federalnewsnetwork.com/workforce/2019/10/with-injunction-lifted-opm-tells-agencies-to-implement-trumps-workforce-executive-orders/" target="_blank">an executive order President Donald Trump signed in 2018</a> that appeared to allow the VA to tell union leaders not to use their VA emails to answer questions, an interpretation the union is challenging.</p>
<p>“They are putting our employees in danger because the union is not allowed to respond via email, or go around and explain things to employees like I would have done before” the executive order, she said. “We’ve been partners with the agency [as the union refers to VA management] many times over the years. But not this time.”</p>
