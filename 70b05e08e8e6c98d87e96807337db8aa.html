<h1>Ligonier golden retriever wins sporting group competition at Westminster dog show</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A golden retriever from Ligioner who won the Sporting Group at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show was the apparent favorite of the crowd in New York's Madison Square Garden Tuesday night, but the judge picked Siba, a standard poodle, as Best in Show.</p>
<p>A whippet named Bourbon was Reserve Best In Show, which is second place.</p>
<p>Grand Champion Hillock’s Jack Daniels is bred and owned by Tammy Tomlinson and was put through his paces in the Madison Square Garden show ring by professional handler Karen Mammano of Webster, N.Y.</p>
<p>The five-year-old dog — known as&nbsp;“Daniel” at home in Westmoreland County — was a clear crowd favorite as he raced around the ring. The applause was deafening when the judge picked the red-gold-colored dog over 32 other sporting dogs (basically bird-hunting breeds) who had won&nbsp;“Best in Breed” competitions earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Daniel responded by jumping up in the air, putting his big paws on the shoulders of his handler and giving her kisses. Ms. Mammano handled the big blue rosette ribbon to Daniel, who briefly carried it in his mouth.</p>
<p>“The judge heard the voice of the people,” said the FS1 announcer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Westminster show has been a February fixture in Manhattan, New York City, for 143 years.</p>
<p>In all that time, no golden retriever has ever won Best in Show at Westminster. And local people involved in showing dogs in American Kennel Club dog shows cannot remember a local dog winning what they call a&nbsp;“group one” at Westminster in the last 25 years.</p>
<p>In 2018 and 2019, Daniel won Best in Show 19 times at shows all over the country and he won first place in the Sporting Group 51 times.</p>
<p>This will be Daniel’s last dog show, Mrs. Tomlinson said, in a telephone interview earlier today. He’s the best dog she has ever bred — and she’s been doing it since 1971. Win or lose, she&nbsp;wanted Daniel to go out in a golden blaze of glory on what many think is the most prestigious dog show in the U.S., and perhaps in the world.</p>
<p>“This is our Super Bowl,” Ms. Mammano, the handler, said in a televised interview.&nbsp;“Daniel put on an amazing show tonight. When you come to Madison Square Garden, there is nothing like it.”</p>
