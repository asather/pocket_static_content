<h1>Paul Zeise: PGA Tour offers some hope for team sports returning </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cases of COVID-19 seem to be on the rise among college football, baseball and hockey teams. We have had reports almost nonstop for the last few days as teams continue to test athletes regularly.</p>
<p>The numbers rising is not a surprise, but it has led to very legitimate questions about what happens if there is an outbreak during a season. Do teams have to shut down and forfeit? Are players declared out for the year or at least two or three weeks?&nbsp;</p>
<p>These are great questions and we don’t have a lot of answers to them. There are some ideas about what has to happen, but there doesn’t seem to be a consensus. The Korean Baseball Organization has said that if they have a player test positive, they will shit down for three weeks, but if that’s the policy for sports here then we shouldn’t bother because it isn’t going to be worth it.</p>
<p>Players testing positive will happen — we know it will happen — and if “shut it all down for two weeks” is the answer, then there is no way to have a season of any kind in any sport in a reasonable time frame.</p>
<p>PGA professional Nick Watney didn’t feel very well Friday morning when he woke up and was preparing for the second round of the RBC Heritage in Hilton Head. He consulted with the medical professionals, was tested, and it was determined he was positive for COVID-19. He was then isolated and had to withdraw from the tournament.</p>
<p>A few months ago, this exact scenario was presented as one of the hypotheticals and almost universally the answer was the tournament would have to be shut down and all the golfers, caddies and event workers would have to be quarantined for two weeks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That didn’t happen, though, and the lessons learned from it are things that could come into play when team sports return. The tournament didn’t miss a beat. They played Friday and through the weekend and crowned Webb Simpson the champion after a record-setting performance.</p>
<p>The most important piece of information is that Watney was honest about not feeling well. This will be a key to any health and safety protocol in sports — and in just about any other walk of life. People feeling under the weather need to be honest about it and stay away from others.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And once it was determined that Watney was positive, he was isolated. Thats a huge piece of this — there was a protocol in place and doctors stuck to it. Plus, the medical people believe they could have caught this earlier in the week, so they are going to make some adjustments to the protocol for future events.</p>
<p>This is all new, so there is going to be a bit of trial and error to perfect the protocols. All of the sports can learn from each other and get better at dealing with COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Another important fact is that the PGA officials were able to pinpoint all of the people — and other players — that Watney had contact with. And they were able to isolate them until they could get tested, and all of them came back negative and the event went on without incident.</p>
<p>I realize that this isn’t the same as team sports and there are some other challenges in terms of keeping players separated. And, obviously, there is no contact in golf like there is in football, hockey and baseball. But we see soccer leagues starting up and baseball being played in other countries, so it does seem possible.</p>
<p>The thing we learned this weekend from the PGA Tour is that one or even a couple of positive tests should not mean everything has to shut down for two or three weeks. The player that tests positive needs to be isolated, and maybe the rest of his team and coaches need to be tested again.</p>
<p>If all goes well, the team can continue to play, albeit without the positive players. It isn’t ideal, but it isn’t impossible, either, and as we’ve seen from the PGA Tour this past weekend, the show can go on even if one or two of the performers are left behind.</p>
