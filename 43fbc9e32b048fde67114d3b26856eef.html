<h1>Sidney Crosby, of course, comes through with a big game after taking the blame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pro athletes try to avoid reading newspapers and listening to sports talk radio. Well, at least that’s what many claim. But one way or another, Penguins players heard — loud and clear — <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/01/Sidney-Crosby-Penguins-vs-Sharks-lose-again-injury/stories/202003010207" target="_blank">the comments their captain made in San Jose</a>.</p>
<p>“He’s our leader. It shows how much he takes it upon himself. He maybe said that, but it’s not him. It’s the whole team,” Marcus Pettersson said. “For him to do that, and kind of shift the focus onto him and let us play, it just shows his leadership. Then for him to go out and do the things he did today…”</p>
<p>Sidney Crosby came through with a goal and two assists Tuesday as the Penguins snapped their six-game skid with a 7-3 win over the Ottawa Senators.</p>
<p>Sure, Bryan Rust had a hat trick. Evgeni Malkin dished four assists. John Marino scored in his return to the lineup and Brian Dumoulin was a stabilizing presence in his. But this bounce-back victory had Sid’s fingerprints all over it.</p>
<p>Crosby had just one point, the goal he scored in a 5-3 loss to the Washington Capitals on Feb. 23, and a minus-8 rating during their losing streak. His line was out-scored, 3-0, during the three losses in California. In Saturday’s 5-0 loss in San Jose, Crosby missed an open net and finished with a minus-2 rating.</p>
<p>“I put it on myself,” he, unsolicited, told two Pittsburgh reporters that night. “I’ve got to step up. Key situations, you’re down like this and losing games, you need big plays, big performances. And I haven’t done that. So that’s on me.”</p>
<p>Crosby’s numbers, both in the box score and on websites specializing in advanced statistics, had dipped in recent weeks. But the scuffling superstar was far from the biggest problem as the Penguins dropped in the standings.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it’s not all him,” Rust said with a dismissive tone. “He’s a guy who’s got a lot of pride, takes a lot of pride in both his own success and our success. When things aren’t going the team’s way, he definitely gets on himself. You could see tonight, he goes to the cage. He was unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Crosby was also on the ice when Conor Sheary scored his first goal since returning to Pittsburgh. Crosby didn’t pick up a point on that play. But he drove the net and created chaos, and Sheary’s back-door pass hit Mike Reilly and went in.</p>
<p>After a falling Jason Zucker poked him the puck in the corner, Crosby pulled back to fake a slap shot, buying himself an extra split second. He took one step in then snapped a shot that found a way through Craig Anderson, making it 4-1.</p>
<p>Crosby picked up an assist on Rust’s power-play goal in the second period and Zucker’s goal in the third, giving him 800 assists for his career. Crosby is the sixth player in NHL history to reach that milestone in fewer than 1,000 games.</p>
<p>“It’s a nice number. I mean, it took long enough,” he said. “But I’m glad I got it.”</p>
<p>Crosby posted a plus-3 rating during his three-point night against the Senators.</p>
<p>After this game, Crosby was asked about his comments in San Jose and the impact they made on his teammates. Crosby, true to form, answered by talking about the Penguins’ effort and them being rewarded for “playing the right way.”</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan was more willing to comment on Crosby’s leadership.</p>
<p>“I think any time a captain and a player of Sid’s caliber takes ownership like that, it inspires the rest of the group to want to play for him. … I give all of our leaders tonight. I thought they all stepped up,” Sullivan said, also mentioning Malkin and Kris Letang. “That’s the type of response game we were looking for.”</p>
<p>Sullivan was referring to the Penguins at the end there, but he might as well have been talking about just Crosby. But, let’s be honest, was there any doubt he wouldn’t come through with a big night after what happened in San Jose?</p>
<p>“We knew it was only a matter of time. You could see it right away,” Pettersson said. “He wants the team on his shoulders. He thrives under that.”</p>
