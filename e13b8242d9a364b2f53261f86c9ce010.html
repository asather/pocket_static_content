<h1>With SATs optional, a college prep company is tested</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the worst of the coronavirus pandemic seemed to be over and Allegheny County entered the green phase of reopening, Hoon Kim thought it was safe to resume in-person instruction for students of his tutoring and test preparation company after months of online classes.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Prep bought temperature guns, face masks and gloves for its Shadyside and North Hills classrooms.</p>
<p>Instructors began learning how to gauge students’ responses to new concepts by reading the narrow window of faces not covered by masks.</p>
<p>But a week and a half later, an instructor’s sister was alerted by a contact tracer that she had interacted with someone with a confirmed case of COVID-19. Classes went back online.</p>
<p>After staff member tests came back clear, the company could have invited students into classrooms again, Mr. Kim said. But each major shift in instruction delivery methods is “a real shock to the systems of students and parents,” so remote teaching continued.</p>
<p>On a small scale, the back-and-forth for the dozen students enrolled at Pittsburgh Prep at the time demonstrates the challenges facing school districts as they resume classes this fall.</p>
<p>“There is no way that larger school districts who are not ready are going to find this to be in any way easy,” Mr. Kim said.</p>
<p>The past six months have disrupted Pittsburgh Prep’s students’ plans for college and threatened the business that is coaching them for the next stage of their lives.</p>
<p>Students who had been training for months to take college entrance exams saw tests canceled throughout the spring and summer. Nearly all universities made the SAT or ACT exams optional.</p>
<p>As a consequence, enrollment at Pittsburgh Prep plummeted.</p>
<p>“For the month of March, we had zero enrollments,” Mr. Kim said. Class sizes grew in June and July, but overall the numbers are about 60% lower than last year, he said.</p>
<p>“I thought that the school really was in danger of closing,” he said. Small business loans through the federal Paycheck Protection Program and the Urban Redevelopment Authority were lifesavers.</p>
<p>“I don’t know if people thank their bankers,” he said, “but I really love my banker.”</p>
<p>Some of the restrictions led to innovation and progress.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Prep committed to having two instructors for each class on Zoom — one leading the video session and one interacting with students by text chat.</p>
<p>“A lot of the introverts were thriving because they were asking questions in the chat box and they would otherwise not even raise their hands,” he said.</p>
<p>By mid-August in a normal summer, Pittsburgh Prep’s average student improvement is about 100 points on their SAT practice tests. This year’s students had closer to a 200-point improvement, Mr. Kim said. On surveys, they showed their anxiety levels were lower.</p>
<p>“We're not a high volume, quick-and-dirty organization where you come in and we teach you tips and tricks. Students and families stay with us,” he said.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/06/03/BOPnewsletterinsert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p>For the first time this summer, Pittsburgh Prep offered formal courses to prepare students to take Advanced Placement physics, chemistry and calculus next academic year. Mr. Kim said they were responding to a demand from students who felt they missed out on learning crucial concepts in the spring as schools closed and struggled to implement remote classes.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim, 45 and now a Freeport resident, started Pittsburgh Prep in 2006 as a side job as he pursued a master’s degree in business administration at Carnegie Mellon’s Tepper School of Business.</p>
<p>He began with a desk, a chair, an office in East Liberty he rented for $50 per month and a Craigslist ad promoting his experience with teaching and test prep.</p>
<p>The tutoring was meant to be temporary and the MBA was going to provide his life’s path forward. Instead, he gave up the degree to focus fully on developing Pittsburgh Prep into a business.</p>
<p>It now has 10 full- and part-time employees and offers guidance as well as instruction to help students get ready for college.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim immigrated from South Korea as a 9-year-old and was raised by his single mother in the West Bronx. He went from not knowing any English when he arrived to attending New York University, then Harvard and working on Wall Street.</p>
<p>He tried law school and opened a food delivery business and had a family. But juggling so much nearly led him to the point of collapse. He suffered through drug addiction and recovery.</p>
<p>“For good or for worse, managing crises is something that I am used to,” he said.</p>
<p>Still, the way out of this crisis for his business isn’t yet clear. More universities may decide to make entrance exams an optional part of admissions applications even after the pandemic has passed, which would challenge test prep companies big and small.</p>
<p>Mr. Kim still sees the tests’ value. It opened doors for him, he said.</p>
<p>With extracurricular activities, sports and internships canceled this year, other measures, like admissions essays, grade point averages and entrance exam scores can carry more weight, especially at top-tier schools.</p>
<p>He is also trying to make test prep more accessible. “We never turn down students due to financial reasons,” he said. The company partners with nonprofits and has given out about $50,000 per year in scholarships to students who can’t afford the full rate, he said.</p>
<p>“I believe in college,” he said, “and I believe that every student has the power to truly improve.”</p>
