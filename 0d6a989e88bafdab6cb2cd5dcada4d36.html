<h1>As part of self-funding deal, Fish and Boat is reducing financial reserves</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A raft of bills that moved out of the state Senate Game and Fisheries Committee last week included a measure that would amend the Title 30 Fish and Boat Code regarding fishing licenses. But it wasn’t the elusive measure, still contested and which cost a Fish and Boat director his job, that would enable the Fish and Boat Commission to increase revenues by allowing the agency to set its own license fees.</p>
<p>The funding bill is still in the state Senate appropriations committee. Legislators want Fish and Boat to draw down so-called “strategic reserve” accounts held by the agency to be used in environmental emergencies. The reserve has not been tapped during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>For years the strategic reserve totaled nearly a year’s revenue. Fish and Boat is a user-pay extension of the state executive branch that operates on a $54 million annual budget acquired through license fees, federal funding through excise taxes on fishing gear and motor boat fuel, and industrial leases on its properties. The Fish and Boat Commission gets no money from the state, but the Legislature sets license fees.</p>
<p>Mike Nerozzi, Fish and Boat’s director of policy and planning, said that in compliance with lawmakers’ requests, the agency is reducing its financial reserve.</p>
<p>“During [the current] fiscal year the PFBC is on track to spend approximately $4.5 million from our unrestricted reserve accounts on deferred maintenance, infrastructure and equipment,” he said. “This is part of a 10-year plan to gradually draw down the balance of our unrestricted reserves to 70 percent of prior year revenue.”</p>
<p>Senate Bill 1074, one of the bills that made it through committee, would change the current law requiring anglers to sign their fishing licenses in ink. That sounds minor, but Mr. Nerozzi said the bill is a first step toward the approval of virtual fishing licenses that can be stored in cell phones.</p>
<p>“The idea is that you’ll sign electronically and if you’re asked you just show the waterways conservation officer on your phone,” he said. “We’re trying to move on the mobile app that you’ll download. It should be ready in 2021.”</p>
<p>Also moved out of the Senate Game and Fisheries Committee were bills that would empower Fish and Boat to issue citations for failure to mark dams that are difficult to see from the water, increase or clarify penalties and authorize waterways conservation officers to engage in collective bargaining.</p>
<p>House Bill 1188, also approved by the committee, would remove the restriction on the use of infrared, thermal and similar night vision optics for hunting. The bill does not automatically allow the use of those types of optics; it would enable the state Game Commission to permit their use by regulation.</p>
<p>The bills now go to the full Senate for consideration.</p>
