<h1>Sidney Crosby returning to Penguins lineup against Wild</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sidney Crosby will return to the Penguins lineup Tuesday at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>After participating in Tuesday’s morning skate, the superstar center declared that he would be ready to roll when the Penguins host the Minnesota Wild.</p>
<p>“I’m playing tonight,” he said. “So I’m excited to be back in the lineup.”</p>
<p>Crosby has not played since Nov. 9 and had sports hernia surgery in Philadelphia on Nov. 14. The team announced then that he would miss at least six weeks. He began skating in an individual setting about five weeks ago. His first practice with the team was Jan. 1. He’s been ramping up his participation ever since.</p>
<p>“It’s a slow process, just as far as getting each step in and feeling good at each point,” said Crosby, who has 17 points in 17 games. “That’s the biggest thing.”</p>
<p>The Penguins brought him along on their recent road trip. During their week out west, Crosby got in three on-ice workouts, one in a team setting. That practice Saturday in Arizona was his first without contact restrictions. Crosby, after some consideration, was held out for Sunday’s 4-3 shootout win in Arizona.</p>
<p>“You always communicate with the training staff and doctors and everybody kind of weighs in,” Crosby said. “And ultimately, when you feel good enough, it comes to that point [when you are cleared]. Those are pretty daily conversations.”</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s morning skate at the arena, Crosby skated on a line with Jared McCann and Dominik Simon. He also worked with the top power play unit.</p>
<p>Once he elbowed his way through the sizable scrum waiting for him in front of his locker stall, Crosby, with a grin, said he was “happy” to make his return.</p>
<p>“The team’s played great,” he said. “And I just want to come in and help.”</p>
<p>The Penguins went 18-6-4 without Crosby, including their recent road trip that saw them go 3-0 after top Western teams in Vegas, Colorado and Arizona.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan is happy about his return, too, and not just because he no longer has to give incremental updates on Crosby at his news conferences.</p>
<p>“He means so much to this organization. He means so much to his teammates. It’s exciting to have him back,” he said. “His on-ice play speaks for itself. … He’s a difference-maker. But more so than that, he’s a leader. That in and of itself gives our team a big boost. So we’re excited to have him back. It’s been a long time.”</p>
