<p>Two museum professionals have joined the senior staff of Carnegie Science Center.</p>
<p>Lisa Herrmann is senior director of STEM Education, an acronym for science, technology, engineering and math. Marcus Harshaw is senior director of museum experiences.</p>
<p>Ms. Herrmann began her role as senior director of STEM Education on June 29. Previously, she was the education manager at the Arizona Center for Nature Conservation at South Mountain in Phoenix. She has been a classroom teacher, a science educator, and a developer of widely used curricula and programs.</p>
<p>In Arizona, Ms. Herrmann served in statewide leadership, supporting teachers who were implementing national and state science standards. She also led the development of the Arizona Environmental Literacy Framework and a subsequent environmental education certification program.</p>
<p>On Monday, Marcus Harshaw began his role as senior director of museum experiences, which is a new position. Mr. Harshaw will oversee all of the science center’s on-site experiences, including visitor engagement, exhibitions and theaters, such as The Rangos Giant Cinema.</p>
<p>Previously, Mr. Harshaw was vice president of learning and facilities at Kaleideum&nbsp;in Winston-Salem, N.C. He also was a museum education lecturer in the Johns Hopkins University Museum Studies program.</p>
<p>Before that, he was director of education and community engagement at the Indiana Historical Society in Indianapolis and director of program development and evaluation at the Cincinnati Museum Center in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>“After extensive searches for both positions, we are excited to have these two talented individuals join our team,” said Jason Brown, director of the Carnegie Science Center.</p>
<p>“The experience and strengths that both Lisa and Marcus bring to the science center are perfectly aligned with our current needs and goals for the future,” Mr. Brown said in a statement.</p>
