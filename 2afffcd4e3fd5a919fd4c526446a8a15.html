<h1>Pet Events: New wellness centers,animal art and Drag Queen Bingo</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PetIQ is opening 1,000 pet wellness centers across the country this year, including several in Western Pennsylvania this weekend.</p>
<p>The concept calls for pet owners to walk in, without appointments, for “more affordable, up-front pricing.” All procedures are 50% off during the first appointment.&nbsp;See the <a href="https://www.vippetcare.com" target="_blank">https://www.vippetcare.com</a>&nbsp;website for more information, including prices for services and hours and days of operation.</p>
<p>VIP Petcare and PetVet Wellness Centers&nbsp;“provide routine and preventative services in popular brick and mortar locations,” according to the news release.</p>
<p>Opening Friday, 2:30-7:30 p.m.: Bridgeville, Pet Supplies Plus, 1155 Washington Pike, 15017.</p>
<p>Opening Friday, noon-7 p.m.: Beaver Falls, Beaver County, Tractor Supply Co., 142 McKinley Road, 15010.</p>
<p><strong>Animal art show</strong></p>
<p>Meet piggies and pitties at the opening reception of the “Art for Animals,” which opens Saturday from 7-9 p.m. at the North Hills Art Center.</p>
<p>The reception features live music and live pets and it’s free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show will be up through April 3, Monday-Friday from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. and from Tuesdays 7-9 p.m. The art center is in Ross at 3432 Babcock Blvd., 15237.</p>
<p>Pigs from the Pigsburgh Squealers rescue and pit bulls from the Hello Bully rescue will be there.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Drag Queen bingo</strong></p>
<p>The queens are&nbsp;“back by very popular demand” to benefit the homeless animals that are helped by the Pet Search rescue in Washington County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Miss Thea’s Drag Queen Bingo is April 17, but the $25 pre-sale tickets sell out fast. This is the third year for this event, which sold out 300 tickets in each of the past two years.</p>
<p>This year the event has moved to a bigger venue that has room for 400 ticket holders —&nbsp;Hilton Garden Inn Southpointe, 1000 Corporate Drive, Canonsburg 15317. Doors open at 4 p.m., and bingo is from 7-10 p.m. There are also auctions, and an extra $10 gets you the appetizer buffet.</p>
<p>Tickets can be purchased at&nbsp;<a href="http://petsearchpa.org/event/drag-queen-bingo/" target="_blank">petsearchpa.org/event/drag-queen-bingo/</a> or&nbsp;by calling 724-228-7335. Or, order&nbsp;by&nbsp;old-fashioned snail mail: Pet Search, Box 1653, Washington, PA 15301. Include a self-addressed stamped envelope.</p>
