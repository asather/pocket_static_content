<h1>New faces join Etna, Shaler, Sharpsburg councils </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New faces were sworn in Monday night in Etna, Shaler and Sharpsburg as newly elected officials joined those re-elected in November’s general election to take their seats on councils long composed of veterans.</p>
<p>In Etna, Jessica Semler was sworn in for her first term, while Megan Tunon, Greg Porter and Ron Trader returned to council.</p>
<p>Ms. Semler, whose father and grandfather are lifetime residents of the borough, recently moved back and now lives one street away from her childhood home. “I’ve never seen anyone so joyful to be sworn in,” said Mary Ellen Ramage, borough manager and secretary.</p>
<p>Appointed to fill the vacancy created when former Etna Councilwoman Karen Tomaszewski resigned to become tax collector, Ms. Tunon is active in the Etna Community Organization and is a delegate to CONNECT (Congress of Neighboring Communities) which brings Pittsburgh’s surrounding neighborhoods together to work for countywide change.</p>
<p>Mr. Porter was appointed to Etna council when longtime Councilman Terry Houston died five years ago. Mr. Porter ran two years ago and was re-elected, but this will be his first four-year term.</p>
<p>This is Mr. Trader’s second full four-year term.</p>
<p>The newest Shaler Township commissioner, Frank Iozzo, is a 27-year resident. The next newest, David Mizgorski, was appointed by the commissioners in January 2019 to fill the vacancy created when his wife, longtime Commissioner Lori Mizgorski, resigned after being elected state representative for the 30th Legislative District. He was required to run for re-election in November to continue serving the final two years of his wife’s term as commissioner until 2022.</p>
<p>Longtime Shaler commissioners sworn in by Shaler Magisterial District Judge Dan Konieczka included Bill Cross, seven terms; Susan Fisher, four terms; and David Shutter, nine terms.</p>
<p>Brad Truman was the newest Sharpsburg council member sworn this week by Mayor Matt Rudzki. He was elected in November to fill the two years left on the term of Matthew Brudnok, who moved from the borough. Soon after he moved to Sharpsburg in 2018, Mr. Truman started attending council meetings regularly, became a member of the zoning hearing board, volunteered for Sharpsburg Neighborhood Organization and became the leader Sharpsburg’s energy group for the Triboro Ecodistrict.</p>
<p>Adrianne Laing began her third term. According to Mr. Rudzki, Ms. Laing had been appointed twice to fill vacancies, but this is her first full term after being elected in the November general election. A 15-year resident of Sharpsburg, she has volunteered at community events run by SNO as well as townwide clean-up days.</p>
<p>Greg Domian, a lifelong resident, began his third term, having been appointed to his first and elected to his second. He’s been coach of the Sharpsburg Wolves youth basketball club and also plans and hosts Open Streets and the Hometown Holiday Celebration each year.</p>
<p>Jonathan Jaso began his second elected term. He has spent his life as a public servant, working as an Allegheny County Emergency Services dispatcher and a firefighter with the Sharpsburg Volunteer Fire Department.</p>
