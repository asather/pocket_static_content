<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Riverhounds SC will start its 2020 season under a national spotlight.</p>
<p>The club announced Tuesday that its July 12 opener against Louisville City FC will air on ESPN2 at a time to be determined.</p>
<p>“The national stage will mark a tremendous opportunity for our club to return to play,” owner Tuffy Shallenberger said in a statement. “We are looking forward to playing soccer again and beginning our 2020 season.”</p>
<p>The meeting will be a rematch with the team that eliminated the Riverhounds in the USL Championship’s Eastern Conference semifinals last November. It will also be Louisville’s first game in its newly built Lynn Family Stadium.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds’ season was previously scheduled to begin in March, but the USL Championship suspended play because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The league will return to action July 11 using a divisional format aimed at reducing travel. Teams will face divisional opponents three times and play just four games outside of their division before the playoffs begin, a total of 16 games.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds’ group includes Hartford Athletic, Loudoun United FC, New York Red Bulls II and Philadelphia Union II, meaning the match against Louisville is one of their four interdivisional tilts.</p>
<p>The rest of the Riverhounds’ schedule has yet to be announced.</p>
