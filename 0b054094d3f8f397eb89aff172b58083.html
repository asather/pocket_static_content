<h1>First COVID-19 death in Allegheny County reported at Jefferson Hospital </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A patient in their late 60s who was receiving acute care at Jefferson Hospital died Saturday from the novel coronavirus COVID-19.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald announced the county’s first death from the pandemic at a Saturday afternoon news conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The person was a resident of Clairton, Mayor Rich Lattanzi confirmed.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County death represents the second in Pennsylvania, which now has 371 confirmed cases — 103 more than Friday, according to State Department of Health totals. There are now 31 confirmed cases in Allegheny County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Washington County cases now stand at five after two more were reported Saturday, and the first case in Butler County was confirmed.</p>
<p>Officials in the Butler Health System, said in a Saturday release, that it has the first patient with presumed positive results for the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19 illness.</p>
<p>No additional cases were reported midday Saturday in Westmoreland (4), Beaver (3) and Erie (1) counties.</p>
<p>“Prayers from all of us from city hall and condolences to the entire family,” Mr. Lattanzi wrote on Facebook. “May you find peace and love from our community.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lattanzi declined to give any more personal information about the patient out of respect for their family, and urged the residents of Clairton not to panic.</p>
<p>“We extend our sincerest condolences to the patient’s loved ones and our immense gratitude to the exceptional caregivers at Jefferson and across AHN who are on the front lines of our community’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” Mr. Laurent said in a written statement.</p>
<p>Dr. LuAnn Brink, the county health department’s chief epidemiologist, said tracing the contacts of the person who died Saturday already has been accomplished.</p>
<p>“All of those people have been put under quarantine,” Dr. Brink said during the news conference. Four people with the virus remain hospitalized.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Debra L. Bogen, director of Allegheny County’s Health Department, said that as of Saturday, 31 people in the county had tested positive for the new, novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>That figure, Dr. Bogen said, will rise because more tests are being done and,&nbsp;“We have community spread in our region.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The phrase, “community spread,” means there are people who have been infected with the virus and are not sure how or where they became infected.&nbsp;Five to 10 days is the incubation period.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Asked about the rate of community spread in Allegheny County, Dr. Bogen replied, “We’re weeks behind Seattle and Philly but we’re not that far behind.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, the number of COVID-19 cases in the state of Washington reached 1,524 and the number of deaths was 81. As of noon Saturday, there were 371 positive cases in Pennsylvania, 69 in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“People who are ill should not go out,” Dr. Bogen said.</p>
<p>Unless a person requires emergency care, Dr. Bogen encouraged people to visit the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html" target="_blank">Centers for Disease Control website</a> to learn how to evaluate their symptoms and care for themselves at home.</p>
<p>Asked if she felt hampered by a 1955 state law that prohibits her from releasing more information, Dr. Bogen said that if she revealed the neighborhood where the late patient lived, other people could become complacent. She also wanted to protect the privacy of individuals.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald praised Pittsburghers, local business owners and organizations for taking the pandemic seriously and abiding by Gov. Tom Wolf’s order to close.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Pittsburghers pull together and cooperate,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald noted that rumors also spread during a pandemic and that the county plans to launch a “rumor control page” on its website Monday.</p>
<p>The county, Mr. Fitzgerald added, has set up an email address where people can offer to donate personal protective equipment, especially N95 masks, which are in demand in hospitals and for emergency personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you want to donate personal protective equipment, send an email to this address: covid19donations@alleghenycounty.us</p>
<p>“Health care professionals are the people we should be listening to,” Mr. Fitzgerald said, naming as examples Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health, Dr. Rachel Levine and Dr. Bogen.&nbsp;</p>
