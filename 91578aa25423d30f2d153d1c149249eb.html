<h1>Wuhan institute was not source of coronavirus, Chinese lab chief says</h1>

<p>BERLIN — The head of the Institute of Virology in the Chinese city of Wuhan has rejected allegations in the United States that the novel coronavirus could have originated in his laboratory.</p>
<p>“There’s no way this virus came out from us,” said Yuan Zhiming in an interview with state television, the English-language transcript of which was published by Chinese media on Sunday.</p>
<p>“We clearly know what kind of virus research is going on in the institute and how the institute manages viruses and samples,” he added. More generally, he said, “there is no evidence to prove that the virus has artificial or synthetic traces.”</p>

<p>Yuan — a microbiology and biotechnology expert who trained in France, Denmark and the United States — also noted that a man-made coronavirus resembling the one ripping across the globe is beyond the scope of human intelligence.</p>
<p>None of the laboratory staff had been infected with the coronavirus, the director said, adding that he understood why people had jumped to conclusions about his institute in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic originated.</p>
<p>“But it’s bad when some are deliberately trying to mislead people,” said Yuan Zhiming. “I know it’s impossible,” he added. “This is entirely based on speculation.”</p>
<p>Asked about the theory during an interview on U.S. broadcaster CBS, Deborah Birx, a top public health official on the coronavirus, downplayed the possibility.</p>
<p>“I don’t have any evidence that it was a laboratory accident,” Birx said, while cautioning that the origins of the virus were still shrouded in mystery.</p>
<p>“We are still a long way from figuring it out,” she said. “We know it originated in China. We just don’t know how and where.”</p>
<p>The comments come a day after President Donald Trump said the U.S. was investigating whether the virus could have originated in the Wuhan lab. “It seems to make sense,” he told reporters at a daily briefing at the White House.</p>
<p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also seemed to acknowledge theories about the lab in Wuhan.</p>
<p>“We know there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology a couple miles away from where the wet market was,” Pompeo told Fox News. “There is still lots to learn. The United States government is working diligently to figure it out.”</p>
<p>The Chinese government has long denied that the lab was to blame and almost immediately pointed to a wet market in the city of Wuhan as the virus source. And on&nbsp;Friday, it accused the U.S. administration of attempting to shift the focus from its own missteps in dealing with the pandemic by talking up a theory that it was started by a pathogen from a laboratory in Wuhan. (This comes a month after the ministry tweeted the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army.)</p>
<p>Scientists have doubted whether the coronavirus could have come from a lab, killing more than 156,000 people worldwide.</p>
<p>The first infections with the coronavirus were linked with an animal market in Wuhan. Experts believe the virus comes from bats and might also have been spread via another host animal.</p>
