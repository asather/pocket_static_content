<h1>North Hills board to consider hybrid education model on Sept. 17</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The North Hills school board will decide next week whether to move to the next phase of its reopening plan — a hybrid of in-person and virtual on Oct. 5.</p>
<p>The district started Aug. 31 with virtual education after one week during which students attended for one day, based on the first letter of their last names, to pick up their iPads and other items for the virtual learning.</p>
<p>“I was really impressed by the students wearing their masks. There were no masking issues from students or teachers,” Superintendent Patrick Mannarino said during the board’s Sept. 3 virtual meeting. “It was nice to see the students in the building and interacting with each other and with the teachers.”</p>
<p>He added that the week “allowed us to look at what hybrid would look like” with one-way halls and staircases.</p>
<p>The board will vote on the move to hybrid education on Thursday.</p>
<p>The move to hybrid will depend on the number of coronavirus cases in Allegheny County and how it falls within a ranking system issued by the state Department of Education.</p>
<p>The community transmission rate was in the “substantial” range on Aug. 19, which was the first day for teachers, with 100 or more cases per 100,000 residents. A “moderate” rate of 10 to 99 cases per 100,000 residents is necessary for hybrid, and less than 10 cases is necessary for full-time in-person education, he added.</p>
<p>“If we begin hybrid on Oct. 5, if there is a spike that puts the district in ‘substantial,’ we will have to move to virtual,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Mannarino also addressed the district’s two positive cases since school began, a third grade teacher at Highcliff Elementary School and a high school student.</p>
<p>“As we even enter into the hybrid, this is something we are going to have to deal with. We would not have closed schools with one case,” he said. “Masks and social distancing protocols will help us manage this virus.”</p>
<p>He reported that 296 students are attending the district’s cyber academy, up from 37 students last year. The bulk of the cyber academy students are in the elementary grades.</p>
<p>In addition, the sixth grade was successfully moved to the middle school into a renovated space on the second floor, the superintendent reported. Those classrooms received new paint, lights, ceilings, carpet, Promethean boards and furniture. The board voted last year to move sixth graders to the middle school to help with rising elementary enrollment.</p>
