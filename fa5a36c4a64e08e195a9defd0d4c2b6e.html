<h1>Uniontown's black treasurer-elect sues city, officials; claims racial bias barred her from office</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A black woman elected to be Uniontown’s treasurer has sued the city, a councilman and several others in federal court on civil rights grounds over claims that she was prevented from taking office because of her race.</p>
<p>Antoinette L. Hodge is accusing Councilman Martin Gatti, City Clerk Kimberly Marshall — who is identified as Mr. Gatti’s sister-in-law — and other unnamed defendants of a&nbsp;“conspiracy” to prevent her from assuming office.</p>
<p>Mr. Gatti and Ms. Marshall are identified as&nbsp;“caucasian” in the complaint.</p>
<p>The lawsuit claims that Mr. Gatti referred to Ms. Hodge as “colored” in a phone call. It also claims that he — independently and without authority — had Ms. Hodge’s surety bond revoked. Additionally, it claims that Ms. Marshall told Ms. Hodge,&nbsp;“We’ll get you,” the day that Ms. Hodge was supposed to be sworn in.</p>
<p>Neither Uniontown’s solicitor nor the defendants could be reached for comment Wednesday.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed Tuesday in U.S. District Court by Pittsburgh attorney Joel Sansone, alleges retaliation, racial discrimination, conspiracy and violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments. It seeks a jury trial.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge, who ran as a Democrat, won more than 97% of the vote in the Nov. 5 general election. She was due to take office Jan. 6.</p>
<p>The lawsuit says that someone from the Fayette County Election Bureau told Ms. Hodge that official documentation of the election results would be given to the City of Uniontown. Ms. Hodge believes that the information was given to Ms. Marshall.</p>
<p>On Nov. 25, Ms. Hodge was informed that she had to apply to be bonded. She contacted Uniontown’s solicitor, Timothy Witt, about the procedure and was told, according to the lawsuit, that Ms. Marshall typically completed bond applications on behalf of elected officials.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge gave her completed application to Mr. Witt. In the meantime, the lawsuit said, Mr. Witt and the head of the county’s Democratic Party&nbsp;“made repeated requests” for the certification of Ms. Hodge’s election results to Uniontown.</p>
<p>Roughly 48 days later, on Dec. 23, Ms. Marshall provided Ms. Hodge and the solicitor with the necessary documentation to certify the election results, the complaint said.</p>
<p>But five days later, Ms. Hodge was told that Penn National, a bonding company that handles coverage for Uniontown, could not provide her with the necessary bond because of credit report problems, according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Sansone said that Ms. Hodge was the victim of identity theft years ago, which has led to continuing credit problems. He also said that despite that, his client has been able to be bonded at her former job as a purchasing agent for The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore as well as currently as a trustee for a nonprofit church organization.</p>
<p>“The notion that she’s not trustworthy is nonsense,” Mr. Sansone said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge asked the solicitor if she could obtain bond on her own. She was told she could, and she did so.</p>
<p>But on Dec. 31, the day she got the bond, Ms. Hodge said she learned from the incoming mayor that she had to take an exam before assuming office as well as submit an affidavit of residency. Ms. Hodge said she believes that Ms. Marshall should have made her aware of the requirements but did not.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge passed the test on New Year’s Day and waited to be sworn in Jan. 6 at the next council meeting. Mr. Witt provided all necessary documentation to Ms. Marshall on Jan. 3, the complaint said. That same day, however, Councilman Frank Palumbo told the mayor that Mr. Gatti&nbsp;“had informed him that he had canceled the plaintiff’s bond,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Ms. Hodge contacted the entity that had bonded her, BondExchange, and asked if her bond had been revoked. The woman with whom she spoke asked Ms. Hodge if she was black or white, the complaint said. Ms. Hodge said that she was African American, and the woman replied,&nbsp;“that sums it up,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>A BondExchange manager then got on the phone — as Uniontown’s Mayor-elect Bill Gerke listened in with permission — and&nbsp;told Ms. Hodge that Mr. Gatti&nbsp;“had&nbsp;canceled Plaintiff’s bond at approximately 6:00 p.m. on or about January 3, 2020, shortly after&nbsp;Attorney Witt submitted Plaintiff’s documentation...” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gatti told the bonding company “that&nbsp;he had been ‘authorized’ to cancel [Ms. Hodge’s] bond by&nbsp;Defendant Uniontown and that he was doing so because of ‘incriminating evidence’ allegedly&nbsp;uncovered by Plaintiff’s mandated background search,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Mr. Sansone claims in the lawsuit that Mr. Gatti was not authorized to cancel Ms. Hodge’s bond, and he disputed the notion that her background check yielded any inappropriate or illegal behavior requiring revocation of her bond.</p>
<p>The BondExchange manager also said that Mr. Gatti had referred to Ms. Hodge as&nbsp;“colored,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gerke said that he was patched in to the phone call by Ms. Hodge and was on the line for about eight seconds. He said he did not hear the manager’s alleged “colored” comment.</p>
<p>“I didn’t hear that,” Mr. Gerke said.&nbsp;“The only thing that we talked about was who made this call to you concerning Ms. Hodge’s eligiblity to bond. ...The gentleman from The Bond Exchange told me,&nbsp;‘Martin Gatti.’&nbsp;That was the only bit of conversation I had with that gentleman.”</p>
<p>At the swearing-in ceremony, Uniontown’s mayor, council members and controller — all white —&nbsp;were sworn in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But not Ms. Hodges, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Mr. Gerke said that Ms. Hodges was not sworn in on the advice of the solicitor.</p>
<p>After the meeting, the lawsuit claims, Ms. Marshall “aggressively approached” Ms. Hodge and said,&nbsp;“We’ll get you.”</p>
<p>“No matter what color she is, the Third Class City Code says that any official that needs bonded has two weeks after being installed to get bond,” Mr. Sansone said, meaning that his client did not need to be bonded at the time of her installation as treasurer.</p>
<p>“Leave the race out of it for the moment, there’s no excuse,” Mr. Sansone said.&nbsp;“But you come to the inescapable conclusion that you’ve got some racists down there trying to control events.”</p>
