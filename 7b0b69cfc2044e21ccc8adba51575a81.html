<h1>Not lovin' it — McDonald's closes Strip District restaurant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a land where a sandwich stuffed with meat, french fries and coleslaw reigns, the Big Mac couldn’t hack it.</p>
<p>The McDonald’s restaurant at 1630 Penn Avenue in the Strip District has abruptly closed its doors, leaving the owner of the property hustling to find a replacement.</p>
<p>“It’s surprising,” owner Dan Kamin said. “It’s an excellent location and I have reason to believe they did good business.”</p>
<p>The restaurant was perched at a prominent spot at the entrance to the fabled Penn Avenue stretch of merchants featuring the likes of Robert Wholey &amp; Co., Pennsylvania Macaroni Co., Stamoolis Brothers Co., DeLuca’s, Jimmy &amp; Nino Sunseri Co., and, of course, Primanti Brothers, with its famous sandwiches.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamin said McDonald’s gave no reason for the closing. It is the second McDonald’s to call it quits in the vicinity in recent months. The fast-food chain also closed a location on Smithfield Street in Downtown last year.</p>
<p>The Strip District McDonald’s, a longtime fixture on Penn Avenue, shut down long before its lease expired this summer. Jim Coen, head of a Strip District business association, said the restaurant seemed to have trouble keeping employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Mr. Kamin was stunned by the closing, he’s not crying in his Chicken McNuggets. He said brokers have been bombarding him with calls offering ideas and potential tenants.</p>
<p>“There’s no dearth of interest in the site,” he said, noting he has gotten more calls in one morning on the Strip location than he has in two years on a Kmart property in Parkersburg, W.Va., that he has been trying to sell.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamin said he sees opportunities for a bank, a restaurant, and perhaps even an office or another fast-food outlet at the location. With the lease not set to expire until summer, he has time to mull options.</p>
<p>“We’ll come up with something. The location is very good. We haven’t made any decisions,” he said.</p>
<p>And if for some reason nothing pans out, he has a backup plan.</p>
<p>“I’m thinking about opening a McKamin’s,” he joked. “I’m quite proficient at preparing oatmeal in the morning. Maybe I can serve oatmeal and coffee.”</p>
<p>In a neighborhood that delights in the eclectic, that combo just might make the cut.</p>
