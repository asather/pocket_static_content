<h1>Community shows division over Hamlet’s contract renewal with PPS</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some say he inherited a troubled school district in which he has slowly but surely worked to improve student performance and professional development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others say he has failed to bring steady leadership and real change to a district where too many students remain too far behind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board at a comment session Monday evening heard an array of opinions from community members about Superintendent Anthony Hamlet, whose contract is up for renewal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school board will vote Wednesday on a four-year contract that would retain Mr. Hamlet as superintendent until the end of the 2025 school year.&nbsp;The five-year contract to which Mr. Hamlet agreed in 2016 expires June 30, 2021.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speakers criticized Mr. Hamlet for not boosting student performance more quickly during his tenure and pointed to the achievement gap between Black and white students in the district as a lingering problem.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But others said data shows that student performance has improved — albeit slowly — under Mr. Hamlet’s watch, and the disparity in grades among racial lines predated the superintendent.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“Are we now attempting to hold Dr. Hamlet responsible for statistics prior to his arriving in Pittsburgh?” said community member Selene Thomas. “I mean, that seems far-fetched, but it seems as though we are placing blame on his shoulders for other things.”</p>
<p>Supporters of Mr. Hamlet said retaining the superintendent will bring needed stability to the district, especially during the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We need consistency for our students,” said Janice Brown, a member of the social justice group, OnePA.&nbsp;“We can’t change education leaders every time.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bryanna Thomas, a student at CAPA 6-12, said she appreciated that Mr. Hamlet opened a line of communication to students by forming the superintendent’s student advisory council.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Dr. Hamlet, for giving students a voice,” Bryanna said, asking the board to renew the superintendent’s contract.</p>
<p>Many of those who spoke against the renewal of Mr. Hamlet’s contract brought up the controversies that have plagued him throughout much of his tenure as superintendent.</p>
<p>They revisited the inaccuracies found in the resume provided to Pittsburgh Public Schools when he applied for the superintendent role, the turnover of his executive staff, and an unauthorized trip to Cuba during a professional-development program that led to a school board investigation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We have been concerned about Dr. Hamlet from the very beginning, when he appeared to inflate his achievements in his resume,” said Matthew Chinman, the parent of an Allderdice High School student.&nbsp;“Since then, Dr. Hamlet’s performance has not countered that initial concern.”</p>
<p>David Nernberg, the parent of a Colfax K-8 student, called Mr. Hamlet’s tenure an&nbsp;“abject failure” and said the school board should allow his contract to expire.</p>
<p>“Our students and families deserve a superintendent who’s competent, honest, innovative, and not the center of continuous negative press,” Mr. Nernberg said. “We have had enough, and our children deserve better.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still others wondered why the board would decide so soon on whether Mr. Hamlet should receive a new contract. Under state law, the board has until Feb. 1 to inform Mr. Hamlet of a decision on his future.</p>
<p>Lynda Wrenn, a former school board president, urged the board to delay the vote to give members of the public more time to voice their opinions on the matter.</p>
<p>“The board needs to be absolutely sure that families are given ample opportunities to weigh in on this critical subject,” Ms. Wrenn said. “This is a very important decision that directly impacts their children and the quality of education they receive. They, as well as other stakeholders, deserve to know this vote is happening and have time to comment on it.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
