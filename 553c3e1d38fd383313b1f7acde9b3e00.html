<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 06.11.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Hello all, welcome and let’s get started</p>
<p><strong>thomastown</strong>: All the talk about playing the various sports without fans will serve the wealthy owners and players. My concern is with the stadium workers who will still be left behind. Has there been any discussion that the owners and players collaborate on contributing to a fund to help these folks out? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think some have already done that and also some of the players have stepped up to try and help those people out. Unfortunately they are gonna be the most hurt out of all of this because I don’t see fans any time soon.</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: Hello Paul, reading your mailbag, it seems you are right on regarding the flag issue. But on to sports, the MLB owners couldn't be more tone deaf regarding the split with players. Do they not understand that after this year is over they will eventually need to negotiate future contracts with the players union? If no baseball is played this year, expect a significant reduction in attendance next year as more people just give up on the sport. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Baseball will be played this year but under less than ideal circumstances because I don’t see a deal getting done I really don’t. The owners will force the 48-game season on the players, some will opt not to play but you are right - the next time the CBA is up it will be an absolute war as the players won’t soon forget this</p>
<p><strong>Bizzee Bee</strong>: Paul - After all of these years, how is it possible that the Bucs never drafted and/or developed a bunch of left-handed power hitters to take advantage of the short porch at PNC? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well there was Pedro......and you are right. One of the things PNC affords the Pirates is the ability to build a team of left handed pitchers and left handed hitters and they have done neither.</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: Hi Paul...I thought Larry Fitzgerald’s essay in the New York Times was excellent and thought provoking. I applaud him and the ever growing number of athletes and public figures who are trying make this world better. I think we as humans need to treat and see each other as humans. Racism and bigotry is not limited to one group of people, but exists among all us, black, white, brown, yellow and red. Life is not easy. We can make it easier for everyone if we respect ourselves and treat each other with that respect. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It isn’t hard - treat people with the same respect you want treated with</p>
<p><strong>Questfor7</strong>: in Ray’s chat yesterday, he once again comapred MacFarland to Rainey and Archer. MacFarland is 30 lbs heavier than those guys - similar to Alvin Kamara. I see MacFarland filling in admirably for Conner (when he inevitably gets injured) and then being the Steelers every down back next year. Just needs to work on pass protection. If you don’t think so, watch more of his tape at Maryland. What do you think? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I like the pick. I think he can be a major player for the offense, I do. He is good and more importantly that speed and big play ability is tremendous</p>
<p><strong>Tyler</strong>: Hey Paul, I liked the selection of Nick Gonzales by the Pirates. With some seeing Tucker and Newman as the shortstop and second baseman of the future, do you think Gonzales and Cruz may be shifted to play outfield? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t think so. If you read the scouting report on Gonzalez he isn’t a good defender and doesn’t have a great arm. I think if anything Tucker could move to the outfield because he has the skill set to be an excellent d <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: efensive outfielder</p>
<p><strong>Federico</strong>: What’s your gut feeling on Lamar Jackson ? Would he be a star for years or teams will figure him out and be a middle of the road type of guy? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He is extremely talented and really a guy who seems to get better and better. I would not underestimate how good he is and how good he has a chance to be. He looks to me like he is gonna be a star for a long time to fomr</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Paul, with the apparent waning interest in baseball by our young people, do you see baseball reducing the number of draft rounds? If the trend continues, I can’t see mlb having 40 round drafts. Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The other thing is the shrinking minor leagues. I mean they are talking about cutting out about 60 minor league teams. That’s a lot less spots for players to land so yes I think they will cut the draft</p>
<p><strong>Chad</strong>: Hi Paul, who do you think the backup free safety is, if Minkah misses a couple games due to injury? Would they move edmunds or a corner there? Or do you think they will pickup a guy at the end of camp, who is cut from another team? I know we have backup safeties on the roster but they seem more like special teamers and strong safeties. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would assume it would be Edmunds but that is a good point - maybe they wait and pick up someone after teams cut rosters</p>
<p><strong>Mahan</strong>: Serious question for you Paul .. it’s still early for M Rudolph we know, however for what you have seen in both (and circumstances) would you rather have Rudolph or Josh Rosen backing up Ben if we could get him for cheap.. thanks, stay safe! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Rudolph. He knows the offense and I have seen nothing from Rosen that makes me thinks he is an upgrade. Also it doesn’t sound like Rosen is a good team chemistry guy, either</p>
<p><strong>Thomas W.</strong>: I understand the PG has Heath Miller narrowly beating out Louis Lipps as the best ever to wear no. 83. Do you happen to know what those two are doing now? I enjoyed watching them play. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Lipps is still local and I know he dabbles in media and I’ve seen him at some golf outings and stuff. I’m not sure what Heeeaaaathh is up to</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi Paul, <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Hello.....</p>
<p><strong>TomnQteen</strong>: Any info re #7 rehab or # 2 practice progress? I appreciate your voice of reason &amp; reasonableness! Thanks Paul. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Everything we have heard from Ben is positive. It sounds like he is on track and he is doing well and will be ready for training camp. We have heard less about Rudolph but my gut is that since they have been so committed to him as their backup that he will be ready to roll as well. If they were worried at all about it they would have gotten another QB as insurance</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: I read that one of the CDC requirements for opening training camp is that players have to stay 6 feet away from each other. Did I misunderstand that? How can you practice football and stay 6 feet away? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: You can’t and the guidelines are only for on the locker room and on the sidelines</p>
<p><strong>Wojo</strong>: Hi Paul, Has anyone thought of producing protective wear or clothing to cover fans from head to toe as a way to enable fans to attend football games? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No but I’m sure if you call a clothing company and pitch it you might get rich!</p>
<p><strong>Bill in SF</strong>: Good morning from the west coast. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Hello and I hope all is well out there</p>
<p><strong>Pete</strong>: After all the dust is settled between the owners and players, do you see anything coming out of it that may benefit the Pirates or other “small market” teams? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes a 48-game and a DH could help the Pirates this year. I think they have a chance to compete for 48 games. Now long term, no I don’t think so</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Hey Paul, I heard the TV show cops is being cancelled. With the possibility of no NFL any suggestions for back up TV? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know if I am woke enough to give the right answer! And every show I like gets cancelled so hopefully you have Netflix!!!</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Paul, I think it’s time for Commissioner Manfred to Manfred Mann up and do right by us fans!! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well he claims that he is going to make an offer the players will like. I don’t have much faith in him but we shall see</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: What is the ceiling for Pitt basketball under Capel if they continue to do things 'the right way' (if indeed that is what they are doing). No bag men involved, which is apparently what most big-time programs are involved with, including Duke. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think Pitt can be a top 20 program annually and compete for the ACC title. They did that under Jamie Dixon without bag men. You can win if you recruit well and develop players right</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Any chance the Steelers sign Kaepernick to compete with Lynch as our 3rd QB? May need more than 2 QB's if Covid puts down either Mason, Ben or both? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I really believe now I’m being trolled with this. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK that is it for this week let’s do it again next week!!</p>
