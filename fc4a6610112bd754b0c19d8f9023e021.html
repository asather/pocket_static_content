<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Wednesday again extended the city’s emergency disaster declaration for seven more days.</p>
<p>The body must approve the declaration every week to keep it in effect.</p>
<p>This is the fifth time council voted to extend the designation since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/13/mayor-bill-peduto-press-conference-covid-19-city-response-virus-residents/stories/202003130170" target="_blank">Mayor Bill Peduto declared the emergency on March 13</a>. In early April, members approved the extension for a 26-day stretch.</p>

<p>The declaration allows the city to cancel or limit large gatherings; limit city permits; cancel or limit some city services; and cancel or limit public and private activities.</p>
<p>City council also gave tentative approval on accepting just over $138,000 in federal grant funding to assist the city’s Emergency Medical Services in&nbsp;“preventing, preparing for, and responding to the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>The money will be used to pay for personnel and overtime costs, existing agreements or contracts, and health care-related expenses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the legislation summary.</p>
<p>Council is expected to approve the grant Tuesday.</p>
