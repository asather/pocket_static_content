<p>The county said that of those 476 cases of the viral disease, a total of 78 people have needed hospitalization.</p>

<p>In total, the pandemic has killed 102 people throughout the state, with two deaths each in Allegheny, Beaver and Butler counties, one in Fayette County and two in Lawrence County, according to the latest Pennsylvania Department of Health numbers. A Beaver County nursing home reported its third death on Wednesday, but that has not been reflected yet in state figures.</p>
<p>A breakdown by municipality of <a href="http://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=3ada56aa62c2407b91bd581cd57b7520&amp;extent=-80.4261,40.2825,-79.5053,40.6747" target="_blank">confirmed cases in Allegheny County can be found here</a>.</p>
<p>Health officials said community spread continues to be a problem and urge residents to maintain “social distancing.”</p>
<p>“With the warm weather expected this weekend, many of you will be heading outside. If you feel sick, you should stay home,” Allegheny County health officials said in releasing Friday’s data. “If you head outside, remember to stay at least 6 feet away from others, avoid touching common surfaces like playground equipment, and wash your hands or use hand sanitizer often.”</p>
<p>Dr. William Jenkins, emergency medicine&nbsp;director at Excela Health in Westmoreland County, said the next two weeks will be “critical” to controlling the spread of this highly contagious coronavirus. The county’s confirmed cases jumped from 84 to 110 between Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>“Community cooperation is essential to eliminating&nbsp;disease spread,” Dr. Jenkins said Friday. “As the weather gets nicer, please continue social distancing and resist the urge to congregate&nbsp;outside in groups. It is essential that all families do their part to help us through this difficult and potentially&nbsp;dangerous time. It will take the efforts of everyone to eliminate this disease threat from our communities.</p>
<p>“PLEASE&nbsp;continue to maintain social distancing during essential travel outdoors and stay at home when at all possible,” he added.</p>
<p>Confirmed cases by age in Allegheny County:</p>
<p>To age 4 – 2 (less than 1%)</p>
<p>5-12 – 4 (less than 1%)</p>
<p>13-18 – 7 (1%)</p>
<p>19-24 – 42 (9%)</p>
<p>25-49 – 203 (43%)</p>
<p>50-64 – 132 (28%)</p>
<p>Over 65 -- 86 (18%)</p>
<p>The virus is affecting as many women as it is men in the county, health officials said.</p>
<p><strong>Elsewhere in the state, nationwide</strong></p>
<p>Philadelphia County leads the state in the number of cases with 2,284. It also has seen 14 deaths, the most of any county.</p>
<p>Throughout the rest of Western Pennsylvania: Armstrong County has 11 cases; Beaver, 65; Butler, 75; Cambria and Clarion, 4; Erie, 17; Fayette, 20; Greene, 11; Indiana, 7; Lawrence, 19; Mercer, 10; Somerset, 3; Washington, 40; and Westmoreland, 110.</p>
<p>More than 245,000 people have become infected in the U.S. and the death toll has topped at 6,000 as of Friday morning, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. But the true numbers are believed to be much higher because of testing shortages and that many mild cases that have gone unreported.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Health experts now warn that some people infected with COVID-19 do not exhibit symptoms but “may still be able to transmit the disease to others without knowing that they have it. This is why physical distancing is so important.”</p>
<p><strong>Stay-at-home order</strong></p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday extended his stay-at-home order to all 12.8 million people in Pennsylvania amid a growing number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. The order, which took effect Wednesday night, makes Pennsylvania the last state in the Northeast to mandate that all residents remain at home except for limited, “life-sustaining” activities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The reality of&nbsp;the current situation is that the virus has made it across the world to our very own communities and we want our&nbsp;citizens to realize it’s here, and it knows no municipal borders,” the Westmoreland County Board of Commissioners said in a statement Friday. “We need to proceed assuming the virus has left no&nbsp;community untouched, and we need everyone to respond accordingly.”</p>
