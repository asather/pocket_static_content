<h1>UPMC Mercy says July 4th weekend produced record number of firework-related injuries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than 20 people — including several children — were treated at the UPMC Mercy Burn Center in Pittsburgh for serious fireworks-related injuries sustained over the Fourth of July weekend, UPMC officials said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It was the highest count on record at the hospital for injuries related to Independence Day fireworks, according to a release from UPMC, the burn center had only six injuries last July Fourth.</p>
<p>In addition to the victims treated this year at the burn center, several others were treated at the hospital’s emergency room with injuries commonly sustained from reloadable mortar-style fireworks and fire pits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Some of the injuries are very serious. Several patients were admitted and will need ongoing care and therapy,” said Dr. Jenny Ziembicki, the medical director at UPMC Mercy Burn Center, in the release. “We urge people to not engage in personal fireworks use to avoid any of these devastating traumas."</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for UPMC said specific details on other injuries, such as the type of fireworks that caused them, were private or not available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, seven individuals were admitted to the West Penn Burn Center, part of the Allegheny Health Network, with injuries sustained over the holiday, said Allegheny Health spokeswoman Stephanie Waite.&nbsp;“That’s pretty typical for a Fourth of July weekend,” Ms. Waite said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One individual, a minor, required surgical intervention, said Dr. Ariel Aballay, who has worked in West Penn’s burn unit since 2006. He said some burn injuries came from simple sparklers while another injury came from an&nbsp;“accidental explosion.”</p>
<p>“Our advice is to leave the fireworks to professionals,” Dr. Aballay said, “But if it’s going to be children, it’s safety first. That should be left up to the parents.”</p>
<p>Several others were treated for fireworks-related injuries at West Penn’s emergency department and released.&nbsp;“We always see a few,” Dr. Aballay said, noting this year’s injuries were mostly minor compared to past years. “I’ve seen in other years accidental amputations,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>About 10,000 fireworks-related injuries were reported in 2019 at a rate of approximately 3.1 injuries per 100,000 citizens, according to a recent United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) report. Twelve firework-related deaths were reported, seven of which came from “misuse” of fireworks.</p>
<p>The CPSC reported an estimated 7,300 injuries were treated at U.S. hospital emergency rooms and burn centers in a one-month special study period from June 21, 2019 to July 21, 2019.</p>
<p>The record number of fireworks-related injuries at UPMC comes after an exceptionally busy Fourth of July weekend for Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety. The recently-created Fireworks Response Team responded to 131 fireworks-related complaint calls on July 4 alone, according to a release from the department. Police, firefighters and EMS units responded to an additional 125 calls throughout the area over the holiday.</p>
<p>Several citations were issued by police, though spokeswoman Cara Cruz did not have an exact number on how many. Police will be issuing charges for more serious offenses.</p>
<p>“We can only keep reminding people of the dangers consumer fireworks pose, as evidenced by the incidents we've seen in the last week with trees, schools, playgrounds and residences that have caught fire due to the mishandling of fireworks,” said Ms. Cruz.</p>
<p>“Those incidents are under investigation and individuals who are found responsible for the more serious damage that stems from fireworks face charges such as endangering property/arson, endangering persons, and criminal mischief.”</p>
<p>Fireworks were responsible for several small fires at Lewis Park in Hazelwood that required two separate firefighter dispatches. Fires broke out on the park’s dek hockey rink, basketball courts and playground equipment.</p>
<p>Across town, fireworks at a pair of neighborhood block parties were to blame for a two-alarm fire on Orchard Place in Knoxville. In addition to the fire, the public works department was called in to clean up large amounts of fireworks-related debris.</p>
