<h1>Ron Cook: Ben Roethlisberger could have special connection with these Steelers wideouts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The best wide receiver Ben Roethlisberger has had was Antonio Brown, the best wide receiver in Steelers history. The two made beautiful music together for eight seasons before Big Chest lost his mind and bailed out on the team for good late in the 2018 season.</p>
<p>The second-best receiver Roethlisberger has had was Hines Ward. They didn’t always like each other off the field, but they often were unstoppable on it. Ward is a deserving Hall of Fame candidate, although he probably isn’t going to make it.</p>
<p>The best wide receivers Roethlisberger has had as a group were Ward, Santonio Holmes and Mike Wallace in 2009 or Brown, Wallace, Ward and Emmanuel Sanders in the 2011 season. “Young money,” Brown, Wallace and Sanders were called. They were dynamic.</p>
<p>I’m not sure Roethlisberger’s receivers this season won’t end up being his best group, especially if two things happen: Roethlisberger plays into 2022 and beyond and gets to watch the receivers grow and the team signs JuJu Smith-Schuster to a new contract after this season.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson, James Washington and Chase Claypool are young, with Smith-Schuster, in his fourth season, the most experienced. None will be better than Brown or Ward. But collectively? The possibilities are intriguing. Each of the four receivers contributed in a big way to the 26-16 win Monday night against the New York Giants, combining for 16 catches for 199 yards and three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger loves playing with Smith-Schuster, who had a combined 169 catches for 2,343 yards and 14 touchdowns in 2017 and 2018 and was the Steelers’ MVP in 2018 before his production plummeted last season when Roethlisberger missed all but a game-and-a-half with his elbow injury. Roethlisberger knows he can count on Smith-Schuster to be in the right spot. Remember what he said after a late end-zone interception in a crushing loss at Denver in 2018 when he believed Brown ran a poor pattern? “I think we should have gone to [JuJu] four straight plays.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger gushed about Smith-Schuster after the game Monday night for a reason that went beyond Smith-Schuster’s six catches on six targets for 69 yards and two touchdowns. He thought Smith-Schuster’s recovery of a Benny Snell fumble late in the third quarter was one of the big plays of the win. The Steelers led 16-10 at the time.</p>
<p>“Coach showed it [in the film review Wednesday],” Roethlisberger said. “There were, I believe, nine Giants in the pile and JuJu just dove in there and came up with it. To me, that shows the unselfishness of the team and of the player in JuJu. How many guys are ‘looking for a contract’ and trying to get paid would dive into a pile and risk their body with injury to recover a fumble that he didn’t fumble? That just shows the kind of team guy that he is. He’s a professional.”</p>
<p>Johnson got off to a bad start Monday night, fumbling an early punt that gave the Giants possession at the Steelers 3 and finishing the first half with just one catch for 2 yards. But he and Roethlisberger found their groove in the second half when Johnson had five catches for 55 yards. Four of the catches went for first downs.</p>
<p>If Smith-Schuster’s fumble recovery wasn’t the effort of the game, Washington’s 13-yard touchdown catch was. He fought through cornerback Julian Love to find the end zone for a score that gave the Steelers a 16-10 lead with seven seconds left in the first half.</p>
<p>Claypool, just a rookie, a relative baby at 22, made all the highlight shows with his first NFL catch. He reached high for Roethlisberger’s sideline pass, outfought Love for the ball and somehow got both feet in bounds for a 28-yard gain. The catch was absolutely Antonio-like.</p>
<p>“He has shown a lot in camp so far that he can be trusted,” Roethlisberger said of Claypool. “He gets to the place he’s supposed to be and he makes plays. I kind of threw it up for him knowing that it was kind of a one-on-one ball. He went up and made an unbelievable catch.”</p>
<p>Chances are it will be the first of many for Claypool.</p>
<p>“It takes all of us,” Smith-Schuster said. “Ben told us that we can’t be great individually, but, if we work hard together, we can be great as a team.”</p>
<p>Chances are this season will be the final one for Roethlisberger and Smith-Schuster together. Roethlisberger has said he plans on playing out his contract which runs through next season, but another injury could change all that. The Steelers are going to have a hard time signing Smith-Schuster, a pending free agent, to a new deal because of salary cap problems after a pandemic season.</p>
<p>“Ben’s been playing this game for so long. He’s accomplished pretty much everything I’ve dreamed of,” Smith-Schuster said this week in a moment of reflection. “I don’t know how long I have with him. But I make every day, every game, special. Every moment.”</p>
<p>That’s a wonderful attitude.</p>
<p>All of us can learn from it.</p>
<p>We should enjoy watching Roethlisberger and Smith-Schuster while we can.</p>
