<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Thursday that he will order the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff over the next three days as the death toll from COVID-19 surpasses 95,000.</p>
<p>Trump tweeted Thursday: “I will be lowering the flags on all Federal Buildings and National Monuments to half-staff over the next three days in memory of the Americans we have lost to the CoronaVirus.”</p>
<p>He said the flags will continue to be flown at half-staff on Memorial Day in honor of those in the military who died serving their country.</p>

<p>The move follows a request from Democratic leaders to do so to recognize a “sad day of reckoning when we reach 100,000 deaths.”</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote to Trump that an order to fly the U.S. flag at half-staff would “serve as a national expression of grief so needed by everyone in our country.”</p>
<p>Democrats have been critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, and in recent days Pelosi and Trump have exchanged barbs.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, the offices of the House speaker and the Senate majority leader make their own decision regarding whether to lower the flags on the roof of each chamber. The Architect of the Capitol is responsible for two flags on the east and west side of the center of the building, taking instructions from joint House leadership.</p>
