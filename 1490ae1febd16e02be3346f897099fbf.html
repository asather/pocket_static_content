<h1>Derek Holland — like MLB's top stars — has concerns about MLB's Arizona plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mike Trout called Major League Baseball’s plan to potentially play inside of an Arizona-based biosphere “pretty crazy,” raising concerns about players with families and pregnant wives.&nbsp;Trout and his wife, Jessica, are expecting their first child in August.</p>
<p>Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw has three kids of his own, including a newborn, and said he almost assuredly wouldn’t participate in something where he’d have to leave his family for several months.</p>
<p>Trout and Kershaw are two of baseball's biggest names. If they don't want to go, what does that mean for everyone else?</p>
<p>"We would feed off of those guys," Pirates pitcher Derek Holland told the Post-Gazette on Saturday. "If they’re doing something, we’re going to do what they do. Trout’s like the face of the franchise. He’s the face of baseball. We’re going to respect him. Same thing with Kershaw.</p>
<p>“If they’re not agreeing on something, we want to make sure we’re right there with them. We’re a big family. We’re definitely going to stick together."</p>
<p>While Holland raises a valid point — players with less status likely wanting to follow the game's more established stars — he also doesn't need any assistance disliking the whole Arizona plan.</p>
<p>Holland, who actually got engaged during spring training, said if his fiancée was pregnant, there's "no chance" he'd leave her to go play baseball in Arizona.</p>
<p>"I don’t see a lot of guys agreeing with that," Holland said. "Also, what about the guys who have houses in Arizona? You’re going to tell me they can’t go live in their own house? That’s not going to fly. To me, I think that’s a dumb thing we’re trying to do there with that."</p>
<p>Not that it was good for anyone anywhere, but the coronavirus pandemic occurred at an inopportune time for Holland, who signed a minor league contract with the Pirates this offseason and was likely going to make the major league club as Pittsburgh’s fifth starter.</p>

<p>Reunited with an old friend in first-year pitching coach Oscar Marin, Holland had done some excellent work establishing his fastball and using his breaking stuff to get strikeouts. With more than 10 years of major league service time, Holland was a veteran voice — and source of fun — in the clubhouse.</p>
<p>Like all Pirates pitchers, Holland has continued to work out and throw. He’s actually been throwing flat-ground sessions in the street in front of his house in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, with his brother, Greg, catching him.</p>
<p>“When we first started doing it, the pops of the mitt definitely got my neighbors to come out and try to figure out what was going on,” Holland joked.</p>
<p>The left-hander has also been building his own home gym, purchasing dumbbells and a Bow-Flex to stay in shape.</p>
<p>Virtual instruction from Marin has helped, Holland said. The two chat about mechanics and the feel of Holland’s pitches, although it’s obviously not the same as facing live hitters. Holland has been throwing about two innings per session to stay ready but also not overworking himself in case the season restarts and runs long.</p>
<p>“This was actually a pretty good spring for me compared to other springs,” Holland said. “I give a lot of credit to the staff. [Manager Derek] Shelton keeping us all loose, that’s one big plus. Then obviously with Oscar, being able to work with him again since our Texas [Rangers] days; he’s been able to help me always get back on track to where I need to be.</p>
<p>“It’s showing. And that’s why it’s good to be able to do what we’re doing with the mechanics, where he’s picking me apart and letting me know, ‘Hey, this is where you should be. This is how it looks.’ ”</p>
<p>It’s a weird situation contract-wise for Holland, who received $50,000 as part of the MLB Players Association’s plan to compensate non-roster invitees. Yet while there was every indication of Holland breaking camp with the big club, nothing was official.</p>
<p>As such, he’s still obviously getting coaching from the Pirates, but he’s not yet officially a member of the MLB team.</p>
<p>“I don’t care how good I was doing or even if I was pitching poorly,” Holland said. “I’m still not going to know whether or not I’m on the team until they actually put it out there. They treat me as if I’m on the team. That’s awesome. That’s what I love about these guys. They make you feel a part of it, whether you were doing good or bad. … It’s just a matter of now waiting to see what happens.”</p>
<p>And if that means packing up and heading to Arizona, well, Holland hopes players’ families will be able to come, too.</p>
<p>“No player in their right mind is ever going to leave their wife and kids alone like that, especially for months,” Holland said.</p>
<p>Holland does have what he thinks is a better idea. Either families are involved, or games should played in home ballparks with no fans at first, with the hope of including them later on. If players have to wear masks, so be it.</p>
<p>“You’re seeing it already in Korea,” Holland said. “They’re playing baseball with no fans in the stands. That’s the best way to put it. That’s how it might have to start off. I think we should go that way.</p>
<p>“Texas is starting to open up businesses, and people have to wear masks. If it really came down to it, have us pitch with masks on.”</p>
