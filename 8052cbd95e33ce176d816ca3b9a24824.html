<p>The City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure announced in a statement on Thursday that after a multi-year delay, construction has begun on the new West Ohio Street Bridge in Allegheny Commons Park in the Allegheny Center neighborhood.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh City Council approved a $5.4 million budget in September 2018 to repair the 117-year-old bridge, which was closed to traffic in January 2018 due to deterioration.</p>
<p>“When construction is completed in the Fall of 2021, the new West Ohio Street Bridge will support a full return to service between Allegheny Commons and Allegheny West,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Because the bridge runs over the Norfolk Southern Railroad Tracks, the City plans to raise its replacement three feet higher to allow a 22-foot clearance for the rail line that passes underneath, along with the general reconstruction.</p>
<p>The greater clearance height is designed to accommodate taller freight, particularly “double-stack” trains. Yet such trains have come under scrutiny in Pittsburgh over the years, especially after one derailed and spilled two tiers of cargo in Station Square in 2018.</p>
<p>The City originally wanted to maintain the bridge’s current clearance of 19-feet, but was forced to adopt the 22-foot design when Norfolk Southern Railroad, which oversees the rail line, filed a legal challenge and won in appeals court in 2017.</p>
<p>In early 2019 however, the City challenged Norfolk Southern’s plans to alter the bridge, along with several other bridges the company planned to modify in the North Side, by filing legal paperwork to join the state’s Public Utility Commissions review of the plans.</p>
<p>The City, along with neighborhoods in the North Side, argued that the plans to introduce double-stack trains would ultimately increase noise, pollution and risk of derailment.</p>
<p>Those concerns were eventually mediated in late 2019.</p>
<p>The statement also said that a temporary pedestrian bridge will be installed in the coming weeks to allow pedestrian access over the railroad tracks during the construction.</p>
