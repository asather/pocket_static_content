<h1>Pennsylvania golfers and owners rejoice as courses get set to reopen statewide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was a collective sigh of relief as deep as one of Oakmont’s bunkers from golfers and course owners across Pennsylvania when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/27/Pennsylvania-reopening-outdoor-businesses-golf-courses-guided-fishing-campgrounds-mental-health/stories/202004270122" target="_blank">Gov. Tom Wolf announced</a> that golf courses, which had been shut down since March 13, can reopen on Friday.</p>
<p>Wolf’s decision, which was announced Monday, includes all public and private courses, in addition to driving ranges, in the state. Courses have been allowed to maintain their properties during the shutdown because maintenance crews — and landscape businesses — were considered “essential services.”</p>
<p>“We’re alive. ... We’re back in business,” said Jim Antkiewicz, director of golf at the Club at Nevillewood. “Everyone is jumping out of their skin.”</p>
<p>In addition to golf courses, Wolf said other outdoor recreational activities such as marinas and campgrounds are also allowed to open May 1.</p>
<p>Courses will have to maintain strict guidelines set forth by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that are practiced in other states such as Ohio and West Virginia where courses were allowed to remain open. Among those guidelines are sanitizing golf carts after each round, allowing players to ride one to a cart, removing bunker rakes, never touching or removing the flagstick and blocking the cup from the ball entering the hole. Players have to put their own bags on a cart.</p>
<p>Pro shops can be open for limited business, but restaurants and dining areas have to be closed. Private clubs will not provide bag storage or club or shoe cleaning.</p>
<p>“That’s great news — what else can you say,” said PGA professional Sam Depe III, who owns Hickory Heights Golf Club in Bridgeville. “But it’s long overdue I think. I’m all for the social distance and everything, but golf is safer than trout fishing.”</p>
<p>Golf course owners, private clubs and all the top organizations in the state — including the Tri-State section of the PGA of America, Western Pennsylvania Golf Association and Pennsylvania Golf Association — have been petitioning the governor for weeks to allow courses to remain open during the stay-at-home order. Wolf rejected all their requests.</p>
<p>“With golf coming back, we need to be as safe and responsible as possible,” said Dave Wright, Tri-State PGA’s executive director who held a webinar for 70 club professionals on April 17 on preparing courses to reopen. “Everybody is excited now, but after the excitement wears off, it will be about what guidelines do we have to follow.”</p>
<p>Even though courses were ordered to close, members at some private clubs were still surreptitiously playing golf, out of view of the public and, more importantly, police. Most private clubs, though, prohibited their members from playing, including Oakmont and the Club at Nevillewood. Not anymore.</p>
<p>“They can’t wait to play,” Antkiewicz said. “They even said, ‘We have rain suits. If it’s raining, we’re still going.’”</p>
<p>In addition to courses, driving ranges are also allowed to reopen, so long as they maintain social distancing as well. But, according to PGA professional Ed Vietmeier, who owns and operates Vietmeier Golf Center in Kennedy, hitting stalls with artificial mats have to be 10 feet apart anyway for insurance purposes.</p>
<p>Vietmeier, though, will set up tee markers 10 feet apart on his grass hitting areas to maintain safe and proper distance.</p>
<p>“We have to take all the benches out because they don’t want people sitting around,” Vietmeier said. “But people are there for a reason. They hit balls and leave.”</p>
<p>Wolf’s decision will not have any positive impact on sales representatives for golf-equipment manufacturers because most private clubhouses and pro shops will be closed to members. Public-course shops will be open mainly to handle greens fees.</p>
<p>“All of our product is sitting inside the walls and can’t be sold,” said Greg Altman, TaylorMade’s Western Pennsylvania sales rep. “It’s really impacted the activity. But this will really help the facilities that weren’t making any money.”</p>
<p>About the only people disappointed with Gov. Wolf’s decision were golf course owners in Ohio and West Virginia, who were seeing golfers from Western Pennsylvania flock to their facilities because they have been allowed to remain open. Tee times at those clubs were getting harder to come by than a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>Paul DiLorenzo, head golf professional at Williams Country Club in Weirton, W.Va., said his private club picked up 32 new members during the shutdown because golfers from Western Pennsylvania could go there and play on a special one-day “member” rate.</p>
<p>“Guys who had never been here saw how good it was,” DiLorenzo said. “It’s all been good.”</p>
