<h1>Ray Fittipaldo's Steelers report card: Big plays cover up some noticeable warts</h1>

<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>STEELERS WEEK 2 REPORT CARD</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Quarterback:</strong> Ben Roethlisberger was hard on himself after the game, lamenting his play and second-guessing some of the timing on the throws he missed. It was far from a perfect performance, but there were some encouraging signs amidst the uneven play. If anyone was wondering if he could still throw the deep ball, wonder no more. He lofted a perfect pass to Chase Claypool down the sideline, and the rookie took it 84 yards for a touchdown in the first half. He also made a vintage Big Ben play in the fourth quarter when he scrambled and found Diontae Johnson for a 28-yard touchdown. Those were the highlights on an otherwise up-and-down day for the offense. Roethlisberger opened the door for the Broncos to come back early in the third quarter when he made a poor decision and threw an interception to Justin Simmons. It was 17-3 at the time, and one of two critical turnovers that almost cost the Steelers the game. Roethlisberger finished 29 for 41 for 311 yards and a quarterback rating of 98.7, but this win would have been much more impressive if he could have closed the game out with a drive rather than relying on the defense to stand tall late in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B-</p>
<p><strong>Running backs:</strong> Let’s not let James Conner’s 59-yard run late in the fourth quarter gloss over this fact: The rushing attack was poor for much of the game. Conner, who was playing on an injured ankle, finished with 106 yards on 16 carries, but he had just 47 on his other 15 carries. Benny Snell, who was coming off a 113-yard performance in the opener, fumbled in the fourth quarter when the Steelers were trying to run out the clock. The miscue allowed the Broncos to get within five points late in the game. Snell also fumbled last week against the Giants, but JuJu Smith-Schuster bailed him out when he recovered. Maybe that’s the reason coach Mike Tomlin started Conner and played him for most of the game. Snell had just five yards on three carries.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> C</p>
<p><strong>Receivers:</strong> Claypool and Johnson provided the splash plays the Steelers desperately needed. Claypool was drafted for his big-play ability, and the Steelers targeted him knowing he would be in single coverage on his first career touchdown. “I knew I had a pretty good chance to get the ball,” Claypool said afterward. “I just had to win the route.” Johnson won more routes than any Steelers receiver, catching eight passes on 13 targets for a team-high 92 yards. Nine different players caught passes for the Steelers, but there were some drops that pulled this grade down.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Offensive line:</strong> Everyone was worried about the right side of the line with rookie Kevin Dotson making his first career start and Chuks Okorafor making his first start of the season. But Roethlisberger was only sacked one time, and left guard Matt Feiler allowed it. That was the most important stat of the day for the line. There weren’t a lot of big holes for Conner and the other runners, but for all the angst Tomlin had about his inexperienced linemen stepping into the fire, this performance turned out to be just fine. Kudos to Dotson and Okorafor for stepping in and doing well under difficult circumstances.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Defensive line:</strong> The Broncos had some success early with their running game, but they eventually shut off the rushing lanes for Melvin Gordon, who finished with 70 yards on 19 carries. The Broncos totaled 104 yards for the game, a number the Steelers surely will want to lower next week when the Houston Texans come to town. Tyson Alualu registered his first sack of the season, and Cam Heyward had a half-sack. It was a quiet day for Stephon Tuitt, who had just one tackle in the entire game. It was a solid, if unspectacular, day for the front three.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Linebackers:</strong> Wish I could give two grades here — one for the outside linebackers and another for the inside linebackers. Let’s start with the good: T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree had field days against the Broncos’ young tackles. Watt finished with 2 ½ sacks. Dupree had a sack and a forced fumble that got the Steelers going early in the first quarter. They led the charge on a day the Steelers recorded seven sacks. Now the bad: Devin Bush struggled in coverage for much of the day. He gave up a touchdown and two-point conversion to Broncos tight end Noah Fant. Vince Williams was in coverage when Gordon caught a touchdown in the fourth quarter that made it 26-21. The Steelers knew Williams might struggle covering running backs, but they were hoping Bush could do a better job covering Fant. It was an A-plus performance by Watt and Dupree, and a much less desirable grade for Bush and Williams in coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B-</p>
<p><strong>Secondary:</strong> Penalties by the secondary were costly, including a roughing-the-passer on Mike Hilton and some untimely pass interference calls, including one on Terrell Edmunds late in the game that kept a Broncos drive alive. Edmunds made up for that mistake, though, when he sacked Jeff Driskel on fourth down to seal the game for the Steelers. Hilton had a huge first half with a sack, a fumble recovery and four tackles. Joe Haden was beat on a deep ball by Courtland Sutton in the second quarter, but he rebounded on the next series and intercepted a pass that set up a field goal just before halftime. The secondary is one of this team’s strengths, but they have to find a way to decrease their penalties.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B-</p>
<p><strong>Special teams:</strong> Ray-Ray McCloud once again showed why he made the team with an excellent 49-yard kickoff return. He finished with 64 yards on two returns. Diontae Johnson was slippery on punt returns and had an 81-yard touchdown nullified by a clipping penalty on Cam Sutton. Derek Watt recorded a safety when he tackled Broncos punter Sam Martin in the end zone after he bobbled the snap. Chris Boswell made his only field goal attempt and punter Dustin Colquitt pinned the Broncos inside the 20 twice. All in all, it was a solid day for Danny Smith and his units.</p>
<p><strong>Grade:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Coaching:</strong> Defensive coordinator Keith Butler’s call to blitz Terrell Edmunds on the critical fourth-down stop late in the game bailed head coach Mike Tomlin out after he made some questionable decisions down the stretch that almost cost the Steelers the game. His challenge on Noah Fant’s catch on the Broncos’ final drive had no chance. Replays clearly showed Fant get both feet in bounds. Assistant coach Teryl Austin was brought in to help Tomlin on challenges, and not communicating to Tomlin that it was a catch made for some nail-biting moments in the final minutes. The bad challenge cost the Steelers their second timeout. It would have been all anyone would have talked about if the Broncos scored a touchdown and the Steelers failed to answer. On offense, Randy Fichtner has to find ways to get his running game going. On a day Roethlisberger admittedly struggled, the Steelers needed a more reliable run game, and it was nowhere to be found against the Broncos. This offense needs an identity. It’s not too late to find one, but better teams will take advantage of some of the miscues that have been evident in the first two weeks of the season.</p>
