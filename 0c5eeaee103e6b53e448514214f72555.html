<h1>MLB offers players union two choices. So, what happens next?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball has given the MLB Players Association two options regarding how the sides can potentially work together to hold a season in 2020.</p>
<p>Neither looks particularly promising.</p>
<p>In fact, it actually paints a pretty morbid picture for the sport returning at all this summer when you factor in how players feel about things.</p>
<p>According to MLB Network’s Jon Heyman, MLB has told the MLBPA that it can either agree to additional pay cuts or simply wait until fans are allowed back in ballparks, which likely wouldn’t be until 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>The first part of Heyman’s tweet is what has caused the uproar to this point, with the league and its players differing on how to interpret a March 26 agreement that outlined how they would handle things amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Players believe they’ve already agreed to what amounts to a 50% pay cut by accepting a prorated portion of their salary — likely 82 games’ worth.&nbsp;The league, meanwhile, argues that a second set of negotiations are now necessary because there will more than likely be no gate revenue.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, the New York Post <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/19/mlb-thinks-email-is-smoking-gun-in-salary-fight-with-players/" target="_blank">obtained an email</a> from an MLB lawyer, which was sent to league officials and details a discussion with MLBPA representatives from that morning.</p>
<p>Those talks appeared to focus on the need for a second round of negotiations if games were to occur in empty stadiums. The acknowledgement of that could weaken the MLBPA’s argument.</p>
<p>But as far as the options MLB has given the MBLPA, they’re impractical for a few reasons.&nbsp;One, regardless of whether you agree or not, the MLBPA doesn’t believe there’s anything to discuss.</p>
<p>Both <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/07/mlb-baseball-return-july-start-date-reports-jameson-taillon-pirates/stories/202005070167" target="_blank">Jameson Taillon</a>, the Pirates’ MLBPA representative, as well as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/05/08/Joe-Musgrove-Pirates-MLB-pay-cuts-baseball-return-COVID-19/stories/202005080063" target="_blank">Joe Musgrove</a>&nbsp;have spoken in recent weeks about what they believe they’ve already agreed to and have implied they likely won’t take less.</p>
<p>The union also called MLB’s first financial proposal — which technically the league has not yet delivered — a “non-starter,” saying the 50-50 revenue split equated to a salary cap and fearing it was too big of a concession with the current Collective Bargaining Agreement expiring after next season.</p>
<p>Whichever side is right might not matter if the players aren’t amenable to the original proposal and won’t even discuss a different way of handling the prorated salaries.</p>
<p>Another issue here involves the health and safety guidelines MLB delivered to the Players Association this past weekend, detailed directives that could affect how players can train.</p>
<p>If players are taking less and risking potential long-term earnings while doing it, all during a pandemic, it certainly seems plausible that they potentially could ignore the public’s thirst for live sports and wait it out.</p>
<p>At minimum, one of the key questions entering these negotiations was how much the league and its owners would be willing to budge. If Tuesday’s little tidbit of news tells us anything, the answer seems to be not much.</p>
