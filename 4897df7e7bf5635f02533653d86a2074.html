<h1>Pirates’ intentions, progress cloudy as ever after loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY, Mo. —&nbsp;It probably sounds laughable at this point, but the final few weeks of the 2020 season aren’t about a playoff push for the Pirates. Obviously, as one particular coach in Pittsburgh might say.</p>
<p>But while they seemingly punted on that dream long ago — hello offseason additions Guillermo Heredia, Luke Maile, Jarrod Dyson, Robbie Erlin and JT Riddle — the big-picture goal at this point should’ve been clarity.</p>
<p>After an 11-0 loss to the Royals at Kauffman Stadium on Sunday, it’s frightening to think how little of that the Pirates (14-30) actually have.</p>
<p>Their most lopsided loss of the season completed a series sweep for Kansas City and dropped the Pirates to 2-15 against the American League’s Central Division, but it also raised questions about what’s happening here.</p>
<p>Four things stand out about this one, including a no-show by the offense, more defensive gaffes and some head-scratching decisions with playing time. But let’s start with the game’s starting pitcher, Chad Kuhl.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ best starter for much of this season, it was a rough afternoon for Kuhl against the Royals as his fastball command lacked.</p>
<p>Kuhl had a .198 batting average against over his first six starts, allowing two or fewer runs in four of those, but on Sunday lasted just 2 1/3 innings. The right-hander allowed nine earned runs on four hits and six walks, not to mention a wild pitch, a home run allowed and hitting a batter.</p>
<p>"Just had no fastball command, really," Kuhl said.</p>
<p>How much Kuhl labored was noticeable. He definitely struggled to throw strikes, finding the zone on just 31 of his 70 pitches. After a 32-pitch first, Kuhl gave up a 440-foot bomb to catcher Salvador Perez opening the third before issuing a bases-loaded walk.</p>
<p>Kuhl said he's been bothered by intermittent cuticle and blister issues, though he didn't directly blame them for his erratic performance.</p>
<p>“We went to all breaking ball stuff just to try to get some quick outs, but I just didn't have it today,” Kuhl said.</p>
<p>The issue remains what to make of Kuhl this season, and it's probably an incomplete grade because he's coming back from Tommy John surgery. It also stands to reason that the Pirates would like to see progress out of someone they'll need to stabilize their rotation in 2021.</p>
<p>This did little to assuage any concerns there, although the start might've gone differently had more fielding issues not cropped up in the first inning, which is issue No. 2 of concern.</p>
<p>JT Riddle — more on him shortly — booted a grounder to his left, allowing a run to score, although it was inexplicably ruled a hit, not an error.</p>
<p>Josh Bell also botched a grounder, an in-between hop, that forced him to get the out at first, allowing another run to score.</p>
<p>Then what Shelton called "a freak play" unfolded when a wild pitch from Kuhl hit home plate umpire Jeremie Rehak in the mask, nobody could find it, and the Royals ended up scoring two.</p>
<p>"As inconsistent as Chad was, he should have been out of the first," Shelton said. "The ruling on the ball hit to Riddle is atrocious. That’s an error all day long.</p>
<p>“But again, we could have been out of that inning. We have to make plays."</p>
<p>Not only have the Pirates failed to make meaningful progress in the field, but they might have regressed. Kevin Newman has a team-high six errors. Riddle has five in 13 starts. Bell has not looked like an every-day first baseman.</p>
<p>Jacob Stallings has been good. Erik Gonzalez has been serviceable, too. And their best defender has been Ke'Bryan Hayes, who sat in favor of Riddle.</p>
<p>Shelton said he didn’t want to overwork Hayes with a doubleheader Monday, which sort of makes sense except for the fact that Hayes (and the team) was off Monday and Thursday of last week.</p>
<p>But a 23-year-old can’t play five baseball games in four days? And why not stagger the off days so Gonzalez can play over someone with a slash line of .167/.200/.271? The Pirates certainly need it given how little the offense has produced, their collective OPS dropping from .741 in 2019 (19th) to a league-worst .633 this season.</p>
<p>The commitment to Riddle is odd. It’s also not congruent with the Pirates’ insistence that playing time must be earned, the same for how they’re treating Dovydas Neverauskas.</p>
<p>Neverauskas, 27, has a career ERA of 6.89 and coughed up another home run Sunday to bring his season total to five over 18 innings. Yet that’s preferable to Blake Cederlind? How?</p>
<p>So while Sunday offered some interesting nuggets for the present — Royals starter Brad Keller twirled a complete-game shutout, the Pirates twice got a runner to second, and Kansas City hit two homers that totaled nearly 900 feet — the greater frustration has to be the lack of clarity that has been achieved.</p>
<p>“You're always going to have games like this that are pretty ugly,” Kuhl said. “You just want to put this one behind you and gauge yourself based off of the bulk of your work and not just one bad game."</p>
