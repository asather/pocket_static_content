<h1>COVID-19 relief boosts United Way's annual fundraising campaign</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A surge in donations to help people impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic pushed United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania’s fundraising total to $38.5 million during the annual campaign that just concluded.</p>
<p>The total, up 3.5% from the prior year, includes nearly $3 million donated specifically to meet critical needs of those who lost jobs or experienced other fallout from the coronavirus crisis.</p>

<p>Last year’s campaign raised $37.2 million from donors in Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler, Fayette and southern Armstrong counties.</p>
<p>United Way relies heavily on workplace campaigns which came to a sudden halt in March when many businesses closed or sent employees home to work remotely to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>At that point, United Way launched its Emergency Basic Needs Fund which is providing meals to students and families, delivering personal protective equipment, helping to reopen summer camps for children, and supporting needs of senior citizens.</p>
<p>“This year’s fundraising campaign was unlike any we have seen before,” said Bobbi Watt Geer, president and chief executive of the local United Way affiliate.</p>
<p>“We never stopped focusing on our core mission, but we’ve certainly had to adapt in order to guide our community through this crisis and ensure that immediate needs were met.”</p>
<p>Calls to United Way’s 2-1-1 helpline increased by 131% during the first month of the COVID-19 crisis, the nonprofit said.</p>
<p>During that time, it added team members at 2-1-1 to handle nearly 40,000 requests for assistance.</p>
