<h1>COVID-19 update: Pa. reports 115 more deaths as number of cases declines</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials Friday said that 115 more people died of COVID-19 complications and 866 new cases were reported, the 12th straight day under 1,000.</p>
<p>The number of new cases continues to gradually decline. Friday’s jump in cases compares to 980 new cases reported the previous day. The latest figures bring the state’s death toll to 4,984 and case total to 66,258.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported Friday two more deaths due to the disease, following a three-day stretch without a single death from the virus.&nbsp;The new figures bring Allegheny’s pandemic death toll to 146 deaths — 135 confirmed and 11 probable, according to the county Health Department.</p>
<p>Only one other death was reported in Western Pennsylvania: in Beaver County, according to state figures.</p>
<p>Allegheny County on Friday reported 21 new cases. Since the county’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 14, Allegheny has had 1,739 cases — 1,641 confirmed and 98 probable. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>As of Friday, 314 people have been hospitalized in Allegheny because of the highly infectious disease. Of them, at least 125 required a stay at the intensive care unit and 67 required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Since March 14, Allegheny County has administered 27,118 tests. The county health department said it has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald this week expressed some optimism regarding Allegheny’s performance since moving to the yellow phase of reopening on May 15.</p>
<p>“Thus far, our numbers continue to remain good on new cases, hospitalizations [and] fatalities,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. Allegheny Health Director Dr. Debra Bogen cautioned that it is too soon to tell if Allegheny will see additional cases due to reopening.</p>
<p>The county executive also said that he believes the state is considering moving certain businesses, including hair salons, barber shops, gyms and restaurants with outdoor seating into the yellow phase. Gov. Tom Wolf has scheduled a 4 p.m. press conference today to announce the further lifting of restrictions in certain parts of the state.</p>
<p>Also, the state Department of Health has begun providing more information on the cases and deaths occurring inside individual nursing homes and long-term care homes in each county. That list is being made available as a spreadsheet by the state health department. The spreadsheet can be accessed <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Diseases%20and%20Conditions/COVID-19%20LTCF%20Data_5-21-20.pdf" target="_blank">at the department’s website here</a>.</p>
