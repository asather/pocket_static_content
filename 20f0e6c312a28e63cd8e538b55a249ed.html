<p>The organization that administers the SAT on Thursday announced a new Sept. 26 date for the college entrance exam in the U.S. and internationally.</p>
<p>The College Board issued its brief advisory a week after announcing <a href="/SAT0423Schackner0423&nbsp;%20--%20The%20organization%20that%20administers%20the%20SAT%20on%20Thursday%20announced%20a%20new%20Sept.%2026%20date%20for%20the%20college%20entrance%20exam%20in%20the%20U.S.%20and%20internationally.&nbsp;The%20College%20Board%20issued%20the%20brief%20advisory%20a%20week%20after%20it%20announced%20it%20could%20not%20administer%20the%20SAT%20in%20June,%20given%20public%20health%20concerns%20about%20COVID-19.%20The%20new%20date%20is%20for%20students%20in%20this%20country%20and%20abroad.&nbsp;The%20pandemic%20that%20has%20claimed%20nearly%2047,000%20lives%20in%20the%20U.S.%20alone%20has%20thrown%20campus%20and%20high%20school%20schedules%20into%20flux,%20as%20schools%20have%20been%20shuttered%20in%20various%20states%20to%20slow%20the%20virus’s%20spread.%20A%20number%20of%20institutions,&nbsp;including%20some%20in%20Pennsyvlania,%20have%20said%20they%20will%20drop%20the%20standardized%20test%20requirement%20at%20leats%20temporarily,%20given%20the%20disruptions%20caused%20by%20the%20pandemic." target="_blank">it could not administer</a> the SAT in June, given public health concerns about COVID-19.</p>

<p>“Registration for the 2020-21 SAT administrations opens to students in May,” it continued. “Students who registered for June and those in the high school class of 2021 who do not have SAT scores will have early access to register for the August, September, and October administrations.”</p>
<p>The pandemic, which has claimed more than 47,000 lives in the U.S. alone, threw college and high school schedules into flux this spring, as schools were shuttered in various states including Pennsylvania to slow the virus’s spread. A number of institutions, <a href="/This%20administration%20date%20will%20be%20for%20students%20in%20the%20U.S.%20and%20internationally.%20As%20usual,%20Sunday%20testing%20for%20religious%20reasons%20will%20also%20be%20available.%20%20Registration%20for%20the%202020-21%20SAT%20administrations%20opens%20to%20students%20in%20May.%20Students%20who%20registered%20for%20June%20and%20those%20in%20the%20high%20school%20class%20of%202021%20who%20do%20not%20have%20SAT%20scores%20will%20have%20early%20access%20to%20register%20for%20the%20August,%20September,%20and%20October%20administrations." target="_blank">including some in Pennsylvania</a>, have said they will drop the standardized test requirement at least temporarily, given the disruptions caused by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Many schools canceled in-person instruction for the rest of the academic year, and a number of colleges have extended online-only instruction into the summer.</p>
