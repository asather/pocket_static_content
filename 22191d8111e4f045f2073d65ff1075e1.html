<h1>Gene Therapy: A terrible, horrible, very bad week, and that was just the Falwells</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You’ve probably noticed that it’s been another terrible week for um, everything, whether it’s savage meteorological destruction, stubbornly lethal biological pathogens, American shooters crippling and/or killing people in the streets, or just the accumulating nuclear waste of political toxicity.</p>
<p>But thank God, praise Jesus, for hot blooded pool boys and pratfalling evangelicals, always an amusing diversion on the culture’s ever-spinning hypocrisy wheel.</p>
<p>I guess it’s not very funny to Jerry Falwell Jr., who until early Monday, and then again late Monday, was president of Liberty University. His wasn’t a real good week either, at least as we understand the timeline.</p>
<p>Prior to last Sunday: On leave of absence from university gig for being photographed with his pants undone and his fly pulled down and his arm around a woman who wasn’t his wife. He could explain, obviously, but the university preferred he do it during a leave of absence. “I’ve put 50 years of my life into this school,” Mr. Falwell told the Wall Street Journal. “If they want to let me go over a picture showing my belly on the internet, that’s not a school I want to be part of.”</p>
<p>Monday: Resigns after the Washington Examiner publishes a story saying Mr. Falwell and his wife carried on a years-long sexual relationship with hot blooded Miami Beach pool boy Giancarlo Granda, who later tells the New York Post that Mr. Falwell is a serial predator who sent him photos of a Liberty student exposing herself at his farm.</p>
<p>Later Monday: Withdraws resignation, but ultimately relents when Liberty agrees to a separation deal worth a reported $10.5 million. While he might not be laughing all the way to the bank, that won’t preclude him from going to the bank.</p>
<p>Tuesday: Receives offer from the swingers and threesomes division of an adult website that includes free membership for him and his wife and $100,000 to be its brand ambassador. So maybe make out that deposit slip for $10.6 million?</p>
<p>The undoing of Jerry Falwell Jr. had been underway for some time regardless of the role played by the pool boy, as a senior Liberty University official was telling Politico last September, “We’re not a school; we’re a real estate hedge fund. We’re not educating; we’re buying real estate every year and taking students’ money to do it.”</p>
<p>Often enough, sex scandals related to high profile evangelicals spring into the news cycle like meteors unrelated to earthly events. The crumbling of the Jim Bakker televangelism empire both for his $280,000 diversion of church funds to one Jessica Hahn after their sexual encounter and the millions Bakker and wife Tammy Faye diverted from the ministry into their silk-lined pockets wasn’t much more than it was on its face (Jim got sentenced to 45 years and served five), nor was that of weepin’ Jimmy “Ah have sinned!” Swaggart, defrocked for his exertions with prostitutes, who were happy to add that he regularly refused to pay the going rate despite a TV ministry on 3,000 channels.</p>
<p>But Mr. Falwell’s fall is different in that it hit the news cycle during the Republican National Convention, at which he was a prominent speaker only four years ago after unexpectedly endorsing Donald Trump right before the Iowa caucuses. Whether or not that arrangement was brokered by since-jailed Trump bag man Michael Cohen remains speculative, but it’s interesting — no? — that Cohen says he helped scuttle the release by a third party of photographs involving the Falwells and the pool boy.</p>
<p>It’s possible there was no quid pro quo. Possible.</p>
<p>Just as I guess it’s possible that one of the country’s most prominent evangelicals and the head of America’s largest Christian university could get behind a spectacularly irreligious presidential candidate and even vouch for Mr. Trump’s Christian virtues, even though Mr. Falwell originally stated he was endorsing Mr. Trump out of respect for his business experience.</p>
<p>Wonder which of Mr. Trump’s five bankruptcies he admired most?</p>
<p>So this week, the 2020 RNC went off without a marquee speaker, unless maybe you want to count Tiffany Trump. Mr. Falwell might not be as well positioned to deliver the evangelical voting block this time around, but so long as he retains his father’s gift for fearmongering, he’ll be a useful Trump tool.</p>
<p>You’ll remember perhaps that Jerry Falwell Sr., from whom Junior inherited Liberty U., pretty much blamed AIDS on homosexuals and Sept. 11 on them and just about everyone else. “The pagans and the abortionists and the feminists and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the ACLU, People for the American Way — all of them who have tried to secularize America,” Senior said to fellow evangelical TV icon Pat Robertson, "I point the finger in their face and say 'you helped this happen.' "</p>
<p>Folks like the Falwells and the other profit-driven evangelicals will stick with Mr. Trump no matter what. They admire the way he wields fear, and they know he’s an irredeemable con man just like they are.</p>
