<h1>Reputed leader of cross-country coke ring centered in Penn Hills set to plead guilty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Florida felon identified by federal agents as the ringleader of one of the largest cocaine rings ever prosecuted in this district has indicated he will admit his guilt later this month.</p>
<p>Don Juan Mendoza of Jacksonville, who began dealing drugs in the sixth grade, is the accused head of an operation that shipped cocaine and marijuana from Los Angeles and Atlanta to the Penn Hills home of Jamie Lightfoot Jr., who along with his brother Deaubre distributed it across the region.</p>
<p>The Lightfoots have pleaded guilty and now Mendoza has said he will do the same on Jan. 28 before U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak.</p>
<p>Mendoza, 39, was charged in 2017 after the FBI and police tracked an RV traveling from California to Penn Hills. When it arrived at Lightfoot's house, a search of the vehicle turned up 52 kilos of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana, an AK-47 and another weapon.</p>
<p>Mendoza pulled up in a Chevy Tahoe shortly after the RV arrived and was taken into custody.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said he was the orchestrator of drug shipments from Los Angeles using the RV and from Atlanta using a Mercedes van imprinted with the image of his rapper wife, Charlene Mendoza, who goes by the name "Sno-Cold."</p>
<p>Mendoza has a long history of drug-dealing in Florida and has gone to prison three times for it. In the 2000s, he cooperated with prosecutors there and helped police solve four drug-related homicides. That earned him a sentence reduction but it also made him a target in Jacksonville, where gunmen shot him in the head in 2013.</p>
<p>He fled Florida for North Carolina after that and told a judge he was done with the drug life and wanted to focus on raising his five children and running a string of hair salons with his wife. They later moved to Atlanta.</p>
<p>But prosecutors said he did not give up the drug dealer's life and instead picked up where he left off, using his contacts with drug sources in other states and with Mexican cartels to arrange for shipments into Pittsburgh with the Lightfoots as his lieutenants.</p>
<p>Police and federal agents had been aware of the ring for about three years prior to the 2017 arrests and put Jamie Lightfoot's secluded Penn Hills home under surveillance.</p>
<p>They eventually secured wiretaps on various phones and monitored arrivals of the RV and the van as they made deliveries.</p>
<p>The case culminated with arrests on Nov. 5, 2017.</p>
