<h1>Pittsburgh area's jobless rate climbs to 6%</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s unemployment rate in March was 6%, a 1.3 percentage point rise over February, reflecting the start of COVID-19’s economic fallout.</p>
<p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate for the seven-county Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area matched the statewide jobless rate of 6% —&nbsp;also up 1.3 percentage points from February —&nbsp;while the national rate rose nine-tenths of a percentage point to 4.4%, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
<p>The numbers were based on a survey done between March 8 and 14, five days before Gov. Tom Wolf ordered nonessential businesses closed to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Since then, masses of Pennsylvanians have lost jobs, at least temporarily, and claims for jobless benefits have risen.</p>
<p>In March, seasonally adjusted nonfarm jobs in the Pittsburgh MSA slipped 3,700 from February, while inching up 0.5% or 5,900 over same month a year ago. Statewide jobs grew 0.2% for the 12-month period.</p>
<p>Fayette County had the highest unemployment rate in the region at 9.3%, followed by Armstrong County at 8.3% and Beaver and Washington counties at 6.7% each. The City of Pittsburgh’s jobless rate was 5.7%.</p>
<p>The total number of nonfarm jobs in March was 1.19 million, up 3,000 from March 2019, according to the labor survey.</p>
<p>Jobs in health care and social assistance suffered the biggest losses for the year —&nbsp;2,400 —&nbsp;followed by ambulatory health care services —&nbsp;2,100. The biggest job gains were in professional and technical services, where 3,600 jobs were added since March 2019.</p>
