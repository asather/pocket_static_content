<p>Going to the supermarket? Headed to the convenience store? Working at an&nbsp;“essential” business?</p>
<p>All customers who walk into stores and shops as well as those working at businesses in Pennsylvania that are still operating must now wear masks to stem the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The new order signed by the state health secretary last week went into effect at 8 p.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The order states that most businesses still open in the state must bar anyone without a mask from entering,&nbsp;unless the company is providing medication, medical supplies or food, said Dr. Rachel Levine, secretary of the state health department.&nbsp;In those cases, the business must offer alternative options, like pick-up or delivery of goods.</p>
<p>Those who can't wear a mask due to a medical condition and children under 2 may enter a business without a mask, according to the state order. There is no need to provide medical documentation.</p>
<p>The order also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/04/15/face-masks-order-Pennsylvania-Dept-of-Health-Dr-Rachel-Levine-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202004150131" target="_blank">outlined protections for critical workers</a> at essential and life-sustaining businesses that are still open for in-person operations during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvanians want to do the right thing, and we expect they will do the right thing,” Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>State officials say a non-clinical mask or bandanna is suitable to wear.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many Pittsburghers have teamed up to provide handmade masks, which can be ordered online. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/16/where-can-i-buy-order-homemade-masks-pittsburgh-allegheny-county-covid-19/stories/202004160136" target="_blank">A list can be found here</a>.</p>
