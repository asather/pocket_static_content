<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fans waiting to see Gabby Barrett and Dan + Shay at this year’s Academy of Country Music Award will have to wait a little longer.</p>
<p>The awards, which were scheduled for April 5 in Las Vegas, were postponed, the organization announced Sunday.</p>
<p>The ACM said the awards will be rescheduled for September, but said a date, time and venue will&nbsp;“be determined.”</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;health and safety of our artists, fans, industry, staff and partners is our number one priority,” the ACM said in a news release.</p>
<p>Barrett, 19, received an ACM award nomination Thursday morning</p>
<p>Barrett,&nbsp; a Munhall native, is one of five nominated for new female artist of the year, with Ingrid Andress, Lindsay Ell, Caylee Hammack and Tenille Townes.</p>
<p>Barrett’s music video for the break-up song “I Hope” has racked up almost 32 million views on YouTube. It moved up four spots this week, to No. 44 on the Billboard Hot 100. “I Hope” is also tops on the Billboard Emerging Artists chart.</p>
<p>She’ll be touring with Brad Paisley and Jordan Davis this summer. A homecoming date for the 2018 “American Idol” finalist is August 8 at the S&amp;T Bank Music Park in Burgettstown.</p>
<p>Other nominees with local ties are the duo known as Dan + Shay, who with Justin Bieber scored in four ACM categories. Dan Smyers is a McCandless native and Carnegie Mellon University grad who, with Shay Mooney, won a Grammy for best country duo last month.</p>
<p>Their “10,000 Hours” is up for best song of the year, music event of the year and music video. Dan + Shay is nominated for the seventh time as best duo of the year.</p>
