<h1>Buying Here: All new everything for $689,000 in Greenfield</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When contractor Leo Miller heard the story behind <strong>3814 Winterburn Ave.</strong> in Greenfield, it&nbsp; made him like the rambling old house even more.</p>
<p>“It was the first home built on that side of Greenfield,” he said. “The guy who built it put a big flagpole outside of the house. There was a (horse) racetrack in Schenley Park and he would point up to the flag to show people where he lived.”</p>
<p>Well, the racetrack is gone, but the home still has sweeping views of the city park. It looks very different.&nbsp;Gutted to the studs and all new inside and out, it has five bedrooms, 3½ baths and an extra side lot.</p>
<p>The house is now on the market for $689,000 (MLS No. 1432273) and open by appointment with Gail Murman of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices (<a href="https://www.thepreferredrealty.com/real-estate/1432273/3814-winterburn-greenfield-pa-15207/" target="_blank">www.thepreferredrealty.com</a> or 412-901-4895).</p>
<p>Mr. Miller originally planned to preserve the interior of the 120-year-old house. But that wasn’t possible, so he opened up the floor plan and replaced everything.</p>
<p>“Everything is new — the roof, siding, windows, new railings and a new Trex deck that kept the original wraparound footprint,’ he said.</p>
<p>New stone from North Carolina was used to build&nbsp;retaining walls and 6-foot-wide front steps. Dark gray ledge stone was insalled on the first story and foundation and white vinyl railing and trim was added.</p>
<p>The interior has 3,000 square feet of living space.&nbsp;The original entry remains but the walls that separated the front rooms have been turned into dramatic arches that frame views into the living and dining rooms. The redesign of the stairs near the entry is reflected in the living room fireplace and a custom curving bulkhead.</p>
<p>Solid oak floors have a natural stain and clear, satin finish. The dining room area has a tray ceiling with LED lighting that can change color.</p>
<p>The custom kitchen by New Choice Home Deco in Robinson features a furniture-style center island, granite counter tops, extra-tall wall cabinets and a layered bulkhead that adds architectural interest. There is a powder room nearby.</p>
<p>French doors lead to a new deck with more views of Schenley Park. Mr. Miller also purchased the empty lot next door and that parcel is included with the sale.</p>
<p>Upstairs, there are three large bedrooms and two full baths that offer a spa experience, with 24-by-18-inch wall tile, two wall shower units and a big rainshower head above.</p>
<p>“The one attached to the master bedroom has custom glass doors,” Mr. Miller noted.</p>
<p>A second bath services the other two bedrooms and a&nbsp;second-floor laundry has been added.</p>
<p>The third floor has two more bedrooms and a spa bath with a round soaking tub under the window that lets the user take in the view.</p>
<p>All of the bedrooms have carpeting and LED lights in the ceiling that produce gentle lighting and cost savings.</p>
<p>Mr. Miller put in a new driveway that gives the property four off-street parking spaces. The house has all new wiring, plumbing, a zoned HVAC system and a home warranty.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County assessed value is $155,800. Over the last two years, two properties have sold in the 3800 block of Winterburn Avenue: this property for&nbsp;$104,000 in August 2018 and one for $143,000 in June 2019&nbsp;(<a href="http://www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx" target="_blank">www2.county.allegheny.pa.us/RealEstate/Search.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Mr. Miller says this was an expensive, extensive renovation..</p>
<p>“It is very expensive to do a renovation like this,” he said. “Labor, good materials — we took eight months to take this house apart and put it back together. We wanted to take extra time with this one.”&nbsp;</p>
