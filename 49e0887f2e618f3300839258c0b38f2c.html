<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Is Colin Moran a trade waiting to happen or part of the Pirates’ future?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lee Lacy and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions, which refreshingly were laced with Pirate rage after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/28/pirates-colin-moran-michael-feliz-kyle-crick-brault-kuhl/stories/202007270124" target="_blank">Monday’s home opener </a>…</em></p>
<p><strong>Todd McCollum, @mccollumT:</strong> Can we at least say that Colin Moran is and will be a viable and component major league hitter?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I think we can, Dr. McCollum. Question is, what’s his future here? He turns 28 in October, and yet he’s only in his third full major league season. What if he goes from competent hitter — .275 career average with improving power — to very good one? The Pirates should always be in the market for those, and they have control over Moran for the next three years.</p>
<p>Sometimes players develop late. Consider the case of Brandon Moss, who was 28 when he wound up in Oakland. He’d been a disappointment with the Pirates for a few seasons, but he suddenly took off, bashing 76 home runs over the next three seasons with the A’s. Sometimes, all a guy needs is a full-time chance and some patience.</p>
<p>The complication here, of course, is Ke’Bryan Hayes — an enticing third-base prospect who must be given a chance to develop ASAP. With no minor leagues at the moment, there is nowhere but the majors for him to develop. Hayes (currently sidelined) already is an elite fielder.</p>
<p>So, what do the Pirates do with Moran if he continues to bash the baseball?</p>
<p>Trade him, would be one answer. His stock might never be higher. His price is soon to go up.</p>
<p>Keep him, would be the other, and be very thankful the National League has a designated hitter this season. It won’t have one next year but is sure to adopt it full time in 2022. The Pirates, if they play Hayes, might have to get creative with Moran the rest of this season and especially next season. He has played a bit at first and second and even some in the outfield (not recommended).</p>
<p>It also might come to pass — who knows? — that Moran replaces Josh Bell at first base if the Pirates trade Bell this offseason.</p>
<p>Meantime, if someone sees Moran as a piece to their championship puzzle and is willing to offer a nice package, a trade might make the most sense.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Morris, @BriMorris1:</strong> I really want to drink a beer or a shot with Derek Shelton. What do you think he throws down after a game like this. Old German or Natty Light?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I will ask him that on his weekly appearance with “Cook &amp; Joe,” Dr. Morris. We broached a beer topic a few weeks back, if memory serves, and he scored major points with me by saying he is not into craft beer but rather the tried-and-true brands. I would hope he goes with Genny Cream — and after what happened Monday night, several thousand of them.</p>
<p><strong>Six Gun Jury, @SixGunJury:</strong> Why is this manager resting everyone all the time during a 60-game season. If Burdi can’t pitch back to back nights, shouldn’t he be on the DL? lol</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I was initially surprised to not see Burdi for the ninth inning Monday night (Tuesday morning), Mr. Six Gun, but I completely understand not using him back-to-back days, given the severity of the injury that cost him last season. He better be the closer Tuesday, however.</p>
<p>Can you believe we are four games into the season and outraged at not seeing Nick Burdi?</p>
<p>I’ll tell you what: His stuff was electric against the Cardinals. I went back and watched that this morning, what he did to three very good hitters in Goldschmidt, DeJong and Carpenter. Wow.</p>
<p>Will it last? I’d like to find out.</p>

<p><strong>Saint Patrick, @Pat5Slabe:</strong> Why do Feliz and Crick keep getting called upon? They do nothing but walk people and give up runs, they suck!</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Actually, Patrick — do you mind if I drop the “Saint?” — Feliz was excellent a day earlier in St. Louis. The problem was not having Crick up earlier, not that he’ll remind anyone of Goose Gossage at the moment. Thing is, when you have no closer, you need to have two relievers ready in case one implodes.</p>
<p>One did. It was odd seeing Feliz dig himself into a hole that grew deeper and deeper with nobody even warming up. Not sure what Shelton was thinking there, other than perhaps, “Who else do I have?”</p>
<p><strong>Murphy, @Murphy57550132:</strong> Should Bell be full-time DH or does Shelty care more about hurting Josh’s feelings or winning games?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I will say this: It didn’t look like Bell had the confidence to make a throw to second on that hard-hit ball in the ninth — and second was absolutely the play. I don’t think you double up Yelich, but you keep the tying run off second. Maybe Moran should have moved to first to replace Bell when Erik Gonzalez replaced Moran at third.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Reese, @BuStA607:</strong> Do you think teams will still fire managers after a shortened season?-</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That’s an interesting question, Dr. Reese, and I believe teams will be less inclined to fire managers because of the freakishly short (small sample, as they say) nature of this season.</p>
<p><strong>MartyInLawrenceville, @MartyCaridi:</strong> Is Hurdle still managing? Take a hot Moran out of game for defensive replacement. Why is Bell at 1B instead of DH? If he throws to second in the 9th, we’re asleep now. And the pitching decisions are beyond dumbfounding. No Burdi, or Brubaker. Burdi threw, what, 12 pitches [Sunday]?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I hear you, MartyInLawrenceville, and I’m thrilled to be talking baseball. But as I mentioned, Burdi was not available, and I’m guessing the same for Brubaker, who threw 28 pitches the day before.</p>
<p>Also, both better pitch Tuesday if the situation warrants. I’d put them at the front of the line.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Hendricks, @Brian72329568:</strong> Percent change that NFL plays all of its scheduled games, including playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> 35%, Brian. The good news for that league is, not a lot of road games. I would expect in and out on the day of games.</p>
<p><strong>John Antonik, @JohnAntonik:</strong> How about taking a crack at explaining the four-outfielder thing to me in the ninth with a four-run lead?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I kind of liked it, John. One of my feelings going into this season was that I wanted to see the PIrates do some radical things. That was radical (although Justin Smoak wound up grounding a single through the right side). Also, it’s something the Tampa Bay Rays did more than any team in baseball last season (48 times), and anything the Rays are doing is something to consider. They’re ahead of the curve in many ways.</p>
<p>Shelton said this to Rob Biertempfel of The Athletic before the season, in regard to the possibility of using four outfielders: “The benefit is definitely with guys who don’t hit ground balls and who strike out, you’re covering more ground. We’re not going to do it just to do it. It’s not going to be something we’re doing as a sideshow. It’s going to depend on the pitcher, it’s going to depend on the guy swinging the bat, it’s going to depend on where we are in the game. There are a lot of factors that play into it.”</p>

<p><strong>jim davies, dhrinak80:</strong> What should be the penalty for the geniuses who allowed Marlins players who tested positive to play on Sunday?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> It sounds like it was the Marlins themselves who made that decision, Mr. Davies.They also apparently didn’t tell anyone about their three additional positive tests Sunday (added to one Friday) until AFTER the game.</p>
<p>That obviously would have put clubhouse attendants and others at risk. Not sure what you can do about it now, but it was a stupid, reckless decision to play — and reprehensible to keep the situation quiet until after the game.</p>
<p><strong>Darren Leif Evans, @duckyevans:</strong> Will Manfried, commissioner of baseball, resign due to the obvious ineptitude of his leadership during this baseball catastrophe? Or will he get away with reckless manslaughter?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Nobody’s forcing them to play, Ducky. That tweet from David Price made it sound as if he’s surprised MLB isn’t putting player health “first.” Money’s first, my friend. Price knows that. Every player should. Most of them, however, are not in Price’s tax bracket and are playing for the checks. Money’s first for them, too.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Moore, @MichaelMooreNB:</strong> Will Dyson get a hit in July?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> He got one right after you sent that, Mr. Moore. You should ask that question more often!</p>
