<h1>Pastor apologizes for holding worship amid shutdowns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Westmoreland County church defiantly met for worship on Sunday at a time when&nbsp;houses of worship shuttered over the weekend to comply with health officials’ urgent calls for social distancing to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Now in the face of public backlash, the pastor is apologizing on a Facebook post, even as he maintains belief that the Bible promises believers that&nbsp;“no plague will come near your home.”</p>
<p>The church will do livestream-only services for the foreseeable future, he now says.</p>
<p>Word of Life Church in Hempfield Township removed a video of its Sunday service from its website. But excerpts aired on WTAE-TV show the pastor, Tom Walters, denouncing the urgings of the Centers for Disease Control and Pennsylvania health officials to avoid large gatherings.</p>
<p>"I don’t want anyone telling us we can’t worship our God collectively as a body," Pastor Walters said in the Sunday service. "This could possibly be, disguised in everything else, a direct attack against the church itself."</p>
<p>Commenters on the church’s Facebook page angrily criticized the decision as putting at risk the health and lives of church members and those they come in contact with.</p>
<p>Pastor Walters said on Facebook Monday that he and the staff did not ask anyone to attend but opened the doors to those who wanted to join in the service.</p>
<p>In his Facebook apology on Monday, he maintained&nbsp;“it was not out of arrogance or defiance, but solely for the purpose of praying for our churches, communities and nation” that the church opened.</p>
<p>He cited a biblical Psalm as saying&nbsp;“If you make the Lord your refuge, ... no plague will come near your home.”</p>
<p>He said his&nbsp;“heart was so heavy to experience” what he depicted as&nbsp;“hateful comments.”</p>
<p>“I will try harder to be more of an asset to our community,” he said.&nbsp;“Please do not blame our people for this past Sunday, they were simply trying to honor me, and more so our Lord!”</p>
<p>Local houses of worship of all types, including Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Muslim, closed or livestreamed services this past weekend during the crisis.</p>
