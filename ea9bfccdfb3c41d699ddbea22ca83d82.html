<h1>PA Turnpike to pay down debt, set line of credit to deal with COVID-19 revenue shortfall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike is adjusting its finances as it tries to weather a sharp decline in revenue as a result of low traffic on the toll road due to the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The turnpike commission Wednesday approved using up to $300 million in cash reserves to pay down some of its debt and establishing a line of credit of up to $400 million. After the meeting, chief finance officer Nikolaus Grieshaber said the moves are directly related to the drop in toll revenue since the start of the health emergency, a decline that reached nearly 50% for the last week of March compared to the previous year.</p>
<p>Mr. Grieshaber said the agency will draw on cash reserves of about $500 million to make interest and principal payments on about $12.5 billion of outstanding debts. It expects to make a payment of $43 million on June 1 and another of as much as $107 million on Dec. 1.</p>

<p>“It’s not a lot [compared to the overall debt], but every part helps,” he said.&nbsp;“If there’s an opportunity to do more, we will. It’s actually a good way to use the cash on hand.”</p>
<p>Mr. Grieshaber said the agency had been having a strong financial year with increasing revenue until the coronavirus pandemic began in March. Paying off existing bonds now should help lower the agency’s debt ratio and allow it to receive good rates when it goes back into the bond market, likely in August to help fund its capital budget.</p>
<p>Opening the line of credit is another hedge against continuing revenue losses due to low traffic, Mr. Grieshaber said.</p>
<p>“I kind of view it as an insurance policy. Our hope is not to use it,” he said.&nbsp;“The key is to make it through this period.”</p>
<p>Turnpike CEO Mark Compton said in a statement last week the agency is reconsidering all projects in its $491 million capital budget that involve expansion and improvement rather than safety and maintenance. It also is reviewing whether it can continue to make state-required $112.5 million quarterly payments to the state Department of Transportation to help pay subsidies for public transit across the state.</p>
