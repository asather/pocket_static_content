<h1>Remaking a neighborhood </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The redevelopment of the Garden Theater area on the city’s North Side has seen more ups and downs than a roller-coaster ride at Kennywood Park.</p>
<p>Beginning over 25 years ago, developers, city government and community residents have struggled to agree on the best plan for the neighborhood. Finally, it appears that all parties have come to a compromise, and the blighted area can be renewed.</p>
<p>One of the original obstacles was the theater itself. As long as it continued to be open as a porn palace, most people believed that attracting other businesses as neighbors was impossible. After a protracted legal battle, the city’s Urban Redevelopment Authority won the right to acquire the theater in 2007. That building has already been partially renovated, and now studio apartments are proposed for the mezzanine level.</p>
<p>Preservationists wanted to save some historic buildings, and at first they asked developers to incorporate these buildings, or parts of them, into the design. The problem with this is that the block was a warren of 12 small buildings that would be difficult to combine into a unified whole. Three of the buildings were finally demolished in 2018.</p>
<p>Neighborhood groups first chose a Philadelphia-based developer to design the project. A few years later they dismissed that firm, and Trek Development Group, a local company, took over. In 2015 Trek proposed an eight-story apartment building on the corner of North Avenue and Federal Street. Nearby property owners challenged the height of the building in court, and the challenge was successful in preventing that design. The new compromise announced last week includes a five-story building with 56 apartments and ground-floor retail space.</p>
<p>All parties — the community groups, URA and developers&nbsp;— deserve thanks for their persistence in seeing the project to this point. Barring any further glitches, a central part of the North Side will finally be a source of pride for the neighborhood and the city.</p>
