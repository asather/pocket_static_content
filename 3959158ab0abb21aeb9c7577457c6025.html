<h1>Bridging digital divide: Local groups work to get computers for schools</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With Pennsylvania’s schools officially closed through the remainder of the academic year, the implementation of remote learning is now the highest priority for school districts. Unfortunately, there are thousands of students locally — and even thousands more statewide — who don’t have access to a computer and an internet connection, tools necessary for online instruction.</p>
<p>It is against that backdrop that a coalition of area nonprofits, universities and technology companies have banded together to find a solution to this “digital divide” and bring both computers and internet access to students who lack those important educational tools.</p>
<p>It’s another shining example of Pittsburgh organizations working to find solutions to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“Beyond the Laptops” is a grassroots effort of the community group Neighborhood Allies, self-driving technology company Aurora Innovation, the Pittsburgh Technology Council, the University of Pittsburgh and Computer Reach. The goal is to purchase and refurbish more than 3,000 laptops for students and families who don’t have computer access. The group hopes to deliver a thousand computers in the next two weeks and 1,000 more by mid-May.</p>
<p>The multifaceted effort has several organizations lending their help and expertise to the cause. Computer Reach refurbishes the computers; the University of Pittsburgh has set up an IT desk for assistance; Carnegie Mellon University and Meta Mesh Wireless Communities are partnering to set up internet networks in communities with the greatest need.</p>
<p>Although schools are not required to complete 180 days of instruction this year because of the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, state education officials are encouraging districts to continue instruction remotely to avoid having students fall too far behind. Districts typically see a drop in learning during the summer months, the “summer slide” as it is often called, and the loss of three months of in-school instruction this year could only exacerbate the problem.</p>
<p>That’s why getting computer equipment into the hands of students is vitally important to maintaining their education cycle. It is even more crucial in districts with a large percentage of low-income students.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools has ordered 5,000 laptops to go with its supply of 2,500, and received a donation of 599 from the University of Pittsburgh. The Clairton School District has launched a fundraising campaign to purchase a Chromebook for its students. The state Department of Education is providing equity grants of up to $5 million for districts to buy laptops, internet hot spots and instructional materials.</p>
<p>The school year has been thrown into chaos by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting shutdowns. The ability to switch to remote learning presents challenges for many school districts, but the efforts of community organizations to find solutions should be applauded. Their work will help assure that students can continue necessary coursework.</p>
