<h1>WPIAL suspends Mars' Michael Carmody for one basketball game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If the Mars High School basketball team is to make another run in the state playoffs, the Planets will have to win their first game without their top player.</p>
<p>The WPIAL has suspended Michael Carmody for one game for his behavior at last Friday’s WPIAL Class 5A championship when Mars lost to Laurel Highlands, 52-51. Mars plays Elizabethtown in a PIAA first-round game Friday and has made it to the PIAA championship twice in the past four years and the semifinals last year.</p>
<p>The WPIAL originally decided to suspend Carmody for two games but reduced the penalty after a hearing Wednesday. The WPIAL originally sent a letter to Mars on Monday, informing the school of the two-game suspension. But Carmody and Mars asked for a hearing with the WPIAL board of directors. Carmody, his parents and Mars administrators attended the hearing at the WPIAL offices in Green Tree. Carmody apologized for his actions and asked for the suspension to be reduced. The WPIAL voted, 11-2, to take one game off the suspension. The league formally informed Mars of its decision with a letter Thursday morning.</p>
<p>“They were remorseful and they were apologetic,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said of Carmody and Mars. “They knew it was not something to be condoned. The board listened to lengthy testimony in all regards. They took the facts into consideration of whether they were going to uphold the suspension or reduce it.”</p>
<p>WPIAL executive director Tim O’Malley said: “What he did was unacceptable.”</p>
<p>After the loss to Laurel Highlands at Petersen Events Center, Carmody ran toward an official to complain about the lack of a foul call on a last-second shot that Mars’ Mihali Sfanos missed. Carmody then kicked the basketball to half court into celebrating Laurel Highlands players.</p>
<p>Carmody was also called for an intentional foul during the game for hitting Rodney Gallagher with an elbow.</p>
<p>“All aspects were reviewed, but obviously with the actions after the game being very obvious as far as aggression toward an official, and kicking the ball into opposing players, were at the top of the list,” Scheuneman said. “The official could not have stopped the game and thrown him out. The game was already stopped. We’re trying to protect officials and keep officials involved, and something of that nature certainly is not helping in that regard. For us to defend those actions or let them go is unacceptable.”</p>
<p>But Scheuneman did say more than the WPIAL championship played a role in the suspension. Earlier this year, Shaler made the WPIAL aware of an unsportsmanlike play by Carmody during a game against Shaler. The WPIAL sent Mars a letter concerning the play.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say very much, but it definitely played into the decision because we had just addressed this a month before at our board meeting,” Scheuneman said of the Shaler game. “There was a follow-up to the [Mars] district about that situation.”</p>
<p>Carmody is a 6-foot-7, 290-pound Notre Dame football recruit who turned into one of the WPIAL’s top basketball players this season. He averages 19 points and 19 rebounds a game.</p>
<p>O’Malley and Scheuneman said Carmody was extremely apologetic in the hearing.</p>
<p>“We didn’t come to make excuses or put the blame on someone else,” said Rob Carmody, Michael’s father and Mars’ coach. “We came in here because Mike owed everybody an apology. For an 18-year-old to sit down in front of a group of adults that you don’t know and say, ‘Man, I messed up. I lost my mind and did something that I shouldn’t have done,’ says more about Mike’s character and who he is as a person than anything he’s ever done on a basketball floor.”</p>
<p>Rob Carmody said his son never had an intentional foul in his basketball career before the WPIAL championship and that he only has had two technical fouls — for hanging on the rim in a game and for clapping in an opponent’s face. Michael Carmody has a 4.0 grade-point average.</p>
<p>After Wednesday’s hearing, Rob Carmody said, “The narrative from Friday night should be about Laurel Highlands and the fantastic job they did to win. We felt as a family and Michael felt as a kid, he owed some people an apology. [The WPIAL board of directors] might look at the paper and Twitter and think that this kid is a monster. But I think when he walked out of [the hearing] the people in that room got to understand that this is a really good kid who did something he shouldn’t have done. Our job as teachers, coaches, parents is how do we help them learn from it?</p>
<p>“Unfortunately for Mike, because of who he is, because of his success and because of the world we live in, every little mistake gets documented and picked apart and disseminated. That’s part of the world we live in. A lot of kids get to make a mistake in anonymity. Mike’s out there in very public knowledge and he has to deal with that. I’m more proud of him that he stood up there and said, ‘OK, I’m sorry this happened.’ ”</p>
<p>The Carmodys could try to appeal the suspension to the PIAA, but Rob Carmody said he didn’t know if the family wanted to prolong this ordeal.</p>
