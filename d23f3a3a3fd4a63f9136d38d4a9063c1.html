<p>In the days and weeks after the massacre at Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill, people left a wide range of items among the flowers in&nbsp;the large makeshift memorial that formed on the street corner outside the building.</p>
<p>As Tree of Life Congregation officials work with a researcher to preserve the mementos, they are asking for those who left tributes in the wake of the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history to share the stories behind the items.</p>
<p>“We are proud of our neighbors’ immediate, compassionate response and support for the three affected congregations, Tree of Life, Dor Hadash and New Light, that were in the Tree of Life building that day,” Tree of Life said in a press release.&nbsp;“Scholars and students will study the particulars of this terrible anti-Semitic assault for decades to come; this project aims to make sure the caring response of the community is fully documented for their review and intends to ensure that the stories are accurately recorded and preserved.”</p>
<p>Eleven worshipers were killed and six others, including four Pittsburgh police officers, were injured in the rampage on the morning of Oct. 27, 2018. The makeshift memorial began forming at the intersection of Wilkins and Shady avenues a day later and grew for weeks until it was moved inside the Tree of Life building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some of the items have obvious messages and relevance to the event, whereas others are intriguing because their intent is less clear,” the release said.&nbsp;“In all cases, the researchers are interested in knowing why donors chose the items they did; what messages they intended for victims’ families, survivors and visitors to the memorial; why they were motivated to contribute something more tangible then flowers; and how doing so made them feel.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Many of the items left at the memorial have been photographed and temporarily displayed. Eventually, the congregations said, the items will be professionally cataloged and preserved so that the collection will be available to researchers, historians and members of the public.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tree of Life said it was also looking for information about a violinist and church choir who performed briefly on the sidewalk sometime in the 2½ weeks after the shooting.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To share the story of an object left at the memorial, go to <a href="http://www.treeoflifepgh.org/stories." target="_blank">www.treeoflifepgh.org/stories</a>.</p>
<p>With permission, some of the stories may be referenced or recounted in published works about the memorial, the congregation said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We recognize that having contributed to the memorial may have been a personal and deeply emotional experience,” the release said.&nbsp;“If you are uncomfortable sharing your story, we respect that position and appreciate your gesture of a gift, nonetheless.”&nbsp;</p>
