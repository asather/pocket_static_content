<h1>New Chick-fil-A in O’Hara approved despite traffic concern </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Residents of O’Hara — and beyond — got the answer to a question that’s been before council for months: Yes, Chick-fil-A will replace the Rita’s Italian Ice shop in the Fox Chapel Plaza along Freeport Road.</p>
<p>Many issues faced the O’Hara’s planning commission and zoning boards since last summer, before council’s unanimous vote on Tuesday to approve the plans to get the fryers cooking.</p>
<p>Traffic was a main concern brought up by many residents. Already an issue from Fox Chapel Road to Aspinwall, traffic snarls are probable when the popular restaurant begins serving customers, probably by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Freeport is a state road and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation was brought in to do a traffic study and require the restaurant to meet state and local ordinances.</p>
<p>O’Hara’s planning commission and zoning board worked to assure signage, lighting and landscaping requirements were also met. Fears of plastic foam polluting local streams and the Allegheny River were addressed before council gave the go-ahead.</p>
<p>The vote was unanimous, even though council members still were somewhat wary. Cassie Eccles, representative for the fifth ward, said, “I know we’ve had two studies done, but I don’t believe it. If we find Freeport is clogged, can we make further changes?”</p>
<p>David DiGioia, project engineer with McMahon Associates, said PennDOT approved the traffic study, but if something unanticipated occurs, changes could be made. “We’ve accommodated for the cars to be in the plaza, not on the road,” he said. “If the drive-thru backs up, that’s something we can work with.”</p>
<p>Clint Mattson, development manager at Chick-fil-A Corporate in Atlanta, addressed the plastic foam concern. “We usually leave it up to our individual owners,” he said.</p>
<p>George Stewart, councilman representing O’Hara’s second ward, said, “The environmental impact is bad.”</p>
<p>“Especially when we’re so close to the river,” Ms. Eccles said.</p>
<p>But because a prospective operator still has not been chosen for the Fox Chapel Plaza store, that issue will be taken up at a later time, probably in about a year. That’s how long it will take for construction of the store to be completed.</p>
