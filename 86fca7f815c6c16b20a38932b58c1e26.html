<h1>Robert Morris holds on to beat St. Francis, clinches home-court advantage in NEC tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Morris coach Andy Toole entered his postgame news conference with a towel in hand, his clothes damp with water.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes earlier Saturday afternoon, Toole’s Colonials had seen their big lead cut down to four by Saint Francis, but Robert Morris persevered.</p>
<p>With 3:36 left in the game, sophomore guard Jalen Hawkins hit a clutch 3-pointer from the left wing to stretch the Colonials’ lead back to seven, and Robert Morris finished the game on an 11-5 run.</p>
<p>The Colonials (17-14 overall, 13-5) held on to beat the Red Flash, 78-68, snapping a nine-game losing streak against Saint Francis and clinching the No. 1 seed and home-court advantage throughout the Northeast Conference tournament for the first time since 2014. Then, Robert Morris celebrated accordingly.</p>
<p>“It’s a rivalry game, both of us were fighting for home court advantage in the NEC tournament,” said fifth-year senior guard Josh Williams. “It was senior night as well. And on top of that, ... [director of basketball operations] Jimmy Langhurst, it was his birthday today. Just all of that. You want to fight for your family, you know what I mean? And we were able to do that.”</p>
<p>Williams’ performance on senior night, in his last regular-season home game of his career, was up to the magnitude of the game. He scored 23 points on 7-of-13 shooting, corralled 7 rebounds and added 3 assists.</p>
<p>Right from the beginning of the game, he gave a glimpse of what he had in store for the afternoon by hitting two, tough 3s to help jump-start the offense.</p>
<p>Williams wasn’t the only one to give the Colonials a boost in the early going. Robert Morris began the game with an unusual set of starters. Josh and his brother, junior guard Jon Williams, along with senior forward Yannis Mendy, started as they usually do. Joining them, however, was junior forward AJ Bramah and senior guard Sayveon McEwen, who typically come off the bench.</p>
<p>McEwen got the starting nod because it was senior day, but Bramah, known for his energetic style of play, was added to ensure Robert Morris got off on the right foot.</p>
<p>And they did, hitting six of their first eight 3-pointers and taking a 10-point lead (45-35) into the half.</p>
<p>“I just thought we needed to have all the bullets in the gun,” Toole said after the game. “AJ’s a guy who’s had a great year, and he brings that passion to the court, and I think it leaks off to his teammates. I thought Sayveon did a good job with his energy early on, as he started for senior night, and gave us a huge lift. So I thought everybody did the things that they needed to do for us to win the game.”</p>
<p>The second half was a bit slower paced, with both teams cooling off offensively. Nonetheless, Hawkins’ clutch shot and Robert Morris’ solid free-throw shooting brought home the win.</p>
<p>And it was a win worth celebrating, water bottles and all, as it puts the Colonials a step closer to their ultimate goal of winning the NEC tournament and making the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>“That’s been the main factor the whole year,” Williams said. “When we first came in in the summer, the first thing coach asked us is, ‘Who wants to play for an NEC championship? Who wants to play in the NCAA tournament?’ And if your hand doesn’t go up, I don’t understand why you’d be in the room. So that’s what our focus is and it’s gonna continue to be.”</p>
