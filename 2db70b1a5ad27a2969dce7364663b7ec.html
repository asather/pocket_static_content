<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: How can we believe in this Pirates rotation?</h1>

<p><em>Let’s get started:</em><br><br></p>
<p><strong>Mitch:</strong> How can anyone expect anything from the Pirates this year when they have Derek Holland and Steven Brault in their starting rotation? That’s a joke.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is a great question and one I even wrote about a few weeks ago. The rotation is really not very promising. I do think there are a few good pitchers in the rotation and you have to hope they perform well. Trevor Williams has to get back to some semblance of that crafty pitcher he once was. He doesn’t have great stuff but he is a pitcher and knows how to mix his pitches well and induce a lot of soft contact. Joe Musgrove has the intangibles to be dominant but he needs to become more consistent with his pitches. I think in those two cases, the Pirates have an opportunity to have two good pitchers that give them a chance to win every time they take the mound. Mitch Keller is a complete wild card. He obviously has talent and pedigree. Now he needs to prove he can pitch. After that, I agree that it is a mess. I have very little faith that Holland and Brault will be good enough but in a short season, anything can happen. There is also talk of using the opener or some version of it, so it sounds like Derek Shelton is willing to be creative. I know it isn’t promising when you look at it from afar but you have to just wait and see maybe they will surprise.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong> What is the point of a 60-game schedule? It seems like a waste of time and a shameless money grab by the owners. I don’t want to watch a short season of baseball.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wait, you are upset that we are going to have baseball to watch? Given all that has gone wrong this year, given how long we have not had sports, how could you possibly be upset that there will be baseball games to watch? Is it ideal? No, but at least we will have games to watch. And the only difference is that there are fewer games overall, but for about three months (when you factor in playoffs) we will have plenty of games to watch. Relax, pop open a cold one and enjoy the ride, my man.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Aren’t the Pirates likely to just get rid of their best players halfway through this season anyway? They wanted to do a fire sale and it was put on hold aren’t the still going to do it now?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The only reason I say no is because I am not really sure who they could sell. They don’t have much left to deal. Keone Kela is about the only player they have with value enough to bring back a decent haul. And that’s assuming he gets off to a good start. After that, I suppose they could trade Josh Bell, but they have him for a few more years at a very cheap price. Adam Frazier will be traded, but what will he bring back? Gregory Polanco? His contract makes it tough to see anyone giving a lot for him, especially given his injury history. I just don’t see much of anything left here for the Pirates to have a fire sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Stefon:</strong> What do you expect from Gregory Polanco this year? Is he the most frustrating and underachieving athlete in Pittsburgh sports history?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He is frustrating because it feels like he should be much better than he is. He has had injuries that have slowed him. He is fast but a terrible base runner. He is tall, lanky and runs like a deer but he fields like a deer in the headlights. He is streaky so he is mostly feast or famine at the plate. That being said, I expect him to have a bounce-back season at the plate. He will never be a good fielder. He just has no feel for it. But I do think he has value at the plate and will help the Pirates offense greatly. I don’t know for sure but my gut tells me we have had far bigger busts/underachievers in this town than him. He at least has had some stretches of being a good player.</p>
<p><strong>Boyd:</strong>&nbsp;Have you wondered if not having pitchers bat — not having a number of easy outs — leads to longer games? Is there a disconnection between wanting shorter games and wanting more offense?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t have to wonder, this question has been answered by people much smarter than me. And it looks like studies suggest that it doesn’t make a <a href="/‪Is%20the%20DH%20Rule%20Slowing&nbsp;the%20Game%20Down?%20|%20FiveThirtyEight%20https:/fivethirtyeight.com/features/is-the-dh-rule-bane-of-baseball-purists-slowing-the-game-down/‬" target="_blank">significant difference.</a>&nbsp;So time is not a good or valid reason to keep the DH out of the National League.</p>
<p><strong>Chase:</strong> Are athletes who are speaking out about every thing racist that is said by coaches or athletes now showing a double standard with their silence about DeSean Jackson? Why is it OK for him to say racist things and talk about Adolf Hitler?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> This has become a ridiculous discussion. It is simple to me — either racism is wrong or it isn’t and saying racist/insensitive things is worthy of discipline or it isn’t. And it clearly is not acceptable on any level by anyone. So yes, the outspoken athletes are mighty silent right now, but why are we going here with this? This doesn’t need to become an argument — the league should discipline Jackson and we should all move on. These kinds of “what about” arguments make my head hurt and do nothing at all to further any conversation we may be trying to have.</p>
