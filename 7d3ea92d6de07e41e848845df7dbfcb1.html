<p><em>“Deliver the letter, the sooner the better…”</em></p>
<p><em>—&nbsp;the Fab Four by-way-of the Marvelettes</em></p>
<p>It’s Labor Day weekend and this is a story about what we used to call shoe leather and the dignity of work.</p>
<p>In 1967, when a first-class stamp cost a nickel, a movie called “Guess Who’s Coming to Dinner,” was the first mainstream American film to portray interracial marriage as a good thing. At the time, matrimony between Blacks and Caucasians was illegal in 17 states.</p>
<p>As a 9-year-old, I had just just figured out that if a kid wrote letters to big companies, and foreign embassies —&nbsp;fibbing that you were studying this or that in school —&nbsp;you could get free stuff. By return mail, I received everything from cookies to cool maps and, from Norway, a can of sardines, the envelope pasted with exotic stamps.</p>
<p>I don’t remember why I was taken to see a “grown up” movie but vividly recall a scene that has stayed with me all these years. Sidney Portier is a doctor engaged to the daughter of Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. He is arguing about his decision to marry a white woman with his father, a retired mailman played by Roy E. Glenn.</p>
<p>The old man strongly disapproves of his son’s choice, calling it “a mistake” that will derail all he’s accomplished. Contending that Portier owes him something for the opportunities his sweat has provided, Glenn says, heatedly: “Do you know how far I carried that bag in 30 years? Seventy-five thousand miles.”</p>
<p>To which Portier replies, “If you carried that bag a million miles you did what you were supposed to do.”</p>
<p>For three decades, former Pittsburgh letter carrier Alex Criego did what he was supposed to do —&nbsp;deliver mail to residents of the Steel City no matter “snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night.”</p>
<p>Retired since 2015 and living in the South Hills, Mr. Criego, 69, remains employed by the National Association of Letter Carriers, branch No. 84. The union is an “open shop” (employees do not have to join) and represents some 1,600 active carriers in the greater Pittsburgh area and 1,000 retirees.</p>
<p>What do letter carriers have in common with former Pirates’ pitcher Phil Dumatrait?</p>
<p>“Rotator cuff injuries,” said Mr. Criego, who joined the Postal Service in 1975, two years after it ditched the classic leather satchels for canvas sacks. As for shoe leather, preferred approved footwear has long been, as Ringo Starr might say, rubber soled.</p>
<p>Loaded sacks weigh between 35 and 50 pounds and, depending on whether the carrier is left-handed or right, carried on the opposite shoulder. The free hand drops the mail in the slot. Not that long ago, a carrier handled about a dozen-and-a-half parcels in addition to regular mail. That number has tripled in some cases and Mr. Criego said it's often difficult to finish a route without overtime, which he said is frowned upon if not prohibited.</p>
<p>Up and down steps, across lawns riddled with hidden holes and divots, uneven sidewalks and cracked curbs, over and over again across a minefield of slips, trips and falls while dipping into the bag, putting the mail in the box and moving on.</p>
<p>Many suffer knee problems such as meniscus tears along with other injuries that a carrier, particularly younger ones, choose to “walk off” only to regret later.</p>
<p>“You walk across the same lawn a hundred times without thinking about it,” said Mr. Criego. “And the 101st time you twist your ankle. Even the guys that deliver by vehicle get hip replacements from sitting and turning all day.”</p>
<p>One of America’s most famous post office workers was the late poet and author Charles Bukowski, who spent some 15 years as a clerk and letter carrier in his native Los Angeles before stumbling into fame.</p>
<p>In 1971, when a first-class stamp featuring good ’ole Ike cost 8 cents, “Hank” published his first novel, “Post Office”. (In 1976, first-class “Spirit of ‘76” stamps cost 13 cents, the year he gave a reading at the University of Pittsburgh.)</p>
<p>Regarding delivering the mail, Bukowski wrote in “Post Office”, “[soon] I would learn the shortcuts and traps on each route.”</p>
<p><strong>The changes begin</strong></p>
<p>Back in the 1950s —&nbsp;when few might have wagered that Elvis Presley would someday grace one of the most popular first class stamps of all time —&nbsp;machines began sorting mail before carriers walked it out the door. Once sorted, however, they still have to “sequence,” it —&nbsp;lining it up in the pouch to coincide with the order of addresses.</p>
<p>“A great amount of mail is sorted by machines,” said Mr. Criego, “but carriers and clerks still have residual mail that must be sorted manually.”</p>
<p>Then, it’s out into the world: bugs, traffic, pedestrians sending emails on their phones and, of course, dogs. My mother’s brother —&nbsp;Uncle Bill, a former military veteran like many postal employees —&nbsp;was a Baltimore mailman who kept doggie treats in his pocket to mollify Fido.</p>
<p>Mr. Criego, who briefly worked at Crucible Steel in Midland, Beaver County, before his postal career, often ran five-to-eight miles several times a week before going to work. The job, he said, was not overly strenuous for him.</p>
<p>The mental stress of postal work — of which Bukowski regularly complained —&nbsp;didn’t much bother Mr. Criego either. It was feuds with supervisors over infractions both real and imagined that were a pain in the neck.</p>
<p>“Whatever way management wants you to do your job always slows you down,” he said.</p>
<p>Though this is not a news article, there is a hole in this story the size of a mail truck. Since 2001, mail processed by the postal service has dropped from 103.7 billion pieces to 54.9 billion last year.</p>
<p>The Internet, partisan politics and competition from private industry have brought about a possibility that the weather, the last pandemic and both world wars could not: that the post office as we have known it since the founding of the Republic may wind up in the dead letter office.</p>
<p>A 55-cent first-class stamp —&nbsp;the new ones feature Bugs Bunny —&nbsp;might be “forever,” but the wounded behemoth apparently is not.</p>
<p>Said a Pittsburgh carrier whose father also delivered the mail, “Labor Day is a chance to show respect for those before us who carried the torch.”</p>
<p>And the mail.</p>
