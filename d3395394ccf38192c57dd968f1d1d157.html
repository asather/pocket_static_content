<h1>PennDOT will reopen some rest stops after truckers, elected officials voice complaints</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two days after closing all 30 rest areas on Pennsylvania Department of Transportation highways Monday to help prevent the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the state has relented and will reopen the 13 busiest areas by Thursday.</p>
<p>The decision comes after complaints from the trucking industry and several elected officials, including state Rep. Daryl Metcalfe, R-Cranberry.</p>
<p>“Every decision made has been in the interest of mitigating the spread of COVID-19 and we are constantly reevaluating our response,” PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said in an email Wednesday. “That said, we also recognize that drivers need and deserve access to rest areas.”</p>
<p>The stops that will reopen are on Interstate 81, north and southbound stops in Luzerne and Cumberland counties; on Interstate 79, north and southbound stops in Crawford County and the northbound stop in Allegheny County; and on Interstate 80,&nbsp;east and westbound stops in Venango, Centre and Montour counties.</p>
<p>“At these locations, PennDOT will be taking down the barricades on some facilities in critical locations and making them available for truck parking,” Ms. Campbell said. “Portable restroom facilities will be available at these locations; each location will have five portable toilets (one of which is ADA-accessible) that will be cleaned once a day. Electronic message signs will be used near the applicable centers to notify drivers near the opened areas.”</p>
<p>Ms. Campbell said indoor facilities will not be open at the rest stops because PennDOT doesn’t have staffing available to keep them sanitized to prevent the spread of the virus. The department will continue to monitor conditions to determine whether other sites can be reopened.</p>
<p>Norita Taylor, a spokeswoman for the&nbsp;Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association, said the group was pleased with the reversal.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We encouraged [Governor Tom Wolf and PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian] to open all the state's rest areas the moment we learned of the closures ordered and so we certainly welcome this latest decision,” Ms. Taylor said in an email. “Hopefully other states will refrain from implementing similar, short-sighted policies. And we'll continue to call out those who propose policies that jeopardize the safety of truckers and the motoring public.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has been the only state to close all of its rest stops.</p>
