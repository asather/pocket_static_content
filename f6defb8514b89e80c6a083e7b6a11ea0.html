<h1>Joey Porter on Steelers' linebackers, coaching again, community and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joey Porter spent the better part of two years telling anyone who would listen that the Steelers were in excellent shape at outside linebacker with Bud Dupree and T.J. Watt. He always believed the Steelers defense would flourish once Dupree and Watt teamed up to become a dominant pass-rushing duo.</p>
<p>When it finally happened last season, Porter wasn’t around to see it. The Steelers decided not to renew Porter’s contract following the 2018 season, and he watched his protégés reach their potential without him.</p>
<p>Watt recorded 14½ sacks and made first-team All-Pro. Dupree, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/16/bud-dupree-franchise-tag-steelers-2020-kevin-colbert/stories/202003160074" target="_blank">had the franchise tag</a>&nbsp;placed upon him in March, also posted his career high in sacks with 11½.</p>
<p>It was a different perspective for Porter, but he is proud of the work he did during his tenure with the Steelers.</p>
<p>“I talk to those guys, wish them well, criticize them every now and then,” Porter joked Monday afternoon. “But they played real, real well last year. I was happy for both of them. They both did a good job.</p>
<p>“T.J., man, he’s what I thought he was going to be. You guys used to mess with me when told you Bud was going to get it. It just took him a while. Now he’s got it.</p>
<p>“Now you have a tandem, and that tandem can rock for the next decade. They’re both young. You know you’ll get another five or six years out of that tandem. They’re going to be tough, man. One got it early in T.J. Bud is figuring it out, and he still has a lot of football left. It’s going to be good.”</p>
<p>Porter and his wife, Christy, held a ribbon-cutting ceremony Monday afternoon in Sheraden, where they are building the Jasmine Nyree Campus at the site of Holy Innocents Parish. The community center will serve multiple needs, including services for special needs adults, a pre-school, youth after-school and recreational services and an employment center.</p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, pro scouting coordinator Brandon Hunt and other members of the Steelers front office were in attendance, along with some of Porter’s former teammates. One of those was Jason Gildon, who played opposite Porter at outside linebacker for five seasons from 1999-2003.</p>
<p>Dupree and Watt remind Porter of the terror he and Gildon terrorized quarterbacks not all that long ago. Together they combined for 84½ sacks during those five seasons and helped the Steelers reach the AFC championship after the 2001 season.</p>
<p>Porter knew once Dupree came into his own the Steelers defense would go from good to great.</p>
<p>“Every tandem has to have a counterpart that makes it good,” Porter said. “Kevin Greene wasn’t Kevin Greeene without Greg Lloyd. I wasn’t me without Gildon and vice versa. You had [LaMarr] Woodley and [James] Harrison. You need that alpha dog on the other side to make it work, especially in the 3-4. They have their duo.”</p>
<p>Porter, who played for the Steelers from 1999 until 2006 and coached for them from 2015-18, spent last season out of coaching. He is currently supporting his wife’s efforts in the community and watching his son, Joey Porter, Jr., play at Penn State, but he hasn’t closed the door on a return to coaching.</p>
<p>“I’m here to be supportive of what my family is doing,” Porter said. “I always want to coach, but this is what my priority is right now. It’s a crazy time with everything that’s going on right now. My focus is helping my family and to get this community going. I do want to coach. It will happen. I don’t feel like I have to take any job. I’ll take the right job that’s good for me. When that happens, I’ll be ready to go.”</p>
<p>The Porters previously built Jasmine Nyree centers in Bakersfield, Calif., but this is their first venture of this type in Pittsburgh, where he currently calls home. Christy Porter said they are hoping to bring 200-300 jobs to Sheraden.</p>
<p>“We’ve done similar things in California,” Joey Porter said. “Being back in Pittsburgh, where it all started for me, my wife had a vision for this. She told me she found a building, and she’s been over here working ever since. I think it’s going to be beautiful for the community. I’m just proud of my wife. She had a vision, and with the support of the mayor and the community, it’s turning out to be as good as it can be.”</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto attended the ceremony along with city councilwoman Theresa Kail-Smith, who worked with the Porters to bring this venture to Sheraden. In the wake of recent events in the city, Peduto said the ribbon-cutting ceremony was emblematic of hope for the future.</p>
<p>“She built this out as a community vision — how we can take this beautiful part of Sheraden and make it into something that would enhance the community?” Peduto said. “I think we need a lot of that right now. And I mean right now — like this hour — a way to help young adults transition, to give them the opportunities to live a full life, but doing it in a way that makes them a part of the neighborhood in allowing the neighborhood to use one of its most beautiful assets to come together.”</p>
