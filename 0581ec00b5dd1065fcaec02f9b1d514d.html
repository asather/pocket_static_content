<h1>Derek Shelton thinks adjustments are worth it to return to baseball in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The list of rules and suggestions for returning to baseball in 2020 in a healthy manner is exhaustive.</p>
<p>The changes being considered were leaked last week as part of MLB’s proposal to the MLBPA, and they include the discouragement of things such as chewing and spitting sunflower seeds, showering at the ballpark, hitting in indoor batting cages or holding a runner on base too closely. That’s just part of the list.</p>
<p>Derek Shelton is trying to parse through it all himself. The first-year Pirates manager has taken an optimistic point of view throughout the delay to the 2020 season, and he’s taking a similar approach with these suggested adjustments to daily operations.</p>
<p>“I think like we’ve seen, that’s an original draft or the first draft that we’re going to be able to make suggestions off it, and I think we’ll definitely come up with something that’s closer to normal or working,” Shelton said Wednesday. “The hitting in cages, if you have two guys in there at one time, I don’t see how that would cause much of an issue. So I think that’s a working draft that’s going through. Like we’ve talked about numerous times, the fact that we’re starting to talk about actual baseball stuff is the most exciting thing, and I think once we get this proposal in people’s hands and people are able to talk back and forth about it, I think we’ll probably come to something that’s more workable for everyone.”</p>
<p>Shelton discussed the potential plan in a radio appearance on 93.7 The Fan with Post-Gazette columnists Joe Starkey and Ron Cook.</p>
<p>Some of the changes, like the batting cages, Shelton feels are negotiable, assuming that there are safe ways to still use the facilities. For his own sake, he said he hopes the players are able to shower regularly, joking that&nbsp;“if we get on a flight to go to Chicago, I’m kind of hoping guys shower.”</p>
<p>One of the main focuses for Shelton, though, will be communicating with bench coach Don Kelly or his other assistants to make sure their strategy is sound during games even if they have to be six feet or more apart.</p>
<p>For Shelton, it’s all worth it. To him, the prospect of not having baseball at all is far worse than the minor or major adjustments the team would have to make to play the season.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be challenging,” Shelton said. “I definitely think it’s going to be difficult. I just think for us to get back to the game, we’re going to have to be willing to make sacrifices. And I think, at the beginning of it, it’s going to be extremely difficult. Not high-fiving a guy after a home run or your social interaction with people or just the communication with people in terms of how you meet with them and how you’re able to relay a message. It’s definitely going to be challenging, and I think we have to make sure at the end of it that we realize the good of the game is the most important thing, and we’re going to have to adapt and adjust. It’s going to be an adjustment. It’s going to be a challenge to adjust it, but I think at the end of the day, playing baseball is more important than all that stuff.”</p>
<p><strong>Polanco, Hayes looking good</strong></p>
<p>The conversation eventually segued into a discussion about some of Shelton’s inherited personnel. That began with a question on right fielder Gregory Polanco, who, as is well known by now, has struggled in past seasons with injuries and inconsistent play after a promising start to his career.</p>
<p>Shelton likes what he saw from Polanco in spring training, noting that his energy on the base paths and elsewhere was extremely high and that his attentiveness was heartening.</p>
<p>He even went so far as to say that he thought Polanco ran the bases better than anybody else during spring training. Though it’s hard to continue to make progress in specific departments while away from team facilities, Shelton is encouraged by what he has been able to glean about Polanco while the players are off.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen video of where [Polanco] is at recently, and health-wise, he looks awesome,” Shelton said. “I saw him moving around, doing some outfield stuff and throwing. Was really excited about it. So I’m excited where he’s at.”</p>
<p>Shelton is similarly impressed with young third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes, though Hayes’ situation is much different from Polanco’s.</p>
<p>Even if he doesn’t get there to start the 2020 season — Shelton didn’t specify when he believes Hayes will arrive in MLB — the 23-year-old, former first-round pick is on the cusp of the Pirates’ roster. And Shelton’s first impression of Hayes was unique.</p>
<p>“Very rarely when you start to talk about those guys is defense the first thing you talk about,” Shelton said. “And that’s the first thing that everybody had conversations with me when I got the job. And then you watch him defensively, and he’s the guy that when you watch on the baseball field, you realize how good he is just by his actions. And defensively, he’s a very, very special player.</p>
<p>“Offensively, it’s coming, and it’s going to be there, and he’s going to be a really good player, and I’m really excited that he’s going to be our guy.”</p>
