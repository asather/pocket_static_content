<h1>Holocaust memorial event honors the liberators</h1>

<p>They told of parents surviving barbaric cruelty, then coming to America and building new lives and families.</p>
<p>They told of soldiers who came to the aid of people like their parents —&nbsp;the American and other Allied troops who liberated the Jewish inmates in the Nazi death camps 75 years ago in the final months of World War II.</p>
<p>Even though the setting was different than planned, Pittsburgh’s annual Yom HaShoah commemoration retained its solemn tone as the Jewish community and supporters met online for the annual memorial gathering to honor victims and survivors of the Holocaust.</p>
<p>This was the first time in decades of Yom HaShoah programming that the event was held entirely online, broadcast through Zoom and Facebook Live due to the social distancing measures taken due to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>By late afternoon, more than 1,600 people had viewed the <a href="/Yom%20HaShoah%20is%20an%20annual%20day%20of%20remembrance%20established%20by%20Israel's%20Knesset,%20or%20parliament,%20in%201951%20and%20is%20set%20to%20mark%20the%20approximate%20anniversary%20of%20the%20Warsaw%20Ghetto%20uprising.%20%20The%20Holocaust%20was%20the%20systemic,%20state-sponsored%20murder%20of%206%20million%20Jews%20by%20Nazi%20Germany%20and%20its%20collaborators%20during%20World%20War%20II." target="_blank">video of the hour-long program</a>.</p>
<p>Candles were lit in memory of the dead and in honor of the survivors, of the liberating soldiers and of non-Jews who worked to save Jewish lives. Rabbis Jeffrey Myers and&nbsp;Jeremy Markiz offered solemn prayers in memory of those who died in the Holocaust.</p>
<p>Children of survivors told of their parents’ harrowing experiences, barely surviving the death camps and losing most or all of their family, then lighting candles in their memory.</p>
<p>Veronica Schmerling spoke of her parents surviving the Bergen-Belsen death camp and of the day British liberators arrived and a voice on the loudspeaker declared,&nbsp;“You are free.” She lit her candle in memory of relatives who were killed in the Holocaust and of&nbsp;“all the other millions who perished and have no one to remember them.”</p>
<p>Yom HaShoah is an annual day of remembrance established by Israel's Knesset, or parliament, in 1951.&nbsp;The Holocaust was the systemic, state-sponsored murder of 6 million Jews by Nazi Germany and its collaborators during World War II.</p>
<p>Organizers with the Holocaust Center of Pittsburgh had originally planned this year’s event to take place at Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall and Museum, using the occasion to honor surviving veterans who took part in the liberation.</p>
<p>Even so, local researcher and Holocaust educator James Lucot, who has interviewed hundreds of World War II veterans in his quest to understand the war that took his uncle’s life, gave a talk on two of them. Both were veteran Army paratroopers, the late Paul Hilovsky of Butler and the late Vincent Vicari of Bethlehem, Pa., each of whom took part in liberating one of the camps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lucot —&nbsp;a history teacher at Seneca Valley High School who has a master’s degree in Holocaust and Genocide Studies from Gratz College —&nbsp;told of how battle-hardened American soldiers were appalled and outraged to find camps filled with corpses and emaciated survivors.</p>
<p>“The words liberation and freedom have completely different meanings for the survivors, ones that we will never be able to comprehend,” Mr. Lucot said.&nbsp;“This was the same for the liberators. There was no celebration or good ending, but just the conclusion to the physical and mental struggle for survival. The Americans had no idea, no warning of what they were discovering. They had no preparation or training for this.&nbsp;But what if they had? Would it have even mattered?”</p>
<p>He added: “They would be very proud knowing what we’re doing here today because it is so very important that we never forget.”</p>
