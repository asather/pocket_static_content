<h1>North Catholic basketball's Tess Myers and Kylee Lewandowski make all-state again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tess Myers and Kylee Lewandowski were teammates on North Catholic’s girls basketball team for three seasons. They also kept each other company on the all-state team three times.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State Teams for Class 4A and 3A were released Tuesday, and Myers and Lewandowski both made the Class 4A team for the third consecutive year. This was the second year that the two seniors were first-team selections. As sophomores, Lewandowski made second team and Myers third team.</p>
<p>Myers and Lewandowski won WPIAL titles all three seasons they were teammates. Myers also started on a WPIAL championship team as a freshman. Lewandowski transferred to North Catholic after her freshman year at Butler.</p>
<p>Myers, a two-time Post-Gazette Fabulous 5 selection, is a Duquesne University recruit and Lewandowski has signed with Richmond.</p>
<p>Myers is the third member of her family to make all-state. Her sister, Natalie, played at Burrell and was a Class 2A second-team selection in 2016. Joe Myers, father of Tess and Natalie, was a third-team Associated Press all-state selection after his senior year at Burrell in 1979. Back then, all-state teams weren’t broken down by classification.</p>
<p>Myers and Lewandowski were two of three WPIAL players who were first-team selections in Class 4A. The other was Blackhawk’s Mackenzie Amalia, who was a first-team selection for the second year in a row.</p>
<p>Three WPIAL players were third-team selections in Class 4A : McKeesport’s Jhayla Bray, Central Valley’s Christiane Frye and Quaker Valley’s Corinne Washington.</p>
<p>Two WPIAL players were Class 3A third-team selections: Mohawk’s Karly McCutcheon and Carlynton’s Jada Lee. McCutcheon helped Mohawk win a WPIAL title this season.</p>
<p>The Class 2A and 1A teams will be released Wednesday.&nbsp;Here is the complete list for the Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State Teams in Class 4A and 3A :</p>
