<h1>Shad Gaspard, a former WWE star, dies at 39</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The body of the former pro wrestler Shad Gaspard was found after it washed ashore on Venice Beach early Wednesday morning, the authorities said.</p>
<p>Gaspard, 39, was reported missing on Sunday, after he was swept out to sea by a rip current while swimming with his son, Aryeh, 10, according to the Los Angeles County Fire Department Lifeguard Division.</p>
<p>Around 1:25 a.m. on Wednesday, a police officer was flagged down by a person reporting that a body had washed ashore on the beach, the <a href="http://www.lapdonline.org/newsroom/news_view/66566" rel="nofollow">Los Angeles Police Department</a> said. The body was later identified as Gaspard’s.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Gaspard was a member of the World Wrestling Entertainment’s Cryme Tyme duo. In 2008, the team partnered up with John Cena to help him with his rivalry with another wrestler named JBL. Gaspard was also</span><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 13.3333px;" href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2414411/" rel="nofollow">an actor</a><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">, appearing in “Get Hard” with Kevin Hart and Will Ferrell, “Think Like a Man Too”&nbsp;and “Black Panther.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Shad was our whole world and we were his,” Siliana Gaspard, Gaspard’s wife, said in a statement from his family on Thursday. “There are not enough words to describe what he means to all of us. He was our heart, our soul, our protector, our warrior. He was a bright force of nature, who brought joy to many through his joyous and gracious nature.”</p>
<p>“Shad was and will always be our real-life superhero,” she added.</p>
<p>Initially, Gaspard and his son were swimming in waist-deep water, but conditions changed quickly, Kenichi Haskett, the section chief of the lifeguard division, said in an interview on Wednesday.</p>
<p>A lifeguard had noticed that the father and son were struggling in the water and set out to rescue them. Aryeh was closer to the shore, so the lifeguard was able to reach him first, the authorities said.</p>
<p>“The lifeguard went out on a two-person rescue in that rip current, 75 yards off shore,” Haskett said, adding that Gaspard had seen the lifeguard and pointed him to Aryeh.</p>
<p>“His last few words were ‘just secure my son, rescue my son,’” Haskett said.</p>
<p>Haskett said that the lifeguard faced the reality that he could not save both, particularly because Gaspard was 6-foot-7 and weighed around 270 pounds. “Based on the gentleman’s size and the conditions in the water ...,” Haskett said, “these are choices we do not want to make.”</p>
<p>The lifeguard brought the child to shore and ran back out to rescue Gaspard, who was struggling in five- to six-foot waves but still floating.</p>
<p>“In 60 seconds, the lifeguard went back out to go get Shad,” Haskett said. “He saw him and then a wave came and pushed him under.” Gaspard did not resurface again.</p>
<p>Lifeguards began to search for Gaspard on Sunday but could not locate him. The search continued the next day with divers and sonar equipment. On Tuesday, the Coast Guard called off its search, but the Los Angeles County Lifeguards continued to look for Gaspard, Haskett said.</p>
<p>Before his professional wrestling career, the 6-foot-6 Gaspard worked as a body guard for celebrities including Britney Spears, Mike Tyson and Diddy, and played basketball at Georgia Perimeter College in Decatur, Ga.</p>
<p>The Brooklyn-born Gaspard began his stint with WWE in 2006. His contract ended in 2010, and he later appeared in numerous TV and film roles.</p>
<p>“WWE is saddened to learn that former WWE Superstar Shad Gaspard has passed away at the age of 39,” the wrestling company said in a <a href="https://www.wwe.com/article/shad-gaspard-passes-away" rel="nofollow">statement</a>. “Admired by friends and colleagues for his warmth and humor, Gaspard was no stranger to heroic deeds.”</p>
<p>Hollywood star and WWE icon Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson&nbsp;sent the Gaspard family his condolences on <a href="https://twitter.com/TheRock/status/1262959112440160258?s=20" rel="nofollow">Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>“Man, this is a tough one,” Johnson said. “A really tough one. Great guy.”</p>
<p>"I join fans around the world as we remember Shad Gaspard as a beloved performer and a caring father," WWE wrestler and executive Triple H tweeted. "In absolutely tragic circumstances, please keep his loved ones in your thoughts."</p>
<p>"Shad died a hero, saving his son's life. As a parent, there are no words to even explain that," former wrestler Taz tweeted. "He was a really positive &amp; funny guy every time we spoke, just a good dude. Prayers for his family during this horrible time."</p>
