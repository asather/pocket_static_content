<h1>Paul Zeise: Depth will be the Penguins' greatest strength going forward</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nobody was surprised when Jim Rutherford pulled the trigger on a trade that brought winger Jason Zucker to the Penguins. Rutherford and the Penguins don’t play for next year; they play for this year.&nbsp;That’s why Rutherford is one of the best general managers in sports and why the Penguins organization is one of the best-run organizations. They don’t exist for any other reason than to try and compete for a Stanley Cup every single season.</p>
<p>The Penguins were a championship-level team without Zucker, who fills an important role that was left over when Jake Guentzel was injured. With Zucker, they are now a more formidable championship-level team.</p>
<p>People always point to the star power the Penguins have as the main reason they are almost always in the conversation as Stanley Cup contenders. But they&nbsp;have always thrived because they have been deep enough to survive four grueling rounds of the playoffs. The Penguins have won because their fourth line gave them quality minutes and was effective.</p>
<p>Zucker gives the Penguins a little more depth than they had and gives Mike Sullivan some options in terms of what he wants to do with his top two lines. It also enables him to move some players down and ultimately help bolster that fourth line. The Penguins are going to get both Dominik Kahun and Nick&nbsp;Bjugstad back in the next few weeks — and defenseman Brian Dumoulin at some point — and those three will both bolster the lineup and given Sullivan even more to work with.</p>
<p>If you’re a Penguins fan, you have to like what you see when they are completely healthy and Sullivan has all of these pieces at his disposal. The Penguins will be tough to match up with because Sullivan has so many interchangeable parts and so many pieces he can fit together.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And I haven’t even mentioned the Penguins greatest area of depth: goaltender. Neither Tristan Jarry nor Matt Murray is playing like he wants to be the backup. Both have played at a high level, especially since January, and that gives the Penguins an edge in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The best case scenario is one of the two goalies gets hot late in the season and seizes the job and runs with it all the way through the playoffs. That is how many teams have won over the years, by riding a hot goalie to the Stanley Cup.</p>
<p>But the Penguins, in their last two Stanley Cup runs, proved that having a second goalie capable of stepping in and winning games in the playoffs is a huge advantage.They don’t win their Stanley Cup in 2016 if Murray doesn’t step in for an injured Marc-Andre Fleury. And they probably don’t beat Ottawa in the Eastern Conference final in 2017 if Murray doesn’t step in for Fleury, who had struggled against the Senators, in the middle of that series.</p>
<p>Sullivan has to look at his team and love what he sees. He has to love the versatility, the interchangeable parts and the fact that he has so many options to turn to at just about every spot. He also has to love the competition that comes with having so much depth and the fact that nobody can get complacent because they all know they can be replaced by someone else.</p>
<p>The Penguins appear to be getting healthier at the right time and got a boost from their general manager earlier this week. It won’t be easy in the loaded Eastern Conference, but I like their chances of surviving a lot more given how deep they are — or at least soon will be.</p>
