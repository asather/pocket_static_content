<h1>WEATHER: Heat wave continues in Pittsburgh, expected to break this weekend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Southwestern Pennsylvania’s heat wave is expected to stretch into the week with temperatures hovering in the 90s — 10 degrees above average for this time of year.</p>
<p>The average temperature for July is 83 degrees, according to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The high on Tuesday will reach 92 although a 30% chance of scattered showers and a thunderstorm could bring the heat down a few notches later in the day.</p>
<p>“There’s a little upper disturbance going on that may pose a greater threat in the afternoon-to-late-afternoon time frame,” said Myranda Fullerton, a Weather Service meteorologist.&nbsp;“But not everyone’s going to see rain.”</p>
<p>Despite a five-day stretch of 90-degree weather, Pittsburgh hasn’t come close to hitting any records, she noted. Monday’s high of 94 degrees, for instance, was still shy of the record 98 for the day, according to Weather Service data.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps more unique are the ultra-hot streaks, Fullerton said.</p>
<p>If today’s rain doesn’t cool things down, this current stretch could last through Friday. That would tie the record for eight consecutive 90-degree days. The last eight-day stretch was in August 1995.</p>
<p>But the longest stretch of 90-degree days recorded for the area was 13 days in 1988 (keeping in mind that Weather Service records date back to 1875). That stretch ended&nbsp;on July 16, 1988.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fullerton said a&nbsp;cold front forecast to move into the region on Saturday will break the hot spell, dropping temps back into the normal range -— into the 80s.</p>
<p>The extreme heat has been driving up ozone levels and taxing the region’s electrical grid. Duquesne Light reported sporadic outages Monday evening that affected&nbsp;about 20 different municipalities in the Pittsburgh area, the utility said. No major outages were reported as of Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department said the county’s three ozone monitors detected high concentrations of ozone. The ozone level exceeded the eight-hour&nbsp;National Ambient Air Quality Standard — the first time since July 2018.</p>
<p>Higher concentrations of ozone can cause breathing problems for the elderly, children, pregnant women and people with heart or respiratory disease, according to the health department.&nbsp;</p>
