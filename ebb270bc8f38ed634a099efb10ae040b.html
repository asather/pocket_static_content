<h1>New England Road in West Mifflin reopens to traffic but will close again next month</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since July 6, New England Road in West Mifflin has reopened to traffic at&nbsp;its intersection with Smith’s Lane but a longer closure of the road is set to begin in August, the Allegheny County Public Works Department announced.</p>
<p>The recent closure was required for preservation of Pine Run Bridge No. 4, including replacement of the bridge deck and an inlet, installation of scour protection and guide rail, and approach roadway work.</p>
<p>The ongoing project on New England Road will require another closure – about 1,200 feet southeast of Smith’s Lane – starting at 9 a.m. on Monday, August 10. That closure, expected to end in October 2020, is required for replacement of Pine Run Bridge No. 3, including construction of a concrete box culvert with outlet wing walls; installation of scour protection, storm drains, and guide rail as well as approach roadway work.</p>
<p>When that closure begins, traffic will be detoured using Clairton Road (Route 885), Lebanon Church Road, and Camp Hollow Road.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, New England Road was closed at Amblers Lane for replacement of Pine Run Bridge No. 5.</p>
<p>The project is part of the $1.6 million 2019 Capital Bridges contract.</p>
