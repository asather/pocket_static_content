<h1>David Crawley sues KDKA over federal age discrimination, retaliation claims</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A television news reporter injured in a stunt during Pittsburgh's regatta in 2017 has sued his employer in federal court, saying he has been subjected to retaliation because of his age and the medical bills related to the incident.</p>
<p>David Crawley, 72, on Monday sued KDKA-TV, corporate owner CBS and WPCW-TV, also owned by CBS.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawley said in the complaint that CBS has shown a pattern of retaliation and harassment against employees nationwide.</p>
<p>"Discrimination and disenfranchising vulnerable employees is endemic amongst CBS-owned and operated stations," the suit said and cites examples in other cities.</p>

<p>Mr. Crawley's complaint <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/07/19/Dave-crawley-kdka-lawsuit-red-bull-flugtag-injuries-regatta-saatchi-pittsburgh/stories/201907190102" target="_blank">mirrors another he filed in state court</a> over injuries he suffered in the EQT Pittsburgh Three Rivers Regatta in 2017 in which he said he lost his spleen and suffered brain damage after plunging into the Allegheny River during the Red Bull Flugtag event.</p>
<p>Mr. Crawley rode a flying contraption off a 22-foot-high pier. He said in the earlier suit that he didn't want to accept the assignment from KDKA but felt he had to because he had been passed over for other stories for age and health reasons and because KDKA was a regatta sponsor.</p>
<p>Footage of the incident shows him separating from the craft and plunging into the water. He didn't appear injured after he emerged but later said had suffered the spleen and brain injuries. His suit blamed the regatta organizers and others over the safety of the stunt, saying others had been injured at similar Flugtag events across the country.</p>
<p>He has yet to return to work.</p>
<p>In the federal lawsuit, he said he was forced to file a worker's compensation claim and accused CBS of refusing to pay his medical bills.</p>
<p>"CBS has aggressively fought and continues to fight to deny Dave Crawley's workers' compensation and employment rights, including payments for necessary medical treatment," his suit said.</p>
<p>He said the company also has retaliated against him by not renewing his contract with KDKA, eliminated his work email account without warning, stripped away his benefits and "intentionally eliminated him from public view â€” effectively erasing him from Pittsburgh viewership."</p>
<p>According to his suit, another younger CBS employee, Craig Setzer, was treated much differently after he was also badly injured during a similar Flugtag mishap in Miami in 2013.</p>
<p>Mr. Setzer, a weatherman, was promoted after his injury while Mr. Crawley said he was "abandoned, disregarded and retaliated against by CBS."</p>
<p>The suit is asking for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>
