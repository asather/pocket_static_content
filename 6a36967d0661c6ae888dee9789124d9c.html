<h1>Port Authority to study development along East Busway</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority received an unexpected bonus to support a $99.95 million federal grant for the Bus Rapid Transit system: a $682,500 grant to plan transit-oriented development along part of the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway.</p>
<p>The agency hadn’t applied for the planning grant, spokesman Adam Brandolph said, but the Federal Transit Administration announced the supplementary grant two weeks after&nbsp;President Donald Trump tweeted the award of the money for the bus system to link Oakland and Downtown Pittsburgh using exclusive bus lanes. The planning money, part of $22 million announced across the country, is part of a federal pilot program to encourage residential and commercial development around transit projects.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said Port Authority&nbsp;is still learning about the grant program but expects to use the money for planning along the East Busway between the East Liberty and Wilkinsburg stations. Part of the Bus Rapid Transit system would take buses from Oakland to eastern suburbs via the busway.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Port Authority has increased its efforts at transit-oriented development by approving guidelines to encourage municipalities and developers to use land around transit facilities. In addition, it has developed specific recommendations for using land it owns and adjacent private property around the Negley Station on the East Busway and the Station Square Station that serves the light rail system as well as buses on the South Side, but no development has happened there yet.</p>
<p>The goal with transit-oriented development is to locate the type of housing and businesses used by transit riders near transit facilities. The best example in this area is the East Liberty Transit Center, which has an apartment complex, parking garage and businesses on six acres around the East Liberty Station.</p>
<p>Nationally, a Bus Rapid Transit system in Cleveland is considered a model for development around transit facilities. Allegheny County took a delegation to tour there as it developed plans for the system here.</p>
<p>The East Busway has the Homewood Station between East Liberty and Wilkinsburg but the authority doesn’t own much adjacent property along the busway, which follows a railroad corridor most of the way.</p>
<p>David Huffaker, the authority’s director of development, told the board’s planning and stakeholder relations committee the grant would give the agency&nbsp;“an opportunity to work with communities.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said it’s too early to say much more about the process.</p>
<p>“Transit and development certainly can work together,” he said. “We look at it as a way for the community to access transit. We’ll see what we can do along the busway.”</p>
