<h1>West Library park-and-ride in Bethel Park to lose 13 spaces during road work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Beginning Friday and lasting until December, commuters who use Port Authority’s park-and-ride lot at West Library will have 13 fewer parking spaces to jostle over.</p>
<p>That’s because the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation will use those spots while it completes a road-widening project that adds turning lanes on Route 88 in Bethel Park and South Park Township.</p>
<p>The lot has 115 spaces, but authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said it already fills early on weekday mornings. He suggested motorists instead use the garage at South Hills Village, which charges $2 to park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PennDOT project will include replacing two stone arch bridges with concrete box culverts, and also adding left-turn lanes on northbound Route 88 at Clifton and Churchill roads and a right-turn lane from Clifton onto Route 88.</p>
<p>Drainage updates, signal improvements, guide rail updates and new pavement markings also are part of the project. One lane of traffic will be maintained in each direction during the work, but the road will be closed twice for one-week stretches during culvert work.</p>
