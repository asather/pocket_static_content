<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Why should we believe Bob Nutting will change his ways?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat Steelers with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>N-Town Blues:</strong> What is the point of trusting this new [Pirates] management team if the owner is still the same? We have seen this show before, why would we think it is going to change any time soon? You know what it is going to be — more new ski slopes and low rent players!</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;I don’t disagree completely with this sentiment and I understand it. You cannot change the past, you cannot change the overwhelming evidence of what he has done and you cannot predict the future. All I can tell you is that you have to just enjoy the ride, watch this team grow up and hope when it comes down to go time, Bob Nutting does the right thing. I don’t know what that is or will look like, but I have to believe he is taking stock of how angry his fan base is and will try to change some of his ways. I don’t ever see this team being a big spender under Nutting. But I do think he could open things up a little bit to sign a player or two that gets them over the top. Now, you can choose to say&nbsp;“prove it to me” and walk away from the team for a while, but what fun is that? A big part of being a fan is enjoying the ride, rooting for your team through thick and thin and hoping that you have that special season every so often.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jon:</strong> When is the Pirates’ lease with the sports authority at PNC Park up? And should the city force some sort of assurances about the Pirates spending on payroll into the next lease agreement? The park was a gift from taxpayers and Bob Nutting gets to pocket all the money.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I am not an expert on city finances, taxation, leases or the sports and exhibition authority. That being said, my first thought is no. The City of Pittsburgh cannot tell Bob Nutting how to run his team. And they can’t force his hand, either, as it is not like there are other teams dying to be a tenant of PNC Park. The city benefits overall from having the Pirates and having Pirates games, so they aren’t going to bite the hands that feed them. A lot of people are employed by the Pirates, and a lot of bars and places to eat benefit from the Pirates games.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>John:</strong> Rebuilding Bucco style is dumb and you keep defending it.&nbsp;First, dump your two best players, one being Bell, because management won’t pay for top talent.&nbsp;Have you no idea how idiotic that sounds?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Do you know how idiotic it sounds to say&nbsp;“the team is flawed, has many holes and is not close to a contender but let’s spend money on aging players so we can win 78 games instead of 70.” Hooray for mediocrity! The Pirates’ only shot at being a contender is by breaking it down, saving some money this year, turning some of the best players into prospects via trades and hope that the plan comes together in a year or two. I am on the fence about Josh Bell because he is only 27, but keeping Starling Marte around — a 31-year old with a drug suspension and an injury history on his resume — would have been dumb — or, idiotic. It is fun to rip the Pirates and Nutting, I get it, but they actually did the right thing here.</p>
<p><strong>Ian:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think the Pirates will set a club record for lowest attendance this season?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> There have been some really, really lean years, so I will say no. I think the strength of the ballpark, a new management team and the overall experience — and yes bobbleheads, fireworks and all that stuff — will get people to the games. The attendance won’t shatter records, but it won’t be a disaster, either.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Antonio Brown said he has learned from this latest incident and he wants to play in the NFL again. What do you think are his chances?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> Very slim. I mean, if he indeed has turned over a new leaf, has cleaned up his act and is going to make real changes then, yeah, he can come back and someone would take him. The guy can’t through a week without an incident, though, so he has a lot of work to do to prove that he is indeed reformed and ready to do things right.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zach:&nbsp;</strong>Do you think Pitt women's basketball head coach Lance White will be given enough time to build the program? The team has gotten worse in his 2nd year.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I think he is the right guy for the job. I also think the job is a really, really difficult job. It is much tougher to build a program on the women’s side than the men’s side because the depth of top players is so much different. There are more girls playing every year. but the depth is still not close to the boys side. It will take some time to dig out of the hole that they are in. He has recruited well and has some good freshmen, so he is on the right track. Just give it some time.</p>
<p><strong>Shawn:</strong> I saw that WVU beat Army and Navy in rifle the last few weeks. Should we be concerned that the military academies are not the best rifle teams in the country?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> That is concerning! Actually, though I am happy they are losing to a team who has a mascot that holds and fires a musket. I mean, the Mountaineers wander around the mountains shooting deer and bear, so they need to be proficient with the rifles, as well. That’s also why it wouldn’t bother me if Robert Morris beat Army and Navy because, well, Colonials needed to be great riflemen too! It would be far more concerning if the military academies were losing to a team whose mascot is a dog or a lion or something. This question actually made my day, by the way.</p>
<p><strong>TJ:</strong> The Kobe story sucks, he was my favorite player. You are an NBA guy, where do you rank Kobe all time among the greatest players. He has to be top three, right?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> You are right it is a tragedy. That being said, we tend to do this too much — a man dying doesn’t make him a greater player than he actually was. In other words, we tend to overrate players in the immediate aftermath of their deaths. It is natural and emotional. That being said, I think any list that has Kobe anywhere in the top seven is not accurate. Michael Jordan, LeBron James, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Tim Duncan, Shaq and maybe even Bill Russell should all be ahead of him. He was a great, great player. He wasn’t quite at the level of the guys I mentioned. Those are just my quick thoughts.</p>
