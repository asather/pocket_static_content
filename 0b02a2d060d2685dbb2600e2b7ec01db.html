<h1>Kevin Colbert: Optimism high Ben Roethlisberger 'could be a better football player' after surgery </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS — General manager Kevin Colbert said he thinks quarterback Ben Roethlisberger could be even better in 2020 coming off his season-ending surgery on his throwing elbow.</p>
<p>And, for the first time, he put a hopeful timetable on Roethlisberger’s return to the football field; Game 1 of the 2020 season.</p>
<p>“We want to have Ben ready for Game 1, whenever that is,” Colbert said Tuesday at the NFL combine. “A guy like Ben, you might have to hold him back if he’s a little too aggressive (with his rehab). That’s something the docs will figure out.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger lightly threw a football on Friday in Los Angeles for the first time since having surgery, which Colbert said was a positive and even surprising sign of his progress his recovery.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about the surgery because it might be a better result,” Colbert said. “The possibility is real he could be a better football player coming out of this surgery. I’m encouraged and excited where he can go.”</p>
