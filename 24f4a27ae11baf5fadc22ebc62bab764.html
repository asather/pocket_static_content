<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man was found dead after a fire destroyed a bar and restaurant Wednesday morning in Somerset County.</p>
<p>Authorities responded just before 6 a.m. to Walat’s Bar and Grill on Lincoln Highway/Route 30 in Jenner, fire officials said. The facility was closed at the time of the blaze.</p>
<p>The county coroner was called to the scene.</p>
<p>One man, whose identity has not been revealed, was found dead inside the building, according to Jennerstown Fire Chief Dave Robertson.</p>
<p>“When you walk inside, the bar is to your right, and to the left is a seating area,” the fire chief said.&nbsp;“He was found near the seating area.” Whether or not the man was dead prior to the fire was not immediately known.</p>
<p>Chief Robertson said firefighters had the blaze under control within 45 minutes.</p>
<p>The building sustained extensive damage and the cause of the fire is under investigation by the state police fire marshal’s office.</p>
<p>Chief Robertson said the restaurant was a popular stop along Route 30 that catered to many tourists over the years.</p>
<p>“The bar’s been here for 50, 60 years ... it’s had a lot of skiers, snowmobilers ... it had a nice little clientele over the years,” he said.</p>
<p>A portion of Lincoln Highway that was closed due to the fire had reopened by 8:30 a.m.</p>
