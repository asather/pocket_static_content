<h1>Paul Zeise: Steelers need to bolster defensive depth in draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers addressed many of their holes in free agency this year. They added a tight end, an offensive lineman and a special teams ace who also plays fullback. They tagged Bud Dupree and they added to their offensive line depth by re-signing Zach Banner.</p>
<p>That gave Kevin Colbert and Mike Tomlin some flexibility when it comes to the NFL draft. At least that is what it appears to be at first glance, but a little closer look at the roster suggests there are still some holes to fill on defense. They aren’t glaring holes because the starting 11 is pretty much intact, but they are still holes nonetheless.</p>
<p>Obviously, the season will be largely determined by the health and ability to play at a reasonably high level by Ben Roethlisberger. If he isn’t able to play or can’t get back into form, it doesn’t much matter what else happens — the Steelers are likely to struggle. I don’t think it means they go 4-12, but it would seem like they would stumble to another season hovering around .500.</p>
<p>The defense is going to be a team strength regardless of what happens, as it should be one of the best units in the NFL. The Steelers should have one of the best pass rushes in the NFL, two excellent corners, one of the best safeties and a couple of playmakers on the defensive line.</p>
<p>Beyond the starters, though, there just isn’t much depth. The Steelers defense is one or two key injuries away from having a significant drop in production. They need to bolster this area ,and the best place to do it is in the draft.</p>
<p>I’ve heard a lot of talk about who the Steelers should take with their first pick at No. 49, and it mostly revolves around a running back, a receiver or an offensive lineman. I think that would be a mistake because they need to address defense.</p>
<p>That pick would ideally be a linebacker. The Steelers really could use an inside linebacker to replace Mark Barron and Tyler Matakavich and give them some depth behind Devin Bush and Vince Williams. They could actually use an outside linebacker as well, but they have a little more depth at that spot than inside.</p>
<p>The Steelers have two excellent corners in Joe Haden and Steven Nelson. Haden is starting to get to the age where corners see their skill sets diminish. And Cam Sutton and Mike Hilton, two of the primary backups, have been mostly pedestrian thus far in their careers. I think depth at linebacker is the biggest priority on defense, but the Steelers could definitely also use another cornerback.</p>
<p>Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt are an excellent one-two punch at defensive end, but Tuitt has had trouble staying healthy. And Heyward is still extremely productive, but he is 30 and entering his 10th season. The Steelers did address the depth here by trading for Chris Wormley, but currently their nose tackle is Dan McCullers, so they could use some help up front, too.</p>
<p>The Steelers have plenty of options in the draft, but they need to make sure they address their defense, and two of the deepest positions in the draft are linebacker and defensive linemen. There are also plenty of good safeties and corners availablem so there is no question that the Steelers should have a chance to grab a high quality defensive player at No. 49 — and even with their third-round pick at 102.</p>
<p>Running back is not a very deep position. Nor is tight end, and those are two positions the Steelers already have enough depth at now. The addition of Eric Ebron is a good insurance policy for Vance McDonald, and they still have Zach Gentry, as well. That isn’t to say they couldn’t bolster this position late in the draft, but it isn’t a priority. And the Steelers are already four deep at running back and are committed to James Conner as the starter.</p>
<p>One other good thing about drafting for defensive depth is that just about anyone you pick can help on special teams. In fact, most rookies are going to make their impact there to start. And that’s the thing:&nbsp;none of the players that are drafted are going to be thrust into major roles unless there is an injury.</p>
<p>The Steelers appear to be a team that will compete for a division title this year, at least on paper. A lot depends on Roethlisberger, but a lot also hangs on the health of the defense. The Steelers are not going to be able to replace the production of some of their stars on defense with a rookie, but they need to be able to survive if one or two of them goes down.</p>
