<h1>'Music is Essential' march sparks division among Pittsburgh musicians </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Music is Essential” is the title, and while most people would agree with the sentiment, the intended delivery method has whipped up controversy on social media.</p>
<p>At a time when musicians all over the world are streaming stay-at-home concerts in response to the pandemic, plans were announced Monday for a “Global March for Freedom” on Saturday that includes at “every city hall, public park &amp; downtown” from 2 to 5 p.m.</p>
<p>The flyer, posted Jessica Rosario, a singer-songwriter and former music coordinator for the Deutschtown Music Festival, demands “No More Lock Downs. No More Fear.” and requests of participants “Bring your gear, bring your art, and let’s PLAY.”</p>
<p>It is not clear who created the flyer, which sparked an immediate backlash on Facebook, some of it from Pittsburgh musicians.</p>
<p>Mandy Kivowitz-Delfaver, aka singer Phat Man Dee, reacted with, “This is irresponsible as hell. If you love the music scene like you say you do, you’ll tell folks to stay the f--- home. Your inability to make music on the Internet should not interfere with my ability to actually live.”</p>
<p>Shawn Macintyre, an EMT and musician, wrote, “Music and Dance are essential, all of which you can do at home and support artists at home. The entire idea of this event is irresponsible and stupid. Are you trying to kill musicians?”</p>
<p>Dave Kuzy of the avant-noise band Microwaves, posted “Reported for self-harm.”</p>
<p>Rosario, who fronted the band Big Gypsy, posted on Tuesday, “While we’re ‘locked down’ the evil doers of the world are boldly taking steps to enslave humanity...handing out freshly printed DEBT, poisoning our water, DESTROYING our industry, shutting down our FOOD chains, while families sit JOBLESS &amp; HUNGRY, mandating oxidative STRESS &amp; DISEASE while spreading FEAR &amp; LIES!...ENOUGH IS ENOUGH!”</p>

<p>She goes on to say that while some may soon have the “privilege” of going back to work, “do you really think they’ll let us performers get back to piling into vans &amp; packing venues all in the name of their sick game?”</p>
<p>Rosario, who could not be reached for comment Thursday morning, also posted on Tuesday, “OK, it’s officially on now. Mini Fest dahn at Point Park. Open space &amp; free jam for the purpose of UNITY!”</p>
<p>When you click on the post for the Music is Essential event, a notice from Facebook comes up saying, “It's up to all of us to slow the spread of COVID-19. Everyone, including young and healthy people, should avoid large gatherings during this time. Stay up-to-date with public health guidelines from cdc.gov.”</p>
<p>“Music is Essential” would be the second anti-shutdown demonstration Downtown. On April 20, a few hundred people, some of them armed, gathered in front of the City-County Building to protest the restrictions. It was attended by Paul and Leah Martinez, co-owners of the Strip District nightclub CAVO<em>.</em></p>
