<h1>Ron Cook: A changing of the guard for NFL quarterbacks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The exclusive club of NFL Hall of Fame-caliber quarterbacks lost a prized member Friday. Eli Manning announced his retirement after 16 seasons with the New York Football Giants. He didn’t just lead his team to two Super Bowl wins. He didn’t just win the MVP award in each game. He beat Bill Belichick and Tom Brady — the greatest coach and greatest quarterback of all time — twice, including the first time after the 2007 season when the New England Patriots were 18-0.</p>
<p>Manning leaves behind Brady, Ben Roethlisberger, Drew Brees and Aaron Rodgers, who have combined to win 10 Super Bowls. I’m including Philip Rivers in the club even though he hasn’t been able to lead the San Diego/Los Angeles Chargers to a Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The question today:</p>
<p>Will any of the five quarterbacks win a Super Bowl in the little time they have left in the NFL? Will they even make it to a Super Bowl?</p>
<p>Rodgers, at 36, is the youngest of the group. Brady, who will turn 43 before next season, is the oldest. Brees celebrated his 41st birthday on Jan. 15. Rivers is 38. Roethlisberger will turn 38 on March 2, a couple of months, presumably, before he throws his first pass after major elbow surgery.</p>
<p>The odds are stacked against each quarterback.</p>
<p>No one knows where Brady and Rivers will play next season. Each has given hints he is looking for a new team, although it still will be shocking if Brady isn’t back with the Patriots. Brees has been to just one Super Bowl, his New Orleans Saints winning against Indianapolis after the 2009 season. The Saints have had brutal playoff losses in each of the past three seasons, including the past two at home. Rodgers also has been to just one Super Bowl, his Green Bay Packers beating the Steelers after the 2010 season. Roethlisberger, who missed most of this season, might not be the quarterback he was before his surgery. He won two Super Bowls and played in a third but has won just three playoff games since the 2010 season.</p>
<p>A young group of strong quarterbacks is ready to push aside the old guys. It is headed by Kansas City’s Patrick Mahomes and San Francisco’s Jimmy Garoppolo, who will play in the 2020 Super Bowl next Sunday, and Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson, the presumptive MVP this season. Several others have a chance to join Seattle’s Russell Wilson as a Super Bowl winner.</p>
<p>I’m throwing out Brady and Brees because of their age. I know, it’s never smart to bet against Brady, but I also know Father Time is undefeated in every sport.</p>
<p>I’m throwing out Rivers because he can’t play anymore. He should follow Manning into retirement.</p>
<p>I’m thinking Rodgers is the best bet to get back to a Super Bowl because he figures to have more opportunities. But does he have good enough players around him? Did you see the Packers run defense against the 49ers last Sunday?</p>
<p>That leaves Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Two things are true:</p>
<p>One, the Steelers will have a heck of a shot next season if Roethlisberger is healthy. I get that it’s fair to worry about the aging offensive line, about James Conner being able to stay healthy and about the lack of a dependable tight end. But the returning defense will be good enough to get to a Super Bowl and win it, assuming the team keeps Bud Dupree, which it will.</p>
<p>And, unfortunately, two …</p>
<p>The Steelers will have no chance if Roethlisberger can’t play or is limited. No chance at all.</p>
