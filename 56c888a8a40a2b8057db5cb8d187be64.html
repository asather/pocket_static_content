<h1>Ohio House speaker, 4 others charged in $61 million bribery scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Authorities arrested Republican Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder and four others on Tuesday, charging them as co-conspirators in a nearly $61 million bribery and racketeering scheme that has been called the worst in Ohio political history.</p>
<p>The scheme was tied to last year's passage and subsequent defense of a law bailing out nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>Mr. Householder, 61, was described as the ring leader by U.S. Attorney David DeVillers during a news conference in Columbus. Gov. Mike DeWine, Senate President Larry Obhof, Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, Lt. Gov. Jon Husted and Ohio Republican Party Chairman Jane Timken were among fellow Republicans who called for Mr. Householder's immediate resignation.</p>
<p>“I am deeply concerned about the allegations of wrongdoing in the criminal complaint issued today by the U.S. attorney’s office,” Mr. DeWine said. “Every American has the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. Because of the nature of these charges, it will be impossible for Speaker Householder to effectively lead the Ohio House of Representatives; therefore, I am calling on Speaker Householder to resign immediately.</p>
<p>“This is a sad day for Ohio,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally authorities have implicated a 501(c)4 organization called Generation Now, a nonprofit organization that prosecutors contend was used to disburse “dark money” campaign contributions to House candidates deemed loyal to Mr. Householder, nearly all of whom later supported his 2019 election as the Ohio House speaker.</p>
<p>Also arrested were:</p>
<p>• Matt Borges, 48, of Bexley, a former Ohio Republican Party chairman who was described by authorities as a lobbyist for a subsidiary of the unnamed “Company A” and at the heart of the effort to use dark money to kill a ballot effort to repeal the bailout law.</p>
<p>• Neil Clark, 68, a high-profile Columbus lobbyist, described as Mr. Householder’s “proxy” to enact House Bill 6 and kill the referendum effort.</p>
<p>• Jeff Longstreth, 44, of Columbus, a political consultant and key Householder adviser, described as a point of contact for “Company A” that was funneling unreported cash to nonprofit Generation Now.</p>
<p>• Juan Cespedes, 40, a Columbus lobbyist, described as a “key middleman” who tracked “Householder camp” legislative candidates who were later given dark money funneled through Generation Now.</p>
<p>All of the charged individuals are accused of diverting some of the money to their own personal benefit. All also made appearances via video before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie K. Bowman, of Cincinnati, part of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.</p>
<p>The suspects are accused of racketeering conspiracy, a charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.</p>
<p>“All forms of public corruption are unacceptable,” said Chris Hoffman, the FBI’s special agent in charge in Cincinnati. “When the corruption is alleged to reach some of the highest levels of our state government, the citizens of Ohio should be shocked and appalled.”</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s court appearance, each defendant, through his attorney or on his own, answered the judge's questions but did not offer additional statements, other than for some to say they have ailing relatives and other personal issues that may require them to seek permission from the court to periodically travel outside of southern Ohio.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Emily N. Glatfelter, who represented prosecutors during the hearing, told Judge Bowman that in each case the government was not seeking detention.</p>
<p>Each defendant was allowed by the judge to remain free, provided he does not violate conditions of his bond.</p>
<p>Mr. Householder, a veteran Republican lawmaker, pushed for passage of House Bill 6, designed to funnel about $1 billion from surcharges on consumer bills to bail out two struggling nuclear power plants.</p>
<p>He is accused of conspiring with Generation Now from March 2017 to March 2020 to enact the bill and then work to kill a subsequent ballot effort that was designed to repeal it. The money flowed into Generation Now from an unidentified energy company and its affiliates, authorities allege.</p>
<p>Mr. Longstreth incorporated Generation Now, which the FBI contends was actually run by Mr. Householder. The money was used to help pay for Mr. Householder's campaign staff, according to federal officials.</p>
<p>Mr. Householder allegedly received an estimated $400,000 in personal benefits to settle a personal lawsuit, pay for costs associated with a Florida residence and pay off thousands of dollars in credit card debt.</p>
<p>“Make no mistake, this is Larry Householder's 501(c)4,” Mr. DeVillers said.</p>
<p>The organization, created under a section of the Internal Revenue Code, was not required to disclose where it got its money, something that made it easier for such a scheme to be hatched and carried out.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Mr. Householder could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Preliminary hearings for the individuals have been scheduled for Aug. 6, and a first appearance in court is scheduled that day for Generation Now, as well.</p>
<p>The Ohio House in July 2019 narrowly voted to have Ohio consumers pay $150 million a year to rescue the financially failing Davis-Besse plant near Oak Harbor and the Perry plant east of Cleveland.</p>
<p>FirstEnergy Solutions — at the time the owner-operator of Davis-Besse — had said it would begin decommissioning its Davis-Besse nuclear plant in Oak Harbor by May 31, 2020, and its Perry plant east of Cleveland a year later if it did not receive assistance. The plants have been unable to compete in this age of cheap and abundant natural gas, as well as lower-priced solar, wind and other forms of renewable energy.</p>
<p>Together, Davis-Besse and Perry, directly and indirectly, provide or support more than 4,000 jobs. Each plant has about 700 full-time employees.</p>
<p>A FirstEnergy plant in Western Pennsylvania was spared from closure earlier this year.</p>
<p>In March, two years after FirstEnergy said it would shutter the Beaver Valley nuclear power plant in Shippingport because it was uneconomic without state subsidies, Energy Harbor Corp., the current operator of the plant as well as the two Ohio plants, said the power plant would remain open after all.</p>
<p>The power station employs 1,000 people and has a total capacity of 1,872 megawatts, enough to power more than 1 million homes.</p>
<p>The company said that while it didn’t succeed in getting the same type of legislation passed in Pennsylvania as in Ohio, Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to join the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a program for capping and gradually decreasing carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector in 10 states, would be enough to keep Beaver Valley viable.</p>
<p>In a statement issued late Tuesday afternoon through FirstEnergy company spokeswoman Jennifer Young, the company said it had “received subpoenas in connection with the investigation surrounding Ohio House Bill 6.”</p>
<p>“We are reviewing the details of the investigation and we intend to fully cooperate,” the statement reads.</p>
<p>The current owner-operator, Energy Harbor, a company that emerged from FirstEnergy Solutions’ bankruptcy proceedings, had little to say.</p>
<p>“We are reviewing the complaint and will cooperate fully with the government’s investigation,” Jason D. Copsey, Energy Harbor spokesman, said.</p>
<p>While Company A is not named in the complaint, Mr. DeVillers said there’s no question who Company A is. Neither FirstEnergy nor its former subsidiary FES have been charged, but the investigation continues.</p>
