<h1>Eight indicted in connection with violent crimes during May 30 protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Eight people have been indicted in federal court on charges connected to violence during the May 30 protests in Downtown Pittsburgh over the killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>The alleged crimes occurred while Pittsburgh police were responding to the demonstrations.</p>
<p>The indictments were returned under seal on July 22 and announced today by the U.S. attorney’s office.</p>
<p>“Throwing IEDS and bricks at police officers, throwing projectiles at and striking police horses, and setting police cruisers on fire are not the protected First Amendment activities of a peaceful protest; they are criminal acts that violate federal law,” said U.S. Attorney Scott Brady in a statement.</p>
<p>He said his office will continue to pursue others who committed crimes during the demonstrations.</p>
<p>Michael Christman, special agent in charge of the Pittsburgh FBI, said the bureau respects the rights of people to peacefully protest “but will not stand by and let those with a violent agenda take over peaceful protests.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich echoed law enforcement in saying that the “lawlessness” of May 30 “cannot be tolerated.”</p>
<p>The first indictment charges George Allen, 31, of Pittsburgh, with one count of obstructing law enforcement by damaging a police vehicle by throwing a projectile through the passenger window.</p>
<p>Nicholas Lucia, 25, of Pittsburgh, also is charged with obstructing law enforcement by throwing an object at police that appeared to be an explosive device. It landed on an officer’s vest. Another officer pulled it off and it exploded when it hit the ground, according to the indictment.</p>
<p>A third indictment charges Andrew Augustyniak-Duncan, 25, of Carnegie, with obstructing law enforcement by throwing projectiles at several police officers.</p>
<p>Raekwon Dac Blankenship, 24, is accused of the same obstruction crime. Prosecutors said he damaged an unmarked police car by hitting, kicking and stomping on it and throwing an object into the windshield. He also is accused of poking and striking multiple police horses.</p>
<p>Devin Montgomery, 24, of Pittsburgh, is accused of malicious destruction by fire of a vehicle belonging to an organization receiving federal financial assistance. The grand jury said he damaged a police vehicle leased by the Pittsburgh Police Bureau. He and Brandon Benson, 29, of Pittsburgh, also are accused of entering Dollar Bank on Smithfield Street with the intent to rob it.</p>
<p>A final indictment accuses Da’Jon Lengyel, 22, of McKees Rocks, and Christopher West, 35, of Pittsburgh, with destroying by fire a vehicle leased by Pittsburgh police. The two are also accused of damaging a police officer’s vehicle by stomping and kicking it and joining others to light it on fire.</p>
<p>All of the defendants will be prosecuted by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shaun Sweeney, an expert in prosecuting arson and related federal crimes.</p>
