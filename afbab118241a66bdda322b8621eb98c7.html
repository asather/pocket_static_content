<p>Some of the biggest names in American theater have joined in power and hope to form Black Theatre United, a coalition to inspire reform and combat systemic racism in their industry.</p>
<p>To launch their platform, a black-and-white video was released Wednesday that delivered the message,&nbsp;“As members of the black community, we stand together to help protect black people, black talent, black lives of all shapes and orientations, in theater and communities across the country.”</p>
<p>On its website, BlackTheatreUnited.com, the group spells out its objectives as awareness, accountability, advocacy and action, using connections and influence both in grassroots work and on a national platform.</p>
<p>The group includes&nbsp;performers, directors, writers, technicians, producers, stage managers and more, with Carnegie Mellon alumni and Pittsburghers Tamara Tunie and Billy Porter and CMU’s Michael McElroy among founding members Lisa Dawn Cave, Darius de Haas, Brandon Victor Dixon, Carin Ford, Capathia Jenkins, LaChanze, Adriane Lenox, Kenny Leon, Norm Lewis, Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Wendell Pierce, Phylicia Rashad, Allyson Tucker, Lillias White, NaTasha Yvette Williams, Schele Williams and Vanessa Williams.</p>
<p>Other artists joining forces on the video introduction are Oscar-winner Viola Davis, Danielle Brooks, Daveed Diggs, Cynthia Erivo, Renée Elise Goldsberry, David Alan Grier, Stephen McKinley Henderson, Samuel and LaTanya Jackson, Delroy Lindo, Leslie Uggams, and Adrienne Warren.</p>
<p>The announcement follows a three-day forum —&nbsp;Broadway Advocacy Coalition's Broadway for Black Lives Matter Again — held in the wake of the killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery and others.</p>
<p>The initial focus of the group is ]the 2020 census and “ensuring that minority communities are represented,” Playbill wrote, adding that Tony Award winners McDonald and Rashad will take part in the Stacey Abrams-founded Fair Count's "Sisters Sip" Zoom happy hour June 17. Black Theatre United also will partner with another celebrity-founded group, Harness, to launch their #BeCounted campaign.</p>
<p>On its website, the coalition announces itself by saying,&nbsp;“We need every voice lifted and every heart opened, aligned with ours to fight against racist ideologies that have divided us by devaluing our lives. We will not be silent. We will be seen. We will be heard. We are here. Join us."</p>
