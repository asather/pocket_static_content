<h1>Forget raindrops on roses, these are some of our favorite television things on Valentine's Day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Valentine’s Day has inspired television writers to create some of the medium’s most memorable episodes. Here are a few we love, with the caveat that it might not include your favorite (two people can’t watch everything!):</p>
<p>•&nbsp;“<strong>The Simpsons,” “I Love Lisa.” Season 4 Feb. 11 1993</strong></p>
<p>Lisa, out of pity for little Ralph Wiggum, gives him a hastily scribbled Valentine and he goes overboard in response. Lisa “Choo Choo Chooses” him, but that doesn’t mean she <em>loves</em> the goofy little kid. It’s part of a nine-episode Valentine’s Day roundup streaming on Disney +</p>

<p><strong>•&nbsp;“Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered.”&nbsp;Season 2, Feb. 10, 1998.</strong></p>
<p>Not a surprising title, given Joss Whedon’s love of musical theater. Xander blackmails emerging witch Amy into trying to make Cordelia love him again. The spell backfires: ALL women love Xander, except for Cordelia. Wackiness and near death ensue. And Buffy gets turned into a rat. Streaming on Hulu.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;“<strong>Parks and Recreation,” “Operation Ann.” Season 4, Feb. 4, 2012.</strong></p>
<p>A whole bunch of nutty stuff happens, including a Ron riddle hunt and Leslie trying to keep making “Galentine’s Day” a thing. Come to think of it, watch Season 1’s&nbsp;“Galentines Day” episode as well.&nbsp;Currently streaming on Amazon, Netflix and Hulu but will be moving exclusively to NBC’s Peacock later this year.</p>

<p>•&nbsp;“<strong>Glee,” “Silly Love Songs.” Season 2 Feb. 8 2011.</strong></p>
<p>Finn sets up a Valentine’s Day kissing booth and hopes to win back Quinn, who is already involved with Sam. Kurt expresses his love for Blaine, who sings to his beloved in a Gap store. The Warblers warble. Darren Criss reminds everyone why he’s a star. Six songs in a one-hour episode is a<em> lot</em> of music. But, what’s with Puck fat-shaming this girl he’s obsessed with? On Netflix.</p>

<p>• “<strong>Crazy Ex-Girlfriend,”&nbsp;“I’m in Love.” April 5, 2019.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>In the series finale, Rebecca has promised to choose Josh, Nathaniel or Greg by the end of Valentine’s Day. Her first stop is her therapist/Dream Ghost, who helps her see that choosing one or the other isn’t the route to happiness. Instead, she discovers that all those musical numbers are what she did for love. Our hearts are broken because one of television’s most inventive series has come to an end. All four seasons are streaming on Netflix.</p>

<p>• “<strong>Frasier,” “Three Valentines.” Season 6, Feb. 11, 1999.</strong></p>
<p>If you recall nothing else from this episode, the silent scene of Niles accidentally setting his brother’s couch on fire is David Hyde Pierce giving a master class in physical comedy. “Frasier” is among the NBC series that left Netflix for the Peacock streaming service.</p>

<p>• “<strong>Mad Men,”&nbsp;“A Day’s Work.” Season 7, April 20, 2014.</strong></p>
<p>It’s getting harder by the episode to keep track of all the intricate relationships, but among the most intriguing is not a romantic one. Sally Draper discovers one of her father’s many secrets and they have a talk about the truth. As Don drops off Sally at boarding school, she tells him, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you.”&nbsp; “Mad Men” is on Netflix for now, but that contract is up for renewal after 2020.</p>

<p><strong>• “Chuck,” “Chuck Versus the Masquerade,”&nbsp;Season 4, episode 16, Feb. 21, 2011.</strong></p>
<p>Yvonne Strahovski plays at some steamy dress-up and then, spy stuff. What’s best about this episode is that love is in the air — even for Morgan. It’s a fun time for Chuck and Sarah, before that devastating series finale.… “Chuck” streams on Prime Video.</p>

<p><strong>•&nbsp;“Saturday Night Live,” Season 39, Feb. 2, 2014.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Not an entire episode, but one of our favorite jabs at buying crappy, last-minute gifts. A succession of men traipse down the aisles of a drugstore, picking up the kind of Valentine’s presents that would appeal to a 9-year-old girl. Maybe.</p>
<p>Cast member Cecily Strong, who is so good at imitating commercial voice overs, suggests getting your significant other&nbsp;“some dumb little thing from CVS,&nbsp;‘cause you’re already [there] getting toilet paper.”</p>

<p><strong>• “Bob’s Burgers,”&nbsp;“V is for Valentine-detta.”&nbsp; Season 8, episode 8.</strong></p>
<p>With Valentine’s Day approaching, Tina is having a meltdown: Jimmy Junior has a date with another girl! Meanwhile Linda and Bob have a special Kissing Coupon event date, a ride in a bright pink limo. Instead, Linda takes the girls out for makeovers to cheer up Tina, so Bob and Gene end up at a trapeze park for a father-son date.</p>
<p>The episode features one of Louise’s best sight gags ever when she reveals her makeup inspiration: nightmares. And then the girls are off to sabotage Jimmy Junior’s date…</p>
