<h1>Pet Tales: The brave and bold outrider horses at the Meadows Racetrack</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wingnut Dinger, a 3-year-old Standardbred horse, was on a truck with other horses headed to Amish country, where they would work pulling buggies. Missy Rothfuss saw something she liked in him back in the fall of 2017, and convinced her husband, trainer Jim Rothfuss, to buy him and school him as a racing trotter.</p>
<p>At the family farm in Houston, Washington County, Mrs. Rothfuss found even more to like.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Wingnut’s not much bigger than a pony, but he is mighty,” she said in a telephone interview.&nbsp;“He is not a hot horse. He is agile and athletic and he is brave. He’s not afraid of anything.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wingnut, 6, is still trotting and competing in harness racing. He has six career wins with purses totaling $41,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, Mrs. Rothfuss decided Wingnut has what it takes to do a tough job that most horses could not handle.&nbsp; For 24 years, Mrs. Rothfuss, 42, has been an outrider at the Meadows Racetrack in North Strabane. She’s teaching Wingnut to chase runaway horses at the racetrack, something she already does with Salem, 25, a black Standardbred/quarter horse cross, and Dude, 15, a palomino.</p>
<p>It takes a bold horse and a fearless rider to do that job, according to racing drivers and other track personnel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the start of each race, Mrs. Rothfuss and one her horses lead the trotters or pacers out onto the track. Dude looks especially flashy doing this, as his coat is bright gold and his mane and tail are silvery white.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the race starts, the outrider walks or trots her horse around the track, well behind the racehorses.&nbsp;The outrider’s real job begins when a horse gets loose for any reason. It’s the outrider’s job to chase, catch and stop the horse. This only happens several times a year, but a loose horse is a danger to itself, the other horses and the drivers.</p>
<p>“We’re running 30-35 miles per hour when we chase,” Mrs. Rothfuss said.</p>
<p>It’s dangerous to approach a loose horse, which is usually very frightened. Once they’re close, Mrs. Rothfuss reaches down and grabs the bridle. They begin to slow the loose horse down to a walk then a stop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How does a horse get loose? Sometimes a rein or other piece of equipment breaks, and the horse runs away with the driver, who then has no control over the horse. On at least one occasion, a young, skittish horse dumped a driver out of the two-wheeled cart that harness racers call a bike.</p>
<p>Salem has been outriding since he was 3 years old, and 22 years later he’s&nbsp; still good at his job.&nbsp; With proper care, horses can be healthy, sound and rideable in their 20s, but it’s unusual for a 25-year-old horse to regularly work at such a physically demanding job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Every year with Salem is a blessing.&nbsp;He loves to work,” Mrs. Rothfuss said.</p>
<p>When the racetrack was closed March 16 to June 15 due to the coronavirus pandemic,&nbsp;“Salem was bored.” He expressed his unhappiness by crawling under the fence to escape from the pasture of his family farm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dude, the palomino, was rescued from a “kill pen” by Mrs. Rothfuss in 2015.&nbsp; She paid $500, the price that would have been paid by people who would have bought him for slaughter.</p>
<p>Salem and Dude take turns as outriders; Mrs. Rothfuss said ideally she would like to have four horses for outriding.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rothfuss has been rescuing horses since she was a student at Chartiers-Houston High School. She buys horses, some of them former racers, rides them, trains them and sells them to people who will provide good homes. Each horse is different. She trains them to be trail-riding pleasure horses or show horses. Standardbreds bred for harness racing are easy to train to be riding horses, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She always has at least one horse in training, and some years has rescued and trained up to 10 horses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rothfuss is the third generation of a family involved in racing at the Meadows. Many of her relatives are horse trainers. Her daughter, Shaunna Morris, 20, is a backup outrider at the Meadows and helps train Dude, Wingnut and other horses.</p>
<p>Wingnut is in the early stages of outrider training. The first step was teaching him to be a riding horse. He never bucked or reared when he was saddled and ridden. Mrs. Rothfuss and her daughter ride him around the track and are teaching him to “pony” other horses, walking&nbsp;side by side.</p>
<p>Though the trotters and pacers are racing at the Meadows on Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Saturdays, spectators are not allowed in the stands due to COVID-19 concerns.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The many people who care for the horses in the paddocks and barns are required to wear masks. Drivers are not required to wear masks because they are at least 6 feet apart while racing.&nbsp;</p>
