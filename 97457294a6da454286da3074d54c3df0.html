<h1>About 500 Pittsburgh Public Schools teachers, staff march to protest George Floyd's death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About 500 Pittsburgh educators marched peacefully Monday, walking two miles from Sterrett Classical Academy in Point Breeze to Colfax Elementary in Squirrel Hill, to protest the Memorial Day police killing of George Floyd, a black unarmed Minneapolis man.</p>
<p>Organized by Tamara Saunders-Woods, principal of Colfax, and MiChele Holly, principal of Sterrett, the march began at 8:46 a.m.</p>
<p>The start time reflected the amount of time — 8 minutes and 46 seconds — that Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, kept his knee on the neck of George Floyd, a black unarmed man who died while handcuffed and face down in the street. All four officers involved in his arrest were fired and face felony charges in connection with his death.</p>
<p>"We should not have to see a man murdered on film to be outraged," Ms. Woods told the demonstrators. "Every week we turn around and there's another murder and no accountability."</p>
<p>After urging the protesters to vote and stand up to racism, Ms. Wilson told them, "Do your part. That is all we are asking."</p>
<p>The march concluded with 8 minutes and 46 seconds of silence to memorialize Mr. Floyd. Some protesters held burning candles to symbolize their hope to end racism; others bowed their heads and kneeled.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>Correction, made at 1:45 p.m. June 8:</strong> The principal at Pittsburgh Sterrett is MiChele Holly. Her name was misspelled in an earlier version of this story.</em>&nbsp;</p>
