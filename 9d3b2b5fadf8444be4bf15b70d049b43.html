<h1>Steelers facility to close Friday in observance of Juneteenth</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers will close their facility on the South Side on Friday in observance of Juneteenth.</p>
<p>The NFL offices in New York and some other teams across the league also will close their doors in observance of the holiday. The Browns and Falcons are among teams closing Friday, according to reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On June 19, 1865, Union soldiers landed in Galveston, Texas, with news that the Civil War had ended and all slaves were free.</p>
<p>“This year, as we work together as a family and in our communities to combat the racial injustices that remain deeply rooted into the fabric of our society, the NFL will observe Juneteenth on Friday, June 19th, as a recognized holiday and our league offices will be closed,” NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a statement. “It is a day to reflect on our past, but more importantly, consider how each one of us can continue to show up and band together to work toward a better future.”</p>
<p>The NFL announced Friday it was pledging $250 million over the next 10 years to “combat systemic racism” in the wake of protests across the country following the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>The Steelers have discussed ways to help bring positivity to the issues facing the country. Cornerback Steven Nelson said a couple of weeks ago that speaking out against racism and police brutality is something he and other Steelers plan to do.</p>
<p>“That’s the good thing about being a professional athlete,” Nelson said. “We have big platforms to speak out for the people, voice our opinion and thoughts, and just try to create change as best we can. A lot of guys have big followings on social media. That’s a great start to try and spread positivity and love throughout our country because God knows we all need it right now.”</p>
