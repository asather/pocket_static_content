<h1>Mike Tomlin on Ben Roethlisberger, COVID-19 protocols and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin still hasn’t seen Ben Roethlisberger throw in person, but based on discussions with his quarterback and everything he has been told he expects Roethlisberger to be a “fluid participant” when the players finally get on the practice field for training camp.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger had planned to get on the field and throw Wednesday at Heinz Field, but Tomlin said the team decided against it. That, though, has nothing to do with what the Steelers expect when the 16-year veteran quarterback and his teammates have their first padded practice Aug. 17.</p>
<p>“He’s been throwing and that throwing has been going well,” Tomlin said Thursday in a Zoom call with Pittsburgh-area media members. “We don’t have any reservations about him being a fluid participant in this process.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger will not have the benefit of testing his arm or knocking off some rust in a game before the Steelers open their season Sept. 14 against the New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J. Preseason games have been canceled by the league, though it is unlikely Roethlisberger would have appeared in any of those games anyway.</p>
<p>But the lack of preseason games not only hurts the team’s ability to evaluate players; it raises concerns about the physical readiness of players to jump right into a regular season — not to mention an increased incidence of injuries.</p>
<p>“I’ve been in the league for 20 years, and I’ve never been in a situation like this where we’re going into it without the opportunity to have preseason games,” Tomlin said, his first public comments since the league canceled the preseason. “I feel like I have an understanding of the issues and what’s required in order for [the players] to be ready, but all of us collectively are going to be feeling our way to some degree and possibly have issues get revealed to us along the way.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said it’s important that every player in training camp understands the importance of adhering to the protocols put in place by the NFL because of the COVID-19 pandemic, especially the 25 to 30 players who won’t be on the roster when the regular season is scheduled to begin in six weeks.</p>
<p>Tomlin said players who don’t adhere to the policies will be considered to have performed “conduct detrimental” to the team.</p>
<p>“In this COVID-19 environment, if you’re not using discretion and being thoughtful how you move, that conduct is detrimental to your cause and ours,” Tomlin said. “We have to conduct ourselves accordingly. It’s been a lot of work to position ourselves where we are right now. It’s one fail, all fail, in this environment, so we’ll continue to package our message in that way. It’s conduct detrimental to their efforts and ours.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said he hasn’t spent a lot of time wondering if any of his players will decide to opt-out of the 2020 season because of concerns about the pandemic. As of right now, no Steelers player has indicted they plan to do so.</p>
<p>But at least 20 NFL players, including six from the New England Patriots, have already done so, either out of immediate medical-related concerns or just safety. The deadline for players to make that decision will be seven days after the agreement between the league and players union will be finalized, according to league spokesman Michael Signora.</p>
<p>“It’s very much a part of these circumstances that people have to make individual decisions,” Tomlin said. “If and when they come up, we’ll deal with them appropriately.”</p>
<p><strong>We’ll do it live</strong></p>
<p>Like all NFL teams, the Steelers will have only 14 padded practices to get ready for the start of the regular season. Those practices cannot begin until Aug. 17, which means Tomlin and his staff can average three padded sessions a week before their first game.</p>
<p>Without preseason games to properly evaluate his young players or determine position battles, Tomlin indicated there will be an increased emphasis on live action — more so than in a normal training camp — once those padded practices can begin.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve done that in the past and probably even more so in this environment for obvious reason, not having an opportunity to get preseason games and such,” Tomlin said Thursday. “We want to have an understanding of what we are going to get from people as we go into New York in the opener. The only way to do that is to put that ball on the ground, spot it and play football, so that is what the intent is.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Tomlin will want to use those sessions to get his veteran players acclimated to physical contacts, it will likely be more important for him to evaluate his young players, particularly top draft choices such as Chase Claypool and outside linebacker Alex Highsmith, in those season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You know, the live opportunities and looks, are really framed by the collective bargaining,” Tomlin said. “In this environment, we all have parameters. If we’re smart, we’re going to utilize those padded practices to evaluate. We’re going to utilize those padded practices to teach, to get to know people. Live action is just a part of that.”</p>
