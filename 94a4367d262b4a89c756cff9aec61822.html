<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>South Allegheny had not won a WPIAL playoff game in recent memory. The Gladiators made sure that Friday’s victory was memorable.</p>
<p>Bryce Epps dropped in a pair of free throws with 19 seconds remaining to lift No. 3 seed South Allegheny (22-1) to a 48-46 triumph against Avonworth in the first round of the WPIAL Class 3A playoffs. It was just the fourth district playoff victory in school history. The Gladiators last won a postseason game in 2001, with wins in 1997 and 1995 before that.</p>
<p>Epps, a freshman, scored all of his 7 points in the final four minutes, accounting for 7 of the Gladiators’ final 8 points. He knocked down a 3-pointer that put South Allegheny ahead, 43-40, and scored again to make it 45-42.</p>
<p>The Antelopes (11-12) had a couple of chances to tie or win the game as time ran down. Deon Thomas’ 3-point attempt rimmed out with five seconds left. Jordan Kolenda’s attempt to tip in the rebound also missed before the Gladiators corralled the rebound and the buzzer sounded.</p>
<p>Antonio Epps scored 15 points in the first half and finished with 18 to lead South Allegheny. Avonworth’s Kolenda led all scorers with 22 points.</p>
