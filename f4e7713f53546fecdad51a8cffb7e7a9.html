<p>BAGHDAD — Tens of thousands of Iraqis marched Friday at the urging of popular Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr, decrying U.S. influence in the country and demanding that Washington withdraw its troops.</p>
<p>Around Baghdad’s Hurriyah Square, the streets were a sea of black, white and red, as protesters clutched Iraqi flags and wore shrouds around their shoulders. Iraq’s government is under growing pressure to expel foreign troops after a U.S. drone strike killed Iran’s most powerful military commander on Iraqi soil, inflaming regional tensions and leaving Baghdad’s politicians fuming.</p>
<p>At the march Friday, loudspeakers denounced U.S. troops as occupiers. Posters depicted President Donald Trump hanging from a noose. The anthems of Mr. Sadr’s yearslong militancy against U.S. forces blared.</p>
<p>But the march itself was both disciplined and short, a set piece that made its point vociferously but dispelled fears of violent confrontation. Despite supporting Friday’s so-called “million-strong” march, the Iranian-backed militias that have clashed with U.S. troops here had no obvious presence, and the tone of the day was strictly nationalist.</p>
<p>“Americans came to our country talking of freedom and democracy,” Qayser al-Saad, 23, of Baghdad’s Sadr City, said as he clutched at his sleeves on a bitterly cold day. “Today we’re asking them to leave so we can have just that. It won’t happen in a homeland occupied by foreigners.”</p>
<p>After a period of relative stability, Iraq has been roiled by unrest since the fall. Anti-government protesters have repeatedly clashed with security forces, and more than 500 people have been killed, most of them young, unarmed men. The unrest has toppled a government and won mild electoral changes. But as protesters ramp up pressure for meaningful change, riot police have fired bullets into crowds and launched tear gas canisters heavy enough to smash skulls.</p>
<p>The monthslong protests are leaderless, as activists reject the control of what they see as a corrupted political system. They, too, have demanded an end to foreign interference in Iraq’s politics, decrying U.S. and Iranian influence in equal measure as they watch brinkmanship between the two inflame proxy battles here.</p>
<p>“We don’t want any of them. We don’t,” Abbas Ali, a 31-year-old grocer, said in Tahrir Square on Thursday night. “It’s not just about foreign troops. America built the system we’re living in, and it’s left us with no future. Iran has treated this country like its backyard. We want all of them out.”</p>
<p>Iran-linked militias, which operate alongside Iraq’s conventional forces, have repeatedly attacked protesters in Tahrir Square and southern cities, forcing many to leave their sit-ins and sowing fear among those who stay.</p>
<p>Many of the young demonstrators at Tahrir had been wary of Friday’s anti-U.S. march, fearing that it might blunt their momentum and boost factions that were already empowered in the wake of the killing of Gen. Qassem Soleimani, commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force.</p>
<p>In response, Mr. Sadr, a pragmatic operator who has supported the anti-government protests, made clear that the two gatherings should not meet. Participants were bused from across Baghdad and the south to join his march, and a separate site was identified for them to rally before Friday prayers.</p>
