<h1>Pirates rally behind scout Jessie Nava in COVID-19 battle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you know anything about baseball scouts, it’s that they stick together and look after their own.</p>
<p>That’s currently playing out with a Pirates scout who contracted the coronavirus and needs help paying medical bills and supporting his young family.</p>
<p>Jessie Nava, 33, contracted COVID-19 in Venezuela. A GoFundMe page was set up Wednesday, and by 2:30 p.m. Thursday, it had raised $3,664 of a $5,000 goal — nearly 75%.</p>
<p>Upon learning of Nava’s situation, the Pirates made what vice president of communications and broadcasting Brian Warecki described as a “sizable” contribution.</p>
<p>“Supporting employees and their families in need is something we do really well and take great pride in, but it is the last thing we proactively promote,” Warecki said. “Just like in the past when tragedy has struck those in our organization, we work to ensure they and their families are supported through continued salary payments, medical coverage and monetary support, among a host of other things."</p>
<p>Typical policy for international scouts is for the team to reimburse for their medical policy. The Pirates then took things a couple steps beyond.</p>
<p>"We gave a sizable support contribution to his family as soon as we found out," Warecki said. "In addition, we have also coordinated with MLB on behalf of the family to obtain a sizable show of support from the programs that are available through MLB.”</p>

<p>Nava was a right-handed pitcher in the Seattle Mariners’ system. His last season was 2011, when he went 2-4 with a 3.28 ERA as a reliever with Class A Clinton. The Pirates hired him in mid-2018, Warecki said.</p>
<p><strong>Jones signs</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates on Thursday finalized a contract with second-round draft pick Jared Jones, inking the right-handed pitcher from La Mirada High School to an above-slot bonus of $2.2 million, according to MLB.com’s Jim Callis.</p>
<p>The slot value for the 44th overall pick (where Jones was drafted) is $1,689,500, meaning the Pirates provided Jones with enough financial incentive to skip college.</p>
<p>This was somewhat expected, too, as the Pirates employed a draft strategy that included saving some money in the later rounds to ensure they could exceed slot and convince Jones to sign.</p>
<p><strong>Kingham released</strong></p>
<p>It’s been a rough go for Nick Kingham in the Korea Baseball Organization, and on Thursday, the SK Wyverns released the former Pirates pitcher.</p>
<p>Kingham made just two starts before he incurred elbow problems, allowing eight earned runs in 10 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>The right-hander signed with the Wyverns back in November, looking to revive his career after the Pirates designated him for assignment last season.</p>
