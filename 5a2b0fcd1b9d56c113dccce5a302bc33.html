<h1>Paul H. O'Neill, former Treasury Secretary and Alcoa giant, dies at 84</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Disarmingly blunt, quirky, outspoken, aluminum industry giant Paul H. O’Neill died Saturday morning at his Shadyside home.</p>
<p>He died of complications from lung cancer, said his son, Paul Jr., of Sewickley. He was 84.</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill’s 13-year career at Pittsburgh-based Alcoa Corp. became the stuff of legends after he made zero workplace injuries a company mantra. Safety was part of a broader goal that Mr. O’Neill called “habitual excellence,” which later manifested into a passion for eliminating hospital-acquired infections.</p>
<p>In June 2019, Mr. O’Neill was honored for his service to the nation with the Gerald R. Ford Medal for Distinguished Public Service.</p>
<p>“Paul has devoted his life to service to the American people with his long-serving public service positions and dedication to making a difference,” Mike Ford, chairman of the Gerald R. Ford Presidential Foundation and son of the former president said at the time.</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill was born Dec. 4,1935 in St. Louis, Mo., and served as Treasury secretary under President George H. W. Bush for 11 months until December 2002 when he was fired over policy differences. He was replaced by former CSX Corp. executive John Snow.</p>
<p>In his 2004 memoir, “The Price of Loyalty,” which was written by Pulitzer prize-winning journalist Ron Suskind, Mr. O’Neill said President Bush led cabinet meetings “like a blind man in a roomful of deaf people. There is no discernible connection.”</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill didn’t hesitate to speak his mind when he felt like it would make a difference, whether it was speaking out against the Iraq War or the leadership of UPMC. “He didn’t mind calling people out — he wasn’t uncomfortable,” said his son. “That’s something we are going to miss as a community. There are a lot of people who want to be players but don’t use their authority the way they could.”</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill received a bachelor’s degree in economics from California State University, Fresno and a master’s degree in public administration from Indiana University. He met his wife Nancy Jo at Anchorage High School, from which they both graduated in 1954.</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill worked during the Johnson, Nixon and Ford administrations as a computer systems analyst and as deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget. He left the government to join International Paper in New York City in 1977, where he served as president from 1985 to 1987. He was chairman and CEO of Alcoa from 1987 to 1999 and retired as chairman at the end of 2000.</p>
<p>Alcoa’s market value increased to $27.53 billion in 2000 from $3 billion in 1986, while net income increased to $1.48 billion from $200 million during the same period.</p>
<p>During Mr. O’Neill’s 13-year tenure at Alcoa, the number of lost work days per 100 employees fell to 0.2 from 1.86. The statistics refers to days lost due to workplace injury or illness.</p>
<p>With Jewish Healthcare Foundation President and CEO Karen Wolk Feinstein, Mr. O’Neill co-founded the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative as a way to press doctors and hospitals into ending infections that patients pick up in hospitals. Using Toyota’s team approach to manufacturing, the effort paid off handsomely.</p>
<p>In a 2006 study published in the Joint Commission Journal on Quality and Patient Safety, Mr. O’Neill and a hospital group led by physician Richard Shannon showed that a team-based approach to reducing bloodstream infections in an Allegheny General Hospital intensive care unit had lowered infections from 49 to six in a year and cut the number of deaths to one from 19.</p>
<p>Between 2003 and 2005, Dr. Shannon estimated that the AGH system had saved about $2.2 million in health care costs by reducing infections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill helped launch the Pittsburgh Regional Healthcare Initiative when he was still chairman of Alcoa and he rejoined the group after leaving his job as President Bush’s Treasury secretary at the end of 2002.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill served as a trustee of Pittsburgh-based health system UPMC from 2003 until September 2004. He was said to have clashed with CEO Jeffrey Romoff, but Mr. O’Neill said his main reason for leaving the board was UPMC’s refusal in early 2004 to join one of the healthcare initiative’s programs, which would’ve have committed hospitals to eliminating all medication errors.</p>
<p>The ill will between Mr. O’Neill and UPMC would fester until last year when he and former PNC Bank CEO Jim Rohr challenged UPMC trustees to individually express support for the&nbsp;the institution’s plan to restrict access to some UPMC hospitals and doctors for people with Highmark health insurance. UPMC and Highmark later reached an agreement that allowed some members to use UPMC facilities, depending on their Highmark coverage and making co-payments.</p>
<p>Mr. O’Neill also had an egalitarian streak and a touch for the common man. In his 2004 memoir, he wrote that a CEO should be judged by how be treats “whoever is at the very bottom.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not long after he took over at Alcoa, he pressed the Laurel Valley Golf Club near Ligonier to promote an open admissions policy, which would allow anybody —&nbsp;regardless of race or ethnicity to join — before he would allow Alcoa executives to remain as members.&nbsp;And in 2002, as Treasury secretary, Mr. O’Neill joined rock star Bono on a tour of Africa for an up close view of poverty.</p>
<p>He disliked Alcoa’s imposing Downtown headquarters with “all these god-awful offices,” including the CEO suite at the end of a long hallway on the 30th floor. “So if you weren’t already intimidated, you would be by the time you got there,” he said in a 2014 Post-Gazette interview.</p>
<p>Alcoa later moved its headquarters to the North Shore, in a building that had an open office plan, and Mr. O’Neill’s office was in the middle of the floor. His office had the same 81 square feet of space as all the other offices.</p>
<p>A 2004 profile that appeared in the Guardian newspaper called him a “successful troublemaker.” In his memoir, Mr. O’Neill recalled something that a subordinate told him years earlier: “Paul, you have the [spine] of a daylight burglar.”</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife of 65 years, Nancy, his son Paul Jr., of Sewickley, his daughter Patti, of Fairfax, Va., his daughter Margaret, of New Hampshire, his daughter Julie, of Sewickley, 12 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Funeral services will take place at a later date.</p>
