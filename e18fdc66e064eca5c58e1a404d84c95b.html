<h1>Glenn Cannon, whose 40-year public safety career spanned Pittsburgh to PEMA, has died</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Glenn M. Cannon, a former Pittsburgh public safety director whose 40-year career in emergency management stretched from Grant Street to Harrisburg and touched upon every level of government, has died.</p>
<p>Chris Togneri, the city’s public safety spokesman, said that Mr. Cannon died Monday and was 72.</p>
<p>A news release carried numerous plaudits for Mr. Cannon’s life work in public safety, which began in 1975 when then-Mayor Pete Flaherty named him to oversee the forerunner to the city’s Emergency Medical Services department.</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon, who had a law degree, served as Pittsburgh’s public safety director from 1986 to 1992 under the city’s mayors at the time, Richard Caliguiri and Sophie Masloff.&nbsp;From there, he worked in emergency management at the county, state and federal levels and ran the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency from 2011 to 2015.</p>
<p>“He was a great public safety director, very hands on and very active,” Pittsburgh police Chief Scott Schubert said Monday morning, as he headed into a meeting.&nbsp;“Always the consummate professional, always there to teach and mentor. I’d see him at events in Pittsburgh. He was always a first-rate class-act person who loved Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>“Few people in the history of our city can match Mr. Cannon in terms of contributions to Pittsburgh and Public Safety,” Wendell Hissrich, the city’s public safety director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“He was an extraordinary man who lived an exemplary life. His legacy lives on today as the creator and first leader of the city’s EMS department, and in countless other ways. This is a great loss. Glenn Cannon was a great man and a great Pittsburgher.”</p>
<p>Mr. Cannon — termed a&nbsp;“visionary” by Emergency Medical Services Chief Ron Romano, whom he hired in 1978 —&nbsp;is credited with creating the city’s first River Rescue unit, its first Specialized Rescue units and the first Hazardous Materials Response Team.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich worked as a medic under Mr. Cannon.</p>
<p>“I personally witnessed his leadership at the Bloomfield Train Derailment in 1987 and the Ashland Oil Spill in 1988 while I was assigned to EMS's Rescue Division as a paramedic,” Mr. Hissrich recalled. “I saw firsthand how he was able to gain control of chaotic situations and ensure that first responders were able to do their jobs effectively.”</p>
<p>The city said that Mr. Cannon had degrees from&nbsp;Indiana University of Pennsylvania, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University. He was a partner in the law firm of Kennedy, Cannon &amp; DeVinney and an adjunct faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>No information was immediately available about funeral arrangements.</p>
