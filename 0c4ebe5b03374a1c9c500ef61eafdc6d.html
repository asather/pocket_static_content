<p><strong>MUSIC</strong></p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>• Singer-songwriter <strong>Jon Bindley</strong> has canceled his appearance at the family-friendly St. Patrick’s Day event at the Arcade Comedy Theater. “Sorry to let anyone down,” he said. “Thinking of our fellow friends and neighbors with compromised immune systems.

So, while we all deal with the effects of coronavirus (Covid-19) we will be rescheduling our remaining Bob Weir and Wolf Bros headline dates.&nbsp;Thank you for your continued support, the audiences have been incredible on this tour, the shows have been the kinda stuff we live for and we can’t wait to get back out there with you.&nbsp;In the meantime, be good to yourselves — and to each other — and please take preventative actions as recommended by the CDC and WHO.”</p>
<p><strong>March 23</strong></p>
<p>• <strong>Postmodern Jukebox</strong> canceled its tour, including the show at Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall. The band wrote an open letter to fans saying, in part,&nbsp;“"All of us at Postmodern Jukebox are heartbroken by this turn of events, but we know this is just a bump in the road in our mission to bring great music and great talent around the world, as it has been for the past seven years.”</p>

<p><strong>April 15</strong></p>
<p>• LA electronic band&nbsp;<strong>The Glitch Mob</strong> canceled the tour that was to hit the Roxian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>THEATER</strong></p>
<p><strong>April 2</strong></p>
<p>• The University of Pittsburgh's production of <strong>"Head Over Heels,"</strong> the recent Broadway musical featuring the music of the Go-Go's, is postponed. It had been scheduled to open April 2. Rights have been secured to perform the show in the fall, with the dates TBA.</p>
<p><strong>ELSEWHERE</strong></p>
<p>• The pandemic is also impacting Pittsburgh artists on the road. Grammy-winning country duo <strong>Dan + Shay</strong>, featuring Pittsburgh native Dam Smyers, were set to launch THE (ARENA) TOUR when the show Thursday at Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia was canceled by the venue. Dan + Shay decided to postpone the tour, which will still hit Pittsburgh on Sept. 26. The country duo wrote to fans:</p>
<p>“Well, here we are. March 12, 2020, sitting in a bus parked outside Wells Fargo Center, making a statement we never thought we’d have to make. After the mandatory postponement of our Philadelphia show, and several others in the coming weeks, we have made the collective decision (with our team and health officials) to postpone the spring leg of THE (ARENA) TOUR. These shows mean the world to us, and it was important that they be postponed and not canceled, but more than the shows, our fans mean the world to us, and protecting their safety is the number one priority. We want the shows to be memorable, and not experienced with fear.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for your patience and understanding. It is a strange, strange time for all of us, but we felt this was the right thing to do. Previously purchased tickets will be honored at all rescheduled dates. We hope everyone can make it. Keep an eye on venue websites for further information and updates. Stay safe out there.&nbsp;So much love,&nbsp;Dan + Shay”</p>
