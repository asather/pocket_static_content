<h1>How MLB and the Pirates might change in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Derek Shelton’s former team did something last season that spoke to the current state of baseball, as the Minnesota Twins mashed an MLB-record 307 home runs en route to a 23-win improvement that helped them win the AL Central.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Shelton’s new club could potentially spin the clock in the other direction.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">As the Pirates must figure out how to improve an offense that lost Starling Marte after finishing 11th out of 15 teams in the National League in runs (758) and next-to-last in homers (163), they likely won’t do it by swinging out of their shoes.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">If the Pirates are going to compete and potentially improve upon their .426 winning percentage from a season ago, they’ll have to get a little creative while figuring out ways to jump-start an attack that’s light on power.</span></p>
<p>Part of that strategy could and should involve being more aggressive on the bases. The Pirates, under former manager Clint Hurdle, were 10th in stolen base attempts at 93. Their success rate of 68.8% ranked ninth among NL clubs.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But with a shortened season — along with the free-agent signing of center fielder Jarrod Dyson (30 or more steals five times) — Shelton thinks the stolen base will likely be more of a factor for the Pirates, assuming they’re able to do it well.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Shelton said that new first-base coach Tarrik Brock, who oversees the Pirates’ running game, has spent the quarantine time as well as the first couple days of summer camp emphasizing the importance of getting good reads and knowing when someone might be able to swipe an extra base.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I definitely think you’re going to see the stolen base come into play a little bit more,” Shelton said.</span></p>
<p>The Pirates should want to run more because they have the guys to do it. Kevin Newman, who will most likely lead off on opening day, swiped 16 bases in 2019 and has the quick-twitch muscles and reactions to run more. The issue with Newman might be chance-taking, as he was also caught eight times. Only eight across MLB fared worse.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Dyson is a veteran and knows what he’s doing, and Bryan Reynolds should be attempting a stolen base more than once every 27 games, which is about the rate at which he went in 2019.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Adam Frazier is another player who, with a little coaching and encouragement, should be able to improve upon his stolen-base total from a season ago (five).</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We’re not really the big home run-hitting team, so we kind of wanted to do that last year, as far as putting some guys in motion, being aggressive on the base paths and stuff like that,” Frazier said. “Hopefully, this year, our game plan itself is paying attention to the details on the bases and working on stuff like that. I think we’ll implement that.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">How much of a small-ball approach other major league teams implement should be interesting to watch. Big boppers like the Twins, Yankees, Astros or Dodgers will keep doing what they do — relying on their best bats to put the ball over the fence.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But what about the others? If they’re slumping, will they hold out hope that the homers will come, or will they try and affect change by taking more of an old-school approach?</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Traditional baseball fans could see such things as-well executed hit-and-runs, situational at-bats and effective bunting. Meanwhile, those same people might also have to explain that stuff to the younger generation that’s more accustomed to home runs and strikeouts.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Honestly, the bunting thing is interesting to me because my initial thought on it was, ‘No,’” said Shelton, who inherited a team that finished fourth in the NL in sacrifice hits in 2019 with 47. “But the more that we’ve started to look at it and research it and talk to different people, you may see it.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“A lot of people thought because there was no National League game — with the pitcher not hitting — that the bunting was going to go away. But I think you’re going to see it’s going to be a little bit more prevalent because runs are going to be at a premium. Certain teams are going to play for runs.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">They’re also going to play to prevent them, which is going to change things on the defensive side of the ball. Shelton could conceivably stay with a starting pitcher longer because he doesn’t have to worry about that guy making 30 or 35 starts.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">At the same time, managers can’t afford to let the game go sideways. If a pitcher doesn’t have his best stuff, has danced between raindrops and finds himself with the bases loaded in the fourth inning, that very well may be it. Figure the rest out later.</span></p>
<p>Fans of the recent bullpen takeover might not love that approach, but you can’t always get what you want. Any frustration should also be mitigated by something else that Shelton said he expects to see: fewer Sunday lineups.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Managing over 162 games, Hurdle would infuriate fans when it seemed like he was punting on every Sunday afternoon game. But given the shorter season and the fact that every game means more, don’t expect Shelton to get overly concerned with these, outside of potentially rotating guys in and out of the designated hitter spot.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I think you are going to see less of that,” Shelton said of Sunday lineups. “I think you’re going to see more matchup situations right from the get-go, where you’re playing the guys that you feel are going to attack that starting pitcher that day.”</span></p>
