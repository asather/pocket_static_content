<h1>Terry Bradshaw has high praise for Ben Roethlisberger. But Tom Brady...</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Terry Bradshaw has never been afraid to speak his mind, and he let out a few of his patented truth bombs in a Thursday interview with Post-Gazette columnists Ron Cook and Joe Starkey on 93.7 The Fan.</p>
<p>The four-time Super Bowl champion was asked who the greatest quarterback in Steelers history was. He first joked that the answer had to be Bobby Layne — a Steeler from 1958-62 who won three (pre-Super Bowl era) NFL championships with the Lions — before giving a sincere answer.</p>
<p>“I would give it to Ben [Roethlisberger],” Bradshaw said. “His numbers far exceed mine. I may have more Super Bowls, but he is a much better quarterback. I wasn’t bad in my era, but he’s big, strong, accurate, puts up monstrous numbers and he’s won two Super Bowls. I passed that baton to him gladly. I absolutely have no problem with that. He deserves that.”</p>

<p>Bradshaw did wonder, however, what the conversation would be like if he had played in a modern NFL offense.</p>
<p>“I don’t have a problem with Ben being better than me,” Bradshaw said. “I would defend myself by saying, let me be in this offense they’re running today, and that wasn’t the way it was when I played football.”</p>
<p>If you thought that Bradshaw take was hot, he was just warming up.</p>
<p>When asked if he believes that Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady — a phrase that will never feel entirely natural — is the greatest quarterback of all time, Bradshaw again was brutally honest.</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’s the greatest quarterback of all time,” Bradshaw said plainly. “It’s hard to say. He may be the best quarterback we’ve had in the last 30 years. Is he better than [Roger] Staubach? No. Is he better than Dan Fouts? No. Dan Marino? No. I’m talking talent-wise, when you put all of it together.</p>
<p>“Does he have more Super Bowls than anybody? Yes, therefore he’s the best. I absolutely have no problem saying it. If you’ve got the most Super Bowls, and he’s done it, you can be in there. But I don’t put anybody as the greatest of all time. I would never do that.”</p>
<p>He went on to say that he also doesn’t believer Brady is better than former 49ers quarterback Joe Montana and wasn’t even sure the six-time champ was more talented than Saints quarterback Drew Brees.&nbsp;Bradshaw also said he doesn’t love the “soap opera” that surrounded Brady’s departure from New England in March.</p>
<p>“He left because he wanted to prove something, and he wants to prove to everyone he can win without [Patriots coach] Bill Belichick,” Bradshaw said. “In between all that, you say all the wonderful things. ‘I know he respects me. He knows I like him. We get along great. But after 20 years, I’m leaving.’ You’ve got to be kidding me.”</p>
<p>Leaving a situation like what he had with the Patriots — no matter the nature of Brady’s relationship with Belichick — was not something Bradshaw would ever do.</p>
<p>“I never wanted to leave Pittsburgh, no matter what my relationship with [former Steelers coach] Chuck [Noll] was, which was a good working relationship,” he said. “It wasn’t always pleasant, I didn’t always like him. But I respected him and I knew that if I listened to him and learned from him and followed his direction that we would win. That’s all I cared about was winning.”</p>
