<h1>As national attention returns, Duquesne hopes to stay consistent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been a question since Duquesne started its season with a 10-game winning streak.</p>
<p><em>How do the Dukes deal with increased attention?</em></p>
<p>Well, if the immediate aftermath of that winning streak was evidence, the signs weren’t good. Duquesne lost its next two games to UAB and Marshall, ceding some attention momentarily.</p>
<p>But the Dukes have won their three games since then, and the attention has returned to a degree. On Friday, ESPN’s Joe Lunardi put out his most recent Bracketology projections, in which he attempts to predict the NCAA tournament field. For the first time since 2011, Duquesne made the cut, currently projected as a 12-seed taking on Michigan in the first round.</p>
<p>That placement is almost entirely because the Dukes (13-2, 3-0 A10) currently lead their conference, which can change in the blink of an eye, but it’s still some notoriety as a result of success.</p>
<p>“I think we can play with anybody on our schedule, and I think when the stakes get higher, we’ll show we can be a tough out against anybody,” coach Keith Dambrot said Friday.&nbsp;“The harder games in my mind are the games you talk about, games that people perceive we should win. Because a lot of it is matchups, how you match up, can they stop us inside? That’s gonna be the key. If people can’t stop us inside, we’re gonna win.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The next chance to answer all those questions will come Saturday, when Duquesne travels to Washington D.C., to take on George Washington (6-9, 0-2). It’s a game many believe the Dukes should win, fitting neatly into the category of matchup that Dambrot says he’s worried about.</p>
<p>To win that game, Dambrot also alluded to what may be a key. The Colonials are one of the best teams in the country at suppressing 3-point shooting, keeping their opponents at 27.6% on the season. Conversely, George Washington’s opponents have scored 63% of their points from two-point buckets, which is the fourth-highest rate in the country.</p>
<p>So, naturally, one would assume that Duquesne will play out of the post as much as possible, which it has done for most of the season. But Dambrot isn’t sure it will be quite so straightforward.</p>
<p>“There’s no doubt in my mind that they’ll double the post,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“So when you double the post, you have to be able to throw out of the post and shoot the 3 or throw back into the post. And so it’ll all be how we handle the doubling of the post, which we’ve improved, we’re pretty good. Now, this team’s a little more aggressive on their double team with the trap than Davidson and Saint Joe’s, so that means we have to be a little more precise, take a few little different cuts.”</p>
<p>Really, though, for Dambrot, games like Saturday’s come down to mental sharpness. He believes his team is physically tough enough to win a lot of games, but they need to be mentally in-tune to avoid let downs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those two facets, the mental and physical, need to be balanced. After their two-game losing streak, the Dukes worked harder in the gym, with intense, tough, conditioning-filled practices. This week, Duquesne got back from Philadelphia early Thursday morning after beating St. Joseph’s, didn’t practice Thursday and practiced for just 35 minutes Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s all in an effort to maintain a level of consistency that will push the Dukes to the next level, to prove they are worthy of some national attention.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, past Duquesne teams have started strong only to peter out when push came to shove.&nbsp;The 2019-20 squad is trying to shake that past and continue to break down walls for this program’s future.</p>
<p>“I’m a confident person, so I don’t think it’s the same ol’ Duquesne,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“I liked our first-year team. Our second-year team made strides. But I think this is a better team. Now can they finish the job? Can we be physically tough enough? Can we be mentally tough enough? Can we take the next step? How will the pressure affect us? This is a whole new ballgame for these guys.”</p>
