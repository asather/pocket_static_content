<h1>Lancaster task force focusing on abuse in Plain communities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In years past, when he presided over the sentences of Amish men convicted of child sexual abuse, Lancaster County Common Pleas Judge&nbsp;Dennis Reinaker said courtroom galleys were typically filled with men from the Amish community.</p>
<p>They were there, he said, in support of the defendant, motivated by the high value they place on forgiveness for a confessed offender.</p>
<p>“As a community, they are well known for forgiveness,” said Judge Reinaker, whose county is home to the world’s largest Amish settlement.&nbsp;“That’s fine,&nbsp;but there was never any support being shown to the victims. Their&nbsp;pressure was always to forgive and move on.”</p>
<p>The judge was struck, then, by the difference when he entered his courtroom on Jan. 24 to see it filled with a mixed group of spectators before he sentenced<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/24/Lancaster-County-Amish-David-Stoltzfus-Smucker-sentencing-sex-abuse/stories/202001240122" target="_blank">&nbsp;David Stoltzfus Smucker to&nbsp;38-76 years for sexually abusing four pre-teen girls.</a>&nbsp;While a group&nbsp;Amish men and women sat behind the defendant, the hearing also was attended by another group, mostly composed of women in modern dress, in a show of silent support for the victims.</p>
<p>“I sensed there was a change,”Judge Reinaker said.</p>
<p>That interest, plus an increased awareness of sexual abuse in Amish and related Plain religious communities, prompted him to join others in rebooting a task force to address the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He and others have formed the Plain Communities Task Force, which began having virtual meetings in March.&nbsp;It includes Lancaster-area medical workers, counselors and advocates for victims of sexual violence, many with ties to Plain communities.</p>
<p>“We want to be clear we’re not focusing on the Amish or the Plain communities because we think it [the abuse situation] is worse” than in the general population, said one of the organizers, Linda Crockett, director of Safe Communities in Lancaster, which provides education on preventing abuse and support for victims.&nbsp;“But there are specific cultural and religious barriers to prevention and to victims getting the help they need.”</p>
<p>While focused on the Lancaster County area, she hopes similar efforts take shape in other regions.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coverings/mennonite-amish-sexual-abuse-forgiveness-in-their-communities/" target="_blank">the Post-Gazette in its 2019 “Coverings” series</a>, survivors of abuse in Plain communities of Amish and Mennonites said church leaders often have instructed victims to reconcile with abusers if the latter professed repentance, which left them and other children vulnerable to further assaults. They said victims often have been shamed rather than provided with professional counseling.</p>
<p>Amish, conservative Mennonites and related groups often are known collectively as the Plain People for their simple dress and lifestyle, continuing a 500-year-old Christian tradition emphasizing piety and cultural separation. They reside in most states but are <a href="https://groups.etown.edu/amishstudies/statistics/statistics-population-2020/" target="_blank">most numerous in Pennsylvania and Ohio.</a></p>
<p>While they recognize the authority of civil government, they traditionally have treated sexual abuse as a sin to be dealt with through confession, forgiveness and church discipline rather than as a crime to be handled by the justice system.</p>
<p>In the Lancaster area, law-enforcement officials, child-welfare workers and Plain church leaders have improved&nbsp;<a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coverings/mennonites-amish-sexual-abuse-plain-coverings-lancaster-whispering-hope-intervention/" target="_blank">communication in recent years to facilitate the reporting of suspected abuse as mandated under state law</a>.</p>
<p>The new task force is aimed not at duplicating that work but in improving access to education about abuse and counseling for victims, Ms. Crockett said. One goal is to recruit licensed trauma counselors to undergo cultural sensitivity training to better treat victims from Plain communities.</p>
<p>“You need to have therapists that are trusted by the Amish and respect their religion,” Ms. Crockett said.&nbsp;“At the same time, they have to be equipped to work with the kind of trauma and betrayal that childhood sexual abuse represents.”</p>
<p>The task force includes people with a range of expertise, from counseling to health care to the legal system. It does not include leaders in the Plain communities, but the task force plans to communicate with them.</p>
<p>“We want to work with the bishops, but that can’t be the only points of access” of information to the Plain community, Ms. Crockett said.</p>
<p>Allen Hoover, a member of the Conservative Crisis Intervention Committee —&nbsp;comprised of Plain community leaders and serving as a liaison with law enforcement and child welfare officials —&nbsp;said he first learned of the task force through the news release.</p>
<p>“We’re puzzled by this, as it seems to be duplicating what is already being done” with education and getting help for victims, he said. “I feel we have already made a lot of progress in that area, but if they have something new to offer, we are glad to work with them.”</p>
<p>He said the Plain community leaders have had a good relationship with Judge Reinaker.&nbsp;“We feel if he’s heading it, it must be good,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>‘Farther along’</strong></p>
<p>Judge Reinaker first convened a task force about a decade ago after he presided in a case in which he suspected the Amish victims were pressured by their church leaders into seeking leniency for the perpetrators.&nbsp;“I was concerned that victims were not at all being treated in the ways society realized they needed to be treated,” he said.</p>
<p>The initial task force “made some inroads” but, he said, cooperation from Plain leaders was limited, and it disbanded after a few years.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we’ll be able to get farther along this time,” he said.</p>
<p>Miriam Esh of Lewisburg, Union County, who grew up Amish and who traveled to Lancaster to bear silent witness to the Smucker sentencing in January, said she was encouraged by the news of the task force.</p>
<p>“It seems we are making a noise without making a noise,” she said. The turnout was organized by the group Never Stand Alone, founded to provide a silent show of support for victims of abuse in Plain communities. Participants primarily are from Mennonite or Amish backgrounds but have since left those communities.</p>
<p>Hope Anne Dueck of the Ohio-based A Better Way, a non-profit group that does training and advocacy for abuse prevention in Plain communities and other settings, said she’s hopeful yet cautious about the task force. She said there have been past instances where Plain community leaders have assured civic leaders that they adequately responded to the issue when, for example, they often refered survivors and perpetrators to unlicensed counselors or residential centers.</p>
<p>“Having access to well-informed and professional counselors is vital to thorough healing for survivors and the community,” she said.</p>
