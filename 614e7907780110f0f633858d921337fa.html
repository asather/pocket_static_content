<h1>Celebrating 10 years of Art on the Walls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the challenges facing young and mid-career visual artists is finding a gallery l to show their work. The Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council first addressed that need in 2009 when it launched its Art on the Walls exhibition program.</p>
<p>The organization is marking the program’s first decade with an exhibition, “Past, Present, Future,” that debuts from 5:30 to 10 p.m. Friday&nbsp;during the quarterly Gallery Crawl in the Cultural District, Downtown.</p>
<p>After the Gallery Crawl, the exhibition will be open to the public by appointment at GPAC’s office, 810 Penn Ave., seventh floor, Downtown.</p>
<p>All past exhibiting artists were invited to participate in this show.&nbsp; The 34 artists who responded include Elizabeth Asche Douglas, Lori Hepner, Clayton Merrell, Jane Ogren, Suzie Sparks, Bill Wade and Jian Wang.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years, work by more than 140 artists has been exhibited, with sales of over $60,000.</p>
<p>Art on the Walls now includes six corporate locations; its goals are to connect businesses to the arts, cultivate new arts patrons and help businesses build lasting collections. The&nbsp;corporate offices include the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, which is hosting the 2020 exhibition and is the program’s longest-standing business client.</p>
<p>Eighteen artworks will be displayed there by local artists Seth Clark, Ashley A. Jones, atiya jones, Richard Kelly, Susan Palmisano and Staycee Pearl.</p>
