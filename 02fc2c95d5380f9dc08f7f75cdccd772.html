<p>SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea says it plans to provide coronavirus testing materials to the United States in response to President Donald Trump’s request for help.</p>
<p>Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of South Korea’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the country is willing to send chemical reagents used to extract genetic material during COVID-19 tests, but at a level that doesn’t affect its own testing capacity.</p>
<p>She didn’t provide a detailed estimate on the size of supplies that could be shipped to the United States.</p>

<p>The office of South Korean President Moon Jae-in earlier said Trump during a telephone conversation between the leaders asked whether South Korea could send medical equipment and supplies to help the United States cope with its outbreaks.</p>
<p>South Korea is pushing an aggressive test-and-quarantine program that some experts say possibly contributed to its lower death toll in comparison with mainland China and hard-hit European nations.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, South Korea had tested around 358,000 people while reporting 9,137 infections and 126 deaths.</p>
