<h1>Councilman Lavelle to introduce city chokehold ban; police say it's already banned</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilman Daniel Lavelle wants to legislate a ban on chokeholds, but city police say that neck restraints are already prohibited and can only be used as&nbsp;“a measure of last resort.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lavelle on Tuesday plans to introduce a bill to amend the city’s administrative code for the Department of Public Safety by adding a chokehold prohibition and a measure that allows a person the “right of action against the City of Pittsburgh for injuries proximately caused by violations” of the prohibition.</p>
<p>Councilman Ricky Burgess, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/06/09/Pittsburgh-City-Council-discussion-police-reform-black-lives-matter-protests-burgess/stories/202006090093" target="_blank">who in recent weeks introduced several police reform bills</a>, is a co-sponsor.</p>
<p>The proposed legislation specifically names “carotid restraint” and&nbsp;“neck restraint” as two methods it aims to ban.</p>
<p>It defines carotid restraint as&nbsp;“applying pressure&nbsp;to the carotid artery, jugular vein, or sides of the neck with the purpose, intent, or effect of controlling a subject’s movement or rendering a subject unconscious by constricting the flow of blood to and from the brain.”</p>
<p>It defines neck restraint as&nbsp;“applying pressure against the windpipe, or the frontal area of the neck with the purpose, intent, or effect of controlling a subject’s movement or rendering a subject unconscious by blocking the passage of air through the windpipe.”</p>
<p>The proposed ordinance comes as the nation has seen several high-profile choking incidents of Black men at the hands of police, including the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/29/Ex-police-officers-George-Floyd-killing-court-minneapolis-chauvin/stories/202006290062" target="_blank">death of George Floyd</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2015/07/18/Federal-charges-sought-in-Eric-Garner-s-chokehold-death/stories/201507180131?cid=search" target="_blank">Eric Garner</a>. Just days ago, an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/25/NYPD-officer-charged-in-swift-test-of-state-s-chokehold-ban/stories/202006250148" target="_blank">NYPD officer was charged</a> after cellphone video and his body camera revealed him using a chokehold maneuver on a man in Queens. The banning of chokeholds has become <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/27/House-passage-of-George-Floyd-bill-puts-eyes-on-Senate/stories/202006270037" target="_blank">a sticking point in Congress’ debate over police reform</a>.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police already are prohibited from using&nbsp;“neck restraints or similar control techniques ... unless involved in a deadly force encounter,” according to the Bureau of Police <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/files/police/orders/ch1/12-06-Use-of-Force.pdf" target="_blank">use-of-force policy</a>.</p>
<p>“It is not used in any standard arrest or situation where police are attempting to restrain a non-compliant subject,” said Cara Cruz, police spokeswoman.</p>
<p>Deadly force is called for when an officer “reasonably believes they're going to die and they would be incapable of using a firearm,” for example&nbsp;“a&nbsp;very close violent physical struggle,” said Robert Swartzwelder, president of the Fraternal Order of Police Fort Pitt Lodge 1.</p>
<p>"The neck restraints, chokeholds, et cetera, have been expressly prohibited by Pittsburgh police policy except in deadly force situations for over a decade, minimum,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lavelle said that he is aware that the policy exists but that the police manual has a “potential to be changed, whereas putting something into city code makes it more formal and official.”</p>
<p>Council will hold its regular meeting virtually at 10 a.m. Tuesday. Meetings can be watched live on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-YfIv9wvBjGT3LMxo9hLoQ" target="_blank">city’s YouTube channel</a>.</p>
