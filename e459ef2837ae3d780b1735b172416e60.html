<h1>Wells Fargo’s culture was ‘broken,’ new CEO tells lawmakers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Wells Fargo has suffered from a broken culture and failed leadership but can turn itself around, its new CEO told lawmakers Tuesday, in the bank’s latest pitch to emerge from years of scandal and controversy.</p>
<p>Charles Scharf is the third Wells Fargo chief executive in three years to try to convince Congress that he can turn around the troubled bank. Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., chair of the House Financial Services Committee, started the hearing by telling Mr. Scharf, who started in October, that the two CEOs who preceded him resigned shortly after testifying, eliciting laughs in the room.</p>
<p>“I wish you luck,” Ms. Waters said. “It is clear to this committee that the bank you inherited is essentially a lawless organization that has caused widespread harm to millions of consumers throughout the nation.”</p>
<p>Wells Fargo is an important financial institution that was badly managed but is undergoing a major overhaul, Mr. Scharf told the committee. “People can trust Wells Fargo to do the right thing,” he told the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharf’s efforts to rebuild the bank’s reputation became more difficult last week when the Financial Services Committee released a more than 100-page report that found the bank repeatedly failed to live up to regulators’ demands that it repay consumers and didn’t aggressively address its cultural problems, despite public promises. Two of the bank’s board members resigned Sunday after the report showed they had resisted becoming involved in addressing Wells Fargo’s problems.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Ms. Waters asked the Justice Department to investigate statements former Wells Fargo CEO Tim Sloan made to the committee last year, which the committee report called “inaccurate and misleading.”</p>
<p>“Because this matter involves a potential violation of a federal criminal statute, I am requesting that the DOJ review Mr. Sloan’s testimony,” Ms. Waters said in a letter to Attorney General William Barr. The Justice Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Sloan’s attorney, Josh Cohen, said in a statement: “The allegation that Tim Sloan provided inaccurate and misleading testimony to the House Financial Services Committee is completely unfounded. Mr. Sloan described the considerable efforts that Wells Fargo made under his leadership to comply with the consent orders and directives of regulators. His testimony to the Committee about those efforts was truthful and in good faith.”</p>
<p>Mr. Scharf told the committee that he found the details in the House report confirmed his conclusion that the bank had been poorly managed.</p>
<p>“These matters describe deeply disturbing conduct that is utterly unacceptable and has no place in our company,” he said.</p>
<p>The bank is being reorganized, and new leaders have been brought in, said Mr. Scharf, adding that he spends 75% to 80% of his time addressing Wells Fargo’s regulatory headaches rather than growing its business.</p>
<p>“Simply said, we had a flawed business model in how the company was managed,” he said. “We have not yet done what is necessary to address our shortcomings.</p>
<p>Mr. Scharf’s questioning was generally less contentious than that of his predecessors as he repeatedly acknowledged the bank’s faults and reminded lawmakers that he wasn’t at Wells Fargo during the worst consumer abuses.</p>
<p>“For the life of me, I don’t know why you took this job,” said Rep. Gregory Meeks, D-N.Y., a sentiment repeated by several other lawmakers.</p>
<p>Among the country’s largest and most profitable banks, Wells Fargo has struggled to overcome a scandal involving fake accounts. That scandal ballooned as the bank admitted to other consumer abuses, including mistakenly foreclosing on hundreds of clients and repossessing the cars of thousands of others.</p>
<p>Last month, the bank reached a $3 billion settlement with the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, acknowledging that for more than a decade, thousands of employees falsified records, forged signatures and misused customers’ personal information to meet unrealistic sales goals, opening millions of accounts that consumers didn’t want in the process.</p>
<p>“As we sit here today, we have not yet re-earned the trust that I would like the Wells Fargo name to represent,” Mr. Scharf told the committee. But “we in fact can do that.”</p>
<p>Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, the ranking Republican on the committee, said although Wells Fargo was “grossly mismanaged,” calls by some Democrats to break up the bank, which has nearly $2 trillion in assets, were ill-advised. “We know breaking up the bank is not the answer,” he said.</p>
<p>Rather than holding three hearings on Wells Fargo this month, the committee should focus on more pressing issues, including the spread of the novel coronavirus, Mr. McHenry said.</p>
<p>“Our constituents have real concerns,” he said.</p>
<p>Two former Wells Fargo board members are scheduled to testify Wednesday, and several bank employees will testify later this month.</p>
