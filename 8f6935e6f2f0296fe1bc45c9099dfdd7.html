<h1>Phil Jurkovec, Notre Dame QB and Pine-Richland alum, enters transfer portal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If Phil Jurkovec is to be a starting quarterback at the major-college level, it most likely won’t be at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Jurkovec, the former star quarterback at Pine-Richland High School and one of the best QBs in Western Pennsylvania history, has taken the first step to leave Notre Dame and transfer to another school. Jurkovec has entered his name into the NCAA transfer portal. Jurkovec sent a letter to Notre Dame athletic officials Sunday informing them of his request.</p>
<p>Jurkovec’s father, Jim, confirmed that his son has entered the transfer portal, but neither Jim Jurkovec nor his father wanted to comment further. Once an athlete’s name is in the portal, other college coaches are permitted to contact the athlete.</p>
<p>Entering the portal does not definitely mean an athlete will transfer. Athletes can withdraw from the transfer portal and return to their school. But it looks like Jurkovec’s Notre Dame career might be over without it ever really getting started.</p>
<p>Jurkovec’s decision comes a week after Notre Dame starting quarterback Ian Book announced he would return for his fifth year with the Fighting Irish. Book was Notre Dame’s starting quarterback this season and most of 2018. There was talk that Book might enter the NFL draft or transfer to another college as a graduate student. His decision to return certainly impacted Jurkovec.</p>
<p>Jurkovec played in two games as a freshman at Notre Dame in 2018 and was redshirted. He was Book’s backup this past season and played in six games, showing promise at times while completing 12 of 16 passes for 222 yards and rushing 22 times for 156 yards.</p>
<p>If Jurkovec returns to Notre Dame, he risks sitting for another season behind Book. But he is in a predicament because if he transfers, he will have to sit out a season under transfer rules, unless he gets a waiver from the NCAA to be eligible immediately.</p>
<p>On top of Book returning, Notre Dame has a four-star quarterback recruit coming to the team in 2021. Tyler Buchner of The Bishop’s School in La Jolla, Calif., is rated the No. 42 junior player in the country by Rivals.com. He threw for 4,474 yards and ran for 1,610 this past season alone.</p>
<p>Jurkovec also had some impressive statistics during his days at Pine-Richland. His 5,180 yards offense in 2017 is second-best in WPIAL history, and he set a WPIAL playoff-game record with 539 yards offense against North Allegheny. He finished his career with 11,144 yards, second-best in WPIAL history. He also was a standout basketball player and believed to be the first quarterback from the WPIAL in 50 years to play in the largest classification and make all-state in two sports.</p>
<p>But he got stuck behind Book at Notre Dame when Book took over as the starter early in 2018. Book performed well enough to keep the starting job, and he is 20-3 as a starter the past two seasons. Also, Notre Dame’s offensive coordinator the past three seasons was Chip Long, who was not the offensive coordinator when Jurkovec committed to the Fighting Irish. Long and Notre Dame parted ways after this regular season, and Notre Dame has not yet hired a new offensive coordinator.</p>
<p>Jurkovec committed to Notre Dame in the spring of his sophomore year at Pine-Richland. Although he was only a sophomore, he had numerous other scholarship offers from schools across the country, including Pitt and Penn State. He might soon go through the recruiting process all over again.</p>
