<h1>Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders harness Iowa energy at New Hampshire debate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. — With four days left until the first-in-the-nation primary here, seven of the highest-polling Democratic presidential contenders took to the debate stage at Saint Anselm College to tell the American people why their party&nbsp;— not Republicans&nbsp;— will expand health care, reform the criminal justice system and fight for the working class.</p>
<p>But they disagreed on which candidate could do those things without alienating Americans, how the winning campaign could&nbsp;— and should&nbsp;— be funded, how far is too far when it comes to making progress and who has the vision to bring along the strongest and most diverse electorate to beat Donald Trump.</p>
<p>The 2½-hour debate between three U.S. senators, two businessmen, a former vice president and a former mayor-turned-front-runner was driven as much by policy as it was aspirational thinking, but gave voters detailed looks into the candidates’ opinions on race, money in politics and foreign policy.</p>
<p>Their differences on substance began in the details of health insurance policy, but evolved into who could build the strongest coalition to accomplish their goals and get things done in office.</p>
<p>Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who has led every major poll in New Hampshire conducted in February, insisted that his platform of universal health care&nbsp;— Medicare for All&nbsp;— will do a fine enough job uniting the electorate.</p>
<p>The pushback against his plan came from former Vice President Joe Biden and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Ind. who narrowly beat him in delegates in this past Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg said his plan, which would provide a public option but allow the insured to keep their plans if they choose, is one that will galvanize Americans, not polarize them. Mr. Biden, who acknowledged to start the debate that he “took a hit in Iowa” by finishing fourth, said Mr. Sanders can’t expect to go into Congress, say he wants to give health care to everyone, then decline to give a cost.</p>
<p>“If we do what Joe wants,” Mr. Sanders responded, “we’ll be spending some $50 trillion on health care over the next 10 years. That’s the status quo, Joe.”</p>
<p>The distance between the status quo and moving too quickly toward change was at the center of the debate, as Mr. Buttigieg, Mr. Biden and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar cast doubt on Mr. Sanders’s ability to turn out voters from all political backgrounds with his proposals.</p>
<p>Ms. Klobuchar raised her hand when moderators asked the candidates who fears having a Democratic socialist at the top of the Democratic ticket, saying that Mr. Trump’s worst nightmare is “a candidate that will bring people in from the middle” like herself.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg said he cares less about what Republicans will say about the nominee, but about the necessity of having someone who can “turn the page” with a new style of politics.</p>
<p>“The biggest risk we could take...is trying to unite this country at a moment when we need that kind of unification when our nominee is dividing people with the politics that says, ‘if you don’t go all the way to the edge, it doesn’t count,’ a politics that says, it’s my way or the highway,’” Mr. Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>Asked if he was referring to Mr. Sanders, Mr. Buttigieg said “yes.”</p>
<p>After Mr. Biden said his health care plan would give people a choice and cost much less than Medicare for All, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a proponent of universal health care, said Democrats are supposed to be on the side of expanding health care.</p>
<p>They’re also supposed to be the party of getting money out of politics, Ms. Warren has said, a topic that triggered a debate when moderators brought up former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg’s campaign, which has skipped the early states and poured hundreds of millions of dollars into advertising on the airwaves.</p>
<p>In saying that Mr. Bloomberg, a multi-billionaire, should not be able to buy a nomination, Ms. Warren also railed against candidates who “suck up to billionaires” to fund their campaigns.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders took it one step further, saying that unlike Mr. Buttigieg, he doesn’t have 40 billionaires contributing to his campaign.</p>
<p>Echoing an argument he’s made previously, Mr. Buttigieg responded that whoever is chosen to face Mr. Trump in the general election will need all the financial resources they can get. He also noted that he’s sued pharmaceutical companies before and is campaigning on ideas that are antithetical to big money interests, like raising worker wages and taxing corporations at a higher rate.</p>
<p>“I will not pursue politics by telling people they can’t be on our side if they’re not with us 100 percent of the time,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “This is the time for addition, not rejection. For belonging, not excluding.”</p>
<p>A detailed exchange on criminal justice unearthed common ground between the candidates on the impacts of systemic racism, but illuminated their different approaches to solutions.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders, who said “we have a racist society from top to bottom,” called for investments into jobs and education instead of jails and incarceration, as well as an end to the war on drugs that has “disproportionately impacted African Americans.”</p>
<p>Also urging investment into underserved communities, Mr. Biden proposed mandatory treatment for drug offenses instead of imprisonment.</p>
<p>“Instead of building new prisons, we build new rehabilitation centers,” Mr. Biden said.</p>
<p>Mr. Steyer, noting that he worked to end cash bail and private prisons in California as an activist, said he supports giving reparations to the descendents of slavery and wants to set up a commission on race in his administration.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang’s argument was also economic: that his plan to give Americans $1,000 a month in universal basic income would “reshape the economy” and help people of color reverse course from worsening financial conditions -- which he said is partly due to the elimination of common jobs in the economy.</p>
<p>“It’s something of an economic unnatural disaster,” Mr. Yang said. “And who suffers most in a natural disaster? People of color, people with lower levels of capital and access to opportunity and education.”</p>
<p>It all starts with the right to vote, Mr. Klobuchar noted, saying that her administration would institute automatic voter registration at age 18 and encourage states to set up independent commissions for redistricting. Those changes, she said, would stop states from discriminating against African American voters.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg’s record on race as mayor of South Bend was called into question by the moderators, specifically how it could be that under his administration, black residents were four times more likely to be arrested for marijuana possession as white residents -- a disparity that increased after he took office.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg said his city was not immune to systemic racism and contributed the disparity to a “strategy” his community adopted in which “drug enforcement would be targeted in cases where there was a connection to the most violent group or gang connected to a murder.”</p>
<p>“These things are all connected. But that’s the point,” Mr. Buttigieg added. “So are all of the things that need to change, in order for us to prevent violence and remove the effects of systemic racism not just from criminal justice but from our economy, from health, from housing and from our democracy itself.”</p>
<p>Asked if Mr. Buttigieg’s answer was enough, Ms. Warren said, “No.”</p>
<p>“You have to own up to the facts, and it’s important to own up to the facts about how race has totally permeated our criminal justice system,” she said, insisting that it will take “race-conscious laws” in education, employment and entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>Owning up to the facts is what Mr. Biden asked Mr. Sanders to do on the issue of guns.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders, asked why he voted against background checks and a waiting period to purchase firearms in the ‘90s, said he comes from a rural state —&nbsp;Vermont —&nbsp;which, until just a few years ago, had “virtually no gun legislation at all.”</p>
<p>“I represented that perspective,” Mr. Sanders said. “The world has changed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Biden said the biggest mistake Mr. Sanders made was voting to protect gun manufacturers from being held in liability for “the carnage they are creating.”</p>
<p>The former Vice President also said that he, too, comes from a “major gun-owning state,” which didn’t stop him from pushing for gun control measures.</p>
<p>“While I was pushing the Brady background bill [for] background checks, Bernie voted five times against it when he was in the House,” Mr. Biden said.</p>
