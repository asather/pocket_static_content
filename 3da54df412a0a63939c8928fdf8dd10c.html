<h1>Range Resources fined for air pollution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Range Resources-Appalachia LLC is paying a $198,920 penalty for excessive air emissions of volatile organic compounds at two Washington County well pads, including one in the county’s popular recreational venue, Cross Creek Park.</p>
<p>The violations of the state’s air regulations and the Air Pollution Control Act occurred in 2013, 2014 and 2015 at Range’s Costanzo 1H and 2H unconventional natural gas well pads in Mount Pleasant Township and Cross Creek County Park 6H and 8H gas wells in Cross Creek Township.</p>
<p>At each site, Range operated wells, storage tanks and equipment that had the potential to emit VOCs in excess of the 50-ton annual limit for an industrial “minor source.” Facilities that emit more than 50 tons of VOCs annually are considered “major sources” and are subject to additional permitting requirements.</p>
<p>Range self-reported the violations to the state Department of Environmental Protection after conducting an internal audit that used a different formula to calculate emissions.</p>
<p>At the Cross Creek Park facility, Range originally stated VOC emissions totaled 40.91 tons in 2014, but after the audit changed the total to 61.9 tons. VOC emissions at the Costanzo well pad were originally reported by Range as 63.6 tons and 54.9 tons in 2013 and 2014, then revised to 56.7 tons and 73.2 tons for those two years. In 2015, Range initially reported the Costanzo VOC emissions were 2.91 tons, then revised to 41.6 tons.</p>
<p>The Fort Worth, Texas-based company is responsible for paying penalties, fees and interest for those years in which VOC emissions exceeded the 50-tons-a-year threshold.</p>
<p>According to a DEP release announcing the penalty, Range failed to apply for or receive a Title V major source permit, and when it installed emissions controls to reduce VOC pollution, failed to apply for or receive installation permits for the changes.</p>
<p>Lisa Graves-Marcucci, state community outreach coordinator for the Environmental Integrity Project, a Washington D.C., environmental advocacy organization, questioned why it took the DEP so long to settle the case, and said the state should stop taking the industry’s word on shale gas drilling and storage facilities and start requiring the industry to provide continuous, real-time monitoring of emissions to protect human health.</p>
<p>She said the DEP’s ability to provide proper regulatory oversight of the shale gas industry has been decimated by budget cuts.</p>
<p>“This settlement is a small step in the right direction, but after so many problems over so many years, I don’t know anyone that has the appetite to take the industry’s word on this anymore,” Ms. Marcucci said. “People live around these facilities in real time and they deserve to get information about them in real time.”</p>
<p>During its investigation of the VOC problems, the DEP reviewed data on all of Range’s shale gas well and storage tank facilities to determine if the higher VOC emissions were a system wide problem.</p>
<p>“The department gained more information from Range Resources including, for example, the operator’s methodology to calculate emissions and data on other well sites,” Ms. Fraley said in an email response to questions, “and determined that this was not a pervasive issue.”</p>
<p>The civil penalties will be paid to the Pennsylvania Clean Air Fund, and a portion will be distributed to the communities where the violations occurred. Mount Pleasant Township will receive $21,293, and Cross Creek Township will get $20,744. The money must be spent on parks, recreation, trails or open space projects or on the elimination of air pollution.</p>
