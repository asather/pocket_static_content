<h1>Buttigieg makes pitch to veterans — and New Hampshire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MERRIMACK, N.H. —&nbsp;Between draped American flags and a wall-to-wall crowd of veterans, supporters, and undecided voters inside this small town’s American Legion hall, Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg said that the “state that famously thinks for itself” will come to believe that a 38-year-old veteran of the war in Afghanistan is best suited to take care of U.S. troops.</p>
<p>On Thursday, just days before the first-in-the-nation primary, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor made his case to voters to why he should be the first Democratic president since Jimmy Carter to have served in the armed forces and the first president ever who served in a post-September 11th war.</p>
<p>“When we talk about taking care of veterans, we’re not talking about doing anybody a favor,” Mr. Buttigieg said. “We are talking about America’s way of keeping its promises made in return, and that is to look after you for the rest of your life.”</p>
<p>Shaping his veterans platform as a means of addressing cross-generational problems facing those who served in conflicts from World War II up to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Mr. Buttigieg —&nbsp;like other candidates —&nbsp;talked of reforming the Department of Veterans Affairs and ensuring veterans have access to quality care.</p>
<p>But he differed in the details, explaining to the town hall audience that he’d cut wait times by working to fill the thousands of vacancies in the department. Paying them more, he said, would be one option.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg also talked of his plan to hire a White House coordinator to streamline communications between the VA and Department of Defense, in order to ensure veterans have consistent medical records from the time they start serving to when they seek treatment at home.</p>
<p>Having served a seven-month deployment to Afghanistan as an intelligence officer in the U.S. Navy Reserves in 2014, Mr. Buttigieg spoke about how his time in the military taught him about working toward a common goal and how political leanings don’t matter.</p>
<p>That part spoke to Vietnam veteran Don Lanoue, who said Mr. Buttigieg’s military service will give him the discipline and team-building skills to work across the aisle.</p>
<p>How voters perceive his willingness to work across the aisle could impact how he fairs here in Merrimack, a town south of Manchester in Hillsborough County —&nbsp;one of three counties in New Hampshire that flipped from Barack Obama in 2012 to Donald Trump in 2016.</p>
<p>Merrimack has been a fairly reliable Republican town, but this year, it sent Democrats to the state House for the first time in years, said one attendee.</p>
<p>At the town hall, Mr. Buttigieg continued to frame his candidacy as a moderate alternative to the more progressive candidates like Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, and touted his healthcare plan that offers a government-provided public option.</p>
<p>His plan, which he calls “Medicare for All Who Want It,” would cost $1.5 trillion over 10 years, he said, noting that it’d be a “tiny fraction” of the cost of what other candidates have proposed. It would also help veterans, he said, because a majority aren’t using the VA system for care.</p>
<p>To fund it, he would roll back the Trump tax cuts and use the savings that result from allowing Medicare to negotiate the price of prescription drugs, he told the crowd.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg visited Merrimack between appearances on national television, and will be a featured guest on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” late Thursday.</p>
<p>As he took the stage, Mr. Buttigieg was holding onto<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/06/DNC-calls-for-a-recanvass-of-Iowa-results-after-delays-tom-perez-caucus/stories/202002060128" target="_blank"> a miniscule lead in Iowa</a> of just three state delegate equivalents, with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders picking up ground.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Having already declared victory after Tuesday’s caucuses, Mr. Buttigieg didn’t address the specifics of the new results, but said his campaign is coming into New Hampshire “absolutely electrified by the energy” it got from the “extraordinary validation” in Iowa.</p>
<p>In New Hampshire, Mr. Buttigieg is rising in the polls. One released Wednesday by WBZ/Boston Globe/Suffolk University of New Hampshire showed Mr. Buttigieg&nbsp;with his best showing yet in their polling at 19%, six points behind Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>In taking on veterans’ issues, Mr. Buttigieg’s plan calls for investments in “permanent supportive housing with state and local partnerships,” and he said Thursday that he wants to ensure quality military housing is available because a “shockingly low percentage of those who serve and their families report they’re satisfied with their housing.”</p>
<p>Responding to an attendee who told him that he’d beat Mr. Trump in a face-to-face debate, Mr. Buttigieg said he’s looking forward to the president having to stand next to someone who served the nation and who knows “what it means ... to demonstrate love for this country.”</p>
