<h1>Pittsburgh faith leader to moderate Democrat primary forum in Iowa</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh faith leader who has worked at the intersection of politics and religion for more than 15 years will find himself at the intersection of several Democratic presidential candidates this weekend.</p>
<p>The Rev. John C. Welch, dean of students at the Pittsburgh Theological Seminary, will serve as moderator of “The People’s Caucus: Vote Truth to Power,” a presidential primary forum in Davenport, Iowa, on Sunday that will focus on issues of immigration, education, environmental justice and mass transformational justice.</p>
<p>A list of confirmed candidates has not been released and was not immediately provided by the host organizations. Rev. Welch said the last he heard, former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Congressman John Delaney were interested in attending.</p>
<p>With many people representing faith-based organizations expected to attend as audience members, Rev. Welch said he will be tasked with controlling the agenda and making sure candidates are adequately responding to questions.</p>
<p>Rev. Welch said he hopes to hear the candidates sound authentic, transparent and honest without using “canned responses.”</p>
<p>“Somebody who was formerly incarcerated more than likely will be asking a question from his or her experience, and you can’t fool somebody who’s been behind bars with typical rhetoric,” Rev. Welch said Thursday.</p>
<p>The forum —&nbsp;billed as a “unique” opportunity to hear from the candidates three weeks before the Iowa caucuses —&nbsp;was convened by the Faith Coalition and the Iowa and Illinois affiliates of the Gamaliel Network, a leadership development organization chaired by Rev. Welch that trains people of faith for action.</p>
<p>Rev. Welch served as president of Gamaliel’s Pittsburgh affiliate, the Pittsburgh Interfaith Impact Network, from 2005 to 2010.</p>
<p>“Being able to be part of this on a national stage is a proud moment for me and I’m excited about it,” Rev. Welch said.</p>
