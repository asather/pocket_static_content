<h1>Trump nominates 'eminently qualified' Amy Coney Barrett for Supreme Court seat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Saturday, capping a dramatic reshaping of the federal judiciary that will resonate for a generation and that he hopes will provide a needed boost to his reelection effort.</p>
<p>Judge Barrett, a former clerk to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, said she was “truly humbled” by the nomination and quickly aligned herself with Justice Scalia’s conservative approach to the law, saying that his “judicial philosophy is mine, too.”</p>
<p>Judge Barrett, 48, was joined in the White House Rose Garden by her husband and seven children as guests looked on. If confirmed by the Senate, she would fill the seat vacated by the late liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in what would be the sharpest ideological swing since Clarence Thomas replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall nearly three decades ago.</p>
<p>She would be the sixth justice on the nine-member court to be appointed by a Republican president — and the third of Mr. Trump’s first term in office.</p>
<p>The president hailed Judge Barrett as “a woman of remarkable intellect and character,” saying he had studied her record closely before making the pick.</p>
<p>“I looked and I studied, and you are very eminently qualified,” he said as Judge Barrett stood next to him.</p>
<p>Republican senators are lining up for a swift confirmation of Judge Barrett ahead of the Nov. 3 election, as they aim to lock in conservative gains in the federal judiciary before a potential transition of power. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping the nomination will serve to galvanize his supporters as he looks to fend off Democrat Joe Biden.</p>
<p>For Mr. Trump, whose 2016 victory hinged in large part on reluctant support from white evangelicals on the promise of filling Justice Scalia’s seat with a conservative, the latest nomination in some ways brings his first term full circle. Even before Justice Ginsburg’s death, Mr. Trump was running on having confirmed in excess of 200 federal judges, fulfilling a generational aim of conservative legal activists.</p>
<p>“This is my third such nomination after Justice [Neil] Gorsuch and Justice [Brett] Kavanaugh, and it is a very proud moment indeed,” Mr. Trump said in the Rose Garden.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump joked that the confirmation process ahead “should be easy” and “extremely noncontroversial,” though it is likely to be anything but. No court nominee has been considered so close to a presidential election before, with early voting already underway. He encouraged legislators to take up her nomination swiftly and asked Democrats to “refrain from personal and partisan attacks.”</p>
<p>In 2016, Republicans blocked President Barack Obama’s nomination of Merrick Garland to the Supreme Court to fill the election-year vacancy, saying voters should have a say in the lifetime appointment. Despite that, Senate Republicans say they will move ahead this time, arguing the circumstances are different now that the White House and Senate are controlled by the same party.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said the Senate will vote “in the weeks ahead” on Judge Barrett’s confirmation, adding that Mr. Trump “could not have made a better decision” in nominating the appellate court judge. Hearings are set to begin on Oct. 12.</p>
<p>Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi warned that a vote to confirm Judge Barrett to the high court would be a vote to strike down the Affordable Care Act. Mr. Schumer added that the president was once again putting “Americans’ healthcare in the crosshairs” even while the coronavirus pandemic rages.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden took that route of criticism, as well, framing Mr. Trump’s choice as another move in Republicans’ effort to scrap the 2010 health care law passed by his former boss, Mr. Obama. The court is expected to take up a case against it this fall.</p>
<p>The set design Saturday at the Rose Garden, with large American flags hung between the colonnades, appeared to be modeled on the way the White House was decorated when then-President Bill Clinton nominated Justice Ginsburg in 1993.</p>
<p>Judge Barrett, recognizing that flags were still lowered in recognition of Justice Ginsburg’s death, said she would be “mindful of who came before me.” Although they have different judicial philosophies, Judge Barrett praised Justice Ginsburg as a trailblazer for women and for her friendship with Justice Scalia, saying, “She has won the admiration of women across the country and indeed all across the world.”</p>
<p>Within hours of Justice Ginsburg’s death, Mr. Trump made clear he would nominate a woman for the seat and later volunteered he was considering five candidates. But Judge Barrett was the early favorite and the only one to meet with Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Judge Barrett has been a judge since 2017, when Mr. Trump nominated her to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But as a longtime University of Notre Dame law professor, she had already established herself as a reliable conservative in the mold of Justice Scalia, for whom she clerked in the late 1990s.</p>
<p>She would be the only justice on the current court not to have received her law degree from an Ivy League school. The eight current justices all attended either Harvard or Yale.</p>
<p>The staunch conservative had become known to Mr. Trump in large part after her bitter 2017 appeals court confirmation included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. The president also interviewed her in 2018 for the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, but he ultimately chose Justice Kavanaugh.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump and his political allies are itching for another fight over Judge Barrett’s faith, seeing it as a political windfall that would backfire on Democrats. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Mr. Biden, who is also Catholic, is trying to recapture.</p>
<p>While Democrats appear powerless to stop Judge Barrett’s confirmation in the GOP-controlled Senate, they are seeking to use the process to weaken Mr. Trump’s re-election chances.</p>
<p>Judge Barrett’s nomination could become a reckoning over abortion, an issue that has divided many Americans so bitterly for almost half a century. The idea of overturning or gutting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalized abortion, has animated activists in both parties for decades. Now, with the seemingly decisive shift in the court’s ideological makeup, Democrats hope their voters will turn out in droves because of their frustration with the Barrett pick.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has also increasingly embraced the high court — on which he will have had an outsize hand in reshaping -– as an insurance policy in a close election.</p>
<p>Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the coronavirus pandemic have already led to a flurry of election litigation, and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Mr. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.</p>
<p>“I think [the election] will end up in the Supreme Court,” Mr. Trump said Wednesday. “And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices.”</p>
<p>No Democratic senators are expected to vote to confirm Judge Barrett before the election, even though some did support her in 2017.</p>
<p>Two Democrats still serving in the Senate who voted to confirm Judge Barrett in 2017 — Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia and Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia — now say it’s too close to the election to consider her nomination.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, a member of Senate Republican leadership, said in a statement that the Senate "will give Judge Barrett full and fair consideration, and a timely vote on the Senate floor."</p>
<p>Senate Judiciary Chairman Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican facing a competitive re-election, praised Mr. Trump's selection, calling Judge Barrett “highly qualified in all the areas that matter” in a statement and saying he is “committed to ensuring that the nominee gets a challenging, fair, and respectful hearing.”</p>
<p>Currently, there are 53 GOP senators, meaning Republicans would have to lose four votes for Judge Barrett’s nomination to fail. (If three Republicans flip,&nbsp;Vice President Mike Pence would step in to cast a tie-breaking vote.)</p>
<p>Ahead of the president's announcement, only two Republicans — Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine — had voiced opposition to the possibility of taking up a nominee before Nov. 3.</p>
<p>Ms. Murkowski said Saturday in a statement that she would meet with Judge Barrett.</p>
<p>“For weeks I have stated that I do not support taking up a potential Supreme Court vacancy this close to an election,” she wrote. “But today the President exercised his constitutional authority to nominate an individual to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court left by the passing of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. I welcome the opportunity to meet with the Supreme Court nominee, just as I did in 2016.”</p>
<p>Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, a frequent critic of the president, signaled earlier this week that he is on board with the Senate taking up a Supreme Court nomination during the election year — an announcement that all but ensured Mr. Trump’s nominee will be confirmed, barring any potential missteps by Judge Barrett during the confirmation process.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, outside conservative groups are planning to spend more than $25 million to support Mr. Trump and his nominee. The Judicial Crisis Network has organized a coalition that includes American First Policies, the Susan B. Anthony List, the Club for Growth and the group Catholic Vote to help confirm Judge Barrett, and Mr. Trump’s campaign is expected to include the nomination in upcoming advertising.</p>
