<h1>Witnesses testify about guns, blood, fingerprints on Day 3 of Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At one point Wednesday morning, a prosecutor wearing blue latex gloves stood before the jury box holding a rifle that had been seized as evidence in the investigation of a 2016 mass shooting in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Police had confiscated the gun&nbsp;shortly after the murders while executing a search warrant on the Homewood townhouse where defendant Cheron Shelton’s mother lived.</p>
<p>A fingerprint lifted from the firearm matched Shelton’s, according to testimony from an Allegheny County crime lab scientist, as the third day of trial continued in the homicide case with a flurry of witnesses taking the stand.</p>
<p>“So it’s your opinion that the defendant left a latent print on this rifle?” Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini asked Jason Clark.</p>
<p>“That is correct,” Mr. Clark answered.</p>
<p>Score for the prosecution?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Not so fast.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, the first question asked by Shelton’s attorney, Randall McKinney, was whether Mr. Clark was aware that the rifle was not the kind even alleged to have been used in the March 9, 2016, shooting that killed five adults and an unborn child during a backyard cookout.</p>
<p>Mr. Clark acknowledged that he was. Police have said a .40-caliber handgun and 7.62-caliber ammunition were used.</p>
<p>But Mr. Clark also testified that something else was found in the townhouse: a magazine and a drum magazine, both containing 7.62-caliber ammunition.</p>
<p>Prosecutors believe that Shelton wounded Lamont Shelton and killed his siblings Brittany Powell, Chanetta Powell and Jerry Michael Shelton, as well as his cousins Tina Shelton and Shada Mahone. Also wounded was neighbor John Ellis Jr.</p>
<p>Police believe that Shelton was targeting Lamont Powell because he thought Powell had killed his best friend, Calvin Doswell, in 2013. No one has been charged in that case.</p>
<p>Police arrested Shelton and Robert Thomas, alleging that they had worked together, each using a different gun, to herd the victims from the backyard of 1304 Franklin Ave. toward the house and then gun them down.</p>
<p>On Monday, Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski dismissed charges against Thomas for lack of evidence.</p>
<p>All but one of the morning session’s nine witnesses were either police officers or crime lab technicians.</p>
<p>The day opened with Allegheny County police Detective Kevin McCue under cross-examination about a lengthy compilation of surveillance video from the Nolan Court public housing complex in Pittsburgh’s Hilltop neighborhood that was shown Tuesday to the jury.</p>
<p>Another witness, William Best, who works in the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office’s forensic laboratory division, told jurors that he helped process a white Lincoln Continental registered to Shelton’s sister, Brittany Shelton. Police say that the car, which figures prominently in the videos, matches a description of a vehicle seen near the scene of the murders.</p>
<p>Investigators claim that on the night of the shooting, Shelton left his mother’s Nolan Court home, got into the car, picked up a long object from behind the townhouse, got back in and drove away.</p>
<p>A vehicle matching the description was next seen, police said, on Franklin Avenue shortly before the shooting. The prosecution played surveillance video from a residence across the street and down the block from the shooting scene that captured a white sedan driving by.</p>
<p>Mr. Best testified that the front passenger seat floor mat and floorboard of the Lincoln tested positive for the&nbsp;“presumptive presence of blood.”</p>
<p>No further detail was given about the stain, and cross-examination of Mr. Best was delayed for reasons that weren’t clear.</p>
<p>The remaining testimony came from three Penn Hills police officers who encountered Shelton around 2:30 a.m. on March 10, 2016, several hours after the shootings, which occurred around 10:53 p.m.</p>
<p>Police had received a call for a possible prowler in the 3000 block of Hebron Drive. Three officers responded and encountered Shelton. They testified that he did not have identification but was cooperative, telling them he had lost his cell phone and had found it just before they arrived.</p>
<p>The officers said Shelton was polite, calm and cooperative, and they let him go after no more than eight minutes of talking with him.</p>
<p>Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky asked all three officers whether Shelton seemed drunk, and they all said no.</p>
