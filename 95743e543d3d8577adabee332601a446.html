<h1>Sen. Toomey calls to begin reopening businesses in most of Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., released guidelines Thursday that would allow wide swaths of Pennsylvania, including the Pittsburgh region, to begin reopening businesses amid the COVID-19 pandemic, a plan he based on county-level data showing a low number of positive cases, declining new cases and sufficient hospital capacity.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey, saying he believes the state likely has moved beyond the worst of the pandemic, suggested a three-phased approach. Certain outdoor-centric businesses — such as construction, car dealerships, nurseries and golf courses — should be permitted to reopen immediately, provided they follow federal health guidelines to keep workers and customers safe, he said.</p>
<p>After that, health data on a county level would dictate the phased reopening of specific industries, the plan showed. Those metrics in Mr. Toomey’s report indicate that all but 18 counties clustered in southeastern Pennsylvania could begin reopening by Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“By every meaningful metric, we are making real progress,” Mr. Toomey told reporters in a conference call Thursday. While the widespread economic shutdowns may have made sense a month ago, “We’re really paying a very, very high price,” with 20% of Pennsylvanians on unemployment benefits.</p>
<p>“There’s a human price when people lose their jobs,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Toomey’s plan,&nbsp;Allegheny, Westmoreland and Indiana counties<a href="https://www.toomey.senate.gov/files/documents/PA%20Starts%20Up%20Safely,%20A%20Framework%20for%20Gradually%20and%20Safely%20Reopening%20Pennsylvania's%20Economy.pdf" target="_blank"> could begin opening businesses</a> in phases as soon as Monday, as officials have seen a downward trend of new COVID-19 positive cases consistent with the 14-day decline federal health officials are looking for.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Butler, Armstrong, Washington, Fayette and Greene counties could reopen because they have not seen an increase of more than 10 new cases in&nbsp;a single day over a 14-day period, the report found.</p>
<p>Beaver County could reopen because more than half of its cases are confined to residents and staff in a single nursing home — a fact that renders the county’s cases&nbsp;“contained,” the report argued.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t allow an anomaly to necessarily dictate the policy throughout an entire region,” Mr. Toomey said, referring to the Beaver County nursing home.&nbsp;“We have to realize that that is extremely localized.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey stressed that any reopened business to comply with “reasonable measures to ensure the safety of employees and customers,” like those established for essential businesses by Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>Many manufacturers, retailers and office-based employers are capable of complying with these measures, he said, and could reopen as part of the first phase of his plan. Health care providers should be allowed to resume medically necessary procedures unrelated to COVID-19, he said.</p>
<p>Phase two would allow higher-trafficked retailers like restaurants, bars, and fitness centers to reopen with certain occupancy limits to enforce social distancing. School systems would reopen and travel could resume within the United States to regions not currently experiencing high levels of&nbsp;COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Phase three would allow entertainment venues to reopen and&nbsp;restaurants, bars, and gyms to lift occupancy limits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he favored&nbsp;“devoting very substantial resources” to scaling up greater COVID-19 testing, calling it “enormously central” to his strategy, he said. Congress reached a deal this week to provide an additional $25 billion for testing. That bill was approved Thursday by the House and likely will be signed by President Donald Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s plan arrived a day after Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf released a plan to reopen the state’s economy using similarly phased approach.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he reached out to Mr. Wolf Thursday and “commended him” on his plan and suggested that the governor “think of my plan as a series of constructive suggestions.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were some differences between the plans put forth by the governor and senator.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s plan relies more on regional numbers and prohibits almost all industries from reopening for at least another two weeks, while Mr. Toomey’s plan would allow counties within a region to establish guidelines for reopening immediately.</p>
<p>“The takeaway is there would be more businesses able to reopen sooner under my plan than the governor’s,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Chamber of Business and Industry applauded Mr. Toomey’s plan in a statement.</p>
<p>While crediting Mr. Wolf’s stay-at-home measures for leading to a “flattening of the curve,” the group urged a “reasonable” reopening of the economy.</p>
<p>“Now it’s time to turn our focus on ‘Bringing PA Back,’” Gene Barr, the group’s president and CEO, wrote in a statement. Mr. Toomey “has put forth a good, reasonable plan to assist in that recovery. We strongly encourage the Wolf administration, Senator Toomey and the state Legislature to bring together their collective ideas to begin this economic recovery.”</p>
