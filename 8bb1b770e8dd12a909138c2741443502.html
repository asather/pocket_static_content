<h1>City Council to consider a ban on 'hateful activities' and moving away from blue recycling bags</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Citing a hypothetical case in which “a member of council staff decided to slander, defile, defame” an African American council member “through a whisper campaign,” Councilman Ricky Burgess on Tuesday introduced legislation that would bar Pittsburgh officials and employees from “hateful activities”&nbsp;against other city employees.</p>
<p>Rev. Burgess — elected to a fourth term in November and an unsuccessful contestant a week ago for the council presidency — said he introduced the bill because “one of the ways that racism is perpetrated is through hateful activity,” including online harassment.</p>
<p>The councilman, who is African American, said “cyber lynching” and “unsubstantiated rumors” are “the tools, in part, that they use to perpetuate the consequences of an unfair, unjust system.”</p>
<p>The proposal comes eight days after a council presidency election in which Theresa Kail-Smith emerged as the compromise choice after Rev. Burgess and Councilman Corey O’Connor tried, but failed, to line up the necessary five votes.</p>
<p>Several council members have noted that constituent pressure, including through social media, became a factor in the race, as commenters — often anonymously — tried to influence them to vote for or against Rev. Burgess or Mr. O’Connor.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith said she has “seen some things that are upsetting to members” on social media.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, council members reported hearing raised voices in council’s hallway.</p>
<p>“I think there are two members that are very upset with the process and things that have taken place over the last two weeks, especially,” said Ms. Kail-Smith after council’s meeting. “I think it’s going to take some time to heal these wounds and we have to take action to address this. … I think they may be very difficult to overcome without some mediation.”</p>
<p>She said she has begun to attempt diplomacy between council members.</p>
<p>Rev. Burgess’s proposed&nbsp;legislation would amend the city’s Code of Conduct to bar city officials and employees from organizing or engaging “in person or in writing and/or across various media platforms” including social media in “hateful activities.”</p>
<p>It defines hateful activities as those “that incite or engage in violence, intimidation, harassment, threats, or defamation” related to “actual or perceived race, color, religion, national origin, ethnicity, immigration status, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, or disability.”</p>
<p>Anyone who was victimized by, or knew of, such activity could report it to the city Ethics Hearing Board, which would investigate and, where appropriate, punish perpetrators, he said. He said punishments could include termination.</p>
<p>“My intention is to certainly have a public hearing, a post-agenda [special council meeting],” he said. “I think it’s appropriate to have a very thorough, public, participatory conversation about what’s the standard of our city. I believe there is no place for hateful activities. There’s no place for libel, and slander and defamation of people. … And to be a great city, we cannot allow that to continue.”</p>
<p>Given the pledge of a public hearing, consideration of the legislation could take months.</p>
<p>Council will also consider a potential move toward the use of containers for curbside recycling following the introduction of legislation Tuesday.</p>
<p>A proposed resolution allows the city to accept a $500,000 grant from The Recycling Partnership Inc., a Falls Church, Va., nonprofit. The money would be used for public outreach and the purchase of containers for recyclable materials.</p>
<p>The city currently picks up recyclable materials deposited curbside in blue plastic bags. Such bags are increasingly seen as wasteful, and <a title="Blue Bags" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2019/12/17/Giant-Eagle-plastic-grocery-bags-kroger-wolf-GetGo-Sustainable-Pittsburgh/stories/201912160109" target="_blank">Giant Eagle is phasing out their use.</a></p>
<p>“I’m a little bit jealous when I go out to Bethel Park and I see like four recycling bins” in front yards, said Councilman Anthony Coghill. By contrast he said, “you see all the plastic bags in the oceans. I’m all about getting rid of plastics.”</p>
<p>Council may debate the proposal as soon as Jan. 22, with a final vote potentially occurring Jan. 28.</p>
<p>Council also voted in support of a proposed Prevention Point Pittsburgh needle exchange site on the 7200 block of Frankstown Avenue in Homewood. It would be open five days per week and would be the fifth site in the city for the agency, which aims to reduce the harm done by drug use, including the transmission of disease through reuse of syringes.</p>
