<h1>Flu blamed for two more Allegheny County deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two more Allegheny County residents have died due to influenza complications, the county’s health department confirmed on Wednesday, bringing this season’s total to three.</p>
<p>“One resident was in their 70s and one in their 40s,” said Dr. Kristen Mertz, and ACHD epidemiologist, in a statement. “Both had underlying medical conditions.”</p>
<p>Last week, Dr. Mertz confirmed the county’s first reported death from influenza.</p>
<p>She said an unnamed 90-year-old county resident died from the virus, also from “underlying medical conditions.” Neither recent victim has been identified.</p>
<p>According to Dr. Mertz, the county has seen a decline in reported flu cases each week over the past few weeks, “but we cannot predict if this trend will continue.”</p>
<p>Last week, Dr. Mertz said the county has seen “a larger number of flu cases this year compared to last year at this time, particularly Type B flu.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mertz had several recommendations during flu season:</p>
<p>“Residents should call their health care provider as soon as possible if they’re experiencing flu symptoms (fever, muscle aches, cough, sore throat and fatigue) to determine if antiviral drugs should be prescribed. Antivirals can reduce severity of illness and are recommended for those at high-risk for flu complications: the elderly, young children, pregnant women, and persons with chronic medical conditions. This medication works best if started within two days of onset of symptoms.</p>
<p>“The best way to fight the flu is to get vaccinated. While the effectiveness of this year’s vaccine has not yet been determined, it’s very important to get a flu shot every year. Not only does it protect you from getting sick, it can protect you from spreading the flu to your loved ones and those that cannot be vaccinated. It’s never too late to get a flu shot and we encourage residents to get one if they haven’t already done so.</p>
<p>“To prevent flu transmission, you should also wash your hands frequently, cough or sneeze into your elbow or shoulder and not your hands and stay at home if you’re sick.”</p>
<p>Here’s a look at how the flu has affected Allegheny County so far this season:</p>
<p>Number of cases: 6,145</p>
<p>Number of hosptializations: 41</p>
<p>Number of deaths: 3</p>
