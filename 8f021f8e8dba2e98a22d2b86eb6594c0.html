<h1>County seeks closure of Brentwood restaurant Crack'd Egg over lack of employee face masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County this week filed an emergency injunction request to shut down a Brentwood restaurant that it says continues to operate in violation of state orders on mitigating COVID-19.</p>
<p>The county filed the complaint Monday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court against the Crack’d Egg on Brownsville Road.</p>
<p>The county Health Department ordered the restaurant closed on Aug. 11 but said it continues to operate without observing any of the restrictions imposed by the state.</p>
<p>The county said in the filing that on June 19 the Health Department received the first of many complaints from the public about the restaurant not complying with the restrictions. In several visits, inspectors said they observed “public-facing employees and patrons not wearing face masks” and employees preparing food without wearing face masks.</p>
<p>The complaint said the business has “deliberately continued operations in direct violation and contravention of the Aug. 11 closure order.”</p>
<p>The complaint asks that a judge prevent the restaurant from operating until it submits a compliance plan approved by the Health Department and order the restaurant to pay unspecified civil penalties for violating its Health Department permit.</p>
<p>Attorney Sy Lampl, who represents Crack’d Egg, said they have moved the case to federal court, and cites the county’s closure order as an “issue of constitutionality.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“More specifically, the basis for the county and the Health Department’s actions were under the executive order for Gov. [Tom] Wolf on the basis of his emergency power, and we believe that it has expired under the statute,”&nbsp;Mr. Lampl said. “So we don’t believe there’s any authority actually enforcing these orders. At this point it’s arbitrary and capricious and we just feel that there’s no basis for this action by the Health Department.”</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=750240872432736&amp;extid=IRJcFCS8ZIYEse63" target="_blank">livestream posted on Facebook</a>, the restaurant’s owner, Kimberly Waigand, can be seen making a speech at a rally in Harrisburg on Sept. 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During her speech, Ms. Waigand told the crowd she had followed Gov. Wolf’s initial two-week closure order as well as operating at 25% occupancy and socially distant outdoor seating.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ll tell you what we never did,” Ms. Waigand said to the crowd.&nbsp;“We never required masks.”</p>
<p>Ms. Waigand then told the crowd the “snitches in Brentwood are real,” citing how the Health Department told her they’d been receiving 20 complaints a day about her restaurant for not wearing masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To those complaints, Ms. Waigand responded in front of the crowd,&nbsp;“Fantastic, I’m still not backing down.”<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>When the Health Department told her to refuse customers who did not wear masks, she told the crowd she responded to them,&nbsp;“absolutely not.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I will not violate anyone’s freedoms or liberties,” Ms. Waigand added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Waigand told the crowd she was inspired by another restaurant that also defied orders by opening at full capacity, with no social distancing and no masks.</p>
<p>“I wanted to be like them” Ms. Waigand said.&nbsp;“I know this is no longer about a virus. This is control.”&nbsp;</p>
