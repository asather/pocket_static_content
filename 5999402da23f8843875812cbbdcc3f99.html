<h1>Pitt professor: Past outbreaks provide lessons for figuring out new coronavirus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The way China and the rest of the world is dealing with the coronavirus outbreak may appear chaotic now.</p>
<p>But history —&nbsp;distant and particularly more recent history of similar outbreaks —&nbsp;shows that global health experts will eventually get a hold of it, said Mari Webel, an assistant history professor at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in the history of public health.</p>
<p>“We don’t know a lot about [coronavirus] right now,” said Ms. Webel, who has a PhD in history and teaches classes on the history of health. “But this is why it’s so important to think about what specific pathogen is causing the problem. How is it transmitted? How fast does it move? How many people can one person infect?</p>
<p>“They don’t know now. But they’ll figure it out.”</p>
<p>That was true in 2002 and 2003 when an even more deadly outbreak of a coronavirus in southern China, known as SARS, which killed about 10% of people infected versus 2% of the new virus, sent health officials scrambling to figure out similar information about that virus.</p>
<p>“There were a lot of consequential changes in the World Health Organizations way of operating because of SARS,” Ms. Webel said. “And that was informed again by the H1N1 outbreak [in 2009], and then Ebola” in 2014.</p>
<p>One of the most consequential changes following the SARS outbreak was the passage in 2005, a year after the last recorded SARS case, of the WHO’s new International Health Regulations, which included creating a new Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC) warning.</p>
<p>It was declaring the 2019 coronavirus a PHEIC on January 30 that set in motion a formal global response to address the virus. This was the sixth PHEIC declared by the WHO since 2005, after H1N1 in 2009, Polio in 2014, Ebola in 2014, Zika in 2015, and Kivu Ebola in 2018</p>
<p>The declarations not only set in motion a formal, worldwide health response, it also insures better awareness by the general public.</p>
<p>But having already dealt with SARS not so long ago has helped health officials now recall “what we knew about month X with another similar situation,” Mr. Webel said. “That historic perspective is really valuable in this case.”</p>
<p>Stories have already emerged about large missteps taken with the first known cases of the 2019 coronavirus in China,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/01/world/asia/china-coronavirus.html?action=click&amp;module=Top%20Stories&amp;pgtype=Homepage" target="_blank"> including threatening doctors and others who spread “rumors” </a>about the first cases.</p>
<p>But China has been credited with being more open than they were <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/13/weekinreview/china-discovers-secrecy-is-expensive.html" target="_blank">in the early days of SARS when the government tried to suppress information</a>.</p>
<p>“The thing that is compelling to me is that there was a really vigorous process of self evaluation after SARS in 2003, and after H1N1 in 2009 and after Ebola in 2014, which led to improvements in self-aware ways about communicating about these diseases,” Ms. Webel said.</p>
<p>She took note that the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has been providing near daily updates on the new coronavirus to reporters in recent weeks.</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear,” she said. “The public health institutions are aware of what’s gone on [in the past] and they are improving the flow of information, which is good.”</p>
<p><strong>Will it work?</strong></p>
<p>One of the truly unknown factors in the new coronavirus outbreak is whether China’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/why-we-should-be-skeptical-of-chinas-coronavirus-quarantine/2020/01/24/51b711ca-3e2d-11ea-8872-5df698785a4e_story.html" target="_blank">attempt to enact the largest-ever known quarantine</a> of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, will work.</p>
<p>“The question is: How do you do that now? Do you quarantine an entire city? Will that work?” Ms. Webel asks.</p>
<p>Much smaller versions of quarantine have, with some regularity, been enacted in the United States, including with <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/25/us/ucla-measles-los-angeles.html" target="_blank">last year’s measles outbreaks in Los Angeles</a>, and lesser steps to limit people’s interaction with others in New York City.</p>
<p>“If you’re going to try to isolate all the known contacts of a person, that’s one way” to quarantine, Ms. Webel said. “But if you’re going to try to limit a broad region, those are two very different things.”</p>
<p>The CDC last week and again this week took the extraordinary steps of ordering 14-day quarantines for everyone on planes coming from Wuhan, forcing them to land at U.S. Air Force bases and stay on the base until they have been cleared to leave.</p>
<p>Ms. Webel points out that is a step not unlike the events that led to the origin of the word “quarantine,” which comes from the Italian word, “quaranta giorni,” which means “40 days.”</p>
<p>Forty days was the length of time that Venice during the 14th century required ships to dock off the coast before they were allowed to unload at port if they were coming from locations in other parts of the world infected with plague.</p>
<p>“The word itself points out that we have been quarantining for a very long time,” Ms. Webel said. “And even prior to [the 14th century] we used isolation as a human response to visible illness is something that we see in a lot of different contexts in history.”</p>
<p>One of Ms. Webel’s concerns about some of the initial public response to the new coronavirus is based on history as well.</p>
<p>Some reports have called the virus “Wuhan coronavirus,” after the city where it appears to have originated.</p>
<p>Naming a deadly virus or disease after a region can “have long-term consequences” for that region, she warns.</p>
<p>In 2015 the WHO tried to discourage naming viruses and diseases after locations.</p>
<p>But another festering fallout from the new coronavirus has been the demonization of the open food markets in Wuhan —&nbsp;similar to markets like it all over the world —&nbsp;where the virus first became known as a source of the first cases.</p>
<p>In contrast, she said, because Americans rely so much on refrigeration we have bacteria issues arise here with salmonella and listeria with some regularity, but the way our food is sold is rarely the target of demonization.</p>
<p>In Wuhan, “After that initial cross-species transmission, this is a healthcare infrastructure problem, it’s a public health-reporting challenge; it’s not about that market anymore,” she said. “That’s one of the things I really try hard to talk about and put in historical perspective.”</p>
<p>“We have to remember that jumping to conclusions and lumping people or an entire population based on some assumptions of a common set of characteristics is irresponsible,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Webel is organizing <a href="https://www.ucis.pitt.edu/asc/coronavirus" target="_blank">a “teach-in” about the new coronavirus and its outbreak as well as other public health issues</a>. The teach-in, which is free and open to the public, will be held from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m. on Feb. 12, in Room 120, Lawrence Hall on the Pitt campus, at 3942 Forbes Ave.</p>
