<h1>MLB releases 2021 schedule; Pirates to open April 1 at Cubs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">Despite the fact that the 2020 Major League Baseball season has not yet started — and won’t for more than two weeks — the league released its 2021 schedule on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>Yes, seriously.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ slate of 162 games — remember that number? — includes an April 1 start against the Cubs in Chicago, while the first game at PNC Park will be on April 8, also against the Cubs.</p>
<p>It’s the 22nd time the Pirates will begin their season against the Cubs and the first time in Chicago since 2011. Pittsburgh has now opened away from home in five consecutive years.</p>
<p>The Pirates will see the same interleague teams in 2021 as they will in 2020 — the AL Central. Their schedule features visits from the Royals (April 27-28), Indians (June 18-20), White Sox (June 22-23) and Tigers (Sept. 6-8).</p>
<p>They will travel to play the Tigers (April 20-22), Twins (April 23-25), Royals (May 31-June 1) and White Sox (Aug. 31-Sept. 1).</p>
<p>The Pirates are scheduled to play at home against the Braves on the Fourth of July, while they finish the year with a six-game homestand against the Cubs and Reds, ending Oct. 3.</p>
<p>The 2021 season marks the first time since 1968 that every team will open on the same date.</p>
<p>While the schedule release seems early — it usually occurs in August — doing it now likely allows teams more opportunity to sell tickets with business slow amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
