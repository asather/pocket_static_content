<h1>Pittsburgh Public Theater will offer live readings of classic plays</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Theater has carved out a new space in the digital world, heading online to reach the rest of us who are cocooning at home.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/511623303076141/" target="_blank">A Facebook page</a> is already up and running to herald Pittsburgh Public Theater Playtime, which debuts live at 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday, with readings from Shakespeare’s&nbsp;“Henry V.”</p>
<p>According to the online introduction, “PlayTime is a new online reading series, hosted live by artistic director Marya Sea Kaminski, that will bring great classic plays and the work of extraordinary Pittsburgh writers right to your living room, computer, or device.”</p>
<p>On Thursday and Friday, March 26 and 27, Kaminski and&nbsp;“special guests” will read from Oscar Wilde’s “The Importance of Being Earnest: A Trivial Comedy for Serious People.”</p>
<p>Last week, the Public was forced to cancel its production of&nbsp;“American Son” the day before opening night in response to the threat from COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“While our physical theater is closed, all of us at Pittsburgh Public Theater want to invite you into our artistic home in a new way,” the announcement read. The digital portal can be found at <a href="http://bit.ly/PPTPlayTime" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/PPTPlayTime</a>&nbsp;(this URL currently takes you to Zoom and offers prompts). The PlayTime series is free, but donations are welcome at <a href="/ppt.org/donate" target="_blank">ppt.org/donate</a>.</p>
