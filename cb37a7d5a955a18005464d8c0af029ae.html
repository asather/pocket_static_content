<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams didn’t sugarcoat his message to the American people Monday during television appearances.</p>
<p>“I want America to understand this week, it’s going to get bad,” Adams said on the “Today” show to discuss the spread of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, and why it’s continuing to spread so rapidly. “We really need to come together as a nation.”</p>
<p>It got bad quickly.</p>
<p>For the first time since the coronavirus pandemic reached U.S. soil, the country reported more than 100 deaths in a single day, according to tracking by The Washington Post. That pushed the newspaper’s death toll past 500 and the infection total to more than 41,000.</p>
<p>On “Today,” Adams went on to say the biggest problem contributing to the spread is the number of people who continue to gather in large groups and who are not practicing social distancing. The surgeon general pointed to news reports from over the weekend show people gathering on beaches in California and Florida despite warnings and orders from officials to stay home. He mentioned the same thing in Washington, where crowds gathered to see the District of Columbia’s cherry blossoms.</p>
<p>The surgeon general said: “I think that there are a lot of people who are doing the right things, but ... we're finding out a lot of people think this can't happen to them."</p>
<p>“Everyone needs to act as if they have the virus right now. So, test or no test, we need you to understand you could be spreading it to someone else. Or you could be getting it from someone else. Stay at home,” Adams also said.</p>
<p>Adams reminded the public that the numbers of coronavirus cases they see reported reflects what happened two weeks ago and stressed that mitigation measures, such as practicing social distancing and postponing elective surgeries, are designed to ignite a sense of urgency in Americans.</p>
<p>He noted, however, that they are only effective as early preventive tactics.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to be starting off my week with such a dire message for America,” Adams also said on “CBS This Morning.” “Things are going to get worse before they get better. We really need everyone to understand this.”</p>
