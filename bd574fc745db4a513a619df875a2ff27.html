<h1>Pro Football Focus' three best defenders in NFL all have Pittsburgh ties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All roads lead back to Pittsburgh, including the three best defensive players in the NFL.</p>
<p>Two Steelers — defensive tackle Cam Heyward and linebacker T.J. Watt — as well as Rams defensive tackle and Pittsburgh native Aaron Donald topped Pro Football Focus’ list of the NFL’s best defenders released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Donald, who went to Penn Hills and later Pitt, came in at No. 1 on PFF’s ranking with a 93.7 rating. Heyward was in second place with a 91.5 score and Watt rounded out the top three with a 91.3 rating.</p>
<p>At this point, Donald is used to racking up accolades like this. He was the NFL’s Defensive Player of the Year for the 2017-18 and 2018-19 seasons, and he <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DonaAa00.htm" target="_blank">finished this year</a> with 48 combined tackles, 12.5 sacks and two forced fumbles.</p>
<p>Watt and Heyward wreaked havoc in opposing backfields all season as the leaders of a dominant Steelers pass rush. They helped Pittsburgh go from a porous defense the previous few years to the <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/stats/team/_/view/defense/season/2019/seasontype/2" target="_blank">fifth-best unit in football</a> this season.</p>
<p>Pro Football Focus has been very complimentary of the Steelers this week. They had a lot of nice things to say earlier this week about defensive tackle Tyson Alualu and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/20/pittsburgh-steelers-Tyson-Alualu-minkah-fitzpatrick-antonio-brown-mike-mayock/stories/202001200062" target="_blank">his increased production</a> in 2019.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since the Steelers’ defense was this universally praised by the football community. Hopefully they keep up that quality of play going forward.</p>
