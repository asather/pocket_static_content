<h1>Now is the time to divide hostas and other perennials</h1>

<p>“Sleep, creep, leap” is a time-worn yet accurate adage used in describing how perennials grow.</p>
<p>A young plant will “sleep” the first season it’s in the ground. In year two, it “creeps” up in size but still will be well short of its predicted mature size. Year three brings the “leap” as an established and happy plant may fill the space perfectly, or it may outgrow its bounds.</p>
<p>Nature is not static: no plant grows to a mature size and just stops growing. In the early years, you’re anxious for plants to fill in. This is followed by a few years of “perfection,” followed by an era when the garden is overgrown! Some perennials fill in quickly while others take years to establish.</p>
<p>Perennials that outgrow their allotted space, show a decline in flower production or die out in the center can be divided to maintain their health and boundaries. Splitting a rare or favorite plant allows you to spread it throughout the garden or share it with another gardener. But be careful not to share a plant that is growing in an area impacted by either invasive weeds or animal species.</p>
<p>Local examples include stiltgrass and jumping worms. If any of these issues exist in your garden, be sure to rinse as much of the soil off of the plant’s roots as possible. Then you can replant secure in the knowledge that weed seeds and insect eggs are not hitching a ride to the new location.</p>
<p>Spring and fall are ideal times to divide perennials. Fall planting and division of herbaceous species should done in September through mid-October, while soil temperatures are warm enough for roots to begin to establish. Be sure to water new divisions if rainfall drops to below 1 inch per week.</p>
<p>If insects or disease are not an issue, leave some soil clinging to the roots of divisions. Soil protects the finest roots from dehydration and plants will be a bit less stressed. Transplants may look droopy on a warm day, or when rainfall is scarce, but in time the roots will make their way into the soil and the plants recover nicely. Some plants may become completely dormant only to return the following spring.</p>
<p>Dig up the plant you want to divide, shake some soil from the roots and observe the crown of the plant. This is the area where the top growth joins the roots. Some plants have fibrous roots, a tangled network of fine roots. Other perennials have more defined roots, with small distinct sections where the roots and top growth are attached or large, thick roots showing the same junction.</p>
<p>Roots can be pulled apart by hand, cut with garden shears or knife or split with a spade. If the plant is dying in the center, make divisions as you would cut a pie and discard the dead area in the center. A serrated bread knife is good tool for slicing up plants with fibrous roots. Be sure to have a healthy chunk of root and some top growth in your divisions. Large, thick roots may require a sharp spade to penetrate the root mass. Look for openings between sections of top growth and either drive your spade between them, or place a pair of garden forks between the areas and lever them apart.</p>
<p>To create a nice new patch of a groundcover, plant small divisions 6 or less inches apart. If you want one perennial to become a trio, divisions can be larger and spaced much further apart.</p>
<p>There are some perennials that “resent” division. Many have taproots or a central stem that can’t be pulled apart easily. Examples include balloon flower (<em>Platycodon</em>), Oriental poppy (<em>Papaver orientale</em>) and blue wild indigo (<em>Baptisia australis</em>).</p>
<p>Now is a good time to assess the perennials in your garden that are ripe for division. Getting some of the work done will reduce your labor during the busy spring months.</p>
