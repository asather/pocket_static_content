<h1>Owners of NBA's Sixers, NHL's Devils purchase stake in the Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers confirmed Monday that they have two new minority owners.</p>
<p>Financiers Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who own the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils, bought a stake for less than 5% of the team, according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-06-15/76ers-owners-harris-and-blitzer-acquire-stake-in-nfl-s-steelers" target="_blank">a report by Bloomberg News</a>. Harris and Blitzer also own Prudential Center in Newark, N.J., and the Crystal Palace soccer club in the English Premier League.</p>
<p>It’s the second time in less than a year the Steelers have welcome new investors. In December, Doug Ledba, a Pittsburgh native who founded Lending Tree, and NC Revocable Trust, a family-based trust in Pittsburgh, purchased a portion of the nearly 5% percent stake David Tepper held.</p>
<p>Tepper, the Stanton Heights native who bought the Carolina Panthers in 2018, had to divest his interest in the Steelers upon purchasing another NFL franchise. The remainder of Tepper’s stake was purchased by Pittsburgh Steelers Inc., the company that operates the team.</p>
<p>The Rooney family, which has owned the club since its inception in 1933, continues to run day-to-day operations of the team. Art Rooney II, the grandson of team founder Art Rooney, is the team’s president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am pleased that Josh Harris and David Blitzer have joined the Steelers ownership group,” Rooney II said in a statement. “Josh and David are successful sports business partners, and they are a welcomed addition to the Steelers family.”</p>
<p>According to the Bloomberg report, Harris and Blitzer will be silent investors with no input in day-to-day operations of the franchise. Thomas Tull,&nbsp;Rob Citrone, Bruce Rauner and former Steelers receiver John Stallworth are among other silent investors with the Steelers.</p>
<p>When Harris and Blitzer led the group that paid $280 million for the 76ers in 2011, they joined the growing ranks of financiers in the owners boxes of pro sports franchises. The list now includes Steve Pagliuca, Jeff Vinik, Phil Anschutz, David Bonderman, Tony Ressler and Marc Lasry.</p>
<p>While the financiers are partners in sports, they’re rivals on Wall Street. Harris made his multibillion-dollar fortune as a cofounder of Apollo Global Management Inc., while Blitzer runs the Tactical Opportunities group at rival Blackstone Group Inc. The Steelers stake won’t be part of the holding company they formed in 2017, Harris Blitzer Sports &amp; Entertainment, according to the people familiar with the transaction.</p>
