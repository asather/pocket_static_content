<p>Rest easy, East Enders: Beloved Vietnamese restaurant Tram’s Kitchen is not closed. It’s just getting its close-up.</p>
<p>A Reddit post Tuesday morning caused an online panic when it stated that Tram’s had apparently closed and been replaced with a physical therapy and wellness center. The evidence? A large new sign.</p>
<p>Turns out the new sign was part of a faux facade (faux-cade?) put up for Tuesday night filming of “Sweetgirl,” a Netflix movie starring Jason Momoa and Marisa Tomei.</p>
<p>Tram’s was open for lunch business as usual on Tuesday afternoon. A sandwich board sign out front made it clear: “TRAM’S IS OPEN.”</p>
<p>Le Thao and his wife, Truong Bac Cuc, came to Pittsburgh in 1993 and opened Tram’s in 1997 at 4039 Penn Ave. in Lawrenceville. The&nbsp;little restaurant and its authentic Vietnamese food quickly built a cult following.</p>
<p>The restaurant is named for the couple’s daughter,&nbsp;Le Dinh Ngoc Tram, who had to remain behind in Vietnam when they first emigrated to the United States in 1992.&nbsp;An April 2000 Post-Gazette story&nbsp;<a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/regionstate/20000413trams3.asp" target="_blank">chronicled the family’s effort to reunite</a>.</p>
<p>The rest of the family went first to California to live with relatives there who sponsored them.&nbsp;They moved to Pittsburgh in 1993 because their younger son, Thien, needed a kidney transplant.</p>
<p>Finally, in April 2000, Tram and her family succeeded in untangling a ball of red tape between the two countries and were reunited here in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
