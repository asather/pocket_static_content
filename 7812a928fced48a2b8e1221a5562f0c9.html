<h1>NFL cancels owner's meetings; offseason schedule, for now, remains in place</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following the lead of other professional sports leagues, the National Football League has altered its offseason due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>After consulting with medical experts, the NFL has canceled its annual owner’s meetings, which were set to take place in March 29-April 1 in Palm Beach, Fla.</p>
<p>“There will be full consideration and votes on any open football issues, including rules, bylaws and resolution, as well as any other business matters that were on the agenda for the annual meeting, at the spring meeting scheduled for May 19-20,” league spokesman Brian McCarty said in a statement. “Most of the first day will be dedicated to football-related issues. Head coaches and general managers will participate in the meeting.</p>
<p>“This decision was made consistent with the league’s primary concern to protect the health of club and league employees and the public while enabling the league to continue with its essential business operations. We will continue to closely monitor developments, consult with leading experts, and be prepared to make any changes necessary as circumstances warrant.”</p>
<p>Some teams have begun pulling coaches and scouts off the road, where they are attending pro days across the country. Some universities are canceling their pro days.</p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Kevin Colbert were at Clemson on Thursday, but all scouts and coaches who had been on the road are returning home, according to team spokesman Burt Lauten. There are no plans to send personnel back on the road for the next few days as the team continues to evaluate the situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Thursday afternoon, the league planned to keep its offseason schedule in place. The deadline to place the franchise or transition tag on players is currently set for 11:59 a.m. Monday and the legal tampering period for free agents begins one minute later at noon. Free agency is scheduled to begin Wednesday, the first day of the new league year. All teams must be in compliance with the salary cap by March 18.</p>
<p>The next big date on the NFL’s offseason calendar is the entry draft, which is scheduled for April 23-25 in Las Vegas.</p>
<p>“It’s unfortunate that the League meetings have been cancelled but appropriate under the circumstances,” team president Art Rooney II said.&nbsp;“Hopefully we will be able to conduct some League business through remote channels over the next few weeks.”&nbsp;</p>
