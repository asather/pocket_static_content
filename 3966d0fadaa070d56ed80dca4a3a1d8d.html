<h1>Ohio’s governor orders mandatory use of face masks in 7 hardest-hit counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Tuesday reversed course again and ordered the mandatory use of face masks in his state’s seven counties hardest hit by coronavirus.</p>
<p>Residents of Huron, Cuyahoga, Franklin, Trumbull, Hamilton, Butler, and Montgomery counties must wear facial coverings when in public indoor locations such as bars, restaurants, and shops, outdoors when unable to maintain social distancing, and on public and shared transit.</p>
<p>The mandate takes effect Wednesday at 6 p.m.</p>

<p>Things have changed, Mr. DeWine said, from when he opted in April not to follow through with a proposed statewide order requiring the wearing of face masks by nearly everyone in public, saying at the time that he feared that would have been one step too far in terms of government orders.</p>
<p>“We are now at a different time,” he said. “We are in a much more dangerous time, and we’re at a point in time where I believe Ohioans — when they look at Texas, when they look at Florida — will say we do not want to go there, and we’re willing to accept in seven red counties that are red hot that wearing masks out in public is absolutely imperative.”</p>
<p>Children under the age of 10 and people with a medical excuse are exempted from the face mask requirement.</p>
<p>The number of cases, deaths, hospitalizations, and intensive-care stays from the coronavirus in Ohio have surged far above already climbing daily averages over the past three weeks.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, Ohio had been cresting with an average well below 500 new infections a day — not the steady decline Mr. DeWine wanted but a stability that he claimed allowed him to proceed with plans to slowly reopen the state’s economy.</p>
<p>Since then the numbers have climbed, hitting 1,301 on Thursday, the highest rate seen since April’s peak. The state has seen its daily average of new cases balloon over the past three weeks to 804. It reported 948 new infections on Tuesday.</p>
<p>So far the state has not experienced the kind of corresponding surges in hospitalizations, intensive-care unit stays, and deaths as seen in some southern and western states such as Arizona, Florida, and Texas. But even those numbers were climbing Tuesday. Mr. DeWine credited part of that to a potential lag in reports over the holiday weekend.</p>
<p>Deaths more than doubled the daily average with 43 new deaths. Hospitalizations totaled 134 for the day, more than twice the 21-day average.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/faces-of-covid-19/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/04/15/faces-of-covid-19-stories-behind-local-lives-lost" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The state is using a four-color guide with red indicating those counties at the second-highest level of risk. No counties are in the highest level of purple, but Franklin is considered to be on the cusp.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said that it is not the responsibility of businesses to enforce the mask mandate among their customers in their counties. That remains the responsibility of state and local departments of health.</p>
<p>A violation of a state health order during a state of emergency remains a misdemeanor, punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a fine of $750. The General Assembly recently sent the governor Senate Bill 55, which would reduce the severity of such an offense from a criminal violation to a civil violation with a possibility of a fine. Mr. DeWine has said he will veto that bill.</p>
<p>“It would be a tragic mistake, and I’m not going to allow it to happen,” he said. “It is a very serious crisis. It’s a crisis we have not seen in the state for 102 years... We have to treat it like the crisis it is. Having the ability to very carefully do the things that need to be done is essential to our coming back.”</p>
<p>He noted that governors who had previously indicated they would never require masks are now doing so.</p>
<p>“They’re doing that because they’re looking at the data,” Mr. DeWine said. “They’re doing it because frankly they’re afraid, and they’re justifiably afraid of what is going on. We are not going to lock a lot of Ohioans up. That is not what we’re about, but we have to have the ability to enforce orders.”</p>
<p>The Ohio General Assembly also has its first known coronavirus patient. Cleveland Democratic Rep. Stephanie Howse, president of the Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, announced late Monday via a video tweet that she had tested positive.</p>
<p>“My symptoms are pretty mild,” she said. “I was on the phone this morning really just trying to contact the people I had been in touch with over these past two weeks.”</p>
<p>She encouraged people to wear masks. Democrats have been critical of some of their Republican colleagues for their refusal to do so on the House floor. The House last had voting session early in the morning of June 12.</p>
<p>A positive test among a staff member in the state Senate prompted Sen. Teresa Fedor, D-Toledo, to refuse to return to session until there is an agreement among her colleagues addressing the fact that many Republican senators have not worn masks. She subsequently tested negative.</p>
