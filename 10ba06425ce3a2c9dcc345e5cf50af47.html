<h1>2020 NFL draft: Ray Fittipaldo's top five players at each position</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Ray Fittipaldo breaks down the top five prospects at each position heading into the 2020 NFL draft:</em></p>
<p><strong>QUARTERBACKS</strong></p>
<p><em>Name, height, weight, school, 40-yard dash, class</em></p>
<p>1. Joe Burrow, 6-3, 221, LSU, NA, Sr. — Former Buckeye led LSU to national title after transfer. Cincinnati should bring him back home as the No. 1 pick.</p>
<p>2. Tua Tagovailoa, 6-0, 217, Alabama, NA, Jr. — Dual-threat southpaw with national championship pedigree, but hip injury is worrisome.</p>
<p>3. Justin Herbert, 6-6, 236, Oregon, 4.68, Sr. — Big, strong-armed and fast to boot. Has to become a more accurate passer.</p>
<p>4. Jordan Love, 6-4, 224, Utah State, 4.74, Jr. — Has to cut down on INTs, but Love has the size, arm and athletic ability teams covet.</p>
<p>5. Jacob Eason, 6-6, 231, Washington, 4.89, Jr. — Prototypical pocket passer, but lack of mobility means his offensive line must be strong.</p>
<p><strong>RUNNING BACKS</strong></p>
<p>1. D’Andre Swift, 5-8, 212, Georgia, 4.48, Jr. — Has the skills to step in as a rookie and start after earning all-SEC honors last season.</p>
<p>2. Jonathan Taylor, 5-11, 226, Wisconsin, 4.39, Jr. — Productive, durable and a home-run threat. Mileage and fumbling are concerns.</p>
<p>3. Cam Akers, 5-10, 217, Florida State, 4.47, Jr. — An elusive and tough three-down feature back, Akers will be a better pro than college player.</p>
<p>4. Clyde Edwards-Helaire, 5-7, 207, LSU, 4.60, Jr. — Creative runner with strong receiving skills, but there are questions about his size and ability to pass protect.</p>
<p>5. J.K. Dobbins, 5-9, 209, Ohio State, NA, Jr. — Three-year starter that relies on hard-nosed running style and power.</p>
<p><strong>RECEIVERS</strong></p>
<p>1. Jerry Jeudy, 6-1, 193, Alabama, 4.45, Jr. — Electric playmaker that can stretch the field but also is effective with short and intermediate routes.</p>
<p>2. Ceedee Lamb, 6-2, 198, Oklahoma, 4.5, Jr. — Big-play potential every time he touches the ball. He averaged 21.4 yards per catch.</p>
<p>3. Henry Ruggs III, 5-11, 188, Alabama, 4.27, Jr. — Fastest player in the draft with good hands to boot. Size against physical corners is a concern.</p>
<p>4. Tee Higgins, 6-4, 216, Clemson, NA, Jr. — Deep threat with excellent ball skills, Higgins scored 13 touchdowns with only 59 receptions.</p>
<p>5. Laviska Shenault, 6-1, 227, Colorado, 4.58, Jr. — Dynamic playmaker that can rack up yards after the catch. Has speed and ball skills to be a dangerous deep threat, too. Injury history is a concern.</p>
<p><strong>TIGHT ENDS</strong></p>
<p>1. Harrison Bryant, 6-5, 243, Florida Atlantic, 4.73, Sr. — Good after the catch and plays faster than he timed. Should become a good blocker once he adds strength.</p>
<p>2. Cole Kmet, 6-6, 262, Notre Dame, 4.7, Jr. — Good hands but more of a brute after the catch than elusive runner. Must improve as a blocker, but he has the size to do it.</p>
<p>3. Albert Okwuegbunam, 6-5, 258, Missouri, 4.49 Jr. — Classic pass-catching tight end with speed to threaten defenses. Injuries and lack of big-time production are concerns.</p>
<p>4. Adam Trautman, 6-5, 255, Dayton, Sr. — Solid pass-catcher that must improve his blocking. Can he make the big jump from FCS to NFL?</p>
<p>5. Dalton Keene, 6-4, 253, Virginia Tech, Jr. — Underrated and versatile tight end that can play H-back and fullback, too. A creative offensive coordinator will carve out a role for him.</p>
<p><strong>CENTERS</strong></p>
<p>1. Lloyd Cushenberry, 6-3, 312, LSU, Jr. — Proved himself on the big stage with all-SEC honors. Powerful enough to handle big noses and strong in pass protection.</p>
<p>2. Cesar Ruiz, 6-3, 307, Michigan, 5.08, Jr. — Athletic option for a zone-heavy scheme. Bigger defensive tackles will challenge him because he lacks pure power.</p>
<p>3. Tyler Biadasz, 6-4, 314, Wisconsin, NA, Jr. — Three-year starter helped pave the way for Jonathan Taylor. Strong with his technique.</p>
<p>4. Nick Harris, 6-1, 302, Washington, 5.1, Sr. — Quickness and toughness makes up for his lack of size. Has experience at guard, which will be a plus for teams looking for versatility.</p>
<p>5. Matt Hennessy, 6-4, 307, Temple, 5.18, Jr. — Another undersized but tough player with plenty of starting experience. Has to get stronger.</p>
<p><strong>GUARDS</strong></p>
<p>1. Robert Hunt, 6-5, 323, Louisiana-Lafayette, NA, Sr. — Played tackle his final two college seasons but best fit might be inside. Versatility is a big plus.</p>
<p>2. Netane Muti, 6-3, 315, Fresno State, NA, Jr. — The best power blocker among interior prospects, Muti did 44 reps on the bench at the combine. Injury history is a big concern.</p>
<p>3. John Simpson, 6-4, 321, Clemson, 5.24, Sr. — Another power blocker that will thrive in a downhill scheme. Plug-and-play potential.</p>
<p>4. Shane Lemieux, 6-4, 310, Oregon, 5.11, Sr. — A four-year starter and another tough power blocker on the inside.</p>
<p>5. Damien Lewis, 6-2, 327, LSU, 5.24, Sr. — Stout run-blocker with athletic limitations. Does not offer position flexibility, which decreases his value.</p>
<p><strong>TACKLES</strong></p>
<p>1. Jedrick Wills, 6-4, 312, Alabama, 5.05, Jr. — The best of a strong crop of tackles. He’s the total package and ready to start as a rookie.</p>
<p>2. Tristan Wirfs, 6-5, 320, Iowa, 4.85, Jr. — Rare true freshman starter at Iowa. Ready-made starter with big upside if he continues to develop. Can play guard, too.</p>
<p>3. Mekhi Bechton, 6-7, 364, Louisville, 5.1, Jr. — Humungous and athletic, Bechton could develop into one of the best players in this draft. Ability to manage his weight is a concern.</p>
<p>4. Andrew Thomas, 6-5, 315, Georgia, 5.22, Jr. — Played left side in college but could find a home on the right side in the NFL. Lacks elite athleticism, but excels as a competitor.</p>
<p>5. Isaiah Wilson, 6-6, 350, Georgia, 5.32, Soph. — NFL teams will be drawn to his size and upside. Possesses traits to be a longtime starter at right tackle.</p>
<p><strong>INSIDE LINEBACKERS</strong></p>
<p>1. Isaiah Simmons, 6-4, 238, Clemson, 4.39, Jr. — One of the most versatile players in this draft. Has experience at safety, corner and linebacker. Perfect chess piece for today’s NFL.</p>
<p>2. Patrick Queen, 6-0, 229, LSU, 4.5, Jr. — Another in a long line of LSU linebackers. Devin White went in the top 5 last year. Queen is a likely first-round pick, as well.</p>
<p>3. Kenneth Murray, 6-2, 241, Oklahoma, 4.52, Jr. — Sideline-to-sideline player with size and speed NFL teams covet. Three years as a starter in the Big 12.</p>
<p>4. Zack Baun, 6-2, 238, Wisconsin, 4.65, Jr. — Played on the edge in college, but does not have size to play there on a full-time basis in the NFL. Right coach will find a place for him to thrive.</p>
<p>5. Logan Wilson, 6-2, 241, Wyoming, 4.63, Jr. — Three-year college starter with three-down potential in the NFL. Versatile skill set geared toward spread game.</p>
<p><strong>OUTSIDE LINEBACKERS</strong></p>
<p>1. K’Lavon Chaisson, 6-3, 254, LSU, NA, Soph. — Only one year as a full-time starter in college, but has loads of potential. Earned first-team all-SEC honors last fall.</p>
<p>2. Terrell Lewis, 6-5, 262, Alabama, NA, Jr. — Long and athletic edge rusher that has to add strength to deal with NFL tackles. Long injury history that wiped out almost two seasons a concern, as well.</p>
<p>3. Jabari Zuniga, 6-3, 264, Florida, 4.64, Sr. — Another defensive end that was asked to work out with the linebackers at the combine, Zuniga is another player that projects as either a 4-3 end or 3-4 outside linebacker. An ankle injury limited him to six games last fall.</p>
<p>4. Jonathan Greenard, 6-3, 263, Florida, 4.87, Sr. — Like Zuniga, his teammate with the Gators, Greenard is likely to play 3-4 outside linebacker in the NFL. Earned all-SEC honors after posting 9 ½ sacks after transferring from Louisville.</p>
<p>5. Anfernee Jennings, 6-2, 256, Alabama, NA, Sr. — Well-schooled and technically sound, Jennings might be the most well-rounded 3-4 outside linebacker prospect in this draft. Not an elite athlete, but he produced big-time when healthy for the Crimson Tide.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSIVE ENDS</strong></p>
<p>1. Chase Young, 6-5, 264, Ohio State, NA, Jr. — Widely regarded as the best player in this draft. Following in the footsteps of the Bosa brothers as the next elite edge rusher out of Ohio State; posted 16 ½ sacks last fall.</p>
<p>2. A.J. Epenesa, 6-5, 275, Iowa, 5.04, Jr. — Produced big numbers in college with 26 ½ sacks in three seasons. Poor testing at the combine might decrease his value, as it’s unlikely now that he projects to a 3-4 outside linebacker.</p>
<p>3. Yetur Gross-Matos, 6-5, 266, Penn State, NA, Jr. — Recorded 17 ½ sacks over the past two seasons; has to add some weight and strength to excel against NFL linemen.</p>
<p>4. Marlon Davidson, 6-3, 303, Auburn, 5.04, Sr. — Four-year starter who recorded 7 ½ sacks last fall. Has size to play inside, but he did most of his damage as an end.</p>
<p>5. Alton Robinson, 6-3, 264, Syracuse, 4.69, Sr. — Produced 14 ½ sacks the past two seasons and has versatility and athleticism to fit almost any scheme. Must add more variety to pass-rush repertoire.</p>
<p><strong>DEFENSIVE TACKLES</strong></p>
<p>1. Derrick Brown, 6-5, 326, Auburn, 5.16, Sr. — The best interior lineman in this draft. He can wreak havoc in the running game and as a pass rusher.</p>
<p>2. Javon Kinlaw, 6-5, 324, South Carolina, NA, Jr. — First-team All-American last fall. Best pass rush move is bull rush so he’ll have to expand his repertoire in the NFL.</p>
<p>3. Ross Blacklock, 6-3, 290, TCU, 4.9, Jr. — All-Big 12 last fall after missing the 2018 season with an Achilles’ injury. Must improve as a run defender, but he’s a gifted pass rusher.</p>
<p>4. Jordan Elliott, 6-4, 302, Missouri, 5.02, Jr. — Technically sound and athletic enough to fit any scheme, Elliott should hear his name called in the first two rounds. Only six career sacks.</p>
<p>5. Justin Madubuike, 6-3, 293, Texas A&amp;M, 4.83, Jr. — Tallied 12 sacks, 3 forced fumbles and 1 INT the past two seasons..</p>
<p><strong>CORNERBACKS</strong></p>
<p>1. Jeff Okudah, 6-1, 205, Ohio State, 4.48, Jr. — Earned first-team All-American honors in his only season as a starter. Hands down the top corner in this class.</p>
<p>2. C.J. Henderson, 6-1, 204, Florida, 4.39, Jr. — Has the size and athleticism to excel on the outside. Six career interceptions and two went for touchdowns when he was a freshman.</p>
<p>3. Jeff Gladney, 5-10, 191, TCU, 4.48, Sr. — Teams must decide if he’s an outside corner or a slot corner due to his size, but Gladney he had five career interceptions and earned all-Big 12 honors last fall.</p>
<p>4. Jaylon Johnson, 6-0, 193, Utah, 4.5, Jr. — Part of a talented Utes secondary that could have three players drafted. Johnson has athleticism and technique to make an impact as a rookie.</p>
<p>5. Trevon Diggs, 6-1, 205, Alabama, NA, Sr. — Brother of Bills receiver Stephon Diggs. Trevon played some receiver as a freshman but settled in at corner for his final three years and earned second-team all-SEC honors.</p>
<p><strong>SAFETIES</strong></p>
<p>1. Xavier McKinney, 6-0, 201, Alabama, 4.63, Jr. — Versatile player that can play free and strong safety and slot corner. Returned interceptions for touchdowns in each of the past two seasons.</p>
<p>2. Kyle Dugger, 6-1, 217, Lenoir-Rhyne, 4.49, Jr. — Elite athlete and multi-faceted defender that has to prove he can make the jump from Division II to the NFL. Adds value as a return specialist.</p>
<p>3. Ashtyn Davis, 6-1, 202, California, NA, Sr. — Former walk-on that also excelled in track. Has versatility and toughness that will make him more valuable for coaches that covet variety in sub-packages.</p>
<p>4. Grant Delpit, 6-2, 213, LSU, NA, Jr. — Played safety for the national champs, but has size to potentially become a nickel linebacker. Earned first-team All-American honors as a sophomore.</p>
<p>5. Antoine Winfield Jr., 5-9, 203, Minnesota, 4.45, Soph. — Big-time production last fall with 88 tackles, 7 INTs and 3 sacks that earned him first-team All-American honors. Injuries cut short his previous two seasons.</p>
