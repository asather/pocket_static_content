<h1>Seneca Valley math teacher multiplies food, generosity </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tracy Richards was in line for lunch at a Chick Fil-A when a Seneca Valley High School graduate she knew paid for her meal.</p>
<p>That generous gesture inspired the seventh-grade math teacher to organize a grassroots effort to feed hungry families in the Seneca Valley School District. The Butler County district has about 7,300 students.</p>
<p>On the same day in late March, Mrs. Richards heard from a school guidance counselor about yet another family that had no money or food.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I drove to Aldi and bought groceries,” said Mrs. Richards, who teaches at Ryan Gloyer Middle School in Harmony.</p>
<p>Soon, the one-car garage at her Zelienople home became the drop-off point for donations. Parents, students and school district employees stopped by with&nbsp;peanut butter and jelly, pancake mix, spaghetti, tomato sauce and toiletries. Last week,&nbsp;Mrs. Richards and other volunteers delivered food to 20 families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some people get a large bag that is jam-packed. Some people get many boxes. It all depends on the need,” she said in a telephone interview.</p>
<p>As word of the effort spread, a Cranberry&nbsp; woman volunteered to be a drop-off point for food donations. Students on the Seneca Valley volleyball team, which Mrs. Richards coaches, stepped up and so did students who play on a district soccer team.</p>
<p>Mrs. Richards coordinated the food packaging at her house. Fourth-grade teachers from one school donated snacks. Treats also arrived from the track and field concession stand. Hundreds of dollars in donations came in, too.</p>
<p>“Parents of my students are coming to my house to drop off food,” said Mrs. Richards, who teaches math to 115 students. Lisa Kasper, a special education teacher, helped with deliveries and shopping.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re going to go on as long as the donations keep coming,” Mrs. Richards said. Her email address is richardstg@svsd.net</p>
