<h1>City Council to 'start from scratch' on parks trust fund bill</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Wednesday all but started over on establishing a parks tax trust fund after an initial proposal to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/21/anthony-coghill-deb-gross-pittsburgh-parks-tax-split-among-nine-districts/stories/202001210116" target="_blank">split the money equally among the nine districts</a> proved controversial and&nbsp;the city’s law department rejected multiple aspects of the bill.</p>
<p>Members unanimously approved a bare-bones version to replace the original seven-section bill that council members Anthony Coghill and Deb Gross introduced on Jan. 21.</p>
<p>“It’s very generic. I think you’re going to see some more changes,” Council President Theresa Kail-Smith said after the standing committee meeting.&nbsp; “But we really wanted to make sure that we had something to work on without killing Councilman Coghill’s bill.”</p>
<p>According to Ms. Kail-Smith, at her request Mr. Coghill and Councilman Ricky Burgess — who were at odds over Mr. Coghill’s proposal — are working together.</p>
<p>The half-mill property tax increase to fund city parks <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2019/11/06/Pittsburgh-parks-tax-vote-referendum-dilemma-city-council-conservancy-Bill-Peduto/stories/201911060143" target="_blank">passed in a close November vote</a> after the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, with public support from Mayor Bill Peduto, petitioned for the ballot referendum.</p>
<p>“We promised the people that we would be equitable in the distribution of these funds, so that’s my priority,” Mr. Burgess said. “... This current amendment is the beginning of crafting an equitable, implementable, legal piece of legislation.”</p>
<p>A Law Department opinion issued Jan. 28 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/01/29/Council-bill-on-parks-tax-money-delayed-by-legal-opinion/stories/202001290144" target="_blank">found that the original proposal&nbsp;clashed with the city’s Home Rule Charter</a>, as it aimed to establish council as a governing board of trustees for the money and to house the funds in the City Clerk’s budget.</p>
<p>The amended one-page legislation strikes those two provisions as well as language that the funds could be used to hire additional unionized city employees. Rather, it specifies that the city’s already established competitive bidding and contracting policies should be applied.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Any mention of splitting the parks money nine ways has also been removed.</p>
<p>“We decided in the spirit of cooperation let’s start from scratch, let’s get all city council members’ opinions, and we’re going to craft something. It’s not going to be easy, but we’re going to do it,” Mr. Coghill said. “I will continue to argue for the nine equal sub accounts, and I think I made a pretty good case as to why.”</p>
<p>Mr. Coghill, who represents District 4, said that the mayor’s six-year capital projects outlook includes little or no investment in his district’s parks.</p>
<p>“I’m the president of the Beechview Athletic Association, our facilities are falling to pieces. [At] the Brookline dek hockey rink, they’re using outhouses. These things I want done right away, I can’t wait for 25 parks to be fixed up before mine,” he said, referring to a list of parks prioritized by an&nbsp;“equitable” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/07/15/Pittsburgh-Parks-Conservancy-400-million-behind-repairs-165-parks/stories/201907150087" target="_blank">“investment priority score” that the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy campaigned on</a>.</p>
<p>Ms. Gross — who said she was never sold on splitting the funding nine equal ways -— said&nbsp;“the important part is that the money stays in the public’s eyes and that they get to participate in the debates on the allocations, and not that [funds] get [diverted] to some special agreement that they can’t see.”</p>
<p>City Controller Michael Lamb’s office is currently auditing 54 existing agreements between the city and the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy.</p>
<p>Council motioned to hold the amended bill for three weeks and to schedule a public hearing.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy declined to comment.</p>
