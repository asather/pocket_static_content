<h1>#OneDay fundraiser aims to help nonprofits providing critical pandemic needs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeremiah’s Place, a crisis nursery in Lincoln-Lemington that offers 24/7 child care, has experienced its own series of crises during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The state ordered it closed in mid-March when all but essential businesses shut down to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The nursery gained a waiver to reopen in April to care for the children of essential workers.&nbsp;By then, some of its own employees opted not to return because of health concerns or because they needed to be home with their own children to oversee virtual learning.</p>
<p>In mid-May, it reopened with limited capacity because of COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>On July 21, it shut down again for two weeks after staff learned a child had been exposed to the coronavirus at another child care facility.</p>
<p>That case “was really several degrees past us,” said Lisa Perry, executive director of Jeremiah’s Place, “but we wanted to make sure we were being careful so that everybody feels safe.”</p>
<p>The nursery offers free care and has seen its annual budget of nearly $900,000 wither during the pandemic as individuals and businesses pull back on donations that pay for diapers, formula, and other necessary supplies.</p>
<p>Ms. Perry hopes an online fundraiser set for Wednesday —&nbsp;the #OneDay Critical Needs Alert, sponsored by the Pittsburgh Foundation — will give a boost to Jeremiah’s Place and other nonprofits in the region that have taken a significant hit as they continue to provide services during the virus crisis.</p>
<p>The nursery is one of about 200 organizations in Allegheny and Westmoreland counties registered as recipients for the fundraiser that will run from 8 a.m. to 11:59 p.m.</p>
<p>Donations can be made at <a href="https://www.pittsburghgives.org/" target="_blank">www.pittsburghgives.org</a>.</p>
<p>The foundation aims to raise $1 million in donations, said Kelly Uranker, director of the foundation’s Center for Philanthropy.</p>
<p>It will supplement the total with a matching pool of $450,000 that will be prorated among the recipients, with $425,000 going to agencies in Allegheny County and $25,000 for groups in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>The money will target nonprofits that provide food, child care, housing, transportation and physical and mental health services.</p>
<p>In April, as the foundation was appealing for dollars for its Emergency Action Fund that eventually raised $9 million for &nbsp;pandemic needs, it scheduled the #OneDay event to provide additional support for nonprofits’ operating budgets, said Ms. Uranker.</p>
<p>“Nonprofits are feeling the strain because of COVID-19,” she said. “They are seeing increased volumes … and even more people coming through the doors.”</p>
<p>Many, including Jeremiah’s Place, incurred added expenses for personal protective equipment and sanitation supplies, Ms. Uranker noted.</p>
<p>A survey by the Nonprofit Finance Fund of 465 nonprofits nationwide found that during the pandemic, 75% had lower earned revenue, 50% had decreased contributions and 27% received less government support.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The combination of surging demand for critical services and the absence of fundraising events due to COVID-19 restrictions “is really a double whammy” for nonprofits, said Bobbi Watt Geer, chief executive of the United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>During a virtual town hall last week attended by 450 people including community leaders and United Way donors, Ms. Watt Geer said United Way has raised close to $8 million in crisis funding since March and most has been distributed for needs including summer food programs for students; and rent, mortgage payments and utilities for struggling individuals and families.</p>
<p>The total includes $4 million United Way received in federal dollars from the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>
<p>That money was targeted for student food programs.</p>
<p>Critical needs rising from the COVID-19 crisis will be a central focus to United Way’s annual campaign that kicks off in the fall, said Ms. Watt Geer.</p>
<p>The pandemic has stretched into “a marathon, not a sprint,” she said, “so we’re working to keep families in our region afloat.”</p>
<p>Jeremiah’s Place was one of approximately 300 agencies that received a grant from the Pittsburgh Foundation’s Emergency Action Fund.&nbsp;Its $30,000 award covered hazard pay for staff; food, diapers, wipes and other supplies for children it serves; and personal protective equipment for staff, said Ms. Perry.</p>
<p>“That’s been a game-changer,” she said.</p>
<p>But it still needs resources to make it through the year, said Ms. Perry.&nbsp;Since March, the agency has been providing extra support to its families in the form of pantry items, diapers and formula they can use at home.</p>
<p>It’s assembling backpacks filled with supplies for remote education classes.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t do my heart good at all not to serve these families,” said Ms. Perry.&nbsp;“And this year, we haven’t been able to rely on donations.”</p>
