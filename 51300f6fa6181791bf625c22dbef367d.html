<h1>Paul Zeise: NBA and NHL should think way outside the box to finish seasons</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NBA, NHL and Major League Baseball have all recently floated ideas about resuming or starting their seasons. The most common one has been the idea of a&nbsp;“bubble” scenario where all teams would go to one place and players are quarantined on some level.</p>
<p>There has been a lot of debate about these bubble city plans and</p>
<p>Many question how realistic these&nbsp;“bubble” plans are. I choose to operate under the assumption that there will be no sports until the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approves a plan that makes sense and ensures the safety of the players. Once that happens — and not a day before — all the rest of the details will fall into place quickly.</p>
<p>That being said, the NHL and the NBA would be very wise to begin to come up with alternative, smaller plans. Both leagues are running out of time to realistically finish the regular seasons that were suspended and complete the playoffs unless they want to run into next season.</p>
<p>Even if the CDC approved a plan today for both leagues to start in a “bubble “city with no fans, they wouldn’t be able to start playing for at least three or four weeks, and both leagues wouldn’t finish until late summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I don’t think that makes a lot of sense to go that deep into the year. The leagues should just scrap the regular seasons and go right to the playoffs. This would do two important things: Shrink the amount of time needed to complete the season and cut the number of teams needed to be brought to one place in half.</p>
<p>Another step could be to take only the top eight teams in the league regardless of conference. So the NHL would bring Boston, St Louis, Colorado, Tampa, Washington, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Las Vegas to one city. The NBA would bring Milwaukee, the LA Lakers, Toronto, the LA Clippers, Boston, Denver, Utah and Miami.</p>
<p>The NCAA tournament houses eight teams in one city every single year, so it wouldn’t be difficult to do. And the number of people needed to be tested and monitored for COVID-19 would be reduced by a large percentage. Also, because they are playoffs and only the winner advances, the number of teams in the bubble city would be cut in half after every round.</p>
<p>It isn’t ideal and there wouldn’t be nearly as many games to try and monetize, but at this point that has to be secondary. There will enough games on TV for a sports-starved nation that the leagues and networks should be able to sell advertising and sponsors to make money. There would have to be a negotiated playoff share for players, but that’s a minor detail as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This kind of thinking would make all of these scenarios so much easier to pull off as well as so much more realistic for even the toughest critics to understand and accept. Yes, it sucks that only eight teams would make the playoffs and that neither league would get to finish properly, but it would enable them to salvage something out of what is looking now like lost seasons.</p>
