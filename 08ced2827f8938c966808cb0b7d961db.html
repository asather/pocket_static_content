<h1>Ben Cherington talks offseason plans for Pirates prospects</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The path forward for some of the Pirates’ prospects is unclear.</p>
<p>Players such as infielders Oneil Cruz and 2020 first-round selection Nick Gonzales were added to the Pirates’ alternate training site in 2020, an opportunity for some of the key fixtures of the future to get guaranteed instruction and training.</p>
<p>Time and again, though, general manager Ben Cherington has noted that the alternate training site is the best any team can do during the COVID-19 pandemic, but it is not a replacement for actual games.</p>
<p>The hope was always that there would be some sort of fall league or format for instruction for those prospects and other players who didn’t play in the majors this season, and while Cherington has said in recent days that hope may be coming to fruition, it isn’t a catch-all. After all, there are far too many prospects in the Pirates’ system to send them all to their spring training site in Bradenton, Fla., and safely put together a league.</p>
<p>So the Pirates will have to send some home. That includes Cruz, who will head back to the Dominican Republic, where Cherington hopes he will be able to participate in a winter league of some sort.</p>
<p>Really, it’s all in the air. The chief concern, of course, is safety. Cherington wouldn’t be comfortable with players hopping in to rogue offseason leagues just to get some work if COVID-19 testing and tracing protocols aren’t fully fleshed out.</p>
<p>“I think that’s the standard winter leagues will be held to. There’s still some information,” Cherington said Tuesday. “[I’m] hopeful that there is a way to solve for that because those opportunities can be really valuable for players. I think the baseball environment is one where we’d want to have a lot of confidence that there’s a safe plan in place, because you’re talking about putting lots of people from different places together in a very close environment. As we’ve seen, that’s where the spread can happen so quickly. When you’re talking about sending a player home, it ought to be a little more of a controlled environment.”</p>
<p>This is so important for the Pirates, and presumably every other MLB franchise, because they do feel they made some progress with players in Altoona. Cherington complimented the work the coaching staff did with Cruz, empowering him to be a leader with defensive work in the middle infield and replicating major-league at-bats as best as they could.</p>
<p>He pointed out how Gonzales, who joined Altoona’s group midseason, has been making hard contact against much more experienced pitchers in his first year as a professional player.&nbsp;Cherington explained the progress that outfielders Travis Swaggerty and Jared Oliva, both top-10 prospects, have made, too. Both are projected pieces of the future.&nbsp;But now, as was always going to be the case, they’ll have to split from Altoona.</p>
<p>“I believe we have players who got better this year despite the lack of games,” Cherington said. “That needs to be our mindset going forward, frankly. We’re not under any illusion that this is all of a sudden going to go back to perfectly normal — like, one day when we wake up in November, we’ll just put 2020 behind us and pretend. It’s just probably not going to be this way. It’s going to be some evolution, so we need to keep that ahead of us that our job is not to focus or react to this uncontrollable part of it, but simply, how do we keep getting better despite that?”</p>
<p><strong>Evaluating 2020</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the main aspect of Cherington’s job at this point, along with a team of staff members around him, is to evaluate what exactly the Pirates have in their organization.</p>
<p>As has been said before, that is hard to do in 2020 for a multitude of reasons. Cherington is the first one to acknowledge that usual statistics such as ERA and OPS are skewed because of how small the sample size is this season.</p>
<p>Instead, Cherington believes some of the eye-test sort of statistics are just as valuable as ever. That includes contact rate for pitchers and hitters, quality of pitchers’ stuff, swing decisions for hitters and things that don’t necessarily need a larger sample size to even out to what they normally would be.</p>
<p>“I would say actually as a whole, as a team, we can look at that and feel like there is enough information to tell us we have to get better at a lot of areas, clearly,” Cherington said. “That’s across the team, not any single position. But I would say with respect to individual players, we should be careful about evaluating too much, at least, the sort of top-line outcomes.”</p>
<p>Additionally, Cherington, manager Derek Shelton and the staff will have to evaluate their own performances. How they have used their time, the decisions Shelton made in-game, etc., will also be dissected.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a team of people who are helping [Shelton] and the coaching staff with whatever the best decision-making tools are,” Cherington said. “We’ve made a fair amount of change to what information we’re looking at, going into the games and during games. You have to learn from that. After games and certainly after the season, you have to reflect on that — what worked, what didn’t work, what do we need to continue to adjust, is there anything else we need to do, any other information we need in the prep.”</p>
<p><strong>Front office personnel</strong></p>
<p>The Atlanta Braves this week laid off an unspecified number of staff members, adding to a long list of cuts across MLB during a 2020 season without fans.</p>
<p>Cherington said Tuesday he had not seen that news, and that conversations about staff for 2021 have not yet become formal with the Pirates, though he hopes that changes soon.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to suggest that ... you’re never going to have change, that change is over. I think change is just part of baseball, right?” Cherington said. “There’s always going to be some amount of change, but I would say that certainly the majority of our focus is really looking forward to 2021 and the people that are going to be part of the Pirates’ baseball ops organization. And then also, are there people we need to add to that, and I would guess that we will have some additions to that going forward.”</p>
