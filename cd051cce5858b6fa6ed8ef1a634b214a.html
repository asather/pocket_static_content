<h1>'I can't give up hope,' furloughed dishwasher says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sometimes he wakes up and can’t breathe.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know where he is and struggles for air. He’ll throw on some clothes, run outside in the yard, panicked and suddenly hyperventilating.</p>
<p>“Fresh air, I opened this door, I’m free,” Mel Rose, an ex-con, said about reliving life behind bars half of his 43 years. “Then I have to calm down.”</p>
<p>Rose is out of prison, but the criminal life is never far from him, where addicts shoot up behind a broken-down panel truck on his Mount Oliver street and empty heroin packets litter the sidewalk. At the same time, he’s trying to find a job —&nbsp;and build a new life —&nbsp;after being laid off in March from an upscale restaurant, where he was a dishwasher for years.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>He is among more than a million Pennsylvanians who lost their jobs when the new coronavirus idled consumer spending, the engine of the U.S. economy, in March. He also is among nearly a quarter-million low-skill workers in Allegheny County who earn less than $15 an hour, according to Partner4Work, a Downtown-based nonprofit specializing in workforce issues.</p>
<p>And Rose isn’t alone: In the seven-county Pittsburgh metropolitan workforce of 1.2 million, 29% — or nearly a quarter-million people — have jobs that are classified as low skill, low wage, Partner4Work found. These are people who often live paycheck to paycheck.</p>
<p>Trevett Hooper, who co-owns Oakland restaurant All Day Legume with his wife, Sarah, called Rose a “once-in-a-decade dishwasher.” Someone who took pride in his work.</p>
<p>“He came in and said he really wanted to work, he asked me to give him a chance,” Mr. Hooper said. “You just don’t find people like that.”</p>
<p>Rose was hired on the spot in 2013.</p>
<p>Rose said he had less than $1 in his checking account when he was furloughed along with 51 others at Legume.</p>
<p>“Too much free time,” he scowls, looking over his street in a cool morning sun. “I’m going stir-crazy sitting in the house” where he lives with his wife, Tonya Evans, 38, and six children ages 7 to 20.</p>
<p>“This whole situation is trouble,” he said. “If I’m not working, I have too much idle time.”</p>
<p>Idle time was kindling for an out-of-control kid growing up on Pittsburgh’s tough streets, he said. Starting when he was just 14, idleness led to a life of illegal guns and drugs, pockets bulging with cash, and, for the first time, not having to ask anybody for anything.</p>
<p>In one four-month period back then, his earnings totaled $165,000. It was a time when he could turn $50 into $1,000.</p>
<p>With steadily increasing wages at Legume, Rose earned $14 an hour.</p>
<p>“Hustling — it’s a high,” he said. “Getting money is an addiction, a rush.”</p>
<p>The money and the rush led to Rose quitting school in ninth grade, stints behind bars, and, most recently, a stretch in prison for illegal drug and weapon charges. He was released last summer and went straight back to Legume to ask for his job back.</p>
<p>He was re-hired immediately.</p>
<p>For now, Rose’s wife, a nurse at a long-term care facility, is the breadwinner as he tries to break through the jammed state website to apply for jobless benefits. Having to ask his wife for money hurts, he said.</p>

<p>They’re fussing more than they had been.</p>
<p>Meanwhile. Mr. Hooper is trying to re-imagine his elegant sit-down place with white cloth tablecloths as a breezy takeout joint or maybe something else.</p>
<p>“We really don’t know what to do,” he said. “We tried opening for takeout. It’s just not what we do. We’re not at all set up for it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hooper is cooking some customer favorites for home delivery on Fridays —&nbsp;his latest try at re-invention. His family members do the deliveries.</p>
<p>For now, Rose is a jobless parolee with some dreams, a GED certificate and “misunderstood” tattooed over his right eye.</p>
<p>He fills his days thinking about the anger he pushed down for so many years, saying nothing and bottling it up inside until suddenly he’d explode, frightening those around him. He said he’s better at managing his emotions these days.</p>
<p>But temptation lingers.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid. Easy money is tempting,” Rose said. “I just can’t give up hope.”</p>
