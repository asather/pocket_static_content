<h1>Munch: A 'last supper' and salute to Pittsburgh's service industry</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We sat down together Sunday night over bowls of pasta and bottles of wine at Stagioni on the South Side for a supper that we well figured could be our last together in a public place for some time. Myself, my wife and my parents.</p>
<p>That restaurant is a special place to us. It’s two short blocks from our home. We had our wedding rehearsal dinner there. It’s been the site of so many wonderful moments from quiet dinners together at the bar to raucous, back-slapping affairs with friends, family and neighbors, punctuated by gut-busting laughter and fantastic fare. The staff have become good friends.</p>

<p>So we clinked glasses, dug in and spent time together. Eating. Talking. Laughing. Arguing. Not every moment was bliss. The churning anxiety of this particular moment in time was hard to ignore, like an 800-pound bottle of Purell in the room. But as a whole it was pure therapy to be with loved ones and, as always, the meal was excellent. They don’t call it comfort food for nothing.</p>
<p>We’d get home later that evening to learn of restaurant and bar shutdowns and facing the disappearance of half our household income: My wife is a bartender.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, longtime Post-Gazette sports columnist Ron Cook opined on enduring the first weekend without sports, and the value of sports to provide moments of joy, inspiration and relief during tough moments in our lives, whether they’re personal or collective, and he’s absolutely right.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence that this region’s love affair with the Steelers began in earnest when the steel industry itself was dying, and a winning team gave true psychological reprieve from a losing economy. It is the joy of the shared experience that makes it special. The Penguins, too. But you can’t eat a hockey puck.</p>
<p>So I’d say the exact same thing about dining and drinking out. Beyond meeting basic sustenance, it’s not just about the food or the drinks itself. It’s the experience — shared and personal. It’s about the gathering.</p>
<p>Restaurants, bars and, most importantly, the people who work in them bring color, flavor and camaraderie to our lives and to our neighborhoods. I moved to my neighborhood 18 years ago and have never left because of the abundance of dining and drinking options available and the genuine friendships I’ve made from the people who work there. There are too many to mention. I adore them all.</p>
<p>The relationship between bartender and regular is often somewhere on a spectrum between therapist and jester; they’re there to give you an ear and a laugh. The gathering spots themselves are public sanctuaries, albeit sanctuaries with brown liquor and buffalo wings. They are places to celebrate. To watch the game. To share a special dinner with your partner. To have a quiet solo respite with a glass of wine. To blow off steam at the end of the work day or week. To hunker down and just be around other people during, say, a snowstorm or after a wake.</p>
<p>When I learned that iconic dive Jack’s — which is open 365 days a year — had closed, it was symbolically disheartening. Jack's,&nbsp;and so many neighborhood haunts like it, are like a big hug from your favorite aunt who smokes too much and has a raspy voice or your stocky uncle that busts your chops relentlessly also but loves you to death.</p>
<p>These places and people are there for you, day in, day out, to serve you and make you feel good regardless of how their day is going. They work very, very hard for us to have a good time. They are among the kindest, give-you-the-shirt-off-their-back people I’ve ever known. And a lot of them are going to be hurting soon and for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>My wife’s restaurant is closed. She’s filed for unemployment. We will manage. Millions of others here and around the country are perilously close to the margins. My “little brother” from Big Brothers Big Sisters is 27 now and works hourly in a kitchen, and lives check to check. He’s a new father and is very worried. And there are so many like him. Some government bailout will be necessary. It’s always there for banks.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The news changes by the minute. Many restaurants have pivoted to offering takeout or delivery, which is still allowed for now, although that may change, too. While that is still an option, I would urge anyone who is financially able to call their favorite places and place an order, leave a nice tip and buy a gift card. And do it again.</p>
<p>This will eventually end. Science and history tell us as much. And when it does, we’ll reconvene at our favorite spots, and savor our favorite meals, and quaff our favorite drinks. But in the meantime, do not forget about our favorite people that work there that make it possible. Think of them and their families and help if you can. They are our neighbors.</p>
<p>Cheers to all of them. I hope we see you again very soon.</p>
