<h1>Derek Shelton: Keone Kela yet to work out with Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nearly a week into summer camp workouts, the Pirates are still without their closer, Keone Kela, although manager Derek Shelton said he’s not worried about Kela’s status or readiness for opening day.</p>
<p>The fact that Kela hasn’t practiced came about during an awkward exchange with Shelton on a Zoom call Wednesday night when a Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reporter asked whether Kela had been working out with the team.</p>
<p>Shelton said that Kela was not on the field Wednesday. When asked if Kela had worked out at all, Shelton said the closer had not. No reason was given for his absence.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Shelton was later asked whether the Pirates had incurred any sort of significant injury trouble thus far. (Reporters have only been allowed inside PNC Park since Tuesday due to an abundance of caution over Allegheny County COVID-19 regulations.)</p>
<p>“We're dealing with certain things,” Shelton said. “We're dealing with some minor things.</p>
<p>"Nothing that I think would put [Pirates director of sports medicine] Todd [Tomczyk] in front of you guys right yet but yeah, we definitely have dealt with some things.”</p>
<p>What could this all mean?</p>
<p>Either Kela is injured, and Shelton doesn’t feel it’s significant enough to have Tomczyk speak on it, or Kela could possibly be dealing with either COVID-19 concerns or a positive test.</p>
<p>Because of privacy laws, Shelton can only say it's a COVID-19 issue if the player grants permission, which reliever Blake Cederlind and outfielder Socrates Brito did last week.</p>
<p>Kela could have come in contact with someone who had the virus, although nearly a week when every-other-day testing is being utilized feels a little long.</p>
<p>The Pirates also got their last remaining batch of intake tests back Tuesday morning, meaning it’s not a late result keeping Kela from practicing.</p>
<p>Bottom line, nothing is known for sure, other than the fact that Kela has missed six days of workouts and counting but that he’s physically in Pittsburgh. Shelton said previously that all 40 players who are supposed to be working out in Pittsburgh are in the city.</p>
<p>Asked about Kela potentially missing time, Shelton did not sound concerned.</p>
<p>“I’m not worried about that in the least bit,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Noesi opts out</strong></p>
<p>Shelton said that pitcher Hector Noesi, who was in Pittsburgh as part of the 40-man group training at PNC Park, has opted out.</p>
<p>“I definitely respect and appreciate his decision, but after talking to some family members, he just thought it was better for his situation to opt out,” Shelton said. “We’re going to have situations where guys feel about certain things, and we’re definitely going to respect them and make sure that they’re supported in any way possible.”</p>
<p>The Pirates signed Noesi to a minor league deal in the offseason. He likely wasn’t going to make the 30-man roster when the season starts, but with a couple injuries, he could have earned a promotion.</p>
<p>Shelton said the Pirates, at this point, don’t expect to fill Noesi’s spot in the 60-man player pool, giving them two empty slots after Edgar Santana was suspended 80 games for PED use.</p>
<p>“As of now, we are not going to fill that,” Shelton said. “That’s not to say that in the coming days we are not going to fill it. As of now, we are not filling it.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Also conspicuously absent from the Pirates Twitter account has been reliever Kyle Crick. Shelton said Crick has worked out, although he has not yet been able to throw live.</p>
<p>Shelton said that Joe Musgrove threw five innings in a simulated game on Wednesday. Chad Kuhl went two.</p>
