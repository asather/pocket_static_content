<h1>Paul Zeise: Western Pa. has impressive history of producing black sports pioneers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Monday was Martin Luther King Jr. Day, so it wasfitting that&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/duquesne/2020/01/20/Converse-Chuck-Cooper-NBA-basketball-MLK-Day-Duquesne-Westinghouse/stories/202001200101" target="_blank">Converse and the NBA announced</a>&nbsp;a new line of shoes honoring Chuck Cooper, Earl Lloyd and Nat&nbsp;“Sweetwater” Clifton. Those three broke the league’s color barrier in 1950, as Cooper was the first black player drafted by an NBA team, Clifton was the first to sign a contract and Clifton was the first to appear in a game.</p>
<p>Cooper, of course, is from Pittsburgh, played at Westinghouse High School and was an All-American at Duquesne before he was drafted by the Celtics. He was the first black player to play in a college game south of the Mason-Dixon line. He was elected to the Naismith Hall of Fame last year, and Duquesne will honor him by naming its new arena UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse.</p>
<p>After hearing about the NBA and Converse&nbsp;celebrating Cooper, I started to think about how many sports pioneers we’ve been able to celebrate here in Western Pennsylvania. And then I got sad, because many people that I’ve talked to — even sports fans&nbsp;— don’t seem to know the history in this area. And if they don’t, it is because we have failed as writers and opinion makers to properly educate them.</p>
<p>February is Black History month, and that is the perfect time to reflect on the careers of and celebrate those that broke color barriers, especially those who have ties to Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>I’m sure I’ll miss some, but here are others, like Cooper, who deserve to be celebrated and whose legacy we should work hard to keep alive:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The 1936 Olympics in Berlin are often referred to as the Jesse Owens Olympics because Owens, a black man, won four Gold medals with Adolf Hitler in the stands.&nbsp;But Owens wasn’t the only black track athlete to win a gold under Hitler’s nose. One of the others was <strong>John Woodruff</strong>, a 21-year old Pitt athlete from Connellsville. Woodruff won the 800-meter race at that same Olympics in yet another small rebuke of Hitler’s ideas about a master race.</p>
<p>• <strong>Willie Thrower</strong> was a superstar halfback at New Kensington High School in the 1940s. He went on to become the first black quarterback to play in the Big Ten Conference, and then in 1953 he became the first black quarterback to play in the NFL. We talk about Russell Wilson, Lamar Jackson, Deshaun Watson, Patrick Mahomes and a host of other black quarterbacks all the time now, and all of them owe a debt of gratitude to Thrower.</p>
<p>• <strong>Sandy Stephens</strong> was a two-sport athlete at Uniontown. He was the first black quarterback at the University of Minnesota and the first black quarterback to be named an All-American. He remains the only Minnesota quarterback to lead the Gophers to the Rose Bowl, and in 1960 he led them to the national championship. Plenty of black quarterbacks have won at a high level in college, but Stephens was one of the first.</p>
<p>• Pitt played in the 1956 Sugar Bowl against Georgia Tech. That in and of itself isn’t all that significant, except for the fact that one of the Panthers’ stars was <strong>Bobby Grier</strong>, and he was the first black player to play in the Sugar Bowl. He did so despite the protests of governors of two states. And he did so even though he had to stay in a different hotel than his teammates.</p>
<p>• Donnie Shell will head to the Hall of Fame this year and that gives those Super Steelers of the 1970s 10 Hall of Fame players as well as Chuck Noll and Dan Rooney. But there is one serious omission: <strong>Bill Nunn</strong>. There is no Super Steelers without the work of Nunn, who changed the NFL by scouting and bringing exposure to the historically black colleges.</p>
<p>Nunn was born and raised in Homewood, went to Westinghouse and was the managing editor of the Pittsburgh Courier and the creator of the black college All-American team in the 1950s. He joined the Steelers as a scout in 1967, and it’s his work that helped the Steelers identify Shell, Mel Blount, John Stallworth, L.C. Greenwood, Ernie Holmes and Dwight White, among others. He changed the game completely, and he created opportunities for players who likely would have fallen through the cracks because of where they played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• The Steelers also hired the league’s first black assistant coach in 1957 when Buddy Parker named <strong>Lowell Perry</strong> the receivers coach. Pittsburgh was also the home of two of the greatest Negro League franchises, the Crawfords and Homestead Grays, but the Pirates in 1971 also were the first team to field an all-black lineup (eight position players and starting pitcher).</p>
<p>There are plenty more I’ve missed and moments that I could talk about, but those are for a different day and perhaps a future column. These stories shouldn’t be forgotten, even though we have come a long way and made a lot of progress in all areas.</p>
<p>These pioneers laid the groundwork for a lot of what we take for granted today because they refused to be held back by the rules of society during their time.</p>
<p>And the fact that so many pioneers have ties to Western Pennsylvania means we should all work hard to make sure their legacies will be remembered and celebrated forever.</p>
