<h1>Unhealthy smog accompanies heat wave</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/07/07/heat-wave-pittsburgh-weather-forecast-summer/stories/202007070077" target="_blank">ongoing hot spell</a> throughout the region spiked ground-level ozone to unhealthy levels, according to the Allegheny County Health Department, and continued high ozone readings are likely for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Based on preliminary readings, all three of the ACHD ozone monitors inched above the 8-hour, National Ambient Air Quality Standard of 70 parts per million Monday. The monitor in Harrison registered 74 parts per million, Lwrenceville and South Fayette were at 71 parts per million.</p>
<p>The health department said in a release that the exceedances were the first in the county since July 10, 2018, and that, “Given the current forecast there may be additional ozone exceedances this week.”</p>
<p>Jim Kelly, the health department’s deputy director for environmental health, said in a phone interview that ozone levels are slightly lower Tuesday, but weather conditions remain “very favorable” for creation of ozone throughout the region.</p>
<p>Concentrations of ground-level ozone, the primary component of unhealthy smog, can move higher when the weather is hot and there is no rain.</p>
<p>Ozone is considered a “secondary pollutant” because it forms in the atmosphere when sunlight cooks emissions of nitrogen oxides and volatile organic compounds from vehicles, factories and power plants.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said the prolonged stretch of hot weather the region is experiencing would have produced higher ozone readings in the past.</p>
<p>“It would have been much worse,” he said. “But cars are cleaner, a lot of power plants have closed in the region.”</p>
<p>Smog may cause breathing problems for the elderly, children, pregnant women and people with heart or respiratory disease, can exacerbate asthma, other respiratory illnesses and cause premature death, as well as stunt tree and crop growth.</p>
<p>Because ozone forms at the ground level, individual actions can help reduce its formation, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p>The health department said people can voluntarily limit pollution-producing activities, including reducing daytime driving; don’t top off gasoline tanks and refuel after 7 p.m.; postpone mowing the lawn until the evening, save energy by washing dishes and clothes only with full loads, and closing windows and blinds to reduce air conditioning and energy usage.</p>
