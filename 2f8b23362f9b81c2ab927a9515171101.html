<p>NEW YORK — Gov. Andrew Cuomo Monday laid out a path that could see some regions of upstate New York start to reopen as soon as May 15 as the coronavirus death toll took a significant drop to 226.</p>
<p>Even as the Democratic governor said that statewide shutdown rules will officially expire in less than two weeks, he laid out stringent conditions that must be met before even little-impacted regions can start to reopen.</p>
<p>“Regions can start to reopen and do their own analysis, but these are the facts that they have to have in place to do it,” he said.</p>

<p>Cuomo laid out an intricate set of requirements, including a declining number of coronavirus cases and available hospital capacity.</p>
<p>He stressed that even areas that are only mildly affected must show steady declines because otherwise they might be susceptible to renewed outbreaks.</p>
<p>Although the governor sounded a note of flexibility, he warned against expecting anything close to normalcy to return anytime soon, especially in New York City and its immediate suburbs.</p>
<p>“If upstate has to wait for downstate to be ready, they’re going to be waiting a long time,” Cuomo said.</p>
<p>As other governors have rushed to reopen their economies, Cuomo has been a steadfast advocate of a go-slow approach. Even as New York has succeeded in significantly reducing deaths and cases, he repeatedly has warned against allowing complacency to slip in.</p>
<p>He strongly backed local police enforcement of social distancing rules like the mini-ticket blitz carried out by the NYPD as the warm spring weather sent New Yorkers out into parks and streets.</p>
<p>A relatively low 226 deaths were reported from Sunday, a much lower figure than recent days. Weekend figures tend to be lower, however, Cuomo noted.</p>
<p>New hospitalizations for COVID-19 also dropped again to a recent low of about 700 in the state.</p>
<p>The declining death toll marked a bright spot, although Cuomo is careful to be sensitive to the people the numbers represent.</p>
<p>That’s 226 wives or brothers or sisters that are mourning the loss of a loved one,” Cuomo said.</p>
