<h1>Bethel Park insurance company owner who ducked IRS for years gets 30 months in prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bethel Park businessman Robert Rionda Jr., who says he foolishly gave away millions to a Florida con man in a misguided investment scheme instead of paying his tax bills, will spend 30 months behind bars for tax evasion.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon on Thursday imposed that term and also ordered him to pay about $1.5 million to the IRS and a $10,000 fine.</p>
<p>Rionda, owner of Arms Insurance Group until selling the company to his son in 2014, pleaded guilty in November to one count of tax evasion.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Brian Bevan, argued for probation, saying Rionda is unlike most tax cheats prosecuted in federal court in that he didn't file false returns or try to conceal his money in some clandestine account.</p>
<p>Instead, he said his client is a good if gullible man preyed upon by a fraudster.</p>
<p>"His failings were not ones of extreme duplicity, like hiding money in offshore bank accounts or unknown shell companies, nor were they motivated by wanting to live a life of extravagance," Mr. Bevan said in sentencing papers. "Rather, he fell victim to a fraudulent investment scheme that he believed in all too well. Over a period of approximately ten years, he sent every dollar he could — even the money he should have put aside for taxes — to a crook in Florida. All the while he accurately and timely filed his returns every year, meaning full well to pay his tax bills 'later.’ ”</p>
<p>Later didn't happen and the IRS came after him. The agency's civil side opened a case in 2011 for unpaid taxes for 2009, 2010 and 2011. When collection attempts failed, the IRS levied his personal bank accounts.</p>
<p>He responded to that action by no longer using his personal bank account, telling the company controller to stop issuing him salary checks and paying his personal bills from the company bank accounts instead of his own.</p>
<p>He filed accurate corporate and personal returns but made only minimal payments for his personal income taxes. From 2009 to 2014, the company paid him varying amounts ranging from $376,000 to $1.6 million yearly.</p>
<p>After he sold the company he stayed on as part owner. The new company then began making payments by check to him that represented monthly payments on a promissory note, rent and other payments. He deposited some checks into two accounts held by Arms rather than put them in his own accounts.</p>
<p>From 2014 to 2016, the new company paid Mr. Rionda $92,000, $298,000 and $291,000, but he didn't make payments towards his taxes.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Kaufman said he instead made payments for his mortgage, a mortgage on a business property, his credit cards and utilities and sent $2.7 million to a man in Florida named Joseph Duva.</p>
<p>"The payments to Duva were apparently some sort of investment or loan," Mr. Kaufman said in a sentencing memo.</p>
<p>Mr. Bevan said Rionda had been taken in by Mr. Duva, whom he met in the early 2000s, with the promise of a huge return on an investment involving professional football ticket sales.</p>
<p>"Mr. Duva never provided Mr. Rionda with any written documents concerning the investment, which Mr. Rionda, who frequently did business with a handshake, did not think was unusual," Mr. Bevan said. "As Mr. Rionda saw a massive return dangling before him as Mr. Duva promised, the defendant sent more and more money into the void, not to the IRS."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaufman said Rionda should have paid the government what he owed instead of wiring money to Duva.</p>
<p>"There is no question that Rionda had the ability to make these payments, yet he chose not to," he said. "There seems to be no explanation for this offense other than greed. Rionda intentionally decided to direct his money elsewhere, take affirmative steps of evasion, and thus cheat his fellow citizens."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaufman argued for prison within the federal guidelines, 30 to 37 months, not only to punish Rionda but to deter other tax cheats. Federal prosecutors typically argue for prison in tax cases to preserve the voluntary tax system.</p>
<p>"It is important that sentences in tax evasion cases, especially large ones like this which involve $1.5 million in loss, constitute just punishment," Mr. Kaufman said.</p>
<p>Rionda will be on probation for two years after gets out of prison.</p>
