<h1>Bob Casey made health care his crusade. In 2020, he finds his party at a crossroads.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — In July 2017, Bob Casey walked into a Fulton County hospital with a dire warning: The following day, the U.S. Democratic senator told officials there, Republicans would hold a vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>If successful, Mr. Casey said, the repeal would threaten more than 1,000 people in the county who had gained health insurance and would reverse positive local health care trends like the falling rate of uninsured people seeking emergency room treatment. His point: The people of Fulton County — among the most rural and deeply conservative counties in Pennsylvania — were at the greatest risk of losing the most.</p>
<p>Republicans’ repeal effort ultimately failed. But the fate of the landmark health care law known as Obamacare, which turns 10 years old next month, is as fraught as ever. It faces multi-sided attacks — from President Donald Trump, from Congressional Republicans, from a federal lawsuit that could vacate the entire law.</p>
<p>Increasingly, he feels, the Affordable Care Act faces neglect from other Democrats who are advocating for a dramatic expansion of health care instead of defending the current law.</p>
<p>“Our party is failing on educating and alerting the public about this,” Mr. Casey said in a recent interview. He repeated it twice for emphasis. “We are failing as a party on that.”</p>
<p>For any Democratic politician, “your number one job is to defend what we have,” he said. “These threats are real, they are near-term, and they’re already landing.”</p>
<p>That has left Mr. Casey, who decided long ago health care would be his top policy issue, at a strange crossroads in 2020. The notably soft-spoken senator becomes uncharacteristically angry and sharpens his words. And if he was shouting from the rooftops before, he has ascended to mountaintops in recent months.</p>
<p>“We should be kicking the hell out of Republicans every day on that, and I’m gonna keep doing it,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p><strong>Coming back to health care</strong></p>
<p>By the mid-2000s, Mr. Casey had spent a contented decade in state government, content, buoyed by the widespread popularity his father — Robert Casey Sr., governor of the Keystone State from 1987 to 1995 — while hoping to chart his own path.</p>
<p>He had spent eight years as state auditor general. In March 1998, Mr. Casey released a damning performance audit of the state’s nursing homes, criticizing state health officials for responding late to nearly 70% of complaints involving residents in “immediate jeopardy.”</p>
<p>That 1998 audit stuck with him. When he was elected state treasurer in 2004, he gave a series of policy speeches on health care. After all, his father’s legacy includes the establishment of an insurance program for uninsured children, which became the model for the federal Children’s Health Insurance Program.</p>
<p>Then came Capitol Hill recruiters: Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., then the Senate Majority Leader. Democrats felt good about re-taking the Senate in 2006. Would Mr. Casey consider a run to challenge Republican Sen. Rick Santorum in Pennsylvania?</p>
<p>“I kept coming back to one issue, and it was health care,” Mr. Casey recalled. He told himself, “You know you can do a lot more as a U.S. Senator.”</p>
<p>He was one of six Democrats who defeated incumbents that year, effectively giving Democrats the Senate majority. At that time, he sought incremental change, perhaps a modest expansion of CHIP or Medicaid coverage.</p>
<p>Never did he imagine, three years later, he would be sitting on the committee debating legislation to create a government-run insurance marketplace.</p>
<p>After President Barack Obama’s election in 2008, Democrats had control in Congress and the White House. The late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., wanted transformative health legislation.</p>
<p>The Affordable Care Act passed in March 2010 over Republicans’ objections.</p>
<p><strong>Fending off attacks</strong></p>
<p>Opposition to the Affordable Care Act among Republicans simmered for eight years under Mr. Obama. Still, the law survived a complex implementation, PR headaches and a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling. In 2014, the Washington Post tallied 54 attempts by Congress to tweak or undo the law.</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump took office in 2017, he immediately pushed to “repeal and replace” the law. Republicans found themselves in control the White House and Congress. The House approved a repeal bill by four votes, but Senate Republicans came up one vote short, with late Sen. John McCain’s dramatic “thumbs-down” gesture.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey acknowledged the law is not perfect — but it added vulnerable Americans to the insurance rolls, expanded Medicaid and provided protections for pre-existing conditions. He thought, after the repeal effort failed, it was finally time to work across the aisle to improve on the law.</p>
<p>Yet Mr. Trump eroded the health insurance marketplace in a less direct way, Mr. Casey said. The president signed executive orders that slashed the marketplace’s marketing budget by 90% and cut nearly in half the funding for enrollment workers, called “navigators,” who help people sign up for the law.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also extended the duration of low-cost, short-term insurance plans that don’t meet the law’s standards — plans that Mr. Casey calls “junk plans.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey — who current and former aides described as analytical to the point of printing off pages of footnotes — has relied on a blend of research and storytelling to get his point across. Mr. Casey, as the only Democrat to sit on all three Senate committees that directly oversee health care, is afforded wide staffing resources.</p>
<p>In 2017, he hired Kate Mevis, who helped shepherd the Affordable Care Act to passage as a Congressional aide and later joined the Obama administration to ensure its implementation. Ms. Mevis is the Democratic staff director on the Senate Special Committee on Aging.</p>
<p>During the 2017 repeal effort, staff compiled a monstrous internal spreadsheet of county-level health data, and they continually update it so Mr. Casey knows precise figures while traveling in the state. He visited all 67 counties in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Getting Democrats on board</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, Mr. Casey is confronting an uncomfortable situation: Few, if any, Democrats match his health care passion on a daily basis.</p>
<p>He expressed frustration at the lack of backup — given the party stuck together during the heady months of the ACA passage, all the years playing defense and in the 2018 midterm elections, which many Democrats viewed as a successful referendum on the Republican repeal effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the oxygen in the 2020 Democratic primary race has been consumed by candidates’ perceived ability to defeat Mr. Trump in November, and whether the party should veer more progressive or moderate.</p>
<p>Accordingly, the health care debate has focused on whether to embrace “Medicare for All” proposals advanced by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., or build on the ACA, suggested by former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.</p>
<p>“Our party dropped the ball after the 2018 election — completely dropped the ball” on messaging health care, Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>The health care law, meanwhile, likely will remain in limbo until after the 2020 election. An appeals court in December sent the federal lawsuit back to the Texas district court. The U.S. Supreme Court declined a request from Democrats to expedite review.</p>
<p>Democrats “need to be constantly explaining to people how big a threat this president is to their health care,”&nbsp;said Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who sits with Mr. Casey on the Senate’s health care committee.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We need to repeat for people what the president is trying to do,” Mr. Murphy said. “That’s why somebody like Bob is important. Bob is thinking every day about how to keep the threats to the Affordable Care Act front and center.”</p>
