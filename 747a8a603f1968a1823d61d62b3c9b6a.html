<h1>Parents in Mars Area School District asked to fill out a survey for reopening plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Parents in the Mars Area School District are being asked to fill out a survey featuring three options for their children for the coming school year: in-person, full-time instruction; a hybrid of in-person and streaming; or attending the Mars Area Cyber Academy full-time.</p>
<p>The survey and the school district’s reopening plan are on the district’s website.</p>
<p>“As you know, these are tough times,” Superintendent Mark Gross said at the board’s July 14 meeting. “All the bad news is out there. The good news is we know we have to find a way to educate children.”</p>
<p>A committee of administrators, board members, teachers, support staff and parents have been meeting to formulate the plan.</p>
<p>“We aren’t finished yet, much to the dismay of some,” Mr. Gross said. “We don’t want to move too fast.”</p>
<p>The district’s plan has red, yellow and green phases. The red phase keeps schools closed and would be at the determination of the state Department of Education. The green phase opens all schools for all-day instruction. Principals are working on building-specific protocols for social distancing in the hallways and at lunch.</p>
<p>The yellow hybrid phase would have schools open for parents who choose for their children to attend, but also offer live streaming for those with health or safety concerns.</p>
<p>Toward that end, the school board approved the purchase of $25,000 in additional bandwidth to support distance learning.</p>
<p>The district’s survey also asks parents if they are comfortable with their children riding the bus, plan to transport the students themselves or, if in high school, the students can drive themselves.</p>
<p>The meeting itself was a hybrid, with the board meeting in person, with a limited audience, and live streaming as well. Several people in attendance, both in person and online, chided the four board members and others who were not wearing masks.</p>
<p>One of those, Jennifer McAfee, said her children will be live-streaming school. “I will not be comfortable sending them here,” she said. Even if only 2% of young children get COVID-19, “please take this seriously. ... It is a killer.”</p>
<p>Ms. McAfee, who is a teacher in another district, told officials to invest in good personal protection equipment for the staff. “If there is a spike of COVID inside the Mars Area School District&nbsp; … you need to pull the classroom. We all have to be cognizant of the fact that some of these kids come to school with problems.”</p>
<p>Teacher Scott McCarthy noted that teachers are required by law to return to work if the schools reopen.</p>
<p>“Our obligation also is to our membership and to keep our members well. I will go with what science says. Every one of our members has children. They have grandchildren. They have parents and elderly grandparents,” he said. “It will take 100 times more than hand sanitizer and a mask and prayer to make this happen.”</p>
<p>The plan will be approved in August.</p>
<p>In other business, the board accepted the resignation of Kara Eckert, former director of curriculum. The curriculum department was disbanded as a cost-saving move. The district offered Ms. Eckert a principal position, but she declined it.</p>
<p>The board also approved Anastasia DiLorenzo as substitute principal at the Primary Center.</p>
