<h1>City Theatre announces furloughs due to COVID-19 cancellations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mandated closings have hit local theaters already in production hard, and now City Theatre is the first to announce furloughs due to the cancellation of the remainder of its season.</p>
<p>"We are only days into this crisis, and already City Theatre is facing cash losses of over $450,000,” read a joint statement released Sunday morning by the South Side theater’s board of directors, artistic director Marc Masterson and managing director James McNeel.</p>
<p>With that, the theater will furlough 75% of its staff, including all part-time workers, while keeping on seven staff members at reduced salaries.</p>

<p>The furloughs are set to come over two waves starting March 29. The total furlough impact will be 19 full-time exempt and nonexempt employees, or from 26 to 7. This does not include “lack of work” for part-timers whose work is contingent on performances.</p>
<p>"When the 'all clear’ is finally given for us to share our plays again in a public setting, it will take a few weeks to ramp up and a strong enough cash position to do it. And we will,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Amid COVID-19 concerns and with physical distancing mandates just beginning, City Theatre was among the first Pittsburgh theaters to announce it would shut down. Now in&nbsp;its 46th season, City has an annual budget of nearly $3 million. It specializes in new-play development on its Mainstage and Lester Hamburg Studio black-box theaters. Last year, it added the Philip Chosky Production Center to its Bingham Street campus, between 13th and 14th streets.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak halted production of Molly Smith Metzler’s “Cry It Out” with 11 performances remaining, and it has cancelled the premiere of “PerkUp PerKup” by Isaac Gomez and the postponement of “F***7thGrade” by Jill Sobule and Liza Birkenmeier.</p>
<p>“The losses from these cancellations, the forced pause in our subscription renewal campaign, and the anticipated impact of lost contributed revenue have been seismic to the financial health of City Theatre,” the statement said. It&nbsp;added that, with the help of patrons, donors and sponsors, there should be “no doubt” that City Theatre will return.</p>
