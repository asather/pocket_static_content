<h1>It was the best of markets to graduate into. And then, it wasn't.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carlow University senior Jenny Miller received a phone call this month — the culmination of four years of hard work as a nursing major.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 21-year-old from Ford City immediately called her dad with the news that West Penn Hospital had offered her a job in a&nbsp;post-surgical unit.&nbsp;“I cried. I’m a crier,” she said. “I was crying and saying, ‘They offered me the job.’”</p>
<p>Her jubilance in that moment April 2 is, on one hand, a reminder to the Class of 2020 that, despite the sudden economic upheaval brought on by a pandemic, jobs are still being filled and careers are getting underway&nbsp;— at least in health care and other fields where demand remains.</p>
<p>But make no mistake, these are rough times — a glaringly obvious fact made more so by what Ms. Miller could not do because of social distancing and restaurants reduced to takeout only. “It was kind of sad because&nbsp;there was no way for me to celebrate with my family,” she said.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t go to dinner,” she explained. “I couldn’t even hug my parents. My mom is immune-compromised.”</p>
<p>Those entering the job market right now —&nbsp;soon-to-be college graduates among them —&nbsp;understandably might wish they could step into a time machine waiting to take them back to last fall.</p>
<p>Back then, the job market seemed so friendly. Unemployment was at or near record lows. Businesses were clearly hiring.</p>
<p>In fact, a November survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers indicated that employers planned to hire 5.8% more new college graduates from the Class of 2020 than peers from 2019.&nbsp;It continued a string of five years in which most employers planned to maintain or increase hiring of new graduates from the previous year.</p>
<p>Subsequent tracking in February suggested even more confidence, with new hiring seen as potentially being 6.8% over the previous year.</p>
<p>Everything changed in March.</p>
<p>COVID-19, the deadly virus encircling the globe, closed businesses across the U.S. and in Pennsylvania. In the last four weeks alone, 22 million new unemployment claims have been filed, according to the government.</p>
<p>“Of course, that hiring projection is no longer valid and we’ll have to wait again until the fall to get a new projection,” said Joshua Kahn, assistant director of research and public policy with the association.</p>
<p>The association’s staff has&nbsp;pivoted to&nbsp;“quick polls” to gauge how employers are responding to the pandemic, and specifically what it means for full-time job candidates and for summer interns.</p>
<p>Better than six in 10 employers as of this month are not revoking any offers, he said. Those who confirmed they were doing so represented just 2% percent, a rate that for the moment is less ominous than in 2009 and the Great Recession, Mr. Kahn said.</p>
<p>“A lot of them, 23 percent, have not revoked any offers but are considering it,” he said.</p>

<p>“It seems that employers are taking a wait-and-see approach. They are trying to hold out as long as they can and hope the economy opens up again relatively quickly,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to react quickly. They don’t know what to do it’s unfolding so quickly.”</p>
<p>Summer internships, not surprisingly, are shifting online, and some employers are reducing the length of summer experiences —&nbsp;starting in July rather than June, and reducing the number of positions.</p>
<p>For campus career centers, the work to help students in their job searches has continued remotely, even as the schools have largely shut down. Staff review and offer critiques to seniors on resumes and cover letters, and use video conferencing to give students experience with fielding interview questions.</p>
<p>Platforms like&nbsp;“Handshake” give students access to resources, help schedule remote sessions and can send email alerts when a job matching their interest opens up.</p>
<p>For many institutions, protecting seniors from a market suddenly turned sour has become a university-wide effort.</p>
<p>At the&nbsp;University of Pittsburgh, the region’s largest school, some 200 faculty and staff volunteers across campus have signed up to contact seniors, and ask them how they are doing and if they know their plans. If those seniors are having problems, staff point them to resources.</p>
<p>The Pitt Career Center normally works out of the William Pitt Union. Instead, its 26 staff members these days are doing so remotely, said Karin Asher, associate director.</p>
<p>“We’re coaching our students to be advocates for themselves but also be flexible and patient,” she said. “We encourage them to reach out [to employers], but be patient. They may not know all the answers either.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s Alumni Association has joined the effort, too.</p>
<p>In an email headlined&nbsp;“The Class of 2020 Needs You,” leaders pointed to the upheaval that graduates face this year and their perseverance during a crisis that took some away of their last weeks on campus and that have altered commencement plans.</p>
<p>“Many businesses and industries need new talent; other organizations seek short-term assistance or an intern to help with a special project or initiative,” wrote Association President Lisa Golden, MD (A&amp;S ’93) and&nbsp;Nancy Merritt, vice chancellor for alumni relations to 165,000 alumni.&nbsp;“Now more than ever, our soon-to-be graduates need a hand from us —&nbsp;Pitt’s powerful, global network of alumni and friends.”</p>
<p>At Point Park University, career staff also offer a menu of job-related services remotely. They are networking with area employers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We understand that the current environment makes the prospect of entering the job market intimidating. While unemployment claims have skyrocketed, many companies that have ability to operate remotely, such as Walmart, Target, Amazon and others, are still hiring,” said Jessica Hobson, director of career readiness.</p>
<p>Campus recruitment fairs are occurring online, she said, and job interviews are being held over video communications platforms. She suggested co-op opportunities as a way to advance career readiness through full-time paid work.</p>
<p>Experts encourage students not to limit themselves to opportunities solely within their major, and to stress soft skills like written and oral communication, problem solving and teamwork — ways to stand out in a crowded market.</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Kahn said, a job candidate in a competitive market should not be satisfied with sending out the same cover letter.&nbsp;“You really have to craft it to match&nbsp;the job description.”</p>
