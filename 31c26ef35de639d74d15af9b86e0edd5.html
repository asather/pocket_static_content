<h1>In updated dress code policy, Port Authority forbids social justice and political statements on face masks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority said Thursday that it has updated its dress code standards, which prohibit employees from wearing clothing items “of a political or social justice nature,” to include wearing face masks with similar messaging.</p>
<p>The updated policy change, sent out to employees via email on July 22, would prohibit staff members from wearing certain messages that support the Black Lives Matter movement, among other social justice issues, and counter-movements.</p>
<p>Sascha Craig Sr., a senior instructor who has been working for Port Authority for 30 years, said he and other Black employees were told by supervisors last week they could no longer wear masks that read&nbsp;“Black Lives Matter.” Mr. Craig said, not long before the update went into effect, that a complaint was made by a white employee.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Port Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said in a statement that “we are aware that one employee expressed their concern regarding a political or social justice statement to garage management, although that individual did not file a formal complaint.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said Port Authority has had a ban on employees wearing political or social justice items since the 1970s. The policy was recently updated to include masks in response to a July 1 order on masks issued by the state Department of Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Since face coverings are now required, our uniform policy was simply extended to include them,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>He added that the “Port Authority uniform is not a forum for these discussions and should not be used in such a way. It’s our position that no personal messages of any kind be allowed on the uniform, including face masks. That is consistent with our position of the last 40+ years.”</p>
<p>The agency’s latest version of the Uniform Standards for Port Authority Operators went into effect on July 23, according to a copy obtained by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The policy states that, “Buttons, stickers, jewelry and clothing (including masks or other face coverings) of a political or social protest nature are not permitted to be worn.”</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette reviewed a copy of an older version — issued in 2018 —&nbsp;of Port Authority’s uniform policy. It confirmed that employees had not been permitted to wear buttons or stickers of a political or social protest nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steve Palonis, president of the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 85,&nbsp;which represents Allegheny County’s Port Authority bus operators, confirmed Thursday that the union was consulting with its legal team&nbsp;“to see whether or not it was right for Port Authority to do what they did,” but could not comment further on the matter.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Craig, Port Authority has not made any statements to employees specifically about Black Lives Matter, but he said he was asked by a supervisor on Thursday morning to remove his BLM mask. Mr. Craig said he is refusing to comply.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Black Lives Matter is not a social or a political protest. It’s a movement,” he said. “It’s how I live my life everyday as a Black man in America. ... It wasn’t an issue until someone made it a racial issue.”</p>
<p>Port Authority said failure to comply with the policy could result in disciplinary action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Although we do not permit such messages in the workplace, Port Authority encourages our employees to express their First Amendment rights outside of the workplace,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1971, members of the ATU went on strike after five Port Authority employees were suspended for wearing buttons that read&nbsp;“Free Angela Davis,” a Black civil rights and political activist who was charged and later acquitted of murder charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency’s ban on political or social protest messages in its uniform policy dates to shortly after that incident, Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Craig said the new policy is discriminatory against Black employees, but Rona Kaufman, an associate professor of law at Duquesne University, said legal implications would depend on whether Port Authority’s original ban on political clothing was constitutional to begin with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kaufman, who has been teaching labor law for the past 11 years, said that a dress code ban on face masks that promote social justice is likely permissible, but there are constitutional concerns about free speech in the workplace.</p>
<p>Because the agency’s dress code, as written, does not specifically call out the Black Lives Matter movement, the Port Authority may be within their rights to enforce it, she said.</p>
<p>“If [Port Authority] was banning the speech in an effort specifically to ban or target [Black Lives Matter], then that would raise flags and that would be a concern,” Ms. Kaufman said.&nbsp;“If a ban is neutral, then it is generally permissible. If it is content specific, or if it’s targeting a specific type of speech, then we see problems and constitutional concerns.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kaufman said the case would violate employee rights under the National Labor Relations Act if union members were forbidden from speaking out in regards to workers’ rights such as unfair wages or workplace safety.</p>
<p>“If Port Authority’s dress code that already bans political speech ... [is] constitutional, then so is this,” she said. “The only way it wouldn’t be is if this was a ban only on Black Lives Matter messaging.”</p>
