<h1>Buildings are closed but the people who run them are still 'rolling the dice' for revenue, customers and job security</h1>

<p>Jeffrey Waddell was worried he had cleaned himself out of a job.</p>
<p>A cleaner at the University of Pittsburgh, Mr. Waddell is one of many people who saw their life&nbsp;— and their industry — upended amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. In an abrupt shift, many people began working remotely and many businesses shut down all in-person operations.&nbsp;But for cleaners, security guards and food service workers,&nbsp;remote work often wasn’t an option and the rise of&nbsp;telework threatened their job security.</p>
<p>Now, as the state moves toward reopening, some buildings are gearing up to welcome employees back with services like extra disinfecting of high-touch point surfaces and increased security to monitor visitation, while others have been silent about what to expect in the coming months.</p>
<p>For those people who work behind the scenes to keep the buildings running, the work has been just as varied. Some companies laid off employees, others started to hire. Some clients cut back on services, others ramped up. Some workers volunteered their time to fill the days, others asked for hazard pay.</p>
<p>When Pitt’s campus emptied out earlier than usual, Mr. Waddell and his team started to work ahead of schedule. But, once nearly all dorms were cleaned, they started to wonder what came next: Had they moved too fast? Would they get laid off? Had they wiped away future paychecks?</p>
<p>“We’re the frontlines in a lot of cases,” Mr. Waddell said.</p>
<p>“We keep it running,” said Nekia Burton, a cleaner at ABM, a facility services company, who works at BNY Mellon.</p>
<p><strong>‘Rolling the dice’</strong></p>
<p>At first, the shift was abrupt.</p>
<p>At Pitt, Mr. Waddell and his colleagues were given 10 extra sick days and a staggered schedule where they worked one week and were off the next, though still getting paid the same amount. BNY Mellon implemented a similar strategy before shifting to three weeks on, one week off, Ms. Burton said.</p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon University, Elizabeth Stanton, a food service worker on campus, was told not to return after spring break.</p>
<p>At Protector Security Services and Investigations Group LLC, a security firm made up mostly of retired state troopers based in Oakdale, employees didn’t have much notice before the work stopped.</p>
<p>One phone call and it was over, said owner and president Kevin Brown.</p>
<p>The company specializes in terminating employees, he said. With the offices empty, there was no one to escort out.</p>
<p>“Security is by need. We’re rolling the dice out here that something’s going to happen and somebody’s going to need somebody,” he said. “We’re not praying for bad news, but eventually it’s going to happen somewhere.”</p>
<p>The company has picked up jobs here and there, like providing security for retail businesses Downtown or working during the protests that have erupted across the state as people speak out against police brutality.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown said he hasn’t stood in the way of those who decide to file for unemployment.</p>
<p><strong>The responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Whitehall-based St. Moritz Security Services Inc. saw an evolution of work, according to CEO Matthew Schwartz.</p>
<p>It went from no staffing to staffing with precautionary measures like adopting curbside pickup to “getting back to what I would call the new norm,” Mr. Schwartz said.</p>
<p>“I think what you’re going to see is the role of security changing quite a bit with new policies and procedures being enforced.”</p>
<p>That means more focus on visitor management and enforcing safety guidelines, like wearing a mask and keeping six feet of distance.</p>
<p>The firm was down about 40% of their normal workload at the peak of business closures and stay-at-home orders. Now, they’re down 20% and Mr. Schwartz expects to return to a full workload in the next 30 days.</p>
<p>Before the pandemic, people thought of cleaning differently as well, said John Samek, owner of Service Master of Greater Pittsburgh, a national cleaning and restoration company with a franchise in Oakmont.</p>
<p>In order of importance, it was a way to maintain appearances, maximize investment and — lastly — maintain a healthy environment. Now, business owners must add offering employees peace of mind to the list, Mr. Samek said.</p>
<p>“People have a new focus on the value of clean and healthy work environments and home environments,” he said. “Business owners now have four reasons — all very good reasons — to step up maintenance of their facilities. There’s definitely opportunities.”</p>
<p>“Everything is just more under the microscope with cleaning services,” said Jeff Lewis, the regional director of Buildingstars of Pittsburgh, a cleaning company in Green Tree with about 90 franchises.</p>
<p>While some clients have cut back cleaning from five days a week to one or two, others ramped up. Still others requested new services — like a day porter who cleans high touch surfaces throughout the day or works on projects like carpet and window cleaning.</p>
<p>He told his staff “cleaning is more essential, now more than ever. Let’s use everything we have, let’s use&nbsp;all the resources we have, partner with our customers to come up with creative solutions.”</p>
<p>At Service Master, Mr. Samek said the company stopped cleaning homes of elderly customers, laid off the construction department and had fewer requests for cleaning and restoring people’s homes after disasters like floods or fires, the company’s main business.</p>
<p>Instead, the company focused on volunteer work for fire departments, ambulance services and food pantries and cleaned for those businesses that wanted to take preventive steps or had suspected cases of COVID-19 in the building. Now, they are looking to hire.</p>
<p><strong>The workers</strong></p>
<p>At Pitt, Mr. Waddell’s unemployment fears were laid to rest. After announcing plans to reopen for the fall semester, the university doubled down on responsibilities for its cleaning staff and is now looking to hire more workers.</p>
<p>At CMU, Ms. Stanton has yet to hear from the university about what a fall semester could look like — and if her job will be there.</p>
<p>Ms. Stanton, who has worked at CMU for about 15 years, was able to collect unemployment until last week.</p>
<p>Unable to get answers as to why from the state unemployment centers or her employer, she is working to figure out her next move.</p>
<p>At BNY Mellon, the commercial cleaners recently switched from one week on, one week off, to three weeks on, one week off.</p>
<p>With little notice of the change, Ms. Burton said her and her colleagues were struggling to make plans for childcare and transportation after months of working different shifts.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the pandemic, she was worried about layoffs; she watched as other office buildings terminated entire cleaning staffs. Now, she’s worried about what her job could look like in a few months.</p>
<p>“They’re going to see the work can get done with less people, and, two, they’re going to expect way more from us,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Burton, 28, from the North Side, said her workload has increased; she went from cleaning about two floors a night to seven or eight.</p>
<p>“I definitely do bust my tail at work,” she said, but the buildings are large and even if they’re empty of people, they are still full of furniture and equipment she has to move.</p>
<p>“My feet hurt a lot more, my back hurts, the calluses on my hands from gripping the machine and pulling the trigger are terrible,” she said. “It’s a lot more strenuous ... I’m drained.”</p>
