<h1>Masses canceled at Shrines parish grouping after possible COVID-19 exposure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Masses in the Shrines of Pittsburgh parish grouping this weekend have been canceled after potential exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p>That grouping includes Immaculate Heart of Mary in Polish Hill, Most Holy Name of Jesus and&nbsp;St. Anthony Chapel in Troy Hill, St. Nicholas in Millvale, and St. Patrick and St. Stanislaus Kostka in the Strip District.</p>
<p>The Masses for this weekend were canceled after the wife of an employee tested positive for COVID-19. The employee was at&nbsp;Most Holy Name of Jesus and Immaculate Heart of Mary this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the employee was only at two of the churches, the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh canceled services at all churches in the grouping&nbsp;“because parish staff work closely with parish priests.”</p>
<p>The employee is still awaiting test results and is quarantined at home. Church officials are informing those who may have come in contact with the employee.</p>
<p>“We have been working hard to keep everyone in our parishes safe as the pandemic continues,” said the Rev. Nicholas Vaskov, the director of the Shrines of Pittsburgh. “We are praying for our employee and their family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“While we were looking forward to gathering again in-person for Mass this Sunday, doing everything we can to&nbsp;protect the health and safety of our community is worth the wait.”</p>
<p>New reopening schedules for the parish grouping are forthcoming, church officials said.</p>
