<h1>Allegheny County will open election offices for over-the-counter voting, ballot returns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Board of Elections voted unanimously on Thursday to approve the opening of additional Elections Division offices in the county leading up to the November election.</p>
<p>The Elections Division proposed the new offices to the board in order to create more secure, accessible sites that provide over-the-counter voting — when a ballot can be provided, filled out and returned in person and over the counter —&nbsp;and the return of ballots, out of concerns related to the pandemic, according to county officials.</p>
<p>“Since the June election, we have focused on improving our processes, confirming polling locations, recruiting, assigning and training poll workers, and taking additional measures to further strengthen the integrity of the election system,” said David Voye, the Elections Division manager, in a press release last week. “We have also heard clearly that voters remain concerned about COVID and their own health and welfare. With that in mind, we have worked on this proposed plan, consistent with guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of State, that will provide additional options for voters to engage in the democratic process.”</p>
<p>Although public comments were not permitted during the board meeting on Thursday, officials said every email received from the public about the measure will receive an individual response.</p>
<p>After Mr. Voye and some of his colleagues outlined the county’s preparations for the upcoming election and county Solicitor Andrew Szefi reviewed the Pennsylvania Supreme Court’s decision on Thursday to extend the state’s mail-in ballot deadline, board Chairman and County Executive Rich Fitzgerald called for a motion to approve the division’s proposal.</p>
<p>Board members and Allegheny County Council members Sam DeMarco and Bethany Hallam both had questions about the security of the new satellite offices, particularly concerning the possibility of someone voting more than once by going to separate locations.</p>
<p>Elections Division officials and Mr. Szefi assured the council members that lists will be kept and updated of voters who have applied for and/or returned ballots, and that office workers will mark each individual’s record in real-time.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald additionally noted that attempting to vote more than once is a felony.</p>
<p>Division officials and Mr. Szefi also reiterated that people cannot register to vote at the new offices, as they are only for applying for and returning ballots.</p>
<p>After questioning from the council members concluded, the resolution was passed unanimously.</p>
<p>The board also voted unanimously to increase the pay of the expected 6,600 poll workers who will work on Nov. 3 to $200 “in light of their service during a global pandemic.” Workers also were paid $200 during the primary, but received less than $150 in past elections.</p>
