<h1>Steelers GM Kevin Colbert was disappointed with one aspect of the 2020 draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wubcGANzSFQ" target="_blank">an interview Tuesday night</a> with Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk, Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert addressed his one big idea for the NFL draft that didn’t make it past the feeling-out phase — but did make it out of the virtual meeting rooms.</p>
<p>Colbert was asked if a report that <a href="https://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/ny-steelers-nfl-draft-plan-20200407-gagzkf5jcncyjpm6cgruesfy5q-story.html" target="_blank">he recommended expanding</a> the unique 2020 draft from seven to 10 rounds was true and confirmed that he did toss out that plan. Problem is, someone within the league made public something Colbert intended to be kept behind quarantined doors.</p>
<p>“What was disappointing about that was you have what are supposed to be confidential conference calls where you discuss ideas about the draft, and I did make that suggestion, why don’t we think about three extra rounds?” Colbert said, then explained his thought process. “The reasoning was, part of it was selfish, we wanted to have a safety net because we’re dealing with less information. And the more picks you have, maybe you have a little bit of a safety net. But the other thing is, it would give the young player, the marginal player who didn’t get his opportunity to go to a pro day and to perform, that opportunity. Maybe there would be more players drafted and then those players would, again, have the chance they might not get.”</p>
<p>Indeed, with just six picks, only the Texans, Saints and 49ers had fewer chances than the Steelers to nail this draft, and all three of those teams picked before their first selection in the second round. At No. 49 overall, the Steelers were the third-to-last team to make their first pick.</p>
<p>But Colbert’s other point about adding three rounds to help players who had more limited exposure this offseason than they would have in a normal year makes some sense. He later mentioned that due to the virtual offseason programs around the league, his team and others won’t get a chance to try out the slew of rookies they usually do, which is how the Steelers stumbled upon quarterback Devlin Hodges and outside linebacker Tuzar Skipper last year.</p>
<p>Below, you can view the full interview with Colbert, who also hit on several other interesting topics.</p>
<p><strong>On what second-round pick Chase Claypool adds to the wideouts:</strong> “He’s a 6-4, 230-pound receiver who can get deep. Quite honestly, we didn’t have that threat last year. We didn’t have that tall receiver, that receiver who could just outrun coverage. We’ve always had that in the past with a Nate Washington, a Mike Wallace or a Martavis Bryant. That was very attractive to us in the long term. In the short term, we know Chase will be a special teams contributor right out of the gate.”</p>
<p><strong>On whether adding Anthony McFarland to the running back corps means the Steelers will use more of a backfield-by-committee approach:</strong> “Last year, they were a committee, and it wasn’t a committee by choice. It was a committee by circumstance because our starter, James Conner, was injured.”</p>
<p><strong>On the never-ending discussion of why the Steelers didn’t add a veteran backup quarterback in free agency:</strong> “A lot of times when we get into salary cap management, and you have significant dollars in your starter, it’s hard to put a lot of dollars in your backup. We’re very comfortable knowing that if need be, Mason [Rudolph] or Devlin or even a Paxton Lynch, who’s got No. 1 talent — we’ll see what we’ve got, but we’re comfortable with that right now.”</p>
