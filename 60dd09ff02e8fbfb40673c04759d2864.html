<h1>R.K. Mellon Foundation to provide $15 million in COVID-19 relief grants </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s largest philanthropy, the Richard King Mellon Foundation, is pouring $15 million into efforts to find a vaccine for COVID-19 and to assist people smacked hard by job loss and other economic fallout from the global pandemic.</p>
<p>Following a meeting of its trustees Monday — its first-ever virtual session and one of the longest meetings in its history, its director said — the foundation said emergency operating grants for nonprofits assisting in relief efforts will be disbursed next week.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The entire $15 million package is expected to be allocated within six months and the foundation will consider additional support as it tracks health and economic data.</p>
<p>“We’re trying very hard to demonstrate leadership in this moment of crisis and to serve as a stabilizing force to help us all get through this together,” Sam Reiman, director of the foundation, said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>The Downtown-based foundation said the investment will “jump-start” its three-pronged COVID-19 response strategy which targets health care, support for nonprofits dealing with the crisis, and economic recovery relief.</p>
<p>In addition to providing funding to help develop a vaccine for the deadly disease, the foundation’s health-related grants will go toward efforts to repurpose existing drugs to be used during the COVID-19 crisis, help manufacturers quickly produce essential medical supplies, and deploy technology to slow spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Those grants include $196,000 to the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research to purchase specialized equipment as it seeks a cure for the virus.</p>
<p>A grant of $160,000 to nonprofit Global Links will help fund the production of 50,000 plastic face shields by local firm Day Owl, Highmark and the Allegheny Health Network.</p>
<p>The foundation in the past has funded “a legacy of work with health care systems and universities,” said Mr. Reiman. “We don’t want to allow a virus to destroy what we’ve collectively built. It starts with halting the spread.”</p>
<p>Its economic recovery grants include $500,000 to the Progress Fund, a Greensburg-based, nonprofit lender which is assisting small businesses; and $500,000 to Bridgeway Capital, a Downtown lender that recently launched a COVID-19 response fund to help small enterprises and nonprofits.</p>
<p>In determining how to address the economic fallout from COVID-19, said Mr. Reiman, the foundation studied data from the Great Recession of 2008-09, the period following the 9-11 terrorist attacks, and the collapse of the region’s steel industry in the 1970s and 1980s.</p>
<p>“We wanted to understand the real human toll on the community and families and … the consequences of people losing their jobs,” said Mr. Reiman. “This is not something we wanted to wait to address. We don’t need six months to see [the impact]. Let’s get out in front of it and address some issues now.”</p>
<p>In mid-March, the foundation began conversations with other local philanthropies about a “collective response,” he said.</p>
<p>At that time, it pledged $1 million to help seed the Emergency Action Fund at the Pittsburgh Foundation which is providing a response to basic community needs including food and housing.</p>
<p>Other large foundations that helped launch that emergency fund were the Heinz Endowments, Hillman Family Foundations and the Pittsburgh Foundation.</p>
<p>On March 27, the R.K. Mellon Foundation called for proposals for emergency operating funds from nonprofits it currently supports in southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>It received more than 77 applications by April 6.</p>
<p>Those that get funded will receive grants capped at $250,000, said Mr. Reiman.</p>
<p>“That was by design to reach as many organizations as possible,” he said.</p>
<p>Those awardees are expected to be announced next week when grants are disbursed.</p>
<p>The R.K. Mellon Foundation’s endowment totaled $2.7 billion at the end of 2019 and last year it awarded grants totaling $129 million for education, human services, economic development and environmental conservation.</p>
<p>The spread and impact of COVID-19 “has hit every part of our grant portfolio,” said Mr. Reiman.</p>
<p>Acknowledging its long history of not discussing its grantmaking activities, Mr. Reiman said the foundation decided to speak publicly Monday because, “This pandemic has created a moment where the foundation and its board understand the importance of public communications.”</p>
<p>“By communicating … we are much more likely to inspire others to give back to the community.”</p>
<p>Individuals don’t need to be associated with large philanthropies to contribute to the COVID-19 crisis, he said.</p>
<p>“You can volunteer at a food bank, or make face masks … anyone can make a difference and have an impact.”</p>
<p>The foundation was launched in 1947 by Richard King Mellon, who was known as “R.K.” and was a grandson of Mellon Bank’s founder, Judge Thomas Mellon.</p>
<p>The Mellon family helped to bankroll Pittsburgh industrial giants Alcoa and Gulf Oil Corp. and R.K. Mellon helped to spearhead Pittsburgh’s first renaissance after World War II, an effort that included massive urban renewal and cleaning up the city’s air and rivers.</p>
<p>R.K. Mellon died in 1970.</p>
<p>His grandson, Richard A. Mellon, became chairman of the foundation last July.</p>
<p>In a statement Monday, Richard A. Mellon said, “Our medical research grants will support essential health innovations, including the intensive efforts of Pittsburgh’s renowned researchers to once again find the world a cure, as they have so notably done before.</p>
<p>“Our emergency grants will help our local nonprofit partners to continue their essential work at this most difficult hour,” Mr. Mellon said. “And our funding of smart economic-development strategies will bring immediate relief to the people of southwestern Pennsylvania -- and position us to be poised to surge again, when the economy starts anew.”</p>
