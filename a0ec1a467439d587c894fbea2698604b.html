<h1>Pitt adds 2021 prospects Terrence Rankl, Jaden Bradley to growing class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Wednesday, his birthday no less, Pat Narduzzi indicated on Twitter that the Panthers picked up three 2021 verbal commitments in a four-hour span. Two-star linebacker Trevion Stevenson announced his decision a couple hours after Narduzzi’s initial post on Wednesday, leaving some mystery for Thursday. Some of that was answered, while another question mark arose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An hour or so before the NFL draft got started Thursday, Pitt (unofficially) added two new players to the program. Three-star offensive tackle Terrence Rankl announced his commitment to Pitt at 6:27 p.m., followed by three-star wide receiver Jaden Bradley, who announced a mere 13 minutes later.</p>
<p>But there’s another 2021 commit coming, too. Narduzzi put out a post Thursday evening indicating a fourth commit in two days. That player has yet to reveal himself, so Pitt’s 2021 class consists of six members, with a seventh pending.</p>
<p>What the Panthers have in those six prospects already is noteworthy. Rankl, Bradley and Stevenson join four-star West Mifflin defensive end Nahki Johnson, three-star Virginia running back Rodney Hammond and three-star Imhotep Charter (Philadelphia) defensive back Javon McIntyre. Johnson, Hammond and McIntyre verbally committed in June, November and January, respectively, so Pitt’s April flurry comes at an opportune time to garner momentum.</p>
<p>There’s plenty of time between now and the 2021 early signing period, regardless if that will remain scheduled for December 2020. But as it stands, Pitt’s 2021 class ranks 33rd nationally, per Rivals, a ranking that will rise once the seventh player comes forward. Five ACC schools — North Carolina, Clemson, Miami, Florida State and Duke — are ranked ahead of Pitt. The Tar Heels, Tigers and Hurricanes are the only conference opponents in double-digits, and the Panthers are starting to close that gap.</p>
<p>Rankl’s addition gives Pitt its first offensive lineman of the 2021 cycle. The 6-foot-6, 280-pound blocker from Washington High School in Massillon, Ohio, held offers from 18 schools, including seven Power Five programs: Arizona State, Duke, Iowa State, Kentucky, Purdue, Vanderbilt and Pitt. He’s also the second offensive lineman from Ohio that Pitt has successfully recruited in as many years, linking up with Branson Taylor, a four-star 2020 signee from Elyria Catholic.</p>
<p>Bradley, meanwhile, offers height similar to Rankl, but at wide receiver. The three-star prospect from DeMatha Catholic, a Washington D.C., area powerhouse, is listed at 6-foot-4, 190 pounds. Bradley holds 12 offers, including interest from Virginia and Wake Forest. However, Pitt was Bradley’s first Power Five offer — an offer Narduzzi’s staff extended last November — and the 2021 pass-catcher accepted it.</p>
<p>Pitt hosted both Bradley and Rankl on campus in the past, so neither situation was like Stevenson, who committed Wednesday without visiting. Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, college football coaches are forced to pitch prospects through texts, calls and virtual tours, with the NCAA extending its recruiting dead period through May 31.</p>
<p>Whether or not that will be extended, who knows? In the meantime, Pitt waits for its seventh 2021 commit to announce — and this April run on recruits to possibly continue.</p>
