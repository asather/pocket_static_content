<h1>Paige and Page: Daughters of former Pitt stars help teams win WPIAL championships</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Julius Page was considered one of the best dunkers in the country when he played at Pitt.</p>
<p>One of those slams actually led another former Pitt star to naming his third child after him.</p>
<p>“My parents were watching a Pitt game on TV and he had a crazy dunk,” Paige Morningstar explained. “At the time, they were thinking of names for me. My dad (Darren) looked at my mom (Kim) and said, ‘How about Paige?’ After that, they fell in love with it.’”</p>
<p>About two years after Paige was born, Julius welcomed daughter Perri into the world.</p>
<p>Saturday, Paige and Perri played a big part in helping their teams win WPIAL basketball titles, and it only made sense that it happened at Pitt’s Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Paige Morningstar is a 6-foot junior guard for North Allegheny, and Perri Page a 5-11 sophomore guard for Chartiers Valley. Morningstar scored eight points in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/02/29/North-Allegheny-outlasts-Bethel-Park-in-Class-6A-girls-title-game-for-54-50-overtime-win/stories/202002290075" target="_blank">North Allegheny’s 54-50 overtime win</a> against Bethel Park in the Class 6A championship. Page had 14 points to help <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/02/29/Chartiers-Valley-extends-winning-streak-to-55-games-tops-Trinity-for-WPIAL-title/stories/202002290056" target="_blank">Chartiers Valley win its second straight Class 5A title</a> by beating Trinity, 58-40. The Colts have won 55 games in a row, putting them just one away from the WPIAL record.</p>
<p>“It’s super cool, especially with our dads having both played for Pitt,” Morningstar said. “The whole thing came together and both Paiges won a title the same day.”</p>
<p>Darren Morningstar averaged 12 points and six rebounds a game as a senior at Pitt and was picked by Boston in the second round of the 1992 NBA draft. Julius Page helped the Panthers reach the NCAA tournament each of his four seasons and scored 1,512 career points.</p>
<p>Paige Morningstar has surely met her namesake or his daughter at some point, right?</p>
<p>“It’s really funny because I’ve never met him and I’ve only seen her play once,” Morningstar said, laughing.</p>
<p>Paige and the Pages did exchange some tweets after Saturday’s games.</p>
<p>Both teenagers have bright futures. Morningstar has already committed to play volleyball at Louisville. Page has an offer from Duquesne, and other Division I schools are showing interest.</p>
<p>Morningstar has one other connection to a WPIAL champion from another team: She and Butler star Ethan Morton have been dating for about a year. Morton and Butler played after Morningstar and North Allegheny during Saturday night’s doubleheader which drew 6,600 fans. Paige and Darren watched from the crowd as <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/01/Ethan-Morton-Butler-Mt-Lebanon-WPIAL-6A-title/stories/202003010197" target="_blank">Morton led Butler to a 70-61 win</a> against Mt. Lebanon in the Class 6A championship.</p>
<p>When it comes to WPIAL titles, Morningstar has the bragging rights. Butler’s WPIAL title was its first in 29 years. Morningstar has won two WPIAL basketball titles and two WPIAL volleyball titles. Oh, and she’s won a pair of PIAA volleyball titles, too.</p>
<p>Said Morningstar: “Anytime I complain about anything, he says, ‘You shouldn’t be complaining. You’ve won so much.’ It’s really funny.”</p>
