<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Does Brady-Belichick beat Bradshaw-Noll?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Larry Brown and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Ryan Knee, @Elbowuindagut:</strong> Is Tom Brady really just trying to prove he can win without Belichek?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That’s Belichick to you, Dr. Knee, and while I fully believe Belichick would love to prove he can win without Brady and vice-versa — the egos are massive here, remember, as is the case everywhere in pro sports — I don’t believe that was Brady’s motivation for leaving. I just don’t think he felt wanted anymore.</p>
<p>But here’s a more interesting question (no offense): Was the Belichick-Brady duo the best coach-quarterback tandem of the Super Bowl era?</p>
<p>I would say yes — six Super Bowl titles speak loudly — but not by the wide margin many might believe. Terry Bradshaw and Chuck Noll won nearly as many championships (four) in 14 years as Brady and Belichick did in 20. The Noll-Bradshaw duo was 4-0 in Super Bowls, 14-5 in the playoffs.</p>
<p>No other duo won more than three Super Bowls.</p>
<p>I would put Bill Walsh/Joe Montana third and Bart Starr/Vince Lombardi fourth, even though they did most of their damage before winning the first two Super Bowls.</p>
<p><strong>Mary Mac Bakehouse, @MaryMacMixes:</strong> What a stupid move. (Brady) could have walked away as a hero to New England and his fans, but instead he chooses to do this ... so my question is, what is wrong with people? I don't think there's enough room in the entire paper for your answer…</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> If your question is actually, “What is wrong with people?” then there is not enough room even on the Internet to provide an adequate answer, Mary Mac.</p>
<p>As for Brady, my friend Ken Laird of WEEI in Boston does not believe Robert Kraft’s statement that all Brady had to do was say he wanted to stay and he’d still be in New England. Laird believes Brady was basically forced out — that the Patriots wanted to move on. I believe him, and make no mistake, Brady still walks away as a hero to New England and its fans. They will undoubtedly be on Brady’s side.</p>
<p>It's never easy and rarely pretty when a hero says goodbye.</p>

<p><strong>Matt Zegarelli, @gopenszigg8771:</strong> Can you make sense of the Hopkins for Johnson trade??</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> No. Can you? Bill O’Brien has somehow managed to trade Jadeveon Clowney and DeAndre Hopkins without getting a first-round pick in return. He gave up two first-rounders for Laremy Tunsil. He lost a 24-0 lead in a playoff game.</p>
<p>Other than that, he’s doing a bang-up job as coach/GM of the Texans.</p>
<p>The most embarrassing aspect of the Hopkins trade wasn’t even the trade itself — it was the return Minnesota received later in the day for a lesser receiver in Stefon Diggs.</p>
<p>Closer look:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Hopkins goes to Arizona for backup running back David Johnson and a second-round pick (Clowney netted a third-round pick last year).</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Diggs goes to Buffalo for four draft picks, including a FIRST-ROUNDER.</p>
<p>That’s how it’s done, if you’re going to part with a star receiver.</p>
<p>That said, this is good for the Steelers, because when you look at the AFC, you have to first look at teams that made the playoffs who might not make it this year. Houston is one.</p>
<p><strong>Ray Stein, @RaySteinChannel:</strong> I wonder how Pittsburgh fans would react if Brady ended up with the Steelers?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Should there have been any set of circumstances by which Brady came to Pittsburgh, I’m fully convinced the hate would have turned to adoration in a split second, Mr. Stein (at least until Brady threw his first interception). Heinz Field would have exploded in cheers the first time Brady took the field. I have zero doubt about that.</p>
<p><strong>LJ, @Ldiddles3:</strong> Why did the Vikings get a lot more for Diggs than Houston got for Hopkins?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Let … me … think.</p>
<p>Oh yes, two words. “Bill” and “O’Brien.”</p>
<p><strong>not a pirate, @RevD98:</strong> What about MLB minor league players? Any consideration for them from owners? Pay, living expenses? Training facilities?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Thank you, Mr. not a pirate, for bringing up this issue — because it’s reprehensible what has happened to minor league baseball players in the wake of baseball shutting down. Some of them have nowhere to go. Most of them need money. Thankfully — and perhaps with a bit of push from published reports — teams are taking measures to correct the situation.</p>
<p>This, from Baseball America: “Some teams have taken steps individually. BA correspondent Marc Topkin reported the Rays will continue to pay minor leaguers the $400 a week per diem they normally receive during camp. The Mets also confirmed to BA they will continue to pay minor leaguers the allowances they normally receive during spring training. Dodgers president of baseball operations Andrew Friedman told BA the Dodgers are doing the same. Two other clubs contacted by BA said they are currently in the process of planning measures to compensate their minor leaguers, although formal plans have yet to be established.”</p>
<p>This needs to happen in each and every organization.</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Blackburn, @steelblood1414:</strong> If Hopkins can be had for an oft injured back, perhaps the Steelers can get Mike Evans for Conner?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> If Bill O’Brien were running the Bucs, Dr. Blackburn, I’d consider it a done deal!</p>
