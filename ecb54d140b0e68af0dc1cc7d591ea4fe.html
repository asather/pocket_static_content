<h1>Pirates on pause: Examining the next wave of pitching talent</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>A year ago at this time, it would’ve been a fair criticism.</p>
<p>The Pirates had failed to fully develop Tyler Glasnow and watched him pitch to a 1.86 ERA with 55 strikeouts over his first eight starts with the Tampa Bay Rays. Shane Baz, the player to be named later in the Chris Archer blockbuster trade that was headlined by Glasnow and Austin Meadows, was flirting with triple-digits en route to a key season in his development, one where the 20-year-old had a 2.99 ERA and struck out more than a batter per inning in his first full season at Class A.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, meanwhile, entered the 2019 season badly bereft of starting pitching prospects. Mitch Keller headlined the Pirates’ top 10 overall list, per MLB Pipeline, but the only other sliver of hope entering the year was reliever Luis Escobar, who was designated for assignment last November when the Pirates needed to clear space on their 40-man roster.</p>
<p>What a difference a year makes.</p>
<p>While the Pirates aren’t yet teeming with pitching prospects, they do have a few legitimate arms who could bolster the rotation in years to come. It’s a group headlined by 2019 first-round draft pick Quinn Priester and another hard-throwing righty in Brennan Malone, one of two key pieces in the Starling Marte trade.</p>
<p>“There’s actually some depth with potential, high-upside guys,” said Larry Broadway, Pittsburgh’s senior director of minor league operations. “Any time that you’ve got that to work with, it’s exciting. Big strong guys with big arms who do it pretty clean, then have some pedigree ... it’s fun for our staff. It’s fun for our coaches and coordinators to see those guys grow and develop and work together and what could be.”</p>
<p>Priester and Malone aren’t alone, either, which is even more good news for the Pirates. Hard-throwing reliever Blake Cederlind turned heads during spring training and could soon be ticketed for a back-end bullpen role, while there are several other young starters who have shown promise.</p>
<p>A couple of traits link the group, Broadway said. In addition to above-average velocity among the hurlers who occupy seven of the top 16 spots on MLB Pipeline’s annual list, they also have good size — all are at least 6-foot-3, and five are 6-4 or 6-5 — and athleticism.</p>
<p>“They’re not slugs,” Broadway said. “They’re guys who can move.”</p>
<p>Priester is Exhibit A of that. Already considered the Pirates’ fourth-best prospect behind Keller, Ke’Bryan Hayes and Oneil Cruz, Priester played football his entire life, switching from quarterback to tight end his senior year of high school and also excelling as a defensive back.</p>
<p>This offseason, Priester has bulked up and looks every bit of 215 pounds.</p>
<p>The transition to professional baseball went very well for Priester, who wound up striking out 41, walking 14 and pitching to a 3.19 ERA in 36 2/3 innings with the Gulf Coast League Pirates and one four-inning outing with Class A-Short Season West Virginia.</p>
<p>Priester’s four-seam velocity sat at around 93 mph and touched 97. His sinker and curveball played. His changeup needs work, but he’s also only 19.</p>
<p>Malone, meanwhile, is in a similar situation — drafted out of high school with a ton of tools. His fastball has been around 96 mph with very good breaking pitches. The same as Priester, there’s work to be done on Malone’s changeup, as well as consistency with his delivery and the typical development-of-a-young-pitcher stuff.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic won’t help Priester and Malone, as the Pirates hoped to get them acclimated to year-round work — navigating a set number of starts, getting on a five-, six- or seven-day plan between them while maintaining velocity and making improvements between those outings.</p>
<p>With the strong possibility there won’t be a minor league season in 2020, the Pirates will have to figure out other ways to help these two future front-line starters improve.</p>
<p>Behind Priester and Malone, 21-year-old Cody Bolton comes in at No. 10 and has been good in spurts. His issue has been health, as the sixth-round pick from 2017 battled forearm tightness in 2018 and a groin strain in 2019.</p>
<p>Despite Bolton’s injuries, the results have been very good when he’s been healthy. Bolton breezed through High-A Bradenton in 2019, striking out 69 over 12 starts (61 2/3 innings) and pitching to a 1.61 ERA. Class AA proved to be an adjustment, as Bolton wound up with a 5.85 ERA and a WHIP that went from 0.859 to 1.325.</p>
<p>“He’s really effective when he’s healthy and takes the ball,” Broadway said. “We have to make sure he does that as much as possible without getting banged up and losing time.”</p>
<p>Bolton has some interesting stuff that could play well at the major league level, employing two different fastballs and a plus slider. His four-seamer topped out at 97 mph with a high spin rate. The two-seamer has sink and has netted ground balls.</p>
<p>The biggest wild card among Pirates pitching prospects is probably Tahnaj Thomas, a converted infielder the Pirates acquired from Cleveland in the deal that featured Erik Gonzalez for Jordan Luplow and Max Moroff. Thomas averaged 96 mph and topped out at 100, but his ancillary pitches need work.</p>
<p>Despite a fastball-heavy arsenal, Thomas — still only 20 — fared well at rookie-advanced Bristol in 2019, pitching to a 3.17 ERA with 59 strikeouts and just 14 walks in 48 1/3 innings in 12 starts. Where Thomas goes from here should be fascinating, along with Braxton Ashcraft, another hard-thrower with a football background.</p>
<p>Ashcraft was a second-round pick in 2018. His numbers last year weren’t very good (1-9, 5.77 ERA, 39 strikeouts in 53 innings), but he also dealt with an injury to his left, non-throwing shoulder. Ashcraft (No. 14 per MLB Pipeline) and Santiago Florez (No. 16) are two down-the-line guys worth tracking due to their velocity and breaking stuff.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, the biggest injection of pitching talent should come from Cederlind, who touched triple-digits in spring training and has seen his career take off since incorporating a sinker into his pitch mix.</p>
<p>Broadway said the Pirates want to see Cederlind settle on a breaking ball and better develop that. Cederlind also throws a changeup, which could use some refinement, as well. But the velocity is excellent, the same for Cederlind’s Nuke LaLoosh-like demeanor on the mound.</p>
<p>“He’s made huge strides since two years ago,” Broadway said of Cederlind. “Re-tooled his work ethic and focus. You look at what he went through last year, he’s a completely different pitcher as far as being able to dominate a strike zone and dominate his process. The stuff is huge, obviously. Triple-digits.</p>
<p>“He’s been toying with a slider and a curveball. It blends to a slurve. He’s still trying to get a feel for which one he likes the best, which ones gives him the best action and the best results. That will be a focus for him.”</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING: </strong>In his time with Class AA Altoona last season, Cederlind went 5-1 with a 1.77 ERA, striking out 42 and walking 16 in 45 2/3 innings.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS: </strong>Malone is a North Carolina native and was committed to the University of North Carolina when the Diamondbacks drafted him No. 33 overall in 2019. However, as a high school senior, Malone attended IMG Academy near the Pirates’ spring training home in Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p><strong>HE SAID IT: </strong>“With some big bodies you get some tradeoffs with some twitch and athleticism, but I think the guys that we’re looking at in the top of this depth area, we’re not making those tradeoffs. They’re strong guys — large frames, big and tall — but they also move well. They move quickly. I think that bodes well for them.” — Broadway on the Pirates’ top pitching prospects.</p>
