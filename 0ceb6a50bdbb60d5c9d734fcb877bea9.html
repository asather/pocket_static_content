<h1>Port Authority sets community meetings on future transit plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority will kick off a series of public engagement meetings called&nbsp;“Public Transit: A Community Discussion” with three sessions at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center on Jan. 29.</p>
<p>The authority’s goal during the three-hour sessions is to hear from the public on a broad range of issues, including the agency’s long-range plan, fare policy and the development of technology to allow payment by cellphone. The program is designed for the public to ask questions and participate in the discussion.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to engage communities while it's still early on for many of these topics so we can get a better sense of the direction our stakeholders want us to go,” CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said in a news release. “We felt it was important to hold these get-togethers now so we can talk about these issues before we make any major decisions.”</p>
<p>The current schedule and list of locations can be found below and at <a title="Port Authority public engagement meetings" href="http://www.PortAuthority.org/GetTogether" target="_blank">www.PortAuthority.org/GetTogether</a>.</p>
