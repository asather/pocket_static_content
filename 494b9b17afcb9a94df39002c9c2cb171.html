<h1>'It is different': Tide is turning when it comes to national anthem protests </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While driving outside of his hometown of Portsmouth, N.H., recently, Ian Troost had to stop himself mid-sentence. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. As the former Pitt football player passed a farm, he spotted a large plywood sign rising from the ground. On it, in a county in which 95% of residents are white, was the message “Black Lives Matter.”</p>
<p>“That’s awesome,” Troost said.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, moments like that have become much more common. It’s not just Troost’s small corner of southeastern New Hampshire that’s changing; it’s the entire United States.</p>
<p>Following the killings of George Floyd in Minneapolis and Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Ky., recent examples in a string of well-publicized deaths of Black people at the hands of law enforcement, public outcry and protests in cities large and small have forced Americans to confront the country’s sordid racial history and begin trying to find answers to institutional, centuries-old problems.</p>
<p>One area in which a shifting landscape is most evident is all too familiar to Troost. In 2017, while he was a walk-on kicker, he knelt as the national anthem was played before Pitt’s games against Rice and N.C. State to protest police brutality and systemic racism. By doing so, Troost and other athletes, from NFL standouts to high-school football players, were following the lead of Colin Kaepernick, who first knelt during the national anthem in 2016 while a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers.</p>
<p>Once rebuked, such acts and the movement they represent are rapidly becoming more accepted. A Yahoo News/YouGov poll released June 11 found that 52% of Americans agree it is “OK for NFL players to kneel during the national anthem to protest police killings of African-Americans” compared to 36% who say it’s inappropriate to do so.</p>
<p>As the nation continues to grapple with questions about race, it’s doing the same with the way it perceives one of the enduring symbols of that fight.</p>
<p>“Increasingly, there’s a huge network of athletes who are progressive, articulate and willing to speak out despite the consequences,” said Rob Ruck, a history professor at Pitt who specializes in the history of sport. “Forty years ago, when an athlete or coach would have done that, their livelihood would have been threatened. Think of all the guys who were not stars whose careers were ended prematurely because of their willingness to speak out. That’s less likely these days. It not only feels different; it is different.”</p>
<p>The abrupt repositioning has led to images and statements that, as recently as a month ago, might have seemed unimaginable, from police officers kneeling and marching with protesters to Utah senator Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president in 2012, taking part in a protest in Washington D.C., and telling a reporter he was doing so “to make sure that people understand that Black lives matter.”</p>
<p>In sports, the transformation has been just as astonishing.</p>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, who stood as a face for Kaepernick’s exclusion from the league, admitted he and others around the sport were wrong for not listening to NFL players earlier. He encouraged them to continue to speak out and peacefully protest, even adding that “I personally protest with you and want to be part of the much-needed change in this country.”</p>
<p>As it relates to kneeling, one of the biggest changes has been the way the argument around it has morphed.</p>
<p>When Kaepernick first knelt — a method he opted for after a conversation with Nate Boyer, a former NFL player and a retired Green Beret — the message he was trying to convey became muddled in a polarized political environment. In a 2016 Yahoo News/YouGov poll, only 28% of Americans considered Kaepernick’s actions “appropriate,” and a Reuters poll from September 2016 revealed that 72% of respondents thought his protest was “unpatriotic.” Even two years later, in an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll from August 2018, only 43% of people said kneeling was an appropriate way to bring attention to the cause players were championing.</p>
<p>In the eyes of some, dropping to a knee during the anthem was a repudiation of the country’s flag and military. Rather quickly, it’s a viewpoint that is declining in prevalence.</p>
<p>“I think I had to get past the fact that it wasn’t about the flag,” Tennessee Titans quarterback Ryan Tannehill told reporters last Wednesday. “It wasn’t about the anthem. It wasn’t about our country. It was about the injustice and raising awareness and getting people’s attention. I think once I got past that fact, I could really support it.”</p>
<p>Maybe the most notable example of that real-time evolution was seen with Drew Brees. Following an interview in early June in which the New Orleans Saints quarterback opposed kneeling, saying he would never agree “with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country,” his comments were passionately condemned, including by some of his own teammates. Within 24 hours, he issued a lengthy apology, stating “we can no longer use the flag to turn people away or distract them from the real issues that face our Black communities.”</p>
<p>Brees’ saga is instructive. What was very recently a predominant sentiment became a source of widespread criticism. But what brought that change at such an accelerated rate?</p>
<p>As it is with players protesting, American opinion on the Black Lives Matter movement has evolved. According to data from Civiqs, an online survey research firm, 53% of Americans support Black Lives Matter, up from 42% as recently as April 18. In a Washington Post poll this month, 69% of respondents said the killing of Floyd was “a sign of broader problems in treatment of Black Americans by police,” not an isolated incident. In 2014, after the killing of Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Mo., only 43% said that was the case. A poll this month from Monmouth found that 76% of Americans said racial and ethnic discrimination is “a big problem” in the U.S., up from 51% in January 2015.</p>
<p>“Black Lives Matter is becoming less political in my mind,” Troost said. “It never should have been political to begin with.”</p>
<p>The far-reaching effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately affected the Black community and has stripped much of the country of whatever sense of comfort it previously had, may also play a factor.</p>
<p>“I think the crisis intensifies the process of change,” Ruck said. “Crisis makes you look at things differently because you’re faced with different situations. Going along the way you were doesn’t seem to be working, so you’re more open to looking at things differently and trying different things.”</p>
<p>Public opinion when it comes to athletes and activism, as Ruck knows well, seldom hastens in the way it has the past several weeks. Figures as exalted as Muhammad Ali, Tommie Smith and John Carlos were once reviled, with feelings toward them taking years or even decades to change.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of athletes today who feel very secure in speaking their mind,” Ruck said. “That builds. There’s a critical mass.”</p>
<p>That’s not to say modern athletes are free of backlash should they choose to protest. Despite throwing 16 touchdowns to only four interceptions in 2016, Kaepernick has been out of the NFL since then, eventually filing a collusion grievance against the league that was settled in 2019.</p>
<p>Even for Troost, a white kicker on a team that finished 5-7 the season during which he knelt, difficult days that followed his protest. He said he had Gatorade dumped on his shoulder pads and cherry juice poured on his sweatpants while he was away from his locker, retaliation he said was put to an end once it was brought to the attention of Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi. Some coaches, he said, wouldn’t even acknowledge him unless an opportunity arose to yell at him.</p>
<p>His actions also put him at odds with Pitt’s athletic leadership. After he knelt prior to the Panthers’ game against N.C. State, he said he had a meeting with athletic director Heather Lyke, deputy athletic director Christian Spears and members of Pitt’s life skills department that he described as cordial. In the days that followed, he said he had a second meeting with Lyke and Spears that became contentious after he informed them that he planned on continuing his protest.</p>
<p>“I can’t remember if they explicitly said they were losing money, but it was very implied if it wasn’t straight-up said,” Troost said. “I was told ‘You don’t know how many emails I’m getting from donors and season-ticket holders.’ The implication was ‘You don’t know how deep this runs.’ It almost felt like a threat. ‘You don’t know how high up this goes.’ My thought process was that we were losing all this money and that seemed to be more of your concern than the message of the protest. I remember being called selfish, that I didn’t care about my teammates, that I was trying to be a distraction. The whole thing definitely did not sit well with me.”</p>
<p>In response to an interview request with Lyke, Pitt’s athletic department provided a statement noting it&nbsp;“fully respects and supports its student-athletes’ right to free speech.”</p>
<p>Troost’s experience wasn’t entirely dismal. Years removed from it, he can look back on moments that may have foretold what’s unfolding across the country.</p>
<p>He said he had conversations with teammates who disagreed with him, virtually all of them white, in which he would explain why he was doing what he did. As white men, Troost would tell them, we can never fully understand some of the dangers and challenges that our Black teammates and Black people across the country endure. Though it wasn’t the case with everyone, Troost said most of the teammates with whom he spoke came away sympathetic to the cause, even if they didn’t agree with his methods to amplify it. Some of those conversations with teammates continue today.</p>
<p>“I would try to just be like ‘Hey, take a moment to listen,’ ” Troost said. “While you may disagree with me kneeling, I’m not asking you to kneel with me. Just listen. Try to listen to some experiences because then you’ll have the opportunity to see that we are treated a lot differently.”</p>
<p>Nearly three years after Troost first knelt, there have been some apparent shifts within the program he once represented when it comes to addressing race and police brutality.</p>
<p>On June 4, the Panthers’ entire team and coaching staff had a two-and-a-half hour Zoom conference in which recent nationwide protests and the forces that prompted them were discussed. After a former player alleged that Narduzzi would sometimes use the word “thug” when describing opponents and his own players, the Pitt coach released a statement last week saying he no longer uses the word after learning its connotations and how its meaning has changed. Last Thursday, while wearing shirts with the phrase “Black Lives Matter” printed on them, all of Pitt’s players, coaches and staff knelt together on a lawn near the Cathedral of Learning for eight minutes and 46 seconds, the length of time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck.</p>
<p>The NFL has been inching toward progress, as well. The league pledged to donate $250 million over a 10-year period to “support the battle against the ongoing and historic injustices faced by African-Americans.” Several prominent players — including Brees, Tom Brady, Carson Wentz, Dak Prescott and Myles Garrett —&nbsp;are part of a group of about 1,400 athletes, coaches and general managers across sports who signed a letter to Congress in support of a bill that would eliminate qualified immunity for government officials, including law enforcement. Washington running back Adrian Peterson said he plans on kneeling during the national anthem this season. and he expects many other players to join him. Houston Texans coach and general manager Bill O’Brien, who is white, has said he’ll kneel with his players.</p>
<p>Some of those pledges have been met with skepticism and questions of how genuine those efforts are and how far they’ll go, both in the NFL and in society at large.</p>
<p>Some of the same police departments that had officers kneel with or hug protesters were later shown to use aggressive tactics against them, like in Buffalo, where officers pushed a 75-year-old man to the ground and caused him to suffer a brain injury. Even as Goodell apologized for the NFL’s previous lack of support, he didn’t mention Kaepernick’s name.</p>
<p>How much longer the NFL and its owners remain in solidarity with their protesting players also remains in question. With a bid for re-election looming in November, President Donald Trump has again set his sights on protesting NFL players, criticizing Brees for apologizing for his previous stance on kneeling and questioning Goodell’s statement.</p>
<p>“Could it be even remotely possible that in Roger Goodell’s rather interesting statement of peace and reconciliation, he was intimating that it would now be O.K. for the players to KNEEL, or not to stand, for the National Anthem, thereby disrespecting our Country &amp; our Flag?” the president tweeted on June 7.</p>
<p>Will NFL owners — seven of whom donated at least $1 million to Trump’s inaugural committee, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/2017/09/24/how-much-money-nfl-owners-have-donated-donald-trump/698256001/" target="_blank">according to USA Today</a>&nbsp;—&nbsp;continue to stand with their players? Or will they, as they were in 2017 after Trump used derogatory language when describing protesting NFL players, be more concerned about blowback?</p>
<p>Uncertain as the future may be, the present, for all the turmoil it contains, does offer some hope for the athletes who publicly devoted themselves to fight for change. The history of race relations in America offers plenty of reasons to be jaded, but maybe, they say to themselves, this moment will be different.</p>
<p>“I think the shift you’re seeing is people realizing they can speak on their beliefs,” Troost said. “I wouldn’t necessarily say they have not believed it, but they were afraid they would say something the wrong way. That’s a very valid fear, but at the end of the day, if you remain silent because of that fear, you’re not helping the cause. You’re helping the voices who are against it be louder.”</p>
