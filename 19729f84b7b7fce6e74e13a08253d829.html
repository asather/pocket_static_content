<h1>Steelers corner Mike Hilton has overcome the odds and is poised to cash in</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mike Hilton and several of his high-profile Steelers teammates are entering the final year of their contracts in a most uncertain time in the NFL. Hilton joins Cam Heyward, Bud Dupree, JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner, Alejandro Villanueva and Matt Feiler as starters with contracts that are set to expire at year’s end.</p>
<p>Not that it’s anything new to Hilton, who has been the Steelers’ top slot corner since 2017. He’s played his entire four-year career on one-year contracts.</p>
<p>As an undrafted free agent who has had to scrap and claw for every contract he has earned in the NFL, Hilton has a much different perspective on contract years. All draft picks enter the league with four-year contracts. Undrafted free agents become exclusive rights free agents, then restricted free agents, before finally becoming unrestricted free agents.</p>
<p>That’s what Hilton will be in March if the Steelers don’t come to terms with him on a new contract. For Hilton, it’s a gigantic step in his career path. He’s made $1.6 million in earning over the first three years of his career, which amounts to about the NFL minimum each season. He’s making $3.2 million on his restricted free agent tender this year.&nbsp;Just getting into this situation is a blessing.</p>
<p>“Being undrafted and becoming one of the top players at my position and being able to produce over these last couple of years is a blessing I don’t take for granted,” he said.&nbsp;“With the contract situation, I’m not really focused on it. I know what’s at the end of the tunnel. I just have to do what I can to provide for this team what it needs to win games.”</p>
<p>What’s at the end of the tunnel is a lot of coin. It’s not a stretch to think the signing bonus on his next contract will be more than his career earnings.</p>
<p>Hilton arrived in 2016 when he was signed to the practice squad during the season. By training camp, he supplanted veteran William Gay as the slot corner.</p>
<p>Since then, he’s been a dependable and well-rounded player who has been hard to take out of the lineup. The Steelers took Cam Sutton in the third round of the 2017 draft, but he has not been able to wrestle the slot corner duties away from Hilton, whose hard-nosed approach is appreciated by his coaches and teammates.</p>
<p>Hilton has played in 47 of a possible 48 games, missing only one due to injury in 2018. He’s made 14 starts, including a career-high eight last season.</p>
<p>At 5-feet-9 and 184 pounds, Hilton had to overcome the typical NFL biases when it comes to diminutive players. NFL scouts look for length, height and other measurables in corners, things Hilton did not possess coming out of Mississippi.</p>
<p>But he’s made up for it by being a strong run-stopper, a surprisingly effective blitzer off the edge and a solid player in coverage.</p>
<p>“It’s just grind non-stop,” Hilton said. “I know that’s cliché. And I know a lot of athletes say that. But the effort you put in, it really shows in your play and results. I really feel like in these last few years I feel like I’ve been gaining a lot of momentum in knowing how to take care of my body, and it’s paying off on the field when I’m able to go out there and make plays.”</p>
<p>The Steelers would like to keep Hilton beyond this season, but they’d also like to retain Heyward, Smith-Schuster, Feiler and others. Feiler, like Hilton, is a former undrafted free agent who has made the league minimum until this season.</p>
<p>The truth of the matter is there is not enough money to go around for all of them, especially with the salary cap possibly decreasing by as much as $23 million in 2021 due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The more likely outcome is Hilton cashing in on a big contract on the open market. If he does strike it rich, it will be because of his well-rounded skill set.</p>
<p>“You have to prepare for whatever [as a slot corner],” Hilton said. “You have to prepare for the pass game. Going against slot receivers, it’s more short quick routes to get the ball to them in space. But you also have to have run-support ability and be ready to go because you’ll be filling in the B-gap and taking on linemen.</p>
<p>“For me, it goes hand-in-hand. I feel like with my run stopping ability, I’m one of the best. And with my coverage, I’m also one of the best. I feel good about how I’m going into this year.”</p>
