<p>SONOMA, Calif. — A makeshift noose was found hanging from a tree at the Sonoma Raceway in California and officials said they were investigating the incident.</p>
<p>Raceway President Steve Page said a “piece of twine tied in what appeared to be a noose” was found hanging from a tree Saturday behind a former administrative office, news outlets reported.</p>
<p>Page said the incident was under investigation by the Sonoma County Sheriff’s Department. He also said he has asked staff and on-site business tenants to share any information or “any possible alternative explanation.”</p>
<p>Sonoma was closed over the weekend due the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The discovery at Sonoma, the biggest auto racing venue in the Bay Area, comes after a noose was found hanging in the garage of Bubba Wallace Sunday at Talladega Superspeedway in Alabama. Mr. Wallace is the only full-time Black driver in NASCAR.</p>
<p>Mr. Wallace has been a prominent activist in the sport and was instrumental in calling on NASCAR to ban Confederate flags at its events.</p>
<p>He placed 14th at the NASCAR Cup Series race on Monday.</p>
