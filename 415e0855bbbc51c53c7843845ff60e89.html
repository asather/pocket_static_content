<h1>Pirates claim Sean Poppen; designate JT Riddle for assignment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Pirates claimed another project arm, this time from the Minnesota Twins, and designated JT Riddle for assignment on Thursday.</span></p>
<p>The pitcher they claimed was right-hander Sean Poppen, a 26-year-old who made six relief appearances in Minnesota this past season, allowing four earned runs over 7 2/3 innings while walking four and striking out 10. He also pitched in four games with the Twins in 2019.</p>
<p>Poppen is a Harvard graduate and someone the Twins drafted in the 19th round back in 2016. A Virginia Beach native, Poppen has also started plenty; 16 of his 20 minor league appearances came that way in 2019, as he pitched across two levels.</p>
<p>Poppen went 7-4 in those games with a 4.01 ERA and 107 strikeouts in 89 2/3 innings, relying on a sinker that sits 94-95 mph.</p>
<p>He typically throws that more than half the time and sticks to two pitches, pairing the sinker with a slider and occasionally mixing in a changeup.</p>
<p>It's probably worth noting that the Pirates found success this season with two guys who have similar profiles; Geoff Hartlieb went all sinker-slider, and Sam Howard dramatically upped his slider usage.</p>
<p>Poppen was actually designated for assignment on Monday to make room for Plumâ€™s Alex Kirilloff, who made his MLB debut in the postseason.</p>
<p>The Pirates signed JT Riddle this past offseason to a deal designed to give them infield depth. It never came close to panning out. In fact, Riddle became a source of fan frustration, as it became quite puzzling why he was even playing.</p>
<p>The 28-year-old wound up hitting just .149/.174/.224 in 23 games, including 19 starts. Riddle also struck out 13 times and walked twice in 69 plate appearances.</p>
