<h1>Superior Court refuses to consider Israeli man's bail request</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Superior Court on Wednesday denied review of an emergency petition seeking release from the Allegheny County Jail for an Israeli man who pleaded guilty to sexual assault.</p>
<p>Moshe Journo filed the emergency petition on April 10 asking to be released from the jail because he has several medical conditions that he put him at increased risk of contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>Journo, 54, pleaded guilty in December to aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault, statutory sexual assault and indecent assault. The charges stem from allegations that he raped a 15-year-old girl at a Dormont tanning salon on Sept. 6, 2004.</p>
<p>Journo posted a $25,000 bond after his arrest and fled back to Israel. He was returned to the United States in 2019.= and pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>However, four days prior to his March sentencing date, Journo’s new attorney filed a motion seeking to withdraw his plea.</p>
<p>That motion has not yet been ruled on.</p>
<p>However, Common Pleas Judge Bruce Beemer did consider Journo’s request for release from the jail and denied it, finding that there are no conditions of release that would ensure the defendant’s appearance in court.</p>
