<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: R.J. Reynolds and the gift of teaching</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Having the right coach at Pirates Fantasy Camp — or any event like this — can make all the difference. What you want is someone fun, someone who wants to be there and has a better time than many of the campers.</p>
<p>We definitely got a good one in R.J. Reynolds, the former Pirates outfielder whose energy and passion for baseball made every day a blast. Reynolds was an assistant coach under manager Rick Rueschel on my squad, Team Traynor.</p>
<p>Reynolds’ career in Pittsburgh certainly wasn’t equal to that of Barry Bonds or Andy Van Slyke, the outfielders with whom he rubbed elbows for parts of six seasons in Pittsburgh, but the Sacramento, Calif. native did play on some pretty good teams.</p>
<p>Reynolds will be 62 years old in April, though he doesn’t look or act his age. He’s full of a ton of energy. On our team, Reynolds was always talking, always motivating, always coaching. All of it, from this seat anyway, was greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>“I like to connect with people,” Reynolds told me one night at LECOM Park. “For me, this is fun. It brings back some great memories because I think sometimes you have a tendency to forget where you’ve been.</p>
<p>“When I come down here, it’s a way for me to give back. Without the fans, we’re really not a whole lot.”</p>
<p>Reynolds lives in Sacramento now and serves as a hitting instructor for an organization called Power Alley. He has around 25 clients that he instructs twice a week, including a lot of girls playing fastpitch softball.</p>
<p>Hitting is obviously a major focal point of Reynolds’ work, but he doesn’t confine his coaching to baseball. The kids he works with hear a lot about off-field accountability, how to overcome adversity and handling their schoolwork.</p>
<p>“My cage and my hitting lessons are more like a church,” Reynolds said. “We talk about a lot of things. We’re not just talking about hitting baseballs. I want to know how you’re doing in school, how you’re doing in life, what’s going on in your life. Because at some point, you’re going to leave home. A kid can have talent, but if he or she leaves home and they’re not prepared, they’re always come back because they don’t know how to survive.”</p>
<p>These days, Reynolds said he’s “living his best life.” His post-playing career was something of a struggle for Reynolds to find happiness. He worked in special education, including at a juvenile detention center. He also spoke at group homes. But inside, Reynolds said he struggled with the adjustment from being a professional baseball player to just another guy.</p>
<p>“You get delusional. You lose your way,” Reynolds said. “There was a time when I got out of baseball, I was kind of embarrassed of the fact that I was R.J. Reynolds. I didn’t know how to live with R.J. Reynolds and Robert [his given name]. I had to find Robert. I couldn’t go out on a date unless I had a couple hundred dollars in my pocket. You’re transformed into this false sense of the world.</p>
<p>“The sooner you get grounded again, then you can start putting yourself back together again. I wasn’t ashamed that I played in the major leagues. It was more depression about what I should have done when I was playing baseball.”</p>
<p>Reynolds’ best season as a Pirate came in 1986, when he set career-highs in hits (108), doubles (30), home runs (9) and OPS (.755). But he still finished his career as a .267 hitter with an OPS of .702 — numbers that mean you probably better have something lined up once you’re forced to retire.</p>
<p>Reynolds did not.</p>
<p>Which is why he focuses on what he does at Power Alley, trying his best to prepare the kids with whom he works for what he calls “the afterlife,” essentially everything other than playing baseball.</p>
<p>“What I try to teach kids is that if you don’t have a B plan, you don’t have a plan,” Reynolds said. “My thing is trying to prepare you for the things that I did not prepare for. Fortunately enough I’ve landed on my feet, but why should everybody have to endure that difficult journey?</p>
<p>“I need you to prepare for what’s going to happen because you’re not going to play baseball forever. You’re not going to play sports forever. You have a love for something, then find out what your niche is in that sport.”</p>
<p>Watch him coach, and Reynolds has definitely found his niche. He’s the perfect mix of funny and relatable, at one point reminding us that, “Gentlemen, we use profanity in this game.” He had other funny one-liners that I probably can’t repeat here.</p>
<p>In the batting cages, Reynolds worked with one of our guys, Dean Doyen, on loading up and involving his lower half. Doyen wound up doing some serious damage after that one-on-one session with Reynolds.</p>
<p>At one point early in camp, Reynolds pulled me aside and offered some encouraging words about my swing — positivity that really, truly meant a lot — and he told me to swing harder, to attack the ball. I did and wound up with a couple triples and doubles and hitting surprisingly well all week.</p>
<p>“It’s something for someone to want your autograph, but I’ve been here with doctors, lawyers, chiefs of police and FBI guys,” Reynold said. “I tell them, That’s what I call a career. I want what you want.’ I’ll joke with them and say, ‘Your career lasted a whole lot longer than mine.’</p>
<p>“But I get to go back in time here and enjoy what God has given me, the talent he’s given me, and that’s the ability to connect with people. That’s what I do. I enjoy it. I do people.”</p>
