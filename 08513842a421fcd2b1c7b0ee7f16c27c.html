<h1>Cruisin’ Tikis Pittsburgh to set sail again starting June 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Pennsylvania begins easing social-distancing restrictions statewide, businesses that had to close are beginning to slowly reopen their doors. Or, in some cases, set sail.</p>
<p>On Monday, Cruisin’ Tikis Pittsburgh — which has been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2018/03/27/Cruisin-Tikis-tiki-bar-boat-Three-Rivers-Greg-Darby-pittsburgh/stories/201803260130" target="_blank">offering tiki cruises</a> down Pittsburgh’s three rivers since 2018 — announced it will be resuming service beginning June 1. They’ve even adopted a new tagline appropriate for the age of COVID-19: “We take social distancing to a tropical level.”</p>
<p>“We think that we are a great alternative for people who want to get out and socialize,” said co-owner Dale McCue. “I know that there are a lot of people who want to get out to bars and restaurants and are wary of doing that. I think Cruisin’ Tikis Pittsburgh provides a safe and different option for them.”</p>

<p>The company laid out <a href="https://www.cruisintikispittsburgh.com/" target="_blank">a few of the tactics</a> it will take to keep its passengers safe on its website. They include no longer providing a cooler, bottled water or ice on the boats; cleaning every inch of the vessels between cruises; and captains now being required to wear masks while guests are on board.</p>
<p>Cruisin’ Tiki boats are 16 feet wide and only hold six people plus the captain, who steers from the center and is surrounded by the barlike area where guests are seated. The cruises will be limited to “friends or family members that you’ve felt safe around” to avoid putting anyone in uncomfortable or potentially unsafe situations, according to Mr. McCue.</p>
<p>“There’s some distance in between you and the next person just by the design of the boat,” he said. “So we think that’s a plus.”</p>
<p>Though coolers will no longer be provided by Cruisin’ Tiki, Mr. McCue said folks will be allowed to bring their own small ones. Guests are still permitted to bring alcohol on board, and Mr. McCue said that he spoke with state officials who said that passengers will not be required to wear masks, though it is suggested that they do so between consuming food and beverages.</p>
<p>Given the COVID-19 breakouts that have occurred on cruise ships over the last few months, Mr. McCue understands why folks may be hesitant to hit the water again this soon. He did want to make it clear, however, that Cruisin’ Tikis Pittsburgh is nothing like those much larger boats.</p>
<p>“We’re totally different form going on a cruise ship,” he said. “This is just a two-hour cruise out on the water to give people the opportunity to celebrate special occasions, see our city from a different vantage point ... and there’s really limited interaction between our captains and our guests.”</p>
<p>Mr. McCue hopes that Cruisin’ Tikis can give Pittsburghers an opportunity to safely enjoy a nice summer day on the city’s rivers and take their minds off the world’s troubles for a few hours.</p>
<p>“It’s been a long, difficult winter and spring,” he said. “We’re going to do everything we can to make sure our boats are clean. ... We want everyone to feel comfortable coming on board.”</p>
