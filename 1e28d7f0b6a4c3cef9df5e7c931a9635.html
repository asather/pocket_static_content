<h1>Pirates acquire left-handed pitcher Austin Davis from Phillies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Pirates on Wednesday added to their stable of pitchers recently jettisoned by other teams, as they acquired left-hander Austin Davis from the Phillies for a player to be named and cash considerations.</span></p>
<p>Davis, 27, went 4-1 with a 2.75 ERA last season with Class AAA Lehigh Valley, striking out 64 in 52 1/3 innings while holding opponents to a .224 batting average in 37 relief appearances.</p>
<p>Davis, who had seven separate stints with the Phillies during the 2019 season, made the International League’s midseason All-Star team.</p>
<p>Since his big league debut with the Phillies in 2018, Davis is 1-2 with a 5.86 ERA in 58 1/3 major league innings across 50 relief appearances, totaling 64 strikeouts.</p>
<p>Davis had made four relief appearances for the Phillies in 2020 before he was designated for assignment on Aug. 21.</p>
<p>A 12th-round pick in 2014, Davis is 18-13 with 10 saves, a 2.99 ERA, 336 strikeouts and a .232 batting average against in 174 appearances during his minor league career.</p>
<p>Because of a rash of injuries, the Pirates have been searching for pitching depth, routinely acquiring players after they have been DFA’d by other teams.</p>
<p>Tyler Bashlor, Nick Tropeano and Carson Fulmer are among the recent acquisitions they’ve made, a group that now includes Davis.</p>
