<h1>Pablo Reyes back with Pirates after clearing waivers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pablo Reyes is back in the Pirates organization as of Thursday night and has been outrighted to Class AAA Indianapolis.</p>
<p>The Pirates designated Reyes for assignment when the team signed free agent outfielder Guillermo Heredia last week.</p>
<p>None of the other 29 teams signed Reyes, which allowed him to clear waivers on Thursday. The Pirates have been mostly quiet when it comes to player signings this offseason. However, the team did sign Heredia and catcher Luke Maile.</p>
<p>Those moves put the Piratesâ€™ 40-man roster at 40, and Reyes was the odd man out.</p>
<p>Reyes can play several positions, so it was a slight surprise that the Pirates DFA'd him. He made a strong impression with his September 2018 call-up by hitting .286 with three home runs.</p>
<p>In 2019, the 26-year-old hit .203, 19 RBIs and two home runs with a .596 OPS over 71 games with the Pirates.</p>
<p>He will get another opportunity to make the roster when spring training starts in February.</p>
