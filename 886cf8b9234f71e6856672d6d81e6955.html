<h1>No action needed: Medical transport system remains unchanged </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sometimes the best course of action is no action.</p>
<p>Low-income Medicaid patients will not have changes or disruptions in their transportation service for nonemergency medical care because a state agency wisely dropped plans for cost-cutting measures.</p>
<p>It was the right decision that came about because a number of stakeholders raised legitimate concerns about the effect on those served.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services had planned a series of sweeping changes to the Medical Assistance Transportation Program, which provides Medicaid patients — often in rural areas — with transportation to their doctor, dentist or pharmacy.</p>
<p>The department intended to contract with a brokerage firm to manage a call center for the service and negotiate with transportation networks.</p>
<p>Advocates, legislators and the county officials tasked with running the program in their communities raised concerns about how clients would be affected. A bipartisan group of legislators inserted language into a human services bill last year that called for a study before any changes to the system.</p>
<p>The study, released last month, confirmed what many already suspected: The current system works well in meeting the needs of clients, “a mix of low-income, medically needy, and aged populations.”</p>
<p>Those who use the service said they are, for the most part, satisfied with it.</p>
<p>The proposed changes could save the state money, the analysis concluded, but it could also mean higher transportation costs for the counties, which run the program locally in various ways — some providing transportation directly, some through vendors, some through a combination of the two.</p>
<p>Although officials with the Department of Human Services said they intend to continue studying ways to improve the system, it will remain unchanged for the time being, based on the study’s findings.</p>
<p>That’s good news for those who rely on the service and might otherwise face real hardship for something as simple as making it to a doctor appointment.</p>
