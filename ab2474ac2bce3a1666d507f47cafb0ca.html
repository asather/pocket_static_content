<h1>GM Jim Rutherford on how he plans to retool the Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following the Penguins’ disappointing four-game flameout in the qualifying round, general manager Jim Rutherford promised change.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long to get it. He dismissed the three main assistant coaches just a day later. Then, last week, Rutherford orchestrated a significant, multi-player deal that will bring the Penguins' 2014 first-round pick Kasperi Kapanen back to Pittsburgh in exchange for a first-round pick in 2020 and forward prospect Filip Hallander.</p>
<p>With Kapanen in the fold, the Penguins believe they have solidified their top-six with an infusion of speed and youth. So now what?</p>
<p>In a wide-ranging interview with the Post-Gazette, Rutherford detailed some of the other areas still yet to be addressed during what could be a pivotal — and busy — offseason.</p>
<p><strong>A goalie has got to go — and youth is the selling point</strong></p>
<p>Rutherford plans to move Matt Murray or Tristan Jarry this offseason, in part due to the flat $81.5 million salary cap.</p>
<p>Both goalies are set to be restricted free agents, so technically it’s possible either one goes. However, because budget restrictions are the motivating factor and Murray will command a higher salary, he’s the more likely candidate to find a new home.</p>
<p>“We’re really in a similar situation as we were when we had to move [Marc-Andre] Fleury for cap reasons,” Rutherford said. “We look at different ways of doing it. We talk to different teams that are interested in goalies. We just have to see how it plays out.”</p>
<p>The goalie market this offseason features a wide range of netminders, from veteran Stanley Cup winners like Washington’s Braden Holtby and Chicago’s Corey Crawford, to trusted backups who might turn into more like Calgary’s Cam Talbot and Dallas’ Anton Khudobin, to true No. 1s like Vegas’ Robin Lehner.</p>
<p>While there are plenty of options, Rutherford believes he has something others can’t offer: youth.</p>
<p>Lehner, 28, is the only unrestricted free agent goalie in his 20s who posted a save percentage of .900 or higher.</p>
<p>“The thing with our goalies is they’re in their mid-20s,” Rutherford said. “When you look at the free agent goalies, they’re pretty much 30 and up. When you have a young team and you’re building it toward a contending team or you have a contending team, having that goalie in the mid-20s to grow with is appealing.”</p>
<p>When goaltender-needy teams begin filling their seats via free agency, the market will naturally begin to wane. However, Rutherford said he won’t let the unique nature of this position force his hand before he’s found the right deal.</p>
<p>“When you’re talking about making trades, you can’t have urgency,” Rutherford said. “It has to be a trade that works for both teams. You don’t know when that time comes.”</p>
<p><strong>Changes in style and/or personnel on the third line?</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to stylistic and personnel changes, the third line is one of the first and best places to start.</p>
<p>“What do we want from our third line?” Rutherford said. “Do we want more of a defensive line than an offensive line?”</p>
<p>As it stands now, a possible third line might include two of the heftier contracts in Patric Hornqvist ($5.3 million AAV) and Nick Bjugstad ($4.1 million) and one of the more puzzling players in Jared McCann, who tallied 14 goals in the first 44 games and then none in the final 22.</p>
<p>Salary cap limitations and changes to the style of play will dictate how dramatically the Penguins shake up this possible trio.</p>
<p>“We can use the guys that we’ve got and ask them to play a little different way,” Rutherford said. “Or we can change those guys.”</p>
<p>The center position, in particular, will be one to watch. McCann and Bjugstad both got chances at the position at different points this season. But because of McCann’s slump and Bjugstad’s two surgeries, it remains a question.</p>
<p>“Jared McCann should score 20, 25 goals,” Rutherford said. “Nick will come off his surgery. He’s doing very well. He’s 100%. He’ll probably be better than ever.</p>
<p>“We’ve also got [Sam] Lafferty that can go there. He’s still developing into an NHL player. And we have the possibility of moving [Teddy] Blueger up to the third-line center, too. That would be another option if we wanted it to be more of a shut-down line.”</p>
<p><strong>Goodbye Justin Schultz</strong></p>
<p>Odds have been stacked against the Penguins re-signing unrestricted free agent defenseman Justin Schultz. On Monday, Rutherford confirmed officially that the Penguins plan to go another direction.</p>
<p>“We’ll move on from Justin,” Rutherford said. “He’s going to do better in the marketplace than what he can do here, based on our cap situation.”</p>
<p>Though Schultz made significant contributions to a pair of Stanley Cup runs, he was never the same after a gruesome leg injury in Oct. 2018. This postseason he was relegated to a third pairing that hemorrhaged scoring chances.</p>
<p>Currently, Chad Ruhwedel — who signed a contract extension last week — and Juuso Riikola would be the next options on the depth chart. The Penguins might also give a good look to some young players, like recently signed college free agent Josh Maniscalco, in training camp.</p>
<p>“As always, we’ll keep our eye out to see if there’s anybody out there that can fit into our cap and help us,” Rutherford said.</p>
<p><strong>Assistant coaches coming soon</strong></p>
<p>Rutherford said the Penguins are already in the process of interviewing candidates to replace the three assistant coaches who were dismissed following the loss to Montreal. He expects hires to come “fairly soon.”</p>
<p>“It will be a little bit different for each guy,” Rutherford said. “We’ll look at somebody that has power play experience. We’ll look at somebody that has penalty-killing experience. I’d like to hire somebody that can work with our defense. We’d like to hire somebody that is a good communicator with the players.”</p>
<p>The Penguins also have a couple vacancies in the front office. The club didn’t replace former assistant general managers, Bill Guerin or Jason Botterill, instead choosing to give others within the hockey operations department more responsibilities.</p>
<p>“There’s a possibility that I’ll look to add another person in hockey operations,” Rutherford said.</p>
<p><strong>Young and hungry</strong></p>
<p>On numerous occasions, Rutherford has underscored the value of young and hungry players. On Monday, he mentioned several in particular to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>He said the Penguins are “really high” on Dartmouth free agent Drew O’Connor. A 21-year-old forward, O’Connor brings good speed and 6-foot-3 size. He was named the Ivy League Player of the Year and a finalist for the Hobey Baker Award.</p>
<p>“He’s going to be given a very good chance at training camp,” Rutherford said.</p>
<p>Another forward to keep an eye on is Samuel Poulin, the Penguins’ 2019 first-round pick. After a productive junior season, the Penguins believe he’s close to NHL-ready.</p>
<p>On the back end, the Penguins inked a pair of college free agents in Cam Lee and Josh Maniscalco —&nbsp;left-shot and right-shot defensemen, respectively. They might also have a chance to crack the roster in camp.</p>
