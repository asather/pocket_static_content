<h1>UPMC close to immunity test that could help end lockdown</h1>

<p>UPMC researchers are close to completing a blood test to determine immunity against the virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>Such a test could certify little or no risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and identify the so-called&nbsp;“super” people who could serve in the health-care battle against COIVD-19 with little risk to themselves.</p>

<p>“We are developing an antibody test based on a European test to see if people were exposed and might be immune,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Dr. Alan Wells, executive vice-chairman of the Section of Laboratory Medicine in the UPMC Department of Pathology. He led the research effort that also involved Drs. Michael Shurin and Sarah Wheeler.</p>
<p>Medical tests already can determine the presence of the three key antibodies that the immune system generates in response to the virus. But their presence alone&nbsp;doesn’t mean the person cannot become ill with COVID-19 and transmit it to others.</p>
<p>“Those [European] tests show that the person was exposed but don’t say in and of themselves if the person is immune,” Dr. Wells said. “There is no clear test for immunity at this point.”</p>
<p>Tests to determine exposure and infection presented their own challenges and aren’t yet 100% determinant, given that a more advanced infection that might be detected only in the lungs rather than nose or throat.</p>
<p>“We need detection to see who’s immune right now but there are more uncertainties in testing for immunity than there are for testing for the virus,” he said.</p>
<p>The idea of an immunity test got its foothold in European and more specifically Germany, with&nbsp;researchers at the Helmholtz Centre for Infection Research in Braunschweig busy developing an immunity test. With that test, those shown to have immunity will be issued “immunity certificates,” allowing for “proper transition into post lock-down life.”</p>
<p>“The antibodies will indicate that the test participants have had the virus, have healed and are thereby ready to re-enter society and the workforce,” states a Helmholtz news release.</p>
<p>Next comes the Centre’s study during which it will test 100,000 people at a time and issue “documentation to those who have overcome the virus.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The study will provide a more accurate picture of immunity and pandemic development,” the Centre said, noting that the test could help end the lock down, reopen schools and allow mass gatherings.</p>
<p>“These [antibodies] are retained over a long period of time and are an indication for a past infection,” its news release explained. “It is assumed that patients who have recovered from the COVID-19 disease cannot be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2.”</p>
<p>As every photograph of SARS-CoV-2 reveals, the reddish spikes — known as receptors — protrude from&nbsp;virus membrane, or capsid, which houses the RNA. Once those receptors attach to a cell, the RNA is projected inside, where it replicates the virus and causes infection.</p>
<p>Three antibodies are involved in the immune response.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The IgM antibody is generated in seven to 10 days after the virus first appears, but it only does surveillance, figuring out characteristics of the invader. Over the course of nine or 10 days the IgM antibody transforms into a second type of antibody —&nbsp; IgG —&nbsp;that mounts an attack against the virus.</p>
<p>In that attack, the antibody has developed an end piece that attaches to the viral receptor and essentially caps it, preventing it from docking with and infecting the cell with its RNA.</p>
<p>In time, the third type of antibody — the&nbsp;IgA — shows up and secretes mucus into the lungs and nose and can fight the virus before it gets a foothold in your body, Dr. Wells said.</p>
<p>What’s necessary, he said, is a test that specifically detects the two protective antibodies — IgG and IgA — rather than the first antibody, IgM, that reacts to the virus but doesn’t attack it, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further testing to be done —&nbsp;at the University of Pittsburgh Center for Vaccine Research under Paul Duprex and the UPMC Infectious Disease Division under John Mellors —&nbsp;will determine if these IgG and IgA antibodies are the immune type that neutralizes the virus to provide protection, Dr. Wells said.</p>
<p>“The tests&nbsp;out there now only detect when the person is exposed and not yet immune,” he said. “We are developing an IgG and IgA antibody test developed from a European test, and validated here to determine protection,&nbsp;to see if people exposed to the virus might be immune to it.”</p>

<p>The Allegheny Health Network isn’t developing an immunity test but has acquired rapid immune tests that work in similar ways to a pregnancy test. In this case a drop of blood applied to the test strip indicates whether or not SARS-CoV-2 antibodies are present.</p>
<p>But that testing has limitations, given the 10% crossover with similar antibodies from other coronavirus infections. Prior to COVID-19, coronaviruses generally resulted in cold symptoms.</p>
<p>Kelly A. Stefano, AHN director of microbiology, said having a test to measure the antibody response for COVID-19 is important in understanding its prevalence in the community. It’s also important in developing the same type of treatment used against Ebola — a treatment known as convalescent plasma transfer.</p>
<p>Without an Ebola vaccine, the only proven treatment was transfusing a survivor’s blood, rich with Ebola antibodies, into a patient to spark a more immediate immune response. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the case of COVID-19, purified blood bearing the IgG attack antibody from recovered patients could be used as an immuno-therapeutic treatment for people with severe infections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One key question is whether people can be reinfected and how long their immunity will last. This is especially important given the sizable number of people who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 but had little to no symptoms.</p>
<p>“Screening for immunity to the SARS-CoV-2 virus will help us to identify how long the immunity lasts after infection, and understand who may have a natural immunity to this infection,” said Ms. Stefano, who holds a Ph.D. in immunology and virology.&nbsp;“Understanding the immune response to this virus will help us to develop protective therapeutics and vaccines, and provide increased knowledge about the spread of disease.”&nbsp;</p>
