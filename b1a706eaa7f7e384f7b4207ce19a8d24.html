<h1>Cirque du Soleil's Ovo may bug you</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Crickets jump. Bugs crawl. Spiders spin.</p>
<p>Be prepared to see all that with the Cirque du Soleil performing "Ovo" because its creator Deborah Colker was inspired by movement in the micro world of insects. Ok, spiders are not insects but you see where we are going here.</p>
<p>Our photographer Andrew Rush photographed the Cirque's crew doing work outs back stage Thursday and came back with some creepy and inspiring views that you won't see if you attend the one of the ten actual performances.</p>
<p>It may be all you can do to sit still as they perform Friday through Sunday at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
