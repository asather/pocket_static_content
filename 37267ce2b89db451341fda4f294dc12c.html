<h1>Protesters, police clash in East Liberty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Protesters and Pittsburgh police clashed Monday evening in East Liberty, with objects being thrown from one side and smoke being fired from the other.</p>
<p>The two sides came together at Centre Avenue, and police told the protesters — which was part of a larger group that had peacefully demonstrated earlier in the day — that the event had been declared an unlawful assembly.</p>
<p>After repeated warnings to disperse, police fired smoke canisters toward the crowd.&nbsp;Some of the protesters hurled objects and some threw the canisters back at the police line.</p>
<p>Earlier, around 2:30 p.m., thousands of protesters gathered at the intersection of Penn and Centre avenues near the Target store.</p>
<p>The store had closed before protests started. Down the street, the Whole Foods was boarded up.</p>
<p>Lorenzo Rulli, a local activist, was among the first to arrive.&nbsp;"I came out to support a peaceful protest," he said. "I was Downtown Saturday when the police opened fire on peaceful protestors — when we had our fists in the air — instead of addressing those who were breaking into businesses which were white anarchists.</p>
<p>"That the people here understand the intention is to make sure our narrative isn't changed. We control our narrative. The Black Lives Matter movement is not for others to control.</p>
<p>"I would like everyone to know, that if there is no justice for black men and women killed in the United States, there will be no peace," he said.</p>
<p>Kallistos Myrddin, another protestor, was in front of Target wearing a backpack. It had a sign that said "Medic" and was filled with bandages, water, a kit to clean wounds and stitches.</p>
<p>"I went to the protest a few days ago, and I saw bad things that happened to some people, and I wanted to be here because I have some medical training,” said Myrddin. “In case anything happened, I wanted to help out, support the cause.”</p>
<p>Around 4 p.m., the group made its way north on Penn Avenue and turned onto Euclid Avenue. They marched around in a loop, eventually making their way back to Target. During the march, the group remained peaceful, with some taking turns on a microphone to talk about police brutality’s effect on them and their family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the march ended around 7 p.m., organizers asked the group to go home.</p>
<p>“What happened today was different because it was more organized and we stood our ground together,” a speaker during the march, D’Nico Perry-Ellis said after it was over. “And the police didn’t try to stop us.”</p>
<p>The scene quickly changed. Several hundred protesters remained and flooded the intersection and sidewalks.&nbsp;Some walked towards a Dollar Bank on Penn and threw rocks at the windows. Organizers of the march immediately ran towards the group and told them to stop.</p>
<p>A man wearing a black hoodie, army green pants and yellow Timberland boots threw another rock at the bank. Protesters told him to go home, but the act caught the attention of five Pittsburgh police officers who rushed to the scene.</p>
<p>As the group continued to march, their path was blocked by a line of SWAT officers at Centre and S. Negley avenues.</p>
<p>After a brief standoff, the officers informed the group about the unlawful assembly and ordered it several times to disperse. Smoke canisters and rubber bullets were shot into the crowd.</p>
<p>A protestor near the front line, who wished to remain anonymous, said that the crowd took no violent actions against police or property before riot control stepped in. She also said that a man in front of her holding up a sign was shot twice in the chest with rubber bullets and crumpled to the ground.</p>
<p>Most of the crowd began to scatter shortly after, but police closed in from side streets and from behind on Centre Ave., effectively boxing in the protestors that refused to leave. Several were arrested, according to other protestors leaving the scene.</p>
<p>As the last 10 or so protesters stood on a sidewalk near Target, the riot police pulled up in a Pittsburgh police SWAT vehicle, jumped out, and immediately shot rubber bullets and deployed smoke canisters at people standing about 10 feet away.</p>
<p>One man, Tyler W., 25, of Mount Oliver, said he was shot with two rubber bullets — once in the stomach and once in the buttocks. He displayed a tennis ball-sized, bright red welt on his stomach where the projectile struck him.</p>
<p>"I was standing there peacefully protesting," he said. "They hopped out of [the vehicle] and they shot me."</p>
