<h1>Joe Starkey: Moral victories won’t save Pitt or Duquesne — but they do provide hope</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though mostly silent for decades, Duquesne basketball can still create a joyful sound.</p>
<p>That was my primary takeaway from PPG Paints Arena on Wednesday, after watching the Dukes trade haymakers with the No. 7 team in the country. I heard it. I felt it. Precisely 7,001 fans — plenty for both sides — energized the place during a frantic finish.</p>
<p>Dayton <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/duquesne/2020/01/29/duquesne-basketball-dayton-tavian-dunn-martin-michael-hughes/stories/202001290162" target="_blank">ultimately prevailed, 73-69</a>, leaving Duquesne coach Keith Dambrot in much the same predicament as Pitt coach Jeff Capel a night earlier.</p>
<p>Just like <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/28/pitt-duke-jeff-capel-coach-k-kobe-bryant-tribute/stories/202001280172" target="_blank">Pitt at Duke</a>, Dambrot’s crew clawed back from a huge deficit to make things interesting late. Real interesting, in Duquesne’s case. Once down 19, the Dukes pulled to within two with 33.8 seconds left.</p>
<p>But just like Pitt, Duquesne fell short, and in both cases it was largely because the other guys had a lottery pick.</p>
<p>One night it was Duke’s Vernon Carey Jr., the next it was Dayton’s Obi Toppin, a marvelously athletic, frighteningly efficient, 6-foot-9 sophomore who finished with game-highs of 22 points and 10 rebounds. You’ll probably see one of his baskets — a reach-back, one-handed rebound dunk — on SportsCenter’s Top 10.</p>
<p>And you might see Toppin taken in the top five of the NBA Draft.</p>
<p>Helps to have a lottery pick, right Keith?</p>
<p>“It helped me,” Dambrot said, referring to his days coaching LeBron James in high school.</p>
<p>The key question for Dambrot was basically the same one Capel faced Tuesday: What is the value of a moral victory, if you believe in such things?</p>
<p>Capel spoke of how close isn’t good enough and how his team must reach the point where compliments for narrow losses to good teams are regarded as insults in disguise. But he also seems to like the trajectory of his program.</p>
<p>How about Dambrot?</p>
<p>Did he leave this game encouraged?</p>
<p>“Well, I have to, in order to make sure my team continues to develop,” he said. “(But) to take the next step, we can’t lose to Dayton at home. I don’t care if they’re No. 7 in the country or not. I heard coach Capel’s interview (the night before). Nobody is more competitive than me, so I have to agree with him. Just because you play close doesn’t mean you’re ready to take the next step.</p>
<p>“We played close, but what does that mean? We’ll find out in the next game and the next game and the next game.”</p>
<p>I hear both men loud and clear. But takeaway No. 2 is that Duquesne, like Pitt, is in great hands and headed upward.</p>
<p>Sometimes moral victories provide hope.</p>
<p>Remember some of those close, competitive losses the early Ben Howland teams sustained? Those portended much better days. I sense the same here, on both fronts, and it helps to remember that such turnarounds rarely happen fast.</p>
<p>Both of these programs were buried.</p>
<p>Duquesne hasn’t made the NCAA Tournament since 1977. Dambrot is 50-34 so far. That’s pretty good. This team, though mired in a three-game losing streak, should win at least 20 games.</p>
<p>Pitt was living the Kevin Stallings nightmare just two years ago. In fact, two years ago Sunday it dropped a 96-65 squeaker to North Carolina to fall to 0-11 in the conference.</p>
<p>Give this time.</p>
<p>Talent is the top ingredient, but toughness and tenacity often come first. Duquesne showed both Wednesday. Marcus Weathers was particularly effective, posting 17 points and eight rebounds.</p>
<p>“It’s a super-good learning experience,” he said. “But a loss is a loss.”</p>
<p>Dambrot complimented Duquesne students for their support this season (in which the Dukes no not have a home). He hopes others will follow. Somebody asked about long-suffering Dukes fans who have yet to return.</p>
<p>“Can you blame ’em?” Dambrot said.</p>
<p>He then spoke of his father, Sid, playing on those great Duquesne teams in the early 1950s in front of large, enthusiastic crowds.</p>
<p>“Maybe both teams (Pitt and Duquesne) become so good that, you know, Pittsburgh goes crazy with basketball again,” Dambrot said. “Might as well, right? Can’t be all hockey and football.”</p>
<p>Oh, it could. It mostly is. But while nights like these past two guarantee nothing, and leave a sour taste, they also provide something something Pitt and Duquesne desperately need. Something they lacked not long ago.</p>
<p>Hope.</p>
