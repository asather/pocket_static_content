<h1>City controller willing to audit PPS device inventory</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City Controller Michael Lamb on Thursday said he would be willing to audit the Pittsburgh Public Schools’ supply of devices for students and teachers after a district board member requested the inspection.</p>
<p>School board member Sala Udin asked for the audit because he said he has been unable to get a comprehensive response when he asked the district numerous questions including the number of devices that have been distributed to students and teachers since the COVID-19 pandemic forced schools to close.</p>
<p>Superintendent Anthony Hamlet has said that every student and teacher should be equipped with a district-owned device by the start of the 2020-21 school year, but it still remains a work in progress. The district has purchased thousands of Chromebook laptops and iPads and has received hundreds more through donations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ability for all students and teachers to have a device with access to the district’s learning management system, a working camera and an internet connection could become even more important Friday as the school board will vote on a measure that could make the first nine weeks of school totally online.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The question is, if you do that, do you have the equipment you need to do distance learning?” Mr. Lamb said in a phone interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Udin made the request of Mr. Lamb after he read an article in the education newsletter Education Week that&nbsp;focused on the thousands of laptops&nbsp;that recently went missing in a South Carolina school district.</p>
<p>“Although I don’t believe the situation pertains to the Pittsburgh, the article did remind me&nbsp;of my frustration in trying to get a comprehensive response from the Pittsburgh Public Schools administration when as I have asked, on several occasions, for a complete&nbsp;report on the number of laptops we started with; the number and location currently on&nbsp;hand; the number that have been distributed to students and to teachers,” Mr. Udin wrote in a June 25 letter to Mr. Lamb.</p>
<p>A district spokeswoman did not provide answers to several questions the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette asked about the district’s device inventory Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said his office was willing and able to do an audit, but he said he needed cooperation from the district in order to do so.</p>
<p>“I don’t have the same kind of authority I do with the city,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said he has a meeting scheduled on Friday with school board President Sylvia Wilson to discuss the matter. He has not yet contacted district administration.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Lamb said Mr. Udin had valid questions, he suggested that perhaps an inventory review would be more appropriate than an&nbsp;“all-out” audit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are good questions,” Mr. Lamb said,&nbsp;“and they are worth asking.”</p>
