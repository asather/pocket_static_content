<h1>Inside Bob Nutting's&nbsp;unique approach,&nbsp;pledge&nbsp;for Pirates fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rocco Santucci entered the home clubhouse at PNC Park on Friday and saw plenty of what he expected to see. There was a bobblehead giveaway and drawstring bags distributed featuring plenty of Pirates swag. Jameson Taillon and Bryan Reynolds stood in the center of the room signing autographs.</p>
<p>But one thing Santucci, a 70-year-old Ross Township native, did not expect to see was Bob Nutting, in the middle of the crowd, taking questions from and chatting with any fan who approached him.</p>
<p>It’s something the Pirates owner did for nearly four hours Friday and will repeat Saturday for even longer during the primary part of PiratesFest.</p>
<p>“You expect them to throw some players out here, have them sign autographs and schmooze the people,” Santucci said. “But I was surprised to see [Nutting] just standing there, willing to take it. That takes a certain level of courage."</p>
<p>While Nutting would probably be the first to tell you that the word courage better describes troops and first responders, what he did here was definitely unique and seemingly appreciated. It was also intentional.</p>
<p>Most teams in these settings will have a question-and-answer session with the owner(s) or other members of the front office. Nutting, believing the Pirates have been terrible at communicating with their fans, chose a different direction.</p>
<p>Taking a break from his mingling with fans, Nutting spoke with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about his rationale for doing things a little bit differently this year.</p>
<p>“I think there are a number of reasons, but the most important is that I really think we need a closer, more direct connection to the fans,” Nutting said. “We need to be able to talk to them one-on-one.</p>
<p>"I think the more they interact with all of us, whether it’s the players, our leadership team or with me, I think that’s our best chance to project how much we care and how much we're focused on building a championship team in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure sitting up on a stage and answering a few questions has the same impact.”</p>
<p>Santucci didn’t have any hard-hitting questions for Nutting, but he did praise the Pirates owner for the changes he made, a familiar refrain from many who took the opportunity to bend Nutting’s ear.</p>
<p>Cindy Southern, a 53-year-old Bridgeville resident who has been coming to Pirates games for nearly five decades, wanted to know if there were any deals in the works and about Will Craig’s path to the major leagues.</p>
<p>A season-ticket holder for the past dozen years, Southern said she appreciated Nutting making himself available to anyone and everyone.</p>
<p>“I like that he’s here,” she said. “It’s nice that he’s taking feedback from fans after the way last year went.”</p>
<p>Jim McVay, 50 from Upper St. Clair, took the opportunity to offer his two cents on the changes — he liked them — and came away surprised and impressed by how Nutting handled himself.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously discouraging what happened,” said McVay, who said his father has kept season tickets in the family since the Forbes Field days. “But I enjoyed the opportunity to talk to [Nutting].”</p>
<p>Nutting doesn’t appear to be discarding any of the feedback he has received this season, either.</p>
<p>During the interview with the P-G, Nutting blamed himself for being entirely too distant during times of trouble, saying he needs to do a better job and be more accountable.</p>
<p>The Pirates also need to value their fans more than they have recently, Nutting said.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really important to be available,” Nutting said. “We talked in the fall, and I think we’ve been a little bit too removed. I’ve been a little bit too removed. I think our fans have an incredibly important voice. We need to listen to it. We need to respect it. We need to make sure they know that their input is welcome and their passion is welcome.</p>
<p>One of Nutting’s favorite ways of interacting with fans and soliciting their feedback is at PiratesFest.</p>
<p>“We want to roll out the red carpet and have a party celebrating the best ballpark in America, celebrating the progress the team is making and more than anything just saying thank you to the fans who support us,” Nutting said.</p>
<p>Nutting would also generate some goodwill with fans by spending more money, which was another topic during the interview. Essentially Nutting knows the Pirates need to do that, but they first must determine what they have and where it makes the most sense to allocate those dollars.</p>
<p>Nicole Swartz, 43 of Carmichaels, wouldn’t mind that money going to a pitcher. She approached Nutting once the Pirates owner made his way up to the Pittsburgh Baseball Club, where he continued to take questions from fans.</p>
<p>“I actually first saw him first in the clubhouse,” Swartz said. “I was shocked, but I was glad to see it. He needs to be here.”</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>“He’s the commander in chief,” Swartz explained. “When things are wrong with the country, you look to the commander in chief to try and make changes. We pay money to come here. It just means a lot. It makes me feel like he’s being more proactive about us as fans.”</p>
<p>This is also a more comfortable setting for Nutting. After observing him for about an hour, it became easy to see that he comes off as more congenial than clunky.</p>
<p>Dressed in a navy blue sport coat and light-grey slacks, Nutting was the one seeking out most conversations, rather than standing there like a statue. He posed for selfies. He listened to feedback. Nobody was nasty, either, with most fans thanking Nutting holding the event.</p>
<p>“I think everyone connects better one-on-one,” Nutting would say later.</p>
<p>He’s right, of course. And baseball teams connect with fans infinitely easier when they win games or spend money, usually both. But after the offseason the Pirates had — one that’ll cost Nutting $17 million in dead money — it was refreshing to see all this talk about change and transparency appears to be more than lip service.</p>
<p>“I’m going to work very hard to be clear, direct and transparent,” Nutting said. “If we can get to that — I’m sure we’ll fall short in some areas — but if we can drive forward, I know [president] Travis [Williams] is absolutely committed. How do we do that in a really sincere way?</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to have secret agendas. We’ve been a little bit too removed. We haven’t connected, whether it’s with reporters or whether it’s with our fans, whether it’s talking down to them, whatever. We can do better. I’m certainly going to try.”</p>
