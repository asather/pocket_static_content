<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank is holding two drive-up food distributions:</p>
<p>• From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturday at 333 Lincoln Highway (intersection of N. Trenton and Penn Avenue), Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>• From noon to 2 p.m. Monday at Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, 1 N. Linden St., Duquesne.</p>
<p>• From 10 a.m. to noon Sept. 4 at PPG Paints Arena parking lots, 1001 Fifth Ave., Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>• From 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Sept. 8 at 2151 N. Main St., Washington, Pa.</p>
<p>• From 5 to 7 p.m. Sept. 14 at Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, 1 N. Linden St., Duquesne.</p>
<p>• From 5 to 7 p.m. Sept. 15 at Pittsburgh Mills Galleria, 590 Pittsburgh Mills Blvd., Tarentum.</p>
<p>Participants must register for these events in order to receive a food share.</p>
<p>To register, visit <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/get-help/drive-up/" target="_blank">https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/get-help/drive-up/</a>. Participants must provide their license plate number, name and email address.</p>
<p>As of mid-July, there is no required proof of eligibility and anyone is eligible for food, the food bank said. Your information will only be used to provide food and help the food bank improve your service. Participants should read the instructions each time they register for a new event, as rules may change week-to-week.</p>
<p>Each household must complete a separate reservation. The same car and license plate can be used up to three times for the same event.</p>
<p>To make the process run smoothly, the food bank requires people must stay in their vehicles and unlock their trunk or backseat door so volunteers can place the food into their car. No walk-ups will be permitted due to safety concerns.</p>
<p>Those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or visit the food bank’s website for help in locating a pantry near where you live, according to the nonprofit. The website includes a map of food pantries, meals for children and SNAP (food stamps) application assistance.
