<h1>Shapiro says Pa. will lead multi-state coalition in suing against Postal Service changes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong><em>This story will be updated.</em></strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said the state will be leading a multi-state coalition in filing a federal lawsuit to challenge “nationwide operation changes at the U.S. Postal Service.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro made the announcement Tuesday.</p>
<p>He said the lawsuit is being filed to “ensure safe, secure, vote-by-mail.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro, in his Twitter feed, added that&nbsp;“recent post office changes have been implemented recklessly, before checking the law, and we will use our authority to stop them and help ensure that every eligible ballot is counted.”</p>
<p>The crisis at the Postal Service has erupted as a major election year issue as Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, an ally of President Donald Trump who took control of the agency in June, has swiftly engineered cuts and operational changes that are disrupting mail delivery operations and raising alarms among workers.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has flatly denied he has asked for a slow-walk of the mail. But Mr. DeJoy, a Republican donor with no previous postal management, is facing pressure by Democrats to halt any changes as millions of Americans prepare to vote by mail during the COVID-19 crisis. Demonstrations are being held Tuesday in several cities.&nbsp;Key Republicans also are sounding the alarm.</p>
<p>At the White House, Mr. Trump leveled fresh assaults Tuesday on mail-in voting and universal ballots. More Americans than ever are expected to choose to vote absentee this year instead of risking health concerns by voting at polling places during the coronavirus outbreak.</p>
<p>“You can’t have millions and millions of ballots sent all over the place, sent to people that are dead, sent to dogs, cats, sent everywhere,” Mr. Trump told reporters.</p>
<p>“This isn’t games and you have to get it right,” he said.</p>
<p>According to The Washington Post, at least 20 states plan to file lawsuits against the U.S. Postal Service and Mr. DeJoy.</p>
<p>The suits will argue that the Postal Service broke the law by making operational changes without first seeking approval from the Postal Regulatory Commission. They will also argue that the changes will impede states’ ability to run “free and fair elections,” officials from several state attorney general offices told The Washington Post.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to stop Trump’s attacks on the Postal Service, which we believe to be an attack on the integrity of election. It’s a straight up attack on democracy,” Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh, a Democrat, said. “This conduct is illegal, it’s unconstitutional, it’s harmful to the country, it’s harmful to individuals.”</p>
<p>“We’re asking a court to make him stop,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump made clear last week that he was blocking $25 billion emergency aid to the Postal Service, acknowledging he wanted to curtail election mail operations, as well as a Democratic proposal to provide $3.6 billion in additional election money to the states to help process an expected surge of mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>Maryland is signing onto a suit led by Washington state, which is expected to be filed at 2 p.m. Tuesday, and also includes Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Virginia and Wisconsin, according to a draft of the suit obtained by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Separately, Pennsylvania is filing another suit, joined by California, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts and North Carolina, among others.</p>
<p>All the states are represented by Democratic attorneys general.</p>
<p>Congress is not in session but Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called the House back to Washington over the crisis at the Postal Service, setting up a political showdown amid growing concerns that the Mr. Trump White House is trying to undermine the agency ahead of the election.</p>
<p>The House is expected to vote Saturday on legislation that would prohibit changes at the agency. The package will also include $25 billion to shore up the Postal Service, which faces continued financial losses.</p>
