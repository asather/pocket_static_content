<h1>Joe Starkey: The Pirates, an incredible sign-stealing story and those cheating Astros</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ElRoy Face wanted a cigarette, which wasn’t unusual.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia Phillies were in town. The game was underway. Face, a Pirates relief pitcher and two-pack-a-day smoker, was in the Forbes Field bullpen, where it would have been frowned upon to light up.</p>
<p>So he plucked a Camel (his endorsement deal included a year’s worth of cigarettes) and went to his usual spot — the scoreboard, situated down the left-field line. There was room enough inside for workers to manually arrange the digits. And for Face to smoke his Camels.</p>
<p>One problem: Phillies manager Gene Mauch spotted Face and suspected the worst. This was the early 1960s, but baseball already had a long history of elaborate sign-stealing schemes originating with spies beyond the fences.</p>
<p>Devils in the outfield, one might say.</p>
<p>“I got kicked out of the scoreboard,” recalls Face, who turned 92 last Thursday. “It was stupid, because his team was hitting. How would I be stealing signs with his team hitting?”</p>
<p>I love that story, but it’s not the one I’m here to tell. To retell, actually, though I wasn’t aware of its existence until five days ago. The occasion seems ripe for a retelling, given the furor over the Houston Astros literally stealing the 2017 World Series.</p>
<p>This past weekend, I had occasion to chat with former Beaver County Times newsman Jim Tripodi, who spoke of an article he wrote some 30 years ago, revisiting Harvey Haddix’s legendary 12-inning perfect game (and eventual loss) on May 26, 1959, at Milwaukee’s County Municipal Stadium.</p>
<p>Bill Mazeroski has called it the greatest game ever pitched.&nbsp;Turned out it was even greater than we knew. The Milwaukee Braves stole the Pirates’ signs that night — and with way more than just a glance from a base runner.</p>
<p>“Nobody knew it during the game,” then-Pirates pitcher Vern Law tells me. “That all came out later.”</p>
<p>Law laughed and added, “Just goes to show you can know what’s coming, and it won’t make any difference.”</p>
<p>Tripodi remembers then-Braves pitcher Bob Buhl detailing the scheme to him. Sports Illustrated’s Albert Chen <a href="https://www.si.com/vault/2009/06/01/105819842/the-greatest-game-ever-pitched" target="_blank">described it this way</a> in a 2009 piece:</p>
<p>“In 1989, when players from both teams were present at a banquet in Pittsburgh commemorating the game's 30th anniversary, Buhl pulled Haddix aside. ‘You know we were stealing signs during the game?’ he asked. Buhl told him pitchers in the Braves' bullpen peered through binoculars to pick up the signs [catcher Smoky] Burgess flashed to Haddix. One reliever then signaled the batter: towel on the shoulder meant fastball, no towel meant breaking ball. All but one Milwaukee hitter, [Hank] Aaron, took the signals.”</p>
<p>And yet, the way then-Pirates shortstop Dick Groat remembers it, Haddix allowed only three decently hit balls through his 12 perfect innings. Could a near-immaculate performance actually grow in stature on account of the cheating revelation? It would seem so.</p>
<p>“I agree with you: It makes it even better,” says Groat, who did not play that night on account of a hitting slump.</p>
<p>If the Pirates had known of the scheme at any point that season, it’s likely they would have retaliated.</p>
<p>“If you think somebody’s stealing ‘em,” Groat said, “you’re going to be knockin’ guys on their ass.”</p>
<p>Still unanswered: Did Braves slugger Joe Adcock know the slider was coming, the one he smacked over the fence in right-center to win the game in the 13th inning?</p>
<p>The Braves’ scheme recalled the iconic and crooked 1951 New York Giants, who erased a 13-1/2 game mid-August deficit and won the National League pennant on the Bobby Thomson’s “Shot Heard ‘Round the World.”</p>
<p>The Giants cheated the whole time. They had a coach, Herman Franks, hidden in the center-field clubhouse with a military field scope. His intel triggered a bell system that identified pitches for the hitter.</p>
<p>Is that really so different from the Astros’ algorithms and trash cans?</p>
<p>“Just as bad,” Law says.</p>
<p>I couldn’t leave my conversations with the old Pirates — Face says only 10 remain from the 1960 World Series team, which will be feted in June at PNC Park — without asking what they think should happen to the Astros. People want the players punished.</p>
<p>Groat, 89, figures it would be near-impossible to decipher which Astros were guilty.</p>
<p>“Do you punish the whole team?” he said.</p>
<p>Face figures a punishment of some kind is in order. But taking away their title?</p>
<p>“I don’t know about that,” he said. “But look at what they’ve done to Pete Rose. If it’s that serious, they should do something about it.”</p>
<p>Law, who turns 90 on March 12, would “at least put an asterisk” next to the Astros’ title. But he believes the biggest punishment will be exacted within.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, people can’t just play the dang game the way it’s supposed to be played — ball, bat, glove and just go out there and have fun,” he said. “I know if it was me, I wouldn’t be too proud of myself. I’d look at that ring ... and I don’t know if I’d want it or not.”</p>
