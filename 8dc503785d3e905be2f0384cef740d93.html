<h1>Mt. Lebanon chooses not to play PIAA playoff game due to COVID-19 fears</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All across the world, the COVID-19 outbreak has affected several major sporting events by forcing games to be played without spectators or even canceled altogether.</p>
<p>Now, concerns over the virus are throwing a wrench into the PIAA basketball playoffs — and Mt. Lebanon is the first local team to feel the effects.</p>
<p>The Blue Devils announced Wednesday morning in a letter sent home to parents that the team would not be playing in its scheduled second-round playoff game against Cheltenham High School, located in Montgomery County near Philadelphia, after Cheltenham announced Monday that it would be closing school for the rest of the week. The game was originally scheduled to be played at 7 p.m. Wednesday night at Chambersburg Area High School.</p>
<p>Cheltenham officials said a school district parent was a caregiver to a patient who tested presumptive positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Everybody understands this is something that we’re all learning about, we’re all dealing with. There isn’t a playbook for this one,” Mt. Lebanon athletic director John Grogan said. “So, we need to count on the people that have the expertise in this area, and when the county health department tells you you shouldn’t go, you don’t get on the bus.</p>
<p>“At the end of the day, the health and safety of our kids is the most important thing.”</p>
<p>It is unclear at this time whether or not the Blue Devils will have to forfeit and be disqualified from the state tournament.</p>
<p>“That’s in the hands of the PIAA at this point,” Grogan said. “It’s a tough situation for all involved, for sure.”</p>
<p>As of Tuesday night, Mt. Lebanon coach Joe David was still hopeful that the game would be played, potentially with only family members of players and coaches being permitted to attend. By Wednesday morning, though, those hopes were extinguished. David had one word to describe his immediate reaction when he heard the news.</p>
<p>“Devastation,” David said. “Devastated as far as not playing the game, because we’re not sure what the PIAA says about everything. We’re waiting on that, but if they’re telling us the game’s over and we can’t play or whatever that may be and the season is over, then that’s devastating.</p>
<p>“But we’re hoping that cooler heads prevail and maybe there can be some other way to fix the situation.”</p>
<p>This news comes after three Pennsylvania schools — Oxford, Coatesville and Norristown — all informed the PIAA that they would not play host to second-round playoff games as a precautionary measure.</p>
<p>“I did not sleep a wink last night,” David said. “But I know that our administration is fighting the cause and looking at it and trying to figure it all out. We’ll leave it in their hand and hopefully we’ll be able to play basketball.”</p>
