<h1>With minor league changes looming, Pirates lament lost jobs and experiences</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mike Rabelo has seen it all in the minor leagues.</p>
<p>Before the Pirates hired him as their assistant hitting coach this offseason, Rabelo spent nearly a decade coaching in the minors, working his way up from the Gulf Coast League Tigers in 2011 to manager of the Class AA Erie SeaWolves in 2019, compiling a 358-274 record over six seasons as a manager in Detroit’s system.</p>
<p>It’s an experience that Rabelo wouldn’t trade for the world.</p>
<p>“The experience of playing and surviving minor league baseball sets you up for the rest of your life,” Rabelo said. “What I mean by that is … when they go out and have to get into the workforce, people are looking for competitors. I call it ‘The Hunger Games.’ It molds people for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>“If you want to get to the big leagues, you’re not standing there holding a jersey with the commissioner and the next day you’re going to be playing against the White Sox. You have to pay your dues. The minor leagues, it makes you a man. It really does.”</p>
<p>It’s an experience that won’t exist this season for hundreds of minor leaguers who were cut this week as a result from the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. At this point, the Pirates have made no such cuts, though it’s likely they will come at some point.</p>
<p>While much has been made in the baseball world of financial hardships incurred by these players — who made $400 per week through May from Major League Baseball to cover loss wages during what will almost assuredly become a canceled season — there’s also a piece to this puzzle that’s not as easily quantified by dollars and cents.</p>
<p>For Rabelo, it has less to do with learning the ins and outs of the game — though that’s certainly important — and more to do with developing as a person and figuring out how to function independently and with limited means.</p>
<p>“You learn a lot,” Rabelo said. “I thought I was going to be learning a lot about the game, managing the game. You learn a lot about yourself and managing people. I firmly believe the minor leagues have taught me how to manage people. I treat it like a feather in the cap, man. I’m proud of it. It was fun.”</p>
<p>Joel Hanrahan can relate. The former Pirates closer was supposed to start this season as the pitching coach with Class AAA Indianapolis after working his way up from rookie ball with the Bristol Pirates and spending last season as <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/07/12/Joel-Hanrahan-Pirates-Altoona-Curve-pitching-coach-Tommy-John-surgery/stories/201907120064" target="_blank">Class AA Altoona’s pitching coach</a>.</p>
<p>As a player, Hanrahan said the minor leagues provided some of his best memories, times when the game wasn’t so much about contracts or families and it was more about hanging out with friends.</p>
<p>“You learn how to grow up real quick,” Hanrahan said. “You learn how to make due with a little bit of money and limited resources when it comes to living. You learn how to live cheaply.</p>
<p>“It’s probably some of the most fun you’ll ever have. The people that you meet throughout the minor leagues are people you’re going to be around for a long time because the experience is so unique.”</p>
<p>Some of that involved sharing an apartment with teammates. Other parts of it were road trips spent in random cities. On off days, Hanrahan remembers renting boats and spending days at the lake or on the golf course — almost like what college would’ve been for some of these guys.</p>
<p>“I spent my first year in Montana,” Hanrahan said. “I was 18 years old. I wish when I was 18 that I would have done some things there because now that I’m 38, I’m like, ‘That was pretty cool.’ I’d like to go back to Montana and do it all over again.”</p>
<p>Minor league baseball is expected to shrink heading into the 2021 season, with around 40 teams ceasing to exist. Those teams will likely morph into independent clubs, Hanrahan predicted, but there’s undoubtedly a part of the culture of those small towns that will be affected.</p>
<p>“You hate to see it because being in Bristol, the people running that team are unbelievable people,” Hanrahan said. “The things that they go through to try and make that place successful, it has to be exhausting for them. For them to lose baseball because they’re so passionate about it, you hope they find some way to get a team there of some sort.</p>
<p>“It’s a tough one. Those small towns, there’s not a whole lot else going on. They live to go to the baseball games. It’s not a huge group, but they still live for it.”</p>
<p>For those playing the games, it will take away an opportunity to learn, a chance to do something fun and a way to make lasting memories.</p>
<p>Shortstop Cole Tucker is one of the Pirates most recently removed from the minor leagues. The 23-year-old first-round pick spent his 2019 season in between the majors and Class AAA Indianapolis. The five previous seasons, Tucker was working his way up the organizational ladder.</p>
<p>Now, he’s safe from any minor league cuts as he sits on the precipice of making real headway on an MLB roster. Still, the relationships he’s built over the past few years, combined with his own experience, give him sympathy for the players still in the minor leagues who face being cut or having their season taken away.</p>
<p>“I really feel for the guys who play in the lower levels, because there’s so much uncertainty surrounding the minor league season this year, and obviously the big league season,” Tucker said in April. “But the priority is going to be the major league season, and they’re going to get that squared away before they do anything else, I believe. ... If you didn’t sign for a lot out of the draft, you’re really kind of in a tight spot, because most of those guys didn’t finish college, and most of those guys don’t have stable incomes and jobs aside from baseball. And not that minor league baseball is a stable income, but it’s something. And it’s your dream, you’re working for something bigger. And it sucks.”</p>
