<p>It turns out that even 33 isn’t bigger than 19.</p>
<p>The Big 33 Classic, one of the most prestigious high school football all-star games in the country which has been played every year since 1957, will be sidelined this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a press release Tuesday. The game between star seniors from Pennsylvania and Maryland had been scheduled for May 25.</p>
<p>“It is with deep regret that the Pennsylvania Scholastic Football Coaches Association (PSFCA) must cancel all of our major events surrounding Memorial Day Weekend 2020, just weeks away. These public events include the Big 33 Football Classic, East West Game, a first-ever PSFCA High School Combine, USA Football 1st Down Clinic, Military Murph Competition, and the Big 33 Fan Experience,” said the release from the PSFCA.</p>
<p>The statement went on to say that organizers “are exploring ways in which we can still honor all of these highly talented 2020 athletes — players, cheerleaders, and buddies.”</p>
<p>Ten WPIAL players had been selected to play in the game, in addition to an assistant coach.</p>
<p>The news came a week after the PIAA announced that all spring sports, along with the basketball and swimming championships, would be canceled.</p>
<p>In other coronavirus-related news, state American Legion officials have canceled the 2020 season in Pennsylvania. Last week, the American Legion announced the cancellation of all national tournaments, including the World Series.</p>
