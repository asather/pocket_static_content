<h1>Greensburg Diocese releases plan to reopen schools with in-person classes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Greensburg announced Wednesday its plans for the upcoming fall school year, with the intention to welcome students back to all 12 of its schools in Westmoreland County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to a release sent by the diocese, the plan is based on the most recent available information and will be updated as “changes in government mandates are decided.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, options for remote learning will be made available if a student or a family member becomes exposed or tests positive for COVID-19 or if the family believes it is unsafe for their child to attend school in-person.</p>
<p>“We recognize that some students may be apprehensive about returning to the brick-and-mortar school despite the efforts being taken to ensure a safe return for the school&nbsp;community,” said&nbsp;Dr. Maureen Marsteller, the diocese’s superintendent of Catholic schools, in the release.&nbsp;“If this is the case, options for engaging in distance learning before transitioning&nbsp;back to on-site education may be discussed with a school administrator.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A part of the plan includes creating&nbsp;“Pandemic Safety Committees” for each school. The committees will be made up of members of the school community and will be used to form specific safety practices unique to each building that align with the main safety plan.</p>
<p>School buildings will be cleaned daily. Students, staff and other employees will go through health screenings before entering the buildings. The school’s face-covering policy for students, staff and volunteers will follow the latest state, local and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Social distancing will be “emphasized” throughout the day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visitors and volunteers will be limited and will follow the building’s safety protocols.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Office of Catholic Schools is working to secure clear tri-fold desk shields as a way to form physical barriers between students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a letter sent to parents on Wednesday,&nbsp;Ms. Marsteller said&nbsp;more details will be posted on the school’s website in August on procedures that will be followed if a member of the school community is exposed or tests positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am sure that we would all like to see a return to normal. However, we must&nbsp;remember that we are not living in normal times,” Ms. Marsteller said in her letter. “We must&nbsp;realize that although some aspects of school will be normal, other aspects will be different.”&nbsp;</p>
