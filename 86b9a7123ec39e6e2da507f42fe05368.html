<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 03.11.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we will start our chat in just a couple minutes, so get ready..... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, let's get started....</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: Thoughts on Pick 49: a RB they have rated #30, a WR they have rated #30 or an Offensive Lineman they have rated #30: Who to select? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It won't be an offensive lineman if they're all rated the same.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Is there any scenario where the team does not tag Dupree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not really. It is their No. 1 priority and I don't think anything has happened to change their mind. They are not in position to sign him to a long-term deal.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What's the likelihood the team will address TE or S in free agency? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Safety is not a priority. I think you will see that addressed later in the draft. Tight end is more of a priority, but it is not a major one. Still, it is the one position most likely to be addressed in free agency. The Steelers can always keep their fingers crossed and hope Vance McDonald can stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Is Barron or Vance back with the team next year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Both</p>
<p><strong>Damien</strong>: With Bud presumably being tagged for this coming season, do you expect this to be his last in Pittsburgh, or do you feel theyâ€™ll get a long term deal done before hit hits FA again? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The long-term deal will be going to TJ Watt, so the most likely thing w Bud is he might get a second franchise tag or not one at all, depending what happens in 2020. If he is that productive this season, they won't be able to afford a long-term deal with him anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What kind of implications will COVID-19 have on the draft process regarding pro days, prospect visits? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We shall see. I think a bigger impact will come with the draft being held in Vegas. Pro days and office visits don't carry the same type of community-spread threats</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: Let's say selection #49 rolls around and Chase Claypool and maybe a few other highly regarded wr's are on the board. So are the tight ends noted in the P-G profile piece last week. Who would you pick? Or would you go in a different direction, maybe ol or rb? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If all ratings are the same for players at different positions, i think you will see them lean toward WR. They never turn their back on a quality skill player, and most of those are WRs, especially if one is a playmaker.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Jones</strong>: If I don't tag Dak or sign Amari, will the Steelers end up signing them. I hear the Steelers are great at working the cap, so I'm afraid they'll steal them from me. I need to be comforted. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Take a nap.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Al Villanueva was a TE in college. He'd provide great blocking and CAN catch. Have the Steelers ever thought about that move? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. And never will.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers2010</strong>: Gerry, do you think the Steelers will try and re-sign Watt or JuJu this offseason? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure about this season, but when the salary cap goes up appreciably in 2021, it will definitely happen by then. Not to worry.</p>
<p><strong>Todd from Swissvale</strong>: I agree that the Steelers front office is the best in the league. Does anyone even come close to working the draft pick compensation system as good as they do? It seems they get picks every year and nail those picks better than anyone else. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It is hard to find any organization in the league that retains its best players better and more often than the Steelers. There's a reason why they are among the best, if not the best, franchises in the league over the past 3 to 4 decades.</p>
<p><strong>Double T</strong>: Do the Steelers have most Hall of Famers in the league? It seems they are always in the Hall of Fame game. I understand they are the most popular team, but it doesn't seem right they play the game so often. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. And they don't play the HOF game any more than most other teams. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: BTW, they have played in the HOF game five times since 1965. This will be Dallas' fourth time in the game since 2010.</p>
<p><strong>'Double Divot Dewey</strong>: Been a bit since we've received any updates on Ben's progression. Have you heard any additional updates? Sorry - but I think this might be a common question right up till Game 1...... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don't provide daily updates, nor should they or will they. You can be curious all you want but until we hear more there is nothing else to say.</p>
<p><strong>Go Steelers!</strong>: If you had to cover any other team in the league, who would you choose? I assume it'd be a warm climate team since you like to golf. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm perfectly satisfied what I'm doing.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Given the depth of talent in a few positions of need and our relative lack of picks, would it be worth exploring a trade of next years 2 for a 3 and 4-5 this year? I know the Steelers don't like trading away the future, but this draft seems like a good one to stock up on. What is the forecast for next year's talent? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. And I'm lucky to know and evaluate this year's talent, let alone next year's.</p>
<p><strong>574Fan</strong>: I'm guessing that you know Ben as well as any media figure in town at this point. It certainly seems as if he will be back for training camp as his rehab is on schedule, but who knows what to expect in terms of arm strength, durability (given age and injury), etc. Given the resurgence of the defense last season, it seems like it makes sense for this team to try to revert to the formula that won a lot of games pre-2010: control the LOS, control TOP, run the ball, play action, etc. My question is would Ben buy in? I have a higher opinion of him as a person now than I did years ago, but is he really at a point where it's team first at all costs for him? Seems like he should be since another ring would be a huge feather in his cap post-retirement and he isn't playing for another contract, so I guess it's an ego question. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Look, Ben will adapt to whatever formula is best to win. It's the Steelers who develop that formula. And, with an improved defense, it will require him to throw less if the Steelers are trying to protect leads instead of trying to overcome deficits. The key to his rehab is how well Ben will be able to spin the ball. Those are numbers he can measure. Spin rate determines accuracy and, in some cases, distance. Velocity is important, yes, but not as important as the spin rate.</p>
<p><strong>Big Kev</strong>: Did Goodell give the Steelers one of the easiest schedules because they will be on Hard Knocks and play in the Hall of Fame game? Seems like a fair deal. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no such thing. The formula for a schedule is determined years in advance.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: Gerry, Would you be hurt if the Steeler's go with Jalen in the 2nd rd? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't let any pick ever affect my appetite. But if you mean Jalen Hurts, that ain't happening either.</p>
<p><strong>mark bo</strong>: Do you see the steelers cutting Switzer,Foster ? Keeping Finney? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If that happened, I could see that. But it's a safer bet they will cut Chickillo (for sure) and Foster than Switzer. Keeping Finney makes perfect sense.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Gerry, who do you like in the Players this week? I think Rahn has a real shot. On to football. I just read Cook's article on the CBA and if 65% of the NFL players played at the league minimum, I would think they'd pass it. Why would Pouncey be against it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The number of players who play for the league minimum is nearly 60 percent, not 65, which, yes, is why it will pass. Veterans who have made their money, like Pouncey, don't want a 17th game. They are tired of having their bodies beat up with 16 games, and I get it.</p>
<p><strong>Todd from Swissvale</strong>: Retain their best players more than any other team? That doesn't apply to Bell or Brown, who are among their best in a long time. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They were rid for different reasons. Had nothing to do with WANTING to retain them. It had more to do with WANTING to get rid of their nonsense. Which was the absolute right thing to do.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Gerry, I believe the Steelers will draft a WR with their 2nd round pick since there's so many quality WR's. It would be like picking a 1 at 49. Do you agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think that is a good possibility</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: can't wait for Steelers-Cowboys as my wifes from South Carolina and a Cowboys fan. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I wouldn't get too excited. Most of the players who will appear in that game won't even be on the roster in September.</p>
<p><strong>Hall of fame</strong>: How come the Steelers don't have an actual team hall of fame building? Took a long time to build this hall of honor thing, but it's not much. Do any teams have actual buildings dedicated to their own hall of fame? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure if other teams do. I think the Packers have some sort of building/extension for their own Hall of Fame. I think that's what the Steelers are doing with the Great Hall. But the Pro Football HOF has more than 320 enshrinees. Hard to put up a building for 20-30 guys.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: May I ask who your favorite Steeler of all time to interview? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are more than several. At the top of the list are James Farrior, Dermontti Dawson, Brett Keisel, just to name a few.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Do the players really like doing the out in a restaurant radio shows? AB always seemed like he was asleep on his show with you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they like the payday</p>
<p><strong>Justin</strong>: If the Steelers are keeping Barron (per your earlier prediction), how are they getting under the cap to afford Dupree tag? Foster (3m) and Chick (5m) won't get you there. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There are other ways. When they re-sign Heyward, that will lessen their cap hit by $2-3 million, for example. They can re-do other contracts and turn their salaries into signing bonuses. They know what they're doing more than you. And me.</p>
<p><strong>pozone</strong>: Gerry any chance we draft Jalen Hurts? I would love to see them go speed at WR in round 2? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Uh....no</p>
<p><strong>Not happy</strong>: Leveon Bell is better than any of the other free agents signed last year. The Steelers were hosed in not getting the first 3rd round comp pick. Do you agree with that? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's based on a total formula. However, I agree with you</p>
<p><strong>Sergio from Mexico</strong>: Hello Gerry. What is your opinion on the new CBA? Do you think it will be a Yes? Thanks for keeping us informed of our Steelers here south of the border!!! Vamos Steelers! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think it will be an overwhelming yes.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: If the Bengals draft the LSU kid, would they actually trade the red rifle to the Pats? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think Andy Dalton is a very good free-agent pickup for a lot of teams, including the Patriots.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Don't Steelers-Cowboys play during the regular season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck from Michigan</strong>: Gerry, the Steelers have had a heavy emphasis and success of drafting Big Ten players the last several years. What Big Ten players do you like at RB/TE/OL with the 49th pick? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Jonathan Taylor. You can stop right there.</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: I wonder why so many fans are so down on Dupree? He wasnâ€™t great the first couple years but did produce in a contract year. If they franchise him, itâ€™s still a contract year, for him. How do you rate him? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: To a degree, yes it is a contract year. But, if he were playing for a bigger deal in 2019, he will get it with the franchise tag, somewhere around $15-16 million. I think the Bud I saw last year is very good for what you want from a 3-4 edge rusher. I have no problems with him whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Why are people so high on Jalen Hurts? 3rd round picks rarely become franchise QBs? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas</strong>: Lets pretend the 'Lers draft offense with their first 3 picks, what are your first 3 priorities, and do you have anyone in particular in mind? Can they get a workhorse RB in the 2nd rd? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don't need a workhorse running back, they need a No. 1 big-play RB. But, for your arguments sake, I'd go some combination of WR-RB-G, RB-TE-OL, WR-RB-TE.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: Hey Gerry! I think the contract Ben got was terrible for the organization. A old QB making over 30 million a year. Your thoughts <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: And you want to pay who how much....????</p>
<p><strong>Raymund</strong>: Which WR and Which RB would you like or hope @ 49 that could be available realistically, Not one that obviously wonâ€™t be there most likely ? Thanks Gerry ! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: WR -- Jefferson, Pittman, Hamler. RB-- Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: Hey Gerry. I see above you mentioned Ben and his spin rate. Do they high speed video that and slow it down and count? A chip in the ball? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure of the measuring device, to be honest, but they have a baseline they compare it to. I think most QBs coming out of college now have their spin rate measured. A lot of GMs believe that is a better barometer of measuring a QB's efficiency and effectiveness. For example, Drew Brees doesn't have the greatest arm sterngth in terms of velocity but his spin rate is excpetional. Think of it this way, better spin rate means a tighter spiral. A tighter spiral cuts through the air and reduces drag, meaning it will travel farther than a ball that is wobbling. That's your physics lesson today. Trust me, that's what they will be evaluating with Ben. Got it?</p>
<p><strong>Lou</strong>: What do you think of Dez Bryant as a Steeler on a low risk high reward contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they'll pass</p>
<p><strong>TomnAZ</strong>: Chats greatly appreciated! Who is your guess/projected third string quarterback for 2020? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure I'm ready to guess, but, because you asked, I'll say Paxton Lynch.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers #7 for #7</strong>: What are the odds that Ben wins MVP and the Super Bowl MVP this year? I'm looking to make bank in Vega$! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don't set odds that high.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Gerry, with Ben coming back, how do you see the division being this year. I know the draft has a lot to do witht hings as well as FA, but just curious if we have a shot. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Of course they do. They have a talented roster and a very good, top-tier defense.</p>
<p><strong>Typical Yinzer</strong>: Since the Steelers will be getting the $21 mil in cap space from Brown coming off the books this year, will they use that to sign Austin Hooper and Derek Henry? I heard that cap money will reappear when the new year begins. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That $21 million that comes off the books for 84 doesn't mean they will have an additional $21 million to spend. It doesn't work that way. They are already up against the cap right now and they have to be in compliance by Wednesday, unless for some reason that gets pushed back because of the CBA vote.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Gerry, to change the subject , Masters Badges, practice round tickets and Woman's amateur championship tickets prices have dripped faster the Dow Jones. Masters housing and hotels are slashing prices too. Go Steelers. Mixed feeling about the HOF game. How about you ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Did not know that, but not surprised. I don't like four preseason games, let alone five, whether they are held in Canton, Pittsburgh or Augusta.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Of the eligible players up for a restricted tender, what players do see not being offered? Banner? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, I think all of them will be offered. Maybe not Amara Darboh or L.T. Walton, but that's not a big deal.</p>
<p><strong>CincySteelerfan</strong>: Do you think the corona virus would effect NFL games if it gets more involved in the US? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It could, but the good news is there is still plenty of time before the NFL season to possibly get the virus under control.</p>
<p><strong>steelersfaninCT</strong>: Any idea what will happen with Shazier? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Still to be determined. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, kids, we're out of time and apparently out of questions. Don't forget to wash your hands</p>
