<h1>PNC Bank shuttering eight branches in the Pittsburgh region</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Bank is permanently closing 54 branches across its multi-state footprint, including eight locations in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh-based PNC has been shuttering branches in recent years as more customers have embraced digital banking, reducing the need to visit a teller.</p>
<p>PNC listed the closings in its latest filing with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency.</p>
<p>Offices on the chopping block in this region include branches in Mt. Lebanon on Washington Road, in North Versailles on Lincoln Highway and in Greensburg on Main Street, which are slated to close Oct. 16.</p>
<p>Four others in the region are set to close Nov. 20, including branches in McKees Rocks on Chartiers Avenue and in West Mifflin on Homeville Road, plus the Giant Eagle branch on Washington Pike in Bridgeville and the Farmers Bank branch on Philadelphia Street in Indiana, Pa.</p>
<p>One additional branch, in Elizabeth on Market Street, is set to close Dec. 4.</p>
<p>“We constantly evaluate our branches —- together with our other available channels of banking — to ensure that they are most effectively meeting our customers’ needs,” spokeswoman Marcey Zwiebel said in an email Friday.</p>
<p>“There are many options for banking with PNC via online, mobile, ATM, phone, etc., and we have continued to see our customers taking advantage of the investments we have made in these channels and altering the ways in which they have been banking with us,” she said.</p>
<p>Some 73% of consumer customers used non-teller options for the majority of their banking during the second quarter, she added.</p>
