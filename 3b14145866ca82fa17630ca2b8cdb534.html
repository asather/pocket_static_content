<h1>Local leaders criticize Minneapolis police death while groups plan protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State and local leaders on Friday criticized the actions of the Minneapolis police officers involved in the death of George Floyd, who died in police custody this week, while groups plan local protests this weekend.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto, police Chief Scott Schubert and Attorney General Josh Shaprio all condemned the actions of the Minneapolis police officers.</p>
<p>Chief Schubert said he was “deeply disturbed and saddened” by the footage of Mr. Floyd’s death, which shows Minneapolis police officer&nbsp;Derek Chauvin kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck for several minutes while Mr. Floyd says,&nbsp;“I can’t breathe.”</p>
<p>Mr. Chauvin on Friday was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/29/Minneapolis-cop-who-knelt-on-handcuffed-black-man-arrested/stories/202005290101" target="_blank">charged with third-degree murder</a> and manslaughter in the death of Mr. Floyd.</p>
<p>“This is not how we are trained to restrain people, and it’s not what we stand for as police officers,” Chief Schubert <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4000" target="_blank">wrote in a statement</a>.&nbsp;“Regardless of the original crime or what occurred prior to the arrest, a person in handcuffs and face-down on the ground should not lose their life due to the action or inaction of the involved officers.”</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd was originally taken into custody for allegedly trying to pay for cigarettes with counterfeit money.</p>
<p>“On a grander scale, it’s an issue that we have to address,” Mr. Peduto said. “We have to be able to speak openly about the targeting of black males. Something [like] passing a bad bill or writing a bad check should never be a death sentence for anybody.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro, in a statement on Twitter, wrote, “There is a rot at the center of our society, and this week it was laid bare on the street under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer. Today that officer was charged with murder and is under arrest. It is the first step toward justice, but we have a long road ahead of us.” Mr. Shapiro connected the death to the effects of slavery and institutional racism.</p>
<p>Chief Schubert thanked Pittsburgh police officers and praised the “high level of professionalism, bravery, courage and compassion our officers display on a daily basis.”</p>
<p>“I have asked the academy to review this senseless death and share additional information that can help reinforce our training and policies,” Chief Schubert continued. “Excessive force is unacceptable and will not be tolerated at any level.”</p>
<p>The chairman of the Black Political Empowerment Project, Tim Stevens, commended Chief Schubert’s response, calling it “a very profound sentiment.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m hoping that the words that our Pittsburgh chief, Scott Schubert, shared will be taken to heart by every police officer in the city,” Mr. Stevens said. “And I’m hopeful that every police chief in the country will echo similar words to their officers.”</p>
<p>Several organizations have <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/298770371286740" target="_blank">planned a protest</a> for Saturday afternoon under the umbrella of the Steel City Autonomous Movement, which describes itself as a “platform for communication and coordinating solidarity between autonomous crews and organizations in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Some of the involved organizations include Black Lives Matter, the jail abolitionist group Jailbreak Pittsburgh and local mutual aid groups.</p>
<p>“We want justice for George Floyd and to show solidarity with the protesters in Minneapolis fighting to end the state-sponsored murder of black people,” SCAM wrote in the description of the event, set to take place at 2:30 p.m. at Sixth Street and Liberty Avenue in Downtown.</p>
<p>Halsey Hyer, who spoke on behalf of SCAM, said the organizers have no intention to escalate things beyond the organized demonstration.&nbsp;“No one ever plans for things to be violent. If it escalates, that because people choose to escalate it.”</p>
<p>Sharon McIntosh, a coordinator for the Greater Pittsburgh Coalition Against Violence, said she was&nbsp;“calling for calm” in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;“We don’t want to mimic anything that’s happening in Minneapolis, Minnesota. We don’t need to do that at all,” Ms. McIntosh said, encouraging education for young people about how to&nbsp;“change the system that seems to be completely adverse towards black and brown people.”</p>
<p>Public safety spokesman Chris Togneri said the police would work with protest organizers.</p>
<p>“We are aware that there are going to be some planned protests in the Pittsburgh region,” Mr. Togneri said. “As always, public safety is prepared. We have a long track record over the past couple of years of protests in the city of Pittsburgh, and our track record as a city, as a public safety department ... is that we are going to respect the [protesters’] rights while maintaining the safety for everyone involved [and] for our city residents.”</p>
<p>Protests in the Twin Cities this week led to damage and looting at <a href="https://www.startribune.com/these-minneapolis-st-paul-buildings-are-damaged-looted-after-george-floyd-protests/569930671/" target="_blank">dozens of buildings</a>, including a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/28/Protesters-enter-Minneapolis-police-station-set-fires/stories/202005280202" target="_blank">police station that was torched</a> on Thursday night.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/29/South-Side-protest-pittsburgh-Minneapolis-killing-of-George-Floyd/stories/202005290100" target="_blank">small demonstration</a> was held on Friday outside the Pittsburgh FBI offices on the South Side, where a local family held up signs demanding the arrest of the police officers who were involved in Mr. Floyd’s death.</p>
