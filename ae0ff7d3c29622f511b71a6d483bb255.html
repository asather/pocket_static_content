<h1>Health department closes Rocky's in Bloomfield; posts alert at Sarafino's in Crafton</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rocky’s diner on Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield was shut down by health inspectors for failing to correct food safety violations.</p>
<p>“Owner failed to address the need for commercial refrigeration by the date determined during pre-suspension hearing,” according to the inspection report from the Allegheny County Health Department.</p>
<p>The restaurant, which must remain closed until proper refrigeration is installed, also was cited for lack of a certified food protection manager.</p>
<p>The operator of Rocky’s could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Late last week, the health department posted a consumer alert at Sarafino’s restaurant on Crafton Avenue in Crafton for numerous health code violations, including foods held at unsafe temperatures, improper cooling procedures, lack of a food protection manager, lack of a hand sink at the server station and bare hand contact with ready-to-eat food.</p>
<p>The alert was lifted on Tuesday after fixes were made.</p>
