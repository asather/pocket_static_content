<h1>Allegheny County reports two new COVID-19 deaths; Pennsylvania reports 45 additional deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County on Saturday reported two additional COVID-19 deaths and 21 new cases, bringing the updated sum since the first instance was reported on March 14 to 73 total deaths and 1,198 cases.</p>
<p>The state, meanwhile, in a separate briefing live-streamed from Harrisburg, <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/coronavirus/Pages/Cases.aspx" target="_blank">reported 45 new deaths and 1,397 new cases.</a> They bring the Commonwealth case and fatality tally to 40,041 and 1,537 respectively, according&nbsp;to Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>“To date, all of the deaths have been in adult patients,” the secretary said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said 6,544 of the total cases are associated with 425 long-term care living facilities including nursing homes and personal care homes, plus other congregate settings.</p>
<p>As of Saturday morning, hospitals across the state are reporting that 2,746 patients are currently hospitalized, of which 662 have required a ventilator or breathing machine. Forty-seven percent of hospital beds, 40 percent of intensive care unit beds and nearly 70 percent of ventilators are still available, Dr. Levine noted.</p>
<p>“We know that changes to our daily way of life have been very difficult for Pennsylvanians,” Dr. Levine said.&nbsp;“Major disruptions to daily schedules have been even more difficult for Pennsylvanians with intellectual disabilities and autism who rely on these routes, and it’s also very difficult for those who care for them.”</p>
<p>Since there are more cases likely than surveillance capabilities currently can detect, it is difficult to tell just how deadly the virus is in Pennsylvania and elsewhere, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>The death rate right now is almost four out of 100 cases, but experience in other countries, including China, suggests a rate of two or even one.</p>
<p>“Even if it’s approximately one out of 100 or a little more, that’s still ten times the death rate that it is for influenza,” said the secretary, noting the flu’s death rate of 0.1%</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, total cases to date include 1,167 confirmed and 31 probable, according to the county health department. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>“We are including probable cases to better assess the level of community spread,” it read.</p>
<p>The state plans a midday update of its cases and deaths. Nationwide, cases now total more than 906,000 and deaths have surpassed 52,000, according to Johns Hopkins University’s interactive count.</p>
<p>As of Friday’s state update, Pennsylvania had 38,652 total confirmed cases and 1,492 total confirmed deaths.</p>
<p>Among the cases in Allegheny County, females represent 650 or 54% of the cases and males account for 548 or 46%</p>
<p>The specific age group and share they represent are: 00-04 – 4 (less than 1%);&nbsp;05-12 – 4 (less than 1%);&nbsp;13-18 – 10 (1%);&nbsp;19-24 – 81 (7%);&nbsp;25-49 – 416 (35%);&nbsp;50-64 – 340 (28%); and&nbsp;65 + -- 343 (29%)</p>
<p>Of the 1,198 cases, there are 211 past or present hospitalizations. That represents an increase of three individuals.</p>
<p>Among those who have died, 66 are confirmed (had a positive test) and seven were probable, according to Saturday’s update.&nbsp;“A probable death is one where COVID-19 is listed on the deceased’s death certificate, but the person never had a positive test for the virus,” the county said.</p>
<p>All deceased ranged in age from 42 to 103. Of that total, 84 was the median age of whose who died.</p>
<p>For additional information, the county referred individuals to its COVID-19 Dashboard. It is found at <a href="https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx" target="_blank">http://alleghenycounty.us/coronavirus</a>.</p>
