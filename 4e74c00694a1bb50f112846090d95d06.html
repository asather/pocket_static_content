<h1>Smithfield Foods idles Sioux Falls plant amid coronavirus concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Smithfield Foods Inc. said it will idle its Sioux Falls, S.D., pork-processing plant indefinitely, the latest disruption in the U.S. food supply chain as manufacturers close facilities to limit the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The plant is one of the largest pork-processing facilities in the U.S., accounting for at least 4% of production in the country, the Smithfield, Virginia-based company said in a statement. Smithfield says it will reopen the plant when it receives further direction from local, state and federal authorities.</p>
<p>The plant was the site of an outbreak of COVID-19 cases. The Associated Press on April 10 quoted South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem as saying there were 190 cases tied to an outbreak at the site.</p>
<p>The Smithfield facilityâ€™s 3,700 employees will receive pay for at least two weeks during the shutdown, the company said.</p>
<p>Food production plants across the U.S. are curbing their output and idling facilities as the deadly respiratory virus spreads to rural communities.</p>
