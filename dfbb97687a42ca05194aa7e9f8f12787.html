<h1>Defense, prosecution spar over fate of cocaine dealer in separate prison drug ring case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal prosecutors say Robert Korbe, a convicted cocaine dealer at the center of a drug investigation that resulted in the murder of an FBI agent in 2008, was directly involved in another scheme to smuggle drug-saturated greeting cards into the U.S. prison where he is an inmate.</p>
<p>Facing 48 months in prison as part of a plea deal, they say he should serve that term after his current 300-month sentence.</p>
<p>But Korbe's lawyer, R. Damien Schorr, says there's little evidence to show Korbe was smuggling drug paper directly and the government should not be allowed to punish him twice for the earlier drug case, especially since it was his wife, Christina, who killed FBI Agent Sam Hicks.</p>
<p>Mr. Schorr says part of Korbe's 48 months should be served at the same time as his current sentence.</p>
<p>"Twenty-seven months should be served concurrent to his current sentence, leaving 21 months to be served consecutively," he wrote. "That treats him the same as other defendants in this case with similar backgrounds and offenses."</p>
<p>The sentencing is set for Aug. 3, probably by video because of COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>Korbe, who was sentenced for drug trafficking in 2010, is among several high-profile federal inmates indicted in Pittsburgh in 2019 following an investigation that revealed a network of defendants sneaking synthetic cannabinoids into the prison system on greeting cards, letters and pictures for inmates to smoke.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty last month.</p>
<p>In sentencing papers, prosecutors wasted no time in assessing Korbe's character and history.</p>
<p>"Defendant Robert Korbe should be ashamed of himself," wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Haller. "His drug dealing, violent, and deceitful behavior for the last 20+ years in Western Pennsylvania resulted in six drug trafficking convictions in six federal and state prosecutions as well as convictions for aggravated assault and wire fraud in still more state and federal prosecutions. Even worse, his behavior led to the shooting death of FBI Special Agent Samuel Hicks in the line of duty in 2008."</p>
<p>In that case, Christina shot Agent Hicks as law officers raided the Korbeâ€™s house in Indiana Township.</p>
<p>She is serving a 190-month sentence.</p>
<p>Mr. Haller said that although Christina pulled the trigger that day, Korbe was responsible for the outcome by his conduct.</p>
<p>When agents showed up to serve a search warrant, Mr. Haller said, Korbe refused to open the door. Instead, he ran away from the door to destroy evidence. Agents then breached the door and entered. It was then that Christina shot Agent Hicks from the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>"Mr. Korbe's contemptible actions do not excuse his wife's crimes, but his actions created the circumstances for those crimes to occur," Mr. Haller said.</p>
<p>Mr. Schorr contested that conclusion, saying Christina's story differs from that of the government.</p>
<p>He said Christina maintains that the agents didn't identify themselves and she shot to protect her children. Besides, he said, Korbe was not charged with killing the agent.</p>
<p>"The government relies on crimes Mr. Korbe was never charged with, using 'facts' never proven, nor admitted to by Mr. Korbe, from a case in which he was not a party, in a cynical attempt to justify a sentence significantly harsher than his co-defendants," Mr. Schorr wrote.</p>
<p>The two sides differ on the details of the current case, too. Mr. Schorr said the government can't establish the quantity of synthetic marijuana attributed to Korbe.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the government cannot establish it at all," he said.</p>
<p>He said only one greeting card soaked with marijuana addressed to Korbe was intercepted and the government is unable to establish quantity or purity.</p>
<p>But Mr. Haller said Korbe directly participated in the drug-smuggling with Noah Landfried of Moon, another defendant who was on federal probation in 2017 and 2018 during the conspiracy. His case is pending.</p>
<p>Mr. Haller said James Perry of Ambridge, another defendant who had been on probation, helped Landfried distribute drug paper and other drugs. Perry has pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>Wiretaps over a cellphone used by Perry, along with an investigation by the Bureau of Prisons at FCI-Loretto, where Korbe was housed, established that Korbe was conspiring with Perry to distribute Landfried's drug-saturated paper at Loretto.</p>
<p>Among the government's evidence is May 2018 letter from Korbe to Perry. In the letter, Korbe says "it's a little hot right now" and "I let a little time go in between so people don't get to know where it's coming from. I have someone doing it all for me so my name don't get known. Rats everywhere."</p>
<p>A second letter from Korbe to Perry in June 2018 instructed Perry on how to send the drug paper to one of Korbe's fellow inmates so that it would not be intercepted by the BOP. That letter was recovered at Perry's house in Ambridge when agents searched it January 2019.</p>
<p>In August 2018, BOP also intercepted a drug-saturated greeting card sent to Korbe by Perry according to instructions Korbe provided, Mr. Haller said. Prison security replaced the card with a similar one that had no drugs and forwarded it to Korbe. The following month, the BOP intercepted another letter from Korbe to Perry sent through Korbe's father that revealed Korbe had distributed the replacement card in the prison but that a customer who smoked it complained that "it wasn't that strong."</p>
<p>Mr. Haller said that the letters, among other evidence, show his involvement and that he deserves a consecutive prison term.</p>
<p>"The imposition of a concurrent sentence for drug trafficking in prison while serving a sentence for prior drug trafficking would be, in effect, no punishment for, and no deterrent to, aggravated criminal conduct," he said.</p>
<p>According to testimony and court records, the ring was active in several U.S. prisons, where inmates cut up the paper into pieces for distribution among other inmates who swallowed or smoked it.</p>
<p>The inmates paid for the drug paper with money from their prison accounts. The investigation showed that money was being transferred from those accounts to the accounts of inmate dealers and then to others on the outside.</p>
<p>The network also sold drugs outside of prison, distributing large amounts of heroin, cocaine, fentanyl, painkillers and suboxone.</p>
<p>The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the IRS said the ringleader was Noah Landfried. Another key player, agents said, was Michel Cercone, a former real estate agent from Sewickley who according to phone taps worked with Noah Landfried to prepare the drug paper and sold other drugs across the region.</p>
