<h1>Emergency Action Fund awards more than $8 million for COVID-19 relief </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A community fund established to meet emergency needs in the Pittsburgh region during the COVID-19 pandemic has raised more than $8 million and issued more than 200 grants, including awards targeted for health care, housing and food.</p>
<p>The Emergency Action Fund is housed at the Pittsburgh Foundation, a community foundation that announced the grants Tuesday.</p>
<p>Of $8.3 million in funds awarded, the largest grant was $1.1 million to the Allegheny County Department of Human Services to fund 150 units of temporary housing and food distribution for individuals who are not able to self-quarantine.</p>
<p>Other large awards included $600,000 to the county Health Department for staffing, cleaning and safety supplies, and extra technology needed during the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Urban Redevelopment Authority of Pittsburgh received $400,000 for its housing stabilization program that provides short-term financial assistance to households facing crisis.</p>
<p>The United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania received two grants: $198,650 to transport food safely to vulnerable people including those who are homebound; and $152,000 for the 2-1-1 helpline and other emergency needs.</p>
<p>A majority of the grants ranged from $5,000 to $25,000 and went to a diverse group of nonprofits in Allegheny, Beaver and Westmoreland counties.</p>
<p>Many provide programs and services for low-income households and have annual budgets of less than $5 million.</p>
<p>Some grants were even smaller.</p>
<p>Building Block of Natrona, for instance, received $3,400 to provide personal hygiene products, tutoring and food to families and youth in Natrona and its surrounding communities.</p>
<p>Arts organizations, hard hit by canceled performances and events since stay-at-home orders were issued in March, also received funds to help make up their budget shortfalls.</p>
<p>Among those receiving grants were the Society for Contemporary Craft, $25,000; Pittsburgh Irish and Classical Theatre, $25,000; Off the Wall Productions, $7,500; and Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh, $5,000.</p>
<p>The fund was launched March 16 and seeded by contributions of $1 million apiece from four large Pittsburgh philanthropies: the Richard King Mellon Foundation, Heinz Endowments, Henry L. Hillman Foundation and the Pittsburgh Foundation.</p>
<p>Individuals, corporations and other foundations generated another $4.3 million in donations.</p>
<p>“I knew people across the region would put aside their own worries to give, but the generosity has been just extraordinary,” said Lisa Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Pittsburgh Foundation.</p>
<p>Applications will close on Friday at 5 p.m., but the fund will continue to accept donations for emergency needs in the future, the foundation said.</p>
<p>“We believe this is the right time to shift our focus from immediate emergency relief to the longer-term challenge of securing economic recovery for the region,” said Ms. Schroeder.</p>
