<h1>BNY Mellon imposing 40-hour workweek, raising minimum wage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bank of New York Mellon is imposing a standard 40-hour workweek on employees across the U.S., raising the number of hours many of its employees will work.</p>
<p>The new standard, announced in an email to employees Thursday, takes effect Sept. 6.</p>
<p>The change will ensure “more consistent treatment of employees,” the email stated.</p>
<p>Many of the company’s employees currently are required to work from 35 to 37.5 hours per week.</p>
<p>“We recognize that there may be some concerns about this change,” the email said.</p>
<p>For example, it said, employees who worked less than 40 hours will now be required to work additional hours.</p>
<p>The adjustment will not affect workers’ take-home pay.</p>
<p>“Because you will be receiving the same pay, you will receive a slightly lower regular hourly rate,” the email said.</p>
<p>At the same time, BNY Mellon said it was bumping up its minimum wage from $15 to $16.50 per hour. The hike in the minimum wage takes effect Sept. 1.</p>
<p>“BNY Mellon periodically reviews its policies and practices,” spokeswoman Jennifer Hendricks Sullivan said Thursday. “This change will result in a more consistent treatment of employees with regard to expected hours of work.”</p>
<p>BNY Mellon employs 47,900 globally. The company does not disclose how many work in the U.S., Ms. Sullivan said.</p>
