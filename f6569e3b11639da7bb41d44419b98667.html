<h1>Spectator ban will throw a wrench in high school athletic budgets</h1>

<p>High school football games in Pennsylvania will lose much of their unique atmosphere this fall because of a spectator ban at all sports events. But the ban will also cause the loss of revenue for high school athletics budgets.</p>
<p>It’s not as if the loss of ticket revenue from one football season will doom athletics at high schools and cause major cuts to sports programs. And it isn’t like major colleges, where football revenue is worth millions, paying the bills for most other sports.</p>
<p>But some WPIAL high schools make upward of $40,000 from ticket sales for a season. A few bigger schools with successful teams, such as Thomas Jefferson and North Allegheny, report they can gain as much as $70,000 from ticket sales in a good season. That money will be gone this season.</p>
<p>The ban comes from Gov. Tom Wolf and recommendations from the state departments of Health and Education. The PIAA wants schools in the state to comply with the ban.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With high school athletics budgets being tight in many school districts these days, a loss of more than $40,000 can be significant. Some smaller schools might lose less than $10,000 from gate revenues, but that can be impactful at a small school.</p>
<p>“I look at it like if you’re losing out on budgeted revenue, then money has to come out of the general fund budget at a school, which in turn lessens the amount for what you would call the ‘rainy day fund’ that you would use on other things, like maybe a roof or some technology items,” said Gateway School District superintendent Bill Short.</p>
<p>At most WPIAL high schools, ticket revenue comes mostly from football games, with another large chunk from basketball. Schools don’t even sell tickets for many sporting events. According to Short and Gateway business manager Paul Schott, the district’s $366,000 athletics budget included $64,000 from ticket revenues for the 2020-21 school year. At Gateway, which won the WPIAL Class 5A football championship last year, much of that ticket revenue comes from football.</p>
<p>“We have to remind parents that we’re still in a pandemic and things are so different,” Short said. “Even though there is the opportunity to play now, there are ripple effects from the budget that affect what we were maybe planning for this year or down the road for other things in the district. Now we have to put some of those things on hold because we’re just not ready to commit to that now because of the unknown.”</p>
<p>It should be pointed out that athletics budgets for public high school districts are minuscule in terms of the entire school budget. Often, the athletics budget is less than 1%. But some WPIAL athletic directors contacted for this story said a deficit in an athletics budget will be made up by taking some money from a school district’s general fund.</p>
<p>So how is ticket revenue used? Many schools use the revenue to pay for officials in other sports, which can be costly. Some schools might use ticket revenue for new uniforms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Out of our football ticket revenue, we pay for all officials in every other sport and also for tournament entry fees for all sports,” said Bill Cherpak, football coach and athletic director at Thomas Jefferson. “We probably average $13,000 to $15,000 for officials in every season — fall, winter and spring.”</p>
<p>With a spectator ban in place, schools can undoubtedly save money on the cost of staging a football game. Ticket takers and other workers aren’t needed and the cost of security goes way down.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s not a wash, but this won’t be as devastating as some might think,” Moon athletic director Ron Ledbetter said.</p>
<p>Added Chartiers-Houston athletic director Kurt Kesneck: “I know some schools where a lot of their stuff is contingent on gate sales, but we’re not one of them.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, the Post-Gazette reported on crowds for all WPIAL games (51) on a Friday in late September. The average crowd was 1,612, and 12 games had crowds of more than 2,000. Most high schools charge anywhere from $5 to $8 for adult tickets. So if a school expected to sell 1,500 adult tickets for one game at $6, that’s $9,000 lost because of the spectator ban.</p>
<p>Cherpak estimated gate sales were over $70,000 last year when&nbsp;Thomas Jefferson, a perennial power in football, had a team that won WPIAL and PIAA championships.</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to affect us much because we built up our athletic account over the years because we had such good revenue for football,” Cherpak said. “We have a reserve fund that we’ll go to. But some schools rely heavily on ticket revenue that it could be an issue for them.”</p>
<p>North Allegheny is the largest high school in the WPIAL, and athletic director Bob Bozzuto said a good football season with good weather on Friday nights might generate $75,000 in ticket revenue.</p>
<p>“First, you have to know that budgets can be very different from school to school,” Bozzuto said. “But it does have an effect not having ticket revenue. What we have made in extra funds in past years, we’ll go to that this year.”</p>
<p>According to Upper St. Clair athletic director Kevin Deitrick, the district made $34,836 on ticket sales for four football games last year, minus about $2,000 a game for expenses.</p>
<p>“The thing about this year is there are also expenses that you didn’t earmark for because of the virus, like hand sanitizers and face shields for our football helmets,” Deitrick said. “Then there are the boosters who don’t have as much money for the kids.”</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford athletic director Kerry Hetrick said the district makes over $40,000 in ticket sales in a good football season.</p>
<p>“Honestly, we’ll have to cut some corners,” Hetrick said. “Some things will have to change because there’s truly no way to make it up.”</p>
<p>The loss of ticket revenue isn’t as significant at a smaller school because crowds are smaller. But Beaver Falls, which plays football in the second-smallest classification, could earn more than $30,000 from gate receipts in a good season, said athletic director Jim Carbone.</p>
<p>“The losses won’t be catastrophic, but it does have an effect,” Carbone said.</p>
<p>Mapletown is the third-smallest football playing school in the WPIAL, but the Maples still made $7,322 from football gate receipts in 2019.</p>
<p>“This is going to affect everybody to one degree or another,” Mapletown athletic director Linda Messich said. “Without gates or without admission, I hear a lot of people at our level expressing doubts about how they are going to make ends meet.”</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford’s Hetrick believes he speaks for many athletic directors when he says he’s hoping the spectator ban will be lifted.</p>
<p>“We would just like the decision left to us to properly manage the games for some people to watch the games,” Hetrick said. “Even if it’s just 25 percent of capacity. If they don’t give us something like that, how do we block parents from walking on campus, standing at a fence and watching? Who wants to go down and block a road at school and not allow people on campus to watch a game? That will be impossible. Just give us the opportunity to have a safe environment.”</p>
