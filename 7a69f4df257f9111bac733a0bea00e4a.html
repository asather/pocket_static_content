<h1>Moving the Penguins to bubble city a massive endeavor for equipment staff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Monday, the first truck pulled out of PPG Paints Arena for the bubble.</p>
<p>The FedEx freighter, long enough to squeeze multiple Zambonis inside, was packed to the roof with new skates and gloves for each Penguins player and extra helmets, just in case. There were 40 boxes of hockey tape and 25 more filled with skate laces. Plus the medical supplies, protein powder, shampoo, etc.</p>
<p>“Everything in those boxes was basically just extra supplies,” Penguins associate head equipment manager Jon Taglianetti said Tuesday. “We walked through and looked at what we had. If we could fit it, we were just going to bring it.”</p>
<p>The past two weeks, Pittsburgh’s equipment staff, led by Dana Heinze, has been packing for what the Penguins hope is the longest road trip of their careers.</p>
<p>On Sunday, they will embark for Toronto, which the NHL selected to be its hub city for the Eastern Conference playoffs. They could, if they make it to Edmonton for the final four, be north of the border for more than nine weeks.</p>
<p>Their longest trip this season, down to Florida in February, lasted nine days.</p>
<p>Throw in the COVID-19 pandemic, which has complicated their jobs in terms of both infection control and the logistics of getting five tons of stinky hockey gear over the Canadian border, and it’s been a stressful week for Taglianetti.</p>
<p>“Actually, now that you mention it, I was about to search and see if [the freighter] made it there or not,” he said. “Customs is very strict right now. Once I see that shipment is in Toronto and the league got it, that’s going to be a relief.”</p>
<p><strong>Staying in stock</strong></p>
<p>To get an understanding of the amount of equipment the Penguins might need on another Stanley Cup run, let’s pick a player. How about Evgeni Malkin?</p>
<p>“Geno’s a good one to pick,” Taglianetti replied with a hearty chuckle.</p>
<p>Unlike Sidney Crosby and many others, Malkin isn’t too particular about his gear. He’d hit the ice in a football helmet with a rake in his hands if needed.</p>
<p>But Malkin is one of the heftiest Penguins at 6-foot-3 and 195 pounds. His game, which blends speed with periodic rage, can take a toll on his poor equipment.</p>
<p>“In our job, you’re always thinking about things breaking,” Taglianetti said.</p>
<p>So the Penguins plan to pack three pairs of skates, four pairs of new gloves and 30 sticks for Malkin. They also got Geno new helmets and will stuff the rest of his protective gear into his bag. They’ll also bring a box of the tape he likes.</p>
<p>Now extrapolate that across the entire training camp roster of 29 skaters.</p>
<p>For perspective, the equipment staff will pack two, maybe three stick bags during their annual Western Canada road trip. They’re lugging eight to Toronto.</p>
<p>Don’t forget about the goalies. They need a second set of pads for practice.</p>
<p>“We’re kind of worried about the way the leather will break down in their pads as they sweat and they’re skating,” Taglianetti said. “We will be playing every other day with practices in between. So we just hope that we can get by.”</p>
<p>And last but not least, there is a special cart for all of Kris Letang’s hair gel.</p>
<p>Taglianetti laughed about needing to confirm that a tweet from the @PenguinsEQ Twitter account about Letang requiring gallons of product was indeed a joke. But it is noteworthy the Penguins packed a ton of toiletries.</p>
<p>“Players can’t share deodorant and hair gel anymore,” Taglianetti noted.</p>
<p>Add all that up, and the equipment staff will be bringing at least 9,000 pounds of stuff to the hub city, spread out among two trucks and the team plane. For last season’s Western Canada trip, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2018/10/29/dana-heinze-penguins-equipment-manager-western-canada-road-trip/stories/201810290059" target="_blank">their load tipped the scales at three tons</a>.</p>
<p>“This one’s going to be a different animal than Western Canada,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Deep clean</strong></p>
<p>In normal times, the equipment staff already doubles as infection control experts, worrying about things like MRSA and the NHL’s mumps outbreak in 2014. But in this pandemic, they’re battling the threat of an unfamiliar foe in COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Every day, something else comes out from the CDC or something,” Taglianetti said. “So we’re trying to stay on top of whatever the experts are saying.”</p>
<p>The Penguins have a formidable ally in their corner in UPMC. They share their Cranberry practice facility with the healthcare giant. Taglianetti said his staff did a walkthrough with an infection control expert before players arrived for workouts at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex several weeks ago. They remain in touch with UPMC.</p>
<p>For starters, the Penguins try to practice social distancing. They wear masks in the building whenever they aren’t skating or in the gym. The locker room has been spaced out, a guy at every other stall. During camp, players such as Teddy Blueger and Zach Aston-Reese have had to suit up in an auxiliary locker room.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to keep everyone’s gear and everyone isolated a little,” Taglianetti said. “[The equipment staff] is trying not to touch as much equipment unless we need to. But we have to repair some things, so it’s going to happen.”</p>
<p>Cleaning and disinfecting all that sweaty stuff presents another challenge.</p>
<p>Many pieces, skates being one big exception, can go in their industrial washers. But a number of years ago, the Penguins purchased what Taglianetti called “a disinfectant oven” for skates, helmets and protective equipment. He guessed that a player’s gear used to go in there twice a month. Now it’s twice a week.</p>
<p>“It takes 15 minutes,” he said. “It uses ultraviolet rays to disinfect everything.”</p>
<p>He said they have another machine that sprays to disinfect the locker room.</p>
<p>“But what the infectious disease doctors have told us that the spray and the wipes work best, so that’s getting done every day,” said Taglianetti, who has been spotted in a surgical mask and blue gloves at training camp. “We listen to experts and do what they say and try to do as much as we can on top of that.”</p>
<p>He added: “But we’ve also been told by many infectious disease doctors that just because you’re spraying something, it doesn’t mean it kills everything.”</p>
<p><strong>Eyes on the bubble</strong></p>
<p>From a logistical standpoint, the hub format brings even more uncertainty.</p>
<p>Taglianetti said that the equipment staff had a conference call with the NHL two weeks ago about what they can expect in Toronto, where a dozen teams will be sharing a building in Scotiabank Arena and playing three games a day.</p>
<p>“Every day since, things have been changing, evolving, growing,” he said.</p>
<p>On a typical road trip, the Penguins will often be able to set up the visiting locker room the day before a game. Worst-case scenario, they get in that morning. But Taglianetti said the Penguins were told they will get about three hours.</p>
<p>Game 1 of their qualifying round series against the Montreal Canadiens is Aug. 1 at 8 p.m. Two other teams will start playing four hours earlier on the same sheet of ice. After that game, the locker rooms must be disinfected before the Penguins and the Canadiens can move their many, many cases inside.</p>
<p>“So that’s a new wrinkle,” said Taglianetti, whose father Peter won Stanley Cups with the Penguins back in 1991 and 1992. “There’s definitely going to be a lot of moving parts in this scenario. I guess we’re going to see how it works out.”</p>
<p>It’s his understanding the Penguins will get a pair of permanent locker rooms at the Ford Performance Centre, the practice rink for the Maple Leafs. They’ll keep the equipment there and haul it over to Scotiabank Arena on game day.</p>
<p>The Penguins, whose three-man equipment team will include Paul DeFazio up in Toronto, aren’t alone in that regard. Every Eastern team, except maybe the Maple Leafs, will be dealing with the same headaches. But there is a fraternity of sorts among NHL equipment staffers. They keep in touch and share ideas.</p>
<p>Still, in an unprecedented situation for even their experienced staff, Taglianetti and Co. must be ready to change on the fly, just like the guys they outfit.</p>
<p>“We’re going to have to jump in and figure it all out pretty quickly,” he said.</p>
