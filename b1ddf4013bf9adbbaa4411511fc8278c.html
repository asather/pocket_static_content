<h1>Video: 'Jesus Christ Superstar' director comes from UK to check on tour in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Friday night was Timothy Sheader’s first time coming through the Fort Pitt Tunnel and seeing Pittsburgh’s spectacular opening scene, and there was another first in store the following day. The British director of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/01/01/Review-Cutting-edge-Jesus-Christ-Superstar-thrills-tour-Pittsburgh/stories/202001010155" target="_blank">“Jesus Christ Superstar” 50th anniversary tour</a>&nbsp;— that’s 50 years since the album debuted, before there was a stage show -—&nbsp;was in the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Downtown lobby, before Saturday’s matinee at the Benedum Center, when he held 1970 album in his hands for the first time.</p>
<p>Diana Roth, senior communications manager, brought a pristine copy of the vinyl record and accompanying notes of the Andrew Lloyd Webber-Tim Rice collaboration.&nbsp;Sheader’s own copy of the album that inspired his Olivier Award-winning production is a CD.</p>
<p>“It’s exquisite, isn’t it?,” he said of the album cover, with its classic font and circular angel graphic on a brown background.</p>
<p>Leafing through the notes, he stopped at the credits page and told of the day that Webber and Rice came to see his production in 2016, at its place of origin, the Regent’s Park Open Air Theatre in London. Rice volunteered to give an impromptu speech for the audience.</p>
<p>“He said it was a tribute to them,” Sheader said, pointing at a group of names and realizing that Rice had recited the five leading musicians from memory: Neil Hubbard, Henry McCullough, Chris Mercer, J. Peter Robinson, Bruce Rowland and Alan Spenner — all but Robinson were part of The Grease Band that had backed Joe Cocker, among other rock acts.</p>
<p>Sheader was in town to check on his show, the first time he has visited the tour since it opening in Austin, Texas, in October. He continues to tweak it, depending on the cast and other factors, after having moved it from an outdoor venue to a traveling show for North America’s regional showcases.</p>
<p>It is appropriate that this new version has finally touched down in Pittsburgh. Here’s how Steve Daly, writing a 1996 Entertainment Weekly “time capsule,” described the first coming of a very different “Jesus Christ Superstar”:</p>
<p>“Was Jesus bigger than the Beatles? It certainly seemed so on July 12, 1971, as 13,000 fans packed Pittsburgh’s Civic Arena to see Jesus in concert. Jesus, that is, as played by 21-year-old Jeff Fenholt, who shared the groovily pan-cultural spotlight with a black, beautiful Carl Anderson as Judas and the Hawaii-born Yvonne Elliman as Mary Magdalene.</p>
<p>“The visitation was the first ‘authorized’ enactment of ‘Jesus Christ Superstar,’ adapted from the LP that had rushed in where the Who’s messianic 1969 rock opera ‘Tommy’ dared to tread. ‘Superstar’ reinvented ‘J.C.; as the ultimate hippie rebel and became 1971’s No. 1 album, selling more than 2 million copies in 12 months.”</p>
<p>And now Sheader has reinvented the album yet again, as a commentary on celebrity culture, mob mentality and the ultimate fallen idol.</p>
<p>He sat down for a quick video interview before rushing off to the matinee on Saturday. The final performances in Pittsburgh are Sunday at 1 and 6:30 p.m.</p>
