<p>Pittsburgh City Council is clear: "Black Pittsburgh Matters.”</p>
<p>Council voted 8-0 Tuesday for a resolution that promises investment in the city’s Black communities that suffer from&nbsp;“concentrated intergenerational poverty.”</p>
<p>The legislation that outlines five&nbsp;“strategic investment principles” for putting money back into Pittsburgh’s Black communities was introduced by Councilmen Ricky Burgess and Daniel Lavelle in June following weeks of sustained national and local Black Lives Matter protests following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess’s office, in a press release Tuesday, claimed the legislation&nbsp;“makes Pittsburgh the first City in the nation to officially state that their Black citizens ... matter.”</p>
<p>The bill does not include a budget figure or enforcement mechanism.</p>

<p>The eight council members present also unanimously approved the creation of a new city commission&nbsp;“to advocate for equity for the LGBTQIA+ community in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>The 11-member commission will be tasked with conducting studies, serving as a community resource and reporting annually to City Council.</p>
<p>Councilwoman Deb Gross was absent.</p>
