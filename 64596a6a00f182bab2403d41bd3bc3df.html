<h1>USDA's Secretary Perdue visits Westmoreland County for Farmers to Families Food Box program distribution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue visited the Westmoreland Fairgrounds south of Greensburg on Wednesday morning, when the Westmoreland County Food Bank distributed its first 2,000 boxes from the federally funded Farmers to Families Food Box program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“This type of program, folks, is the best America has to offer,” said Mr. Perdue during opening remarks when he temporarily removed his American flag face mask. He said the “truck-to-trunk” distribution, staffed by scores of mask-wearing volunteers for mostly mask-wearing people in a line of hundreds of cars and trucks, embodied the USDA’s motto of&nbsp;“Do right and feed everyone.”</p>

<p>As part of the&nbsp;Coronavirus Food Assistance Program, the USDA is granting up to $3 billion dollars to food distributors to buy produce and agriculture products from farms and producers and give it to people who need it via nonprofits such as food banks. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/05/11/Farm-to-Table-Marburger-Monteverde-Paragon-Schneider-Turner-USDA-grant/stories/202005080086" target="_blank">In the first round of $1.2 billion in funding</a>, Pennsylvania distributors — including several in the Pittsburgh area —&nbsp;received more than $50 million to fill boxes&nbsp;with fresh fruit/fresh vegetables, or dairy products, or precooked pork and chicken, or fluid milk or a combination of the above. The boxes weigh about 21 to 24 pounds each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wednesday’s boxes of mixed dairy items were put together by Turner’s Dairy Farms of Penn Hills and produce boxes were provided by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Cooperative of Philadelphia, a regional produce distribution system for 23 Feeding America food banks from New England to Virginia. Turner’s received a grant of&nbsp;$315,450; MARC received $3,772,314.</p>
<p>Chuck Turner said he’s not considering his grant a “money maker,” but at a time business dropped by at least 25%, it has enabled him to keep all his employees working, to keep buying milk from 36 dairy farms in the region, and,&nbsp;“It’s helping to put some food on the tables of our neighbors who need some help right now.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Perdue, who had toured the Penn Hills dairy earlier, lauded the company for including items from other companies in its boxes, which included 2% as well as chocolate and chocolate-peanut butter milk; ricotta, cottage and Swiss cheese; even cheese curds. The produce boxes weren’t all exactly the same, but included onions, potatoes, yams, lettuce, apples and oranges, the last of which, of course, definitely aren’t local to this region. Volunteers threw in some bottled water.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is not throwaway food,” said Mr. Perdue. This is high-quality, first rate food ...”</p>
<p>Farmers to Families boxes were distributed last week in Butler County, at the Pittsburgh International Airport and at PPG Paints Arena by the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, working with Warrendale’s Paragon Wholesale Foods. That company received&nbsp;$3,816,000 in the USDA program, which is ongoing and can be extended in two-month increments for as long as through December. Those first boxes included apples from&nbsp;Dawson’s Orchards in Enon Valley, Lawrence County, and produce from other parts of the county, but the number of local farms participating is to increase as this late growing season starts to bear more fruit and vegetables.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Perdue agreed with Pennsylvania Farm Bureau President Rick Ebert, who introduced him, that Americans, including himself, have “learned a lot about the food supply chain over the past two months.” Pre-COVID-19 crisis, half of the country’s food was consumed outside of the home, at restaurants, schools and other institutions. When most of those places closed, farmers had to dump milk, plow under green beans and euthanize pigs that they couldn’t get to consumers.</p>
<p>People also realized,&nbsp;“It takes processors and packers to turn [farm goods] into products,” said Mr. Perdue, as he described how the Farmers to Families Food Box idea quickly came together to help farmers, distributors and consumers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking questions afterwards, Mr. Perdue told the Post-Gazette he is having his department look into how much money goes to distributors vs. how much goes to farmers, but said,&nbsp;“You’d be surprised at how little” most farmers tend to make.&nbsp;“Consumers today have become spoiled,” he said, expecting everything to be skinned, cut-up and otherwise processed and packaged so it can be prepared as easily and quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distributors in this program — those represented at the event also included Paragon, Monteverde’s and Farm to Table Buy Local — will be audited to&nbsp;ensure “they did what they said they would do,” he said, as grant extensions are considered with a bias towards underserved areas.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s recipients — they were greeted by last year’s fair queen, a sash-and-tiara-wearing Sarah DuBrul —&nbsp;expressed gratitude for the food, which some were picking up for people who are unable to drive themselves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re appreciative,” said Janet Durstine, who drove in from Mammoth to get some food with a friend with whom she volunteers at the food bank.&nbsp;“We love helping people who are poorer than us.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Westmoreland County Food Bank CEO Jennifer Miller was appreciative for being able to use the fairgrounds, with its big parking lot and a drive-through barn&nbsp;—&nbsp;“It’s made for it” — and&nbsp;said the next biweekly distribution there is set for June 8.
