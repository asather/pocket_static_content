<h1>Pittsburgh City Council approves five police reform bills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Tuesday approved <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/insight/2020/07/26/Thousands-of-feet-on-the-street-for-police-reform-Will-demands-be-met-in-Pittsburgh/stories/202007260012" target="_blank">Councilmen Ricky Burgess’s and Daniel Lavelle’s five police reform bills</a>, though not without lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>Two requirements on police will now be written into city code: a ban on chokeholds and other neck restraints as well as a requirement for officers to intervene upon witnessing&nbsp;“unreasonable force.”</p>
<p>Both garnered unanimous support from the nine council members present.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Police use-of-force procedures already ban neck restraints unless officers are “involved in a deadly force encounter.” Neck restraints were used five times last year, according to the bureau’s 2019 annual report.</p>
<p>Bureau officials say that its use-of-force manual is also being updated to&nbsp;“to ensure that it incorporates a clear statement related to a duty to intervene.”</p>
<p>Making the policies part of city code goes a step beyond the bureau’s procedural manual, which can change upon new leadership.</p>
<p>Despite all bills finally passing, some members said they could not reach a “comfort level” on bills related to a hiring freeze on police recruits, a prohibition on certain military equipment, and the funding of anti-violence programs.</p>
<p>In an 8-1 vote, council approved matching a percentage of the police budget to fund anti-violence and social services programs. The matching obligation will be 5% in 2021 and grow to 10% by 2026.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bureau’s 2019 budget was $114.8 million, the majority in salary obligations.</p>
<p>Members voted 6-3 to move $250,000 from the police recruit budget to the STOP the Violence fund, which will be dedicated to violence reduction and social services — though specific allocations will need further council approval.</p>
<p>The bill also requests that the mayor put a hiring freeze on new police recruits; Mr. Burgess assured members that the bill would not affect current recruits in training.</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith along with members Bruce Kraus and Anthony Coghill voted against the measure.</p>
<p>The three members also opposed Mr. Burgess’s bill to prohibit the bureau from acquiring or purchasing six specific types of equipment and weaponry from any source, including the U.S. Department of Defense.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The six categories are: weaponized aircraft; bayonets; crowd control devices containing the chemical chloroacetophenone, or CN; wooden batons for crowd control; military surplus weapons&nbsp;“not intentionally made for civilian law enforcement use”; or armored vehicles&nbsp;“not specifically designed for law enforcement use.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus said he’s concerned about the danger of a “citizenry that outguns our police departments and our constituencies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“However, and this is a big one, I will stand on my head to discuss and create sound policy as to when those weapons can be deployed,” he added.</p>
<p>The bureau is not in possession of any items defined in the legislation, and Department of Public Safety officials say police do not receive military surplus equipment and have not had any in its possession since 2007.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess said the new ordinance will not affect the city’s possession of the BEAR armored recovery vehicle, which was used at two mass since 2009: that year’s domestic dispute in Stanton Heights in which three responding officers were killed and several injured; and the 2018 Tree of Life synagogue massacre in which 11 worshipers were killed and several officers injured.</p>
<p>“We have gotten, I believe, a cross section of comments. We have gotten to where I think everybody’s comfortable, and this I think is a great step forward in our city, that we’re standing up and making this vote statement that Black lives do matter in the city,” Mr. Burgess said about the passage of the bills.&nbsp;</p>
