<h1>Beer festivals go on virtually, and a brew is back to fight ovarian cancer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Beer festivals continue to go virtual, including the self-proclaimed “world’s largest celebration of women in the brewing industry” — Beers With(out) Beards.</p>
<p>That Oct. 7-10 event is presented by Pittsburgh-based Hop Culture. Founder Kenny Gould says last year’s second festival in New York City counted more than 1,000 attendees, and that going online only&nbsp;“presents opportunities to reach more fans, support more businesses and celebrate more women than ever” — with as many as 2,500 participants from all over the world.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As was the case earlier this summer with Pittsburgh Fresh Fest Black beer festival, organizers are making available real beer to enjoy during the festival -— a&nbsp;Brewery Box shipped to homes in Pennsylvania and a few other states showcasing beer from 11 female-led breweries.&nbsp;The VIP Box with 11 beers and a glass is $60; a six-pack is $25. The beer comes with a digital pass to “attend,” available separately for $5. Glasses and other swag are available as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Events include a My Body, My Story body positivity art class in collaboration with Collective Arts and the artist Natalie Very B.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hop Culture marketing manager&nbsp;Grace Weitz, who developed this event out of her thesis for a food studies master’s degree at New York University, points out that Hershey, Pa., brewer Troegs is participating in the brewery box and programming with a session featuring the brewery’s label designer, Lindsey Tweed. It’s one several “add-on” programs for $10. Another is&nbsp;a Virtual Cooking Class with New Belgium and the Queer Food Foundation. Digital passes to the event are $5 and available at&nbsp;<a href="https://bwob20.squarespace.com/shop" target="_blank">https://bwob20.squarespace.com/shop</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Beer Fest2U</strong></p>
<p>Beverages2U.com — a home delivery arm of Brentwood Distributing — is holding its own virtual&nbsp;Beer Fest2U&nbsp;on Oct. 24. They’ll deliver beer for the event — a case of 24 Pennsylvania and national craft beers, with a portion of ticket sales going to local restaurant and bar workers hurt by COVID-19 via the Restaurant and Food Service Relief Fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admission with beer is $99; a “Party Pack” with four tasting sets is $396, and additional items such as snacks are available.&nbsp;The event — from 4 to 6 p.m., rolling into an after-party —&nbsp;will feature brewmasters and behind-the-scenes beer commentary as well as other guests and live music. It’s co-organized by Premier Connects, which, like Beverages2U, happens to be woman-run.</p>
<p>“We could all use a little laughter and&nbsp;fun right now,” says organizer Michelle Dangelo Arnoni.</p>

<p><strong>Drink to beat cancer</strong></p>
<p>Michael Fahy, currently brewing at home as Bad Moon Brewing, has again brewed a beer to benefit research on ovarian cancer, which in 2017 killed his wife, Darcel, at age 33.</p>
<p>Last year’s inaugural brew of a coffee milk stout called With You Always raised $19,439 for the Magee-Women’s Research Institute and Foundation.</p>
<p>For this Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, he again brewed at Whitehorse Brewing in Berlin, Somerset County, where he used to work.</p>
<p>Starting Friday, it’ll be available there and at at least a dozen other breweries and bars in the region, including Mike’s Beer Bar on Pittsburgh’s North Shore. Find the full list here: <a href="https://p2p.onecause.com/fahy/page/brewery" target="_blank">p2p.onecause.com/fahy/page/brewery</a>.</p>
<p>All proceeds will go to the Magee-Women's Research Institute and Foundation, which recently wrote about how one of its doctors beat advanced ovarian cancer thanks to clinical trials in which Darcel participated during her 7-year fight.</p>
<p>“Darcel always said if she could help just one person that it would make everything she ever had to go through worth it,” Mr. Fahy said.</p>
<p>COVID-19 is keeping him from holding a big party last year, but he hopes people will buy the beer where they can, as the “research is beyond important ... and successful.”</p>
<p>Donations can be made at <a href="https://p2p.onecause.com/fahy" target="_blank">p2p.onecause.com/fahy</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Distanced beer garden</strong></p>
<p>Hop Culture, De Fer Coffee and Tea and Cinderlands Beer are partnering on in a COVID-19 twist on a beer garden they’re calling&nbsp;“Lagerlands Socially Distanced Beer Garden.”</p>
<p>They’re taking online reservations for spaced-apart outdoor tables at the new Highline riverfront development off McKean Street on the South Side. Guests must reserve a spot for two hours for $5 per face, each of which must wear a mask when not drinking beer, cocktails or soft drinks or eating food from Burgh’ers (and you must order food to drink).</p>
<p>Your reservation deposit goes toward your tab. Kids and dogs are welcome. The venue opens Friday and is to be open on weekends through October: <a href="http://www.lagerlands.com" target="_blank">www.lagerlands.com.</a></p>
<p>Mike’s Beer Bar on the North Side is pouring local during “A Celebration of Pittsburgh Beer” all this month.</p>
<p>“We are dedicating all 80 of our taps to their fantastic beers, meads and ciders, and adding additional local bottles and cans to our coolers,” says owner Mike Sukitch.</p>
<p>The Federal Street establishment is adding more than 300 packaged brews to top last year, when it had more than 40 Pittsburgh breweries represented with 250 beers on tap during the month. Check out the menu at&nbsp;<a href="https://mikesbeerbar.com" target="_blank">mikesbeerbar.com</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual Oktoberfest</strong></p>
<p>At least one company is offering a guided virtual experience of Munich’s Oktoberfest on various dates this month for $19 per device per day.
