<p>Another WPIAL football game has been wiped out because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Freeport was set to host Valley on Friday, but the game has been postponed after a member of Freeport’s football staff tested positive, athletic director Shawn Stivenson confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>It marks the second game in as many days that has been postponed due to COVID-19. On Wednesday, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/09/30/Clairton-Bears-football-game-canceled-COVID-19-symptoms-city-school-district/stories/202009300217" target="_blank">Clairton announced</a> that it had postponed Saturday’s game at Bishop Canevin. Clairton released a statement saying that the decision was made “in response to several athletes showing symptoms that may be related to COVID-19.” Bishop Canevin will host Carrick instead.</p>
<p>There are now three games originally scheduled for this weekend that have been postponed, the other being Gateway at Latrobe. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/09/28/Gateway-football-COVID-19-WPIAL-PIAA-pittsburgh/stories/202009280090" target="_blank">Gateway will also not have any practices or games</a> until Oct. 7 after a player tested positive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each of the games postponed this week were conference games. The WPIAL football committee plans to meet next week to decide how to proceed with conference games postponed because of COVID-19 cases.</p>
