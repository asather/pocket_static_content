<h1>Fishing Report: Big cats caught in the rivers during the flathead prespawn</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) With water temperatures unseasonably cool, the early walleye bite remained slow. Day anglers found a few in 20-30 feet of water and by nighttime, resident walleye had moved to 5-15 feet. On Tuesday, one angler reported five ’eyes up to 30 inches taken while trolling from Walnut Creek to the Ohio line. Lake trout took diving plugs on The Mountain, and with bass harvest season opening June 13 smallmouth bass were taken in shallow water off North East. Medium panfish and smallmouths were caught in the bay off the State Street docks on the Presque Isle State Park shoreline.</p>
<p><strong>Pymatuning Reservoir</strong> (Crawford County) Crappies continued to be active off Jamestown and the northern bays. Stephen Wurst of Meadville reported eight crappies taken on the surface at dusk using a fly rod and black ant pattern.</p>
<p><strong>Conneaut Lake</strong> (Crawford County) Good panfish catches were reported on the lake’s north end.</p>
<p><strong>Woodcock Creek Lake</strong> (Crawford County) Sublegal muskellunge were caught as well as walleye and panfish.</p>
<p><strong>French Creek</strong> (Crawford County) With waters slightly high, anglers took smallmouths, walleye and Northern pike using soft plastics, spinners and jerk baits. A 32-inch Northern took a 4- to 5-inch shiner and was released.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) Hybrid striped bass chased alewife in shallow water at night near the boat launches. Anglers had hookups on live alewife rigs and shiny stick baits.</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Beaver County) A 41.2-pound flathead that went for cut bait at night was released by Jesse St. Espri of Ambridge. Fred Gough of Lisbon, Ohio, caught and released an Atlantic eel near the Beaver River confluence. Another eel was caught two weeks ago on the Allegheny River.</p>
<p><strong>North Park Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Rainbow trout went for salmon eggs and red worms.</p>
<p><strong>Carnegie Lake</strong> (Allegheny County) Despite stockings of channel catfish, bluegill and largemouth bass fingerlings, aquatic weed growth hampered fishing. A weekly fishing program sponsored by the Let’s Go Fishing group was postponed until July as a COVID-19 precaution</p>
<p><strong>Ohio River</strong> (Allegheny County) Debbi Lynn of Hopewell and Issac Dugan of Bridgwater were night fishing off the Point last week when they found waters teaming with flatheads. Several were caught. Using cut trout as bait, Ms. Lynn boated one catfish weighing 37 pounds, 4 ounces.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Allegheny County) While night fishing Downtown, Joe Granata of Monaca boated a 43-pound, 9-ounce flathead and released it. The launch of Venture Outdoors’ annual TriAnglers fishing program was postponed as a COVID-19 precaution. The free Wednesday lunchtime activity is expected to open soon.</p>
<p><strong>Youghiogheny River Lake</strong> (Fayette/Somerset counties) Anglers reported good catches of walleye and channel catfish.</p>
<p><strong>Quemahoning Reservoir</strong> (Somerset County) A few walleye were taken, but many anglers caught Northern pike.</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Hill Lake</strong> (Somerset County) Trout were still hitting well</p>
<p><em>Correction: Chuckie Russell of Beaver County caught and released at 50-pound, 13-ounce flathead on the Ohio River in Beaver County on May 21. Last week’s Fishing Report listed an incorrect body of water.</em></p>
