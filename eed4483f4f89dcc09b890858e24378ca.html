<h1>3 protesters charged in clash with diners in Downtown Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three people protesting racial injustice have been charged in connection with a confrontation with diners earlier this month in Downtown Pittsburgh in which the protesters were seen yelling and breaking a glass.</p>
<p>The Sept. 5 incident outside Sienna Mercato restaurant on Penn Avenue — which started as a peaceful protest and march —&nbsp;was captured on videos that went viral on social media.</p>
<p>Monique&nbsp;‘Nique’ Craft, 35, of the South Side; Kenneth McDowell, 33, of the North Side; and Shawn Green, 24, who also goes by the name of Lorenzo Rulli and is considered homeless according to police, were charged with multiple misdemeanors Monday.&nbsp;Craft,&nbsp;who identifies as nonbinary,&nbsp;is charged by summons with theft, conspiracy and simple trespass; Mr. McDowell is charged with&nbsp;possessing instruments of crime, conspiracy, harassment and two counts of disorderly conduct; and Mr. Green faces charges of disorderly conduct, conspiracy, criminal mischief and simple trespass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police issued arrest warrants for Mr. McDowell and Mr. Green, a criminal complaint states, because their appearance in court is “not guaranteed.” A preliminary hearing for Craft is scheduled for Nov. 3 at City Court in Downtown, according to court records.</p>
<p>The trio&nbsp;engaged in a course of disorderly conduct from the McDonald's at 500 Liberty Avenue to the Sienna Mercato restaurant&nbsp;on Penn Avenue, police said in the criminal complaint. They used a megaphone and offensive language in an attempt to cause violence among patrons, police said. They also harassed bicyclists to the point that they had to defend themselves, the complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The videos, which have been viewed millions of times on Facebook and Twitter, showed anti-racism protesters shouting profanities at diners at the restaurant.&nbsp;In the footage, some people who are eating outside begin to leave their tables.</p>
<p>Police said Craft approaches a table and drinks a diner’s beverage.&nbsp;A pair of patrons look on as the beer is consumed, and Craft sets the beer back on the table.</p>
<p>Another protester approaches and swipes a glass off a table, causing it to shatter on the ground.</p>
<p>Another video shows a protester — identified later in court paperwork as Mr. McDowell —&nbsp;yelling through a megaphone at a man holding a bicycle. The bicyclist smacks the megaphone, and another protester hits the bicyclist in the head with a skateboard. It is not clear from the video what started the confrontation.</p>
<p><em><strong>Warning to our readers:</strong> The footage in these two videos contains violence and graphic language.</em></p>

<p>Craft said the videos show only one side of the story and that there were three men from outside the protest who were screaming “Blue lives matter” — in support of police —&nbsp;at the protesters. When some protesters began to confront them, one man began swinging a bike at people.</p>
<p>According to Craft’s account, a man began grabbing Craft’s hair and placed his hand on Craft’s chest, saying he was trying to stop her from engaging with another man.</p>
<p>When the confrontation ended, Craft said, a man in the restaurant began condemning the protesters’ actions. The woman who was with him offered Craft to come over, have a beer and talk about the situation.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump weighed in on the incidents several days later, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/09/08/Trump-tweet-reaction-viral-video-pittsburgh-protesters-diners/stories/202009080069" target="_blank">publicly calling the protesters&nbsp;“thugs.”</a></p>
<p>In a pair of tweets, Mr. Trump said the protesters’ actions were “disgraceful.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Black Lives Matter] Protesters horribly harass elderly Pittsburgh diners, scaring them with loud taunts while taking their food right off their plate,” Mr. Trump wrote in one tweet. “These Anarchists, not protesters, are [Joe] Biden voters, but he has no control and nothing to say. Disgraceful. Never seen anything like it. Thugs!”</p>
