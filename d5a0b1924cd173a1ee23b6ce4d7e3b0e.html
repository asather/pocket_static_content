<h1>Largest of Pa. state-owned universities shifts fall instruction to online amid COVID-19 spike</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>West Chester University, largest of Pennsylvania's 14 state-owned universities, on Friday became the first public four-year campus in the Commonwealth to switch fall instruction plans to online amid a spike in COVID-19 cases nationally.</p>
<p>It is a major shift for the university with nearly 18,000 students in suburban Philadelphia. West Chester had prepared for mix of in-person and remote learning, and its president, Christopher Fiorentino, notified the campus of its decision in a message.</p>
<p>He pointed to a significant spike in the virus, with more than 3 million cases nationally as of this week, including 60,000 new cases in one day, and hot spots in more than 40 states.</p>
<p>"WCU cannot ignore the potential danger of bringing thousands back to campus. Accordingly, our plans for the fall semester must adjust to this new reality,” he said.</p>
<p>"My leadership team and I have made the decision to continue remote learning through the fall 2020 semester, with a few courses delivered in a hybrid format, meaning both in-person and remote, in order to assist those students with clinical placements, student teaching, performance obligations, internship sites, and similar academic responsibilities."</p>
<p>State System universities and other public and private campuses generally have moved toward reopening this fall — many in recent weeks announcing hybrid approaches that would cut classroom sizes to promote social distancing, reduce dorm occupancy and limit public gatherings.</p>
<p>They have done so trying to balance health worries with students' preference for a residential campus experience.</p>
<p>Asked about the potential impact for other State System universities, spokesman David Pidgeon in Harrisburg said, "At this point, I'm only aware of West Chester's choice to to go remote.’’</p>
<p>The system issued a statement Friday afternoon that read in part:</p>
<p>“The State System believes university presidents and their leadership teams know their local campuses best. We support the decision by the leadership team at West Chester University to update its reopening plan because it makes sense for West Chester.”</p>
<p>About 96,000 students attend the State System campuses, which include California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slipppery Rock universities in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Fiorentino said Chester County is in a green phase of the state’s reopening plan, so&nbsp;“our public buildings will be open and will be limited to 50% capacity.</p>
<p>“This means that Sykes Student Union, the Campus Recreation Center, FHG Library, and several other buildings will be open for use and are currently being readied in ways that will foster and promote active social distancing.”</p>
