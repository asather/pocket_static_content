<p>Christian Elijah Moore, 30, formerly of Elliott, was indicted by a federal grand jury in 2017 for three felonies, including armed robbery and possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.</p>
<p>He was sentenced on two counts in the Western District of Pennsylvania by Chief United States District Court Judge Mark R. Hornak.</p>
<p>On Sept. 5, 2017, Moore walked into the First National Bank at 116 W. Eighth Ave., asked for change and then handed the teller a note, demanding more cash, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. The teller gave more $1,055, along with a GPS tracking device.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police were able to locate Moore in a jitney in Hazelwood. He was carrying a loaded&nbsp;Kel-Tec semi-automatic .9mm pistol, as well as the money and tracking device, according to the U.S. attorney’s office. Police also located an Adidas jacket he discarded near the bank after the robbery.</p>
<p>Upon his release from prison, Moore&nbsp;will also face three years of supervision.</p>
