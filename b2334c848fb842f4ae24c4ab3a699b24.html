<h1>Pittsburgh's women's sports teams gather for evening of recognition and support</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It seemed like a missed opportunity for Pittsburgh’s second annual Girls and Women in Sports Event to be held Thursday instead of Wednesday, which happened to be National Girls and Women in Sports Day.</p>
<p>There was a simple reason for that: They couldn’t book the gym at the Thelma Lovette YMCA in the Hill District on Feb. 5, according to Jordan Daloisio, event organizer and general manager of the <a href="https://www.hotspurs-soccer.com/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Hotspurs</a> women’s soccer club.</p>
<p>Instead of finding that minor setback problematic, Daloisio chose to see it as serendipitous.</p>
<p>“I think it’s fitting because I don’t want it to be just one day,” she said. “I want it to be every day of the year that we’re celebrating these things.”</p>
<p>At least for one night, a number of Pittsburgh’s women’s sports organizations came together in a display of solidarity and, arguably just as importantly, recognition of each group’s efforts to make a name for themselves in the Steel City.</p>
<p>The teams on hand included the Hotspurs, <a href="https://pittsburghpassion.com/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Passion</a> (football), <a href="https://www.pghpuffins.com/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Puffins</a> (hockey), <a href="https://www.pittsburghgaa.com/banshees" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Banshees</a> (women’s <a href="http://usgaa.org/gaelic-football/" target="_blank">gaelic football</a>), <a href="https://pittsburgh-ultimate.org/" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Ultimate</a> (ultimate frisbee), <a href="https://pghrugby.com/womens-club" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Forge</a> (rugby) and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/SteelCityRollerDerby/" target="_blank">Steel City Roller Derby</a>.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of amazing women’s sports in Pittsburgh, and we’re all in isolation,” said Banshees player Maureen Copeland. “So to be able to bring everyone together and just meet each other and see that we exist and can support each other is an awesome idea.”</p>
<p>That was Daloisio and Steel City FC founder Stephanie Harrison’s objective when they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2019/02/07/National-Girls-and-Women-in-Sports-Day-Pittsburgh-event-2019/stories/201902070130" target="_blank">launched this event</a> last year. They realized that these teams were only vaguely aware of each other and could use an opportunity to interact, brainstorm areas for growth and just hang out as sisters in sport.</p>
<p>“I had heard of the Passion and all the other women’s sports teams in the city,” Daloisio said. “I was like, we should be advocating for each other and supporting each other and banding together. There needs to be something. ... This was a day specific to what we do and what women from our area bring to the table.”</p>
<p>In addition to celebrating this city’s women’s sports community, it was also a chance to bring up deeper issues in terms of getting girls of all ages involved in sports.</p>
<p>“Loving sports and athleticism is not something that’s gendered,” said Maria Rose, director of MC1R, a group for rock climbers of color at the <a href="https://www.ascendclimbing.com/" target="_blank">South Side’s ASCEND</a> climbing gym. “But I think the spaces for joining competitive teams are not always accessible, not only across gender lines but across racial lines. ... I think women of color more than just women or people of color have a harder time sometimes just because it’s across those lines.”</p>
<p>The second half of the event involved a panel discussion with representatives of each team where they discussed hurdles like these that every organization faces. One panelist was Chelsea Zahn, a Passion defensive end from 2015-17 and currently a partnership activation manager with the Steelers.</p>
<p>She said that when it comes to competing with the city’s more high-profile sports franchises, “word of mouth is everything in women’s sports.” That includes establishing a strong social media presence and learning how to get coverage from local media.</p>
<p>“Whatever your teams can do to build those relationships are extremely helpful in getting exposure here in Pittsburgh and competing with those professional sports and college sports that have all the money in the world to promote their sports,” Zahn said.</p>
<p>That advice jives well with the ultimate goals of the Girls and Women in Sports Event: for these teams to build a relationship with the city and each other.</p>
<p>“I would encourage everybody to pick their favorite sport and try to support it with women’s sports,” said Ebony Montgomery, panel host and the Passion’s starting quarterback. “Give it a try, go watch a game or two and follow all your local sports teams.</p>
<p>“It’s a great town as far as being sports fans. Why not support women, as well?”</p>
