<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stores across the nation have been hit hard by the economic fallout surrounding the coronavirus pandemic, but some have been hit worse than others.</p>
<p>J. Crew, the clothing company, is preparing to file for bankruptcy, with CNBC reporting that it could come as soon as this weekend.</p>
<p>J. Crew declined to comment on CNBC’s report.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The company is going to work to have $400 million to continue funding operations during the bankruptcy, CNBC added.</p>
<p>According to the report, J. Crew came into the year already struggling with debt and losing customers. CNBC also noted in its article that other similar retail brands like J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus have also felt added strain from the pandemic on top of already coming into the year with prior financial woes.</p>
<p>The company had made $2.5 billion in sales in the year ending on Feb. 1, the article attributed to Moody’s, also noting that it had $93 million in liquidity in February.</p>
<p>CNBC did add that stores like J. Crew could fare through the pandemic better than other brands as they are not forced to use department stores or other third parties to sell their clothing line, instead having the option to sell online directly to customers.</p>
