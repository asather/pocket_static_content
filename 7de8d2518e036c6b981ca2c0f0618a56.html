<h1>Take Five with Patricia Sheridan and ... Steven Knapp</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steven Knapp, who became president of the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh in February, taught English and was president of George Washington University for 10 years. Then he stepped down to return to teaching English literature on the campus&nbsp;in Washington D.C.&nbsp;He says he fell in love with Pittsburgh when he came in 2017 for a basketball tournament as chairman of the Atlantic 10 Presidents Council. The museums open to the public on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>How did you end up taking over the Carnegie museums?</strong></p>
<p>I was&nbsp;approached over the summer [of 2019]. These roles are always a challenge because you have to come and learn&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;about a new institution, but I can tell you what the attractions were for&nbsp;me.&nbsp;&nbsp;First, the more I learned about these four&nbsp;museums&nbsp;the more impressed I became about the quality of the programing, the extraordinary depth of the collections. But also a lot of it had to do with Pittsburgh. There is a tremendous amount of affection and support for the arts and cultural institutions for a city of this size. The thing that really struck my wife [Diane] and I when we visited Pittsburgh in 2017 was how friendly everybody was. It’s a very friendly city. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Your ideas for moving the&nbsp;museums&nbsp;forward?</strong></p>
<p>Strategic&nbsp;partnerships with other institutions —&nbsp;taking highly independent, autonomous institutions such as the multiple universities and museums and making the whole greater than the sum of the parts. &nbsp;It is something I am used to doing as a provost and as a president. I didn’t expect to be doing quite as much of that when I first arrived. It became necessary when the&nbsp;COVID-19 crisis struck. I ended up after being here only six weeks having to close the&nbsp;museums&nbsp;I had just joined. We kept doing online programing but our doors were closed to the public.</p>
<p>Lizzie Barker [director of The Frick Pittsburgh], Mitch Swain of the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and I convened 50 institutions to discuss reopening and other issues. We broke the work up into five teams. One focused on facilities, one on visitors, one on staff and volunteers, one on communication and one on equity and inclusion. The final one is an important part of the picture because we realize we need to connect more strongly with minority communities and communities of color in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>What are your concerns about reopening the&nbsp;museums?</strong></p>
<p>We reopen first to members Friday and then to the public Monday. We will have been closed 15 weeks. As painful as it was to close, it is more complicated figuring out how to reopen. An incredible amount of planning goes into that. &nbsp;How do you handle cleaning? How do you handle distancing? What do you do with elevators? What do you do with bathrooms? All those questions had to be considered and we think we got it.</p>
<p>We have followed what is happening nationally and talked to other&nbsp;museums&nbsp;across the country. &nbsp;Even though the&nbsp;governor&nbsp;allows museums to have 50 percent capacity, we are going to&nbsp;be&nbsp;more conservative and allow 25 percent of the buildings’ capacity. &nbsp;We will have carefully timed tickets and be monitoring the flow of people. Fortunately, we enjoy a large space so it makes it easier.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Where did you spend the lockdown?</strong></p>
<p>We have a&nbsp;townhouse at Forbes Terrace [in Squirrel Hill], which is going to be our permanent Pittsburgh residence.&nbsp; We have a farm in Sparks, Md., 15 miles south of the Pennsylvania boarder. It’s a sheep farm and we just started&nbsp;keeping bees. [laughs]&nbsp; My daughter lives next door to the farm with our four grandchildren. We were in an apartment when things started to close down. March 14th, when the museums closed, I drove down to the farm and spent most of the closure down there because I have an office there I could use.&nbsp; We came up [last week] to set up the townhouse.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You are a conga player?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>I have been a drummer pretty much all my life. When I was in high school, I thought I was going to be a professional musician. &nbsp;I had auditioned and gotten into the Indiana University School of Music, which at the the time had the best percussion program. &nbsp;At the last minute, I ended up going to Yale. I still did a lot of music there. I was in rock and jazz groups and the New Haven Symphony Orchestra and Yale Symphony Orchestra. I do have an interest in world music and hand percussion in particular.</p>
<p>Two highlights from my time at George Washington was when I was able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Taz161cuy4" target="_blank">go up on stage</a> with Earth, Wind and Fire. That was a lot of fun! But the one that mattered most to the staff at George Washington is when Chuck Brown, the Godfather of Go-Go music, gave a concert and I did a solo with him. Go-go&nbsp;originated in Washington D.C. It is a fusion of funk and calypso. He died a few years ago but that was a really unique event. My favorite part of the whole thing was afterwards he came up to me and said,&nbsp;“Man, you are a great percussionist. I haven’t seen hands that fast since my calypso days.” &nbsp;I tell everybody that is what I want on my tombstone. [laughs]</p>
