<h1>Police seek person who released bedbugs in Erie Walmart store</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Someone appears to have deliberately tried to release bedbugs in a Walmart store in Erie County, and police are searching for whoever was behind it, authorities said Monday.</p>
<p>Troopers have made no arrests and do not have any suspects, said Trooper Cindy Schic, a state police spokeswoman.</p>
<p>A manager from the Walmart store in Edinboro contacted police Saturday after store employees found pill bottles with bugs in them.</p>
<p>Some elements of the story, including whether the bugs were alive, are in dispute.</p>
<p>It started Thursday, when store staff found a closed pill bottle containing live bugs, authorities said. The bottle was found in a boy’s jacket for sale in the clothing department and thrown out in the trash, police said. A day later, a hygiene services contractor contacted by Walmart found bugs crawling in the men’s fitting room and identified them as bedbugs, police said.</p>
<p>However, a Walmart spokeswoman contended Monday that the contractor, Ecolab, told Walmart that it had found no live bugs.</p>
<p>On Saturday, a store worker found a second pill bottle on the floor of the men’s department. It was closed and contained several dead bugs, police said.</p>
<p>Troopers were testing for fingerprints on the bottle while store officials were reviewing surveillance video, police said. Walmart said it was taking the matter seriously, including cooperating with police</p>
<p>A Walmart spokeswoman said she did not know whether the store had had to throw away any merchandise.</p>
<p>Any criminal charge would be disorderly conduct stemming from public inconvenience, annoyance and alarm, a misdemeanor, Trooper Schic said.</p>
<p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say bedbugs live off the blood of people and animals, and can hide for long periods of time, even without a meal. They are usually transported by travelers, stowing away in luggage and clothes and otherwise hiding in bedding and furniture, the agency says.</p>
