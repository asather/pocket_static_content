<h1>Beaver County man gets prison for abusing patients at care facility</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beaver County man will spend at least 10 years in prison for abusing special needs patients in his care.</p>
<p>Zachary Dinell, 26, pleaded guilty to 29 counts in February, including 13 counts of neglect of a care-dependent person; 14 counts of invasion of privacy; endangering the welfare of children; and criminal use of a communication facility.</p>
<p>He was sentenced Monday by Beaver County Common Pleas Judge Dale M. Fouse.</p>
<p>Dinell was fired from his position at McGuire Memorial in Daugherty after the allegations against him came to light. The facility, a ministry of the Felician Sisters of North America, has served people with physical and developmental disabilities since 1963.</p>
<p>Dinell was accused of assaulting residents, taking photos and videos of them nude; punching and kicking them; throwing objects at their heads; rubbing unknown substances in their eyes; and choking a patient.</p>
<p>An affidavit of probable cause for the initial charges in the case said police found “obscene and pornographic images” of people with mental and physical disabilities on Dinell’s phone.</p>
<p>Police said the defendant also sent a picture of a nude 19-year-old patient to a co-worker via Snapchat.</p>
<p>Another former caretaker also has been charged. Tyler Smith, 30, of Cranberry, is scheduled for a pretrial conference on July 6 with Judge Kim Tesla.</p>
<p>The patients, who all have special needs, were non-communicative, said Beaver County District Attorney David Lozier.</p>
<p>He would not release any of the victim-impact statements that were prepared for the sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>In addition to the 10- to 31-year prison term, Dinell must also undergo sex offender treatment and register for the rest of his life as a sex offender.</p>
