<h1>Pa.'s senators widely divided on Barrett appointment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania’s two U.S. senators marked the nomination of late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s successor on Saturday with polar-opposite statements.</p>
<p>Republican Pat Toomey, a member of the GOP caucus in the Senate that expects to lead the confirmation of President Donald Trump’s appointee, Judge Amy Coney Barrett, said he supported the judge’s confirmation to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 because of her “intellect, strong legal credentials and impeccable character.”</p>
<p>“These same attributes will serve her well on the nation’s highest court,” Mr. Toomey said. “As a working mother with young children, Judge Barrett would also bring to the Supreme Court a background that will add to its diversity.”</p>
<p>Noting that he thinks Judge Barrett has shown her commitment to the “proper role of a judge” and that she has shown “not to decide cases based on a preferred policy or outcome,” Mr. Toomey said he will review her record further in the coming weeks and speak to her soon.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, a Democrat, criticized the president and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for “rushing” to confirm a nominee who he said will “back their lawsuit to destroy the Affordable Care Act, kicking 23 million people off their health insurance, ending protections for 135 million people with preexisting conditions and raising costs for millions more, in the middle of a pandemic.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said the right thing to do would be for the winner of the November election to nominate Justice Ginsburg’s successor. Republicans struck a similar tone in 2016 when President Barack Obama, a Democrat, nominated Merrick Garland, insisting that confirming a justice in an election year would rob voters of having a say.</p>
<p>“I cannot support a Supreme Court nominee who would rip health care away from tens of millions, undermine the rights of workers and do the bidding of large corporations,” Mr. Casey said, claiming that Judge Barrett has an “extreme judicial philosophy.”</p>
