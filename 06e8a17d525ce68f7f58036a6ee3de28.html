<h1>Miss Manners: Mother-in-law throws feet into her chicken soup</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> My mother-in-law isn't originally from this country, and loves to make chicken soup for me. She is a dear, sweet woman, and I do not want to offend her in any way. However, there is the matter of the ingredients.</p>
<p>There is the chicken, of course; some celery, just a few tomatoes and lots of noodles that she makes herself. But, to her, it isn't quite chicken soup without the chicken's feet.&nbsp;I can get past the gizzard and the heart, since they settle to the bottom of the bowl. But at least one of the feet always ends up in my bowl, and, in case you did not know this, they float.</p>
<p>Again, I can still eat the soup. It is always delicious. However, I spend half my time trying to push the foot back to the bottom of the bowl, and the silly thing is right back up on the top by the time I get even one spoonful to my mouth. Any thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER</strong>: Learn to perfect slipping them out of your soup and into a handkerchief unnoticed. This may mean that you end up with a pocketful of chicken feet. But that is still be better than a mouthful.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS</strong>: What is the proper etiquette when meeting a client or business colleague for a coffee business meeting? It's my belief that etiquette dictates waiting for all parties to arrive before going to the counter and placing an order.</p>
<p>However, on more than one occasion, I've arrived on time to a meeting to find that the other party has arrived early, ordered and is sipping their coffee. Now I feel awkward, and must choose between going to the counter to order my own beverage while forcing them to wait for me to start the meeting, or forgo a coffee and force them to sip in solitude.</p>
<p>What is the correct thing to do in both scenarios? Am I to arrive early and order before the scheduled meeting start time, or wait for all parties to arrive before ordering? What am I to do if I arrive on time and the other party has already ordered?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER</strong>: It is almost impossible to meet in a coffee shop at the exact same time as another party. There is always that awkward moment where you go in to see if the other party is there, and in doing so, find yourself inevitably herded to the counter being asked for your order.</p>
<p>Taking up table space without a purchase is also not an option, particularly now when social distancing makes seating rare. Miss Manners agrees that meeting outside at the appointed time is the best option. She suggests that from now on, you make that clear when setting up appointments. Or stick to videoconferencing, where others can bring their own beverages â€”&nbsp;as long as it is suitably prepared before the meeting starts.</p>
