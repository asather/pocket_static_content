<h1>Depression-era unemployment program confronts a different crisis with a different workforce</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Early in the Great Depression,&nbsp;William Erastus Upjohn, a pharmaceutical baron in Michigan, established a novel experiment: a 1,200-acre farming cooperative for unemployed people to work for a decent wage and grow their own food to get back on their feet.</p>
<p>Three years later, in 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt created a federal program to provide cash directly to laid-off Americans, part of a New Deal package of sweeping social programs that supplanted Upjohn’s humble farm.&nbsp;The system to provide cash stuck, and it has responded reliably to national economic shocks for the last 85 years, economists and labor experts said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet the COVID-19 pandemic — which has thrown millions of Americans out of work in a matter of a few weeks — is challenging some of the founding principles of the modern unemployment system like never before.</p>
<p>“It’s primarily intended to cover people who are working full-time, who have some significant work history and are really attached to the labor force,”&nbsp;Susan N. Houseman,&nbsp;vice president and director of research at the W.E. Upjohn Institute for Employment Research in Kalamazoo, Mich.&nbsp;“This is all baked into eligibility criteria.”</p>
<p>The institute was founded in 1945 as a way to further Upjohn’s mission of sussing out the best method to help everyone during a crisis. Ms. Houseman said the unemployment system built in the Great Depression did not foresee the rise of a workforce of independent contractors whose incomes depend on digital platforms like Uber, Airbnb, TaskRabbit and other online gigs.</p>
<p>“They’re relying on other businesses or customers for their jobs,” Ms. Houseman said. “I think the current recession’s going to underscore the need for figuring out some kind of insurance program for them.”</p>
<p>The system also did not anticipate an economic collapse precipitated by a health crisis. Ms. Houseman said changes to the unemployment system could be married with the creation of other social insurance programs like paid sick leave, which President Donald Trump has endorsed but Congress has disagreed on how to pay for.</p>
<p>“This is a window of opportunity,” she said. “People are now thinking about these kinds of programs.”</p>
<p>The coming weeks are likely to leave a lasting mark on a system that historically few Americans have been forced to consider until recently.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Until last month, about 1.7 million people were enrolled in unemployment insurance at any given time over the last year. New weekly claims reliably hovered near 210,000, with roughly the same number of people leaving the rolls each week.</p>
<p>New&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf" target="_blank">data released last Thursday</a> showed nearly 17 million people have filed initial claims over the last three weeks — more than 10% of American workers, according to the U.S. Department of Labor.</p>
<p>Economists pegged the current unemployment rate at 12%, already higher than the peak of 10% unemployment during the 2008 financial crisis. (The official federal figures are monthly, due out in early May.)</p>
<p>Future estimates have been daunting. An economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis projected <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2020/march/back-envelope-estimates-next-quarters-unemployment-rate" target="_blank">unemployment could rise to 32%</a> for the second quarter of the year, eclipsing the Great Depression’s peak unemployment of 25%.</p>
<p>U.S. officials have expressed hope that the current situation, though painful, will be shorter than previous downturns.&nbsp;In a statement last week, Labor Secretary Eugene Scalia&nbsp;said the soaring unemployment numbers “reflect the purposeful sacrifice being made by America’s workers and their families to slow the spread of the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>Congress temporarily expanded unemployment benefits to include independent contractors and those without sufficient work history.&nbsp;Lawmakers also boosted benefits by $600 a week —&nbsp;a provision that almost derailed the $2.3 trillion rescue package when some Republican senators pointed out low-wage workers could earn more than their total wages from unemployment pay.</p>
<p><strong>Spurring reforms</strong></p>
<p>The temporary nature of the COVID-19 recession should spur some broader reforms, unemployment experts discussed during a webcast <a href="/" target="_blank">broadcast earlier this month</a> by the Brookings Institution in Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The federal system should encourage employers to reduce hours of its entire workforce, as an alternative to laying off workers, according to Katharine Abraham, director of the Maryland Center for Economics and Policy at the University of Maryland.&nbsp;Under that model, all employees would continue to earn a reduced paycheck while receiving unemployment benefits for the hours that were shaved off, she added.</p>
<p>Such a program, called work-sharing, is available in Pennsylvania and about two dozen other states.</p>
<p>Heading into a temporary downturn, “there’s a lot of value in preserving the relationship between employers and employees,” Ms. Abraham said “It makes sense to encourage them to share the work and keep people on the payroll in a reduced schedule, rather than keeping some on and others off.”</p>
<p>This hybrid employment model could make economic recovery significantly faster. Even temporary layoffs can lead to permanent separation over a few months, said&nbsp;Ryan Nunn, a policy director with Brookings.</p>
<p>“I think we can mitigate the economic disruptions caused by this crisis if we manage to largely preserve that network of employment relationships that existed before the pandemic,” Mr. Nunn said.</p>
<p>Any nationwide reform could roll out unevenly, as each state has wide discretion in managing their own system, Ms. Houseman said.</p>
<p>Even with the recently expanded benefits, “Are there people who are still left out? Yeah, there probably are,” she said. “Especially people who are working below whatever hours or earnings threshold the state requires.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s unemployment offices have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/corona2020/2020/03/26/COVID-19-jobless-claims-surge-in-Pennsylvania/stories/202003260135?cid=search" target="_blank">faced hundreds of thousands</a> of initial applications at a time the statewide system has faced delays in&nbsp;upgrades to the computer system it uses for unemployment claims. And two call centers were shuttered by Gov. Tom Wolf in 2017 after Republicans decided not to approve funding for their operation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last Wednesday, Senate Democrats pressed the Trump administration to provide more resources to the states. The 35 senators, including Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the Labor Department&nbsp;needs to provide states more guidance, quicker funding and technological support.</p>
<p>“Americans who have lost their jobs don’t have time to wait for a check,” they wrote. “People need unemployment compensation now so that they can buy groceries, pay rent, and keep up on their bills.”</p>
