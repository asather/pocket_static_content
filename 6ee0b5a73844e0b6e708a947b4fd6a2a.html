<h1>Levin Furniture coming back 'at select locations'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Levin, whose family name has adorned Pittsburgh-area&nbsp;furniture stores for 100 years, said Tuesday he expects to reacquire&nbsp;“select locations” and revive the chain in coming weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin had sold the company to Art Van Furniture, LLC in 2017 but the new owner filed for bankruptcy in March, putting hundreds of Levin employee jobs in jeopardy and leaving customers who’d purchased or made deposits on undelivered furniture in the lurch.</p>
<p>He said he has reached agreement to acquire an as-yet undetermined number of stories with the bankruptcy trustee and lender, and now only needs the bankruptcy judge to sign off on the deal.</p>
<p>A competing bidder has acquired some Levin store locations, but Mr. Levin said he is trying to regain as many stores in Pennsylvania and Ohio as he can, including&nbsp;“at least four Pittsburgh locations.</p>
<p>“My goals have always been to protect as many jobs as possible for Levin associates, and to continue to serve our loyal customers,” he said Tuesday.&nbsp;“Today’s agreement is the first step in accomplishing those goals.”</p>
<p>Two months ago, before Art Van filed for bankruptcy, Mr. Levin thought he had a deal to buy back the Levin stores as well as some of the Johnstown-based Wolf Furniture locations. But the deal broke down after the COVID-19 pandemic forced stores to close, shutting off revenue to keep the stores open.</p>
<p>Mr. Levin said he intends&nbsp;“to help those customers who have been unable to get refunds” although it is not clear yet what will happen with those who made purchases at stores he is unable to reacquire.</p>
