<h1>Paul Zeise: No fans allowed at high school games? Talk about a double standard</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The PIAA, as expected, voted Friday afternoon to go forward with plans to allow member schools across the state to decide if they want to participate in fall sports. The league went against the recommendation of Gov. Tom Wolf and his health czar Dr. Rachel Levine, as both said they would prefer all high school sports be canceled until January.</p>
<p>That was the easy part, and the PIAA is to be commended for doing the right thing and giving it a try. There are obviously risks to it and there is still a good chance they could all get canceled if there is an outbreak of any kind. But as PIAA director Bob Lombardi said last week, “the only wrong decision is not to try.”</p>
<p>Lombardi and the PIAA are right — there is no reason to cancel sports or activities of any kind at this point. These leagues should let it all play out and see what happens. Surely there would come a point when it would be painfully obvious there is no path forward, but we aren’t there yet.</p>
<p>The hard part of the equation came when Lombardi and officials in counties and districts all across the state tried to explain the rules with regards to how many people are allowed in the stadium. It is based on county and state guidelines, and given how hypocritical and seemingly arbitrary those are, who knows what everythingis going to look like.</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, for instance, there is a rule that allows for only 50 or fewer people gatherings outside. It is pretty clear you can’t play many team sports, especially at bigger schools, if only 50 people total are allowed to be in the stadium.</p>
<p>For example, the North Allegheny football team probably has about 80-85 people on it between coaches and players. The Tigers, based on these guidelines, not only couldn’t play another team, they could barely hold an intrasquad scrimmage. The JV players could never attend a game, nor could the band and cheerleaders or any fans.</p>
<p>That’s why Allegheny County has adopted some sort of silly pod system which allows a certain number of people in various parts of the stadium. This will at least allow the games to go on, but it still makes it unlikely there will be any fans allowed to attend.</p>
<p>But if large crowds of people are not allowed, why are politicians all over the country bending over backward to appease groups of protestors? Why are there permits being issued to allow these marches of hundreds, sometimes thousands, of people? Why is Wolf marching with these groups and then telling suburban soccer moms they can’t watch their kids play soccer in a stadium that is mostly empty?</p>
<p>Hypocrisy is a big reason why so many people can’t take all of these restrictions and shutdown orders seriously any more. Levine, who has been adamant about the need to control crowd sizes, was just mired in a controversy because she <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/08/20/Big-car-show-allowed-pennsylvania-attendance-limits-document-covid-19-carlisle-butler/stories/202008190100" target="_blank">cut some sort of backroom deal </a>with the organizers of the Carlisle Car Show that will allow 20,000 spectators to enter every day.</p>
<p>Now understand I have nothing against the Black Lives Matter movement and actually support much of what they are fighting for. I also have no issue with car shows. I do have an issue with a health czar and governor who seem to be making random rules that don’t apply to them or the causes they seem to think are important.</p>
<p>That’s not how it works in the real world, but we’ve seen plenty of evidence that Wolf and Levine live in fantasyland and have very little data to back up the decisions they make.</p>
<p>It is pretty simple to me — either large crowds of people are dangerous and cannot happen or they are safe and any attempt to scale them back is unnecessary. It can’t be both, and the fact that there are people in charge who want us to believe it should be is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>If it is safe for thousands of people to march downtown in protests, or for hundreds of protestors to march outside the mayor’s house, or to have car show with 20,000 people attending it daily, it is safe to have high school sporting events outdoors with fans in the stands without restrictions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It is amazing to me that otherwise-intelligent people are trying to sell the idea that there is some sort of difference between these crowds, especially outdoors. There isn’t. Don’t be fooled and don’t be a fool. It is time to call out this hypocrisy and push back against this kind of nonsense.</p>
