<h1>Art project consumes entire Squirrel Hill street</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Natalie Plecity had one project to finish up as shutdown mode hit the country in late March. A landscape architect, she was suddenly home everyday on Woodwell Street in Squirrel Hill with her husband, Matt Plecity, and their four daughters â€”&nbsp;ages 10, 7 and 2 1/2-year-old twins.</p>
<p>It wasn't as though she didn't have her hands full, but she decided to take on a new project, one that would eventually spread throughout her short street, between Dallas Avenue and Barnsdale Street.</p>
<p>"I have this survey flagging tape that I use for work, and I have a lot of it," she said.</p>
<p>It's not sticky tape but plastic ribbon, and it comes in many colors.</p>
<p>"I saw some hula hoops in a neighbor's garbage, and I took them and tied the ribbon around the hula hoops like spokes in a wheel," she said. "We hung them from our tree, like ornaments, and everybody loved them. Then we had a big windstorm and they were tattered.</p>
<p>"I asked my daughters [the two eldest] if they wanted to do another project," she said.</p>
<p>Marjorie Weiner, a neighbor across the street, described the result: "Cool, geometric layering. The community has been part of it. It has taken on a life of its own."</p>
<p>Ms. Weiner was walking her dog one day when she shot a few photos of the colorful tape designs in front of multiple houses, stretching from trees to porch railings, from balconies to hedges below, from railings to downspouts, from trees to street signs.</p>
<p>"My photos don't do it justice," Ms. Weiner wrote.</p>
<p>Ms. Plecity said after she put the ribbons up in front of her house, neighbors began requesting the same treatments.</p>
<p>"My close neighbors wanted one," she said. "People said, 'If you want to do my house ...' I've done 18 so far and have six more to do.</p>
<p>"I've seen runners [on Dallas] do a 90-degree turn and come back to run down our street."</p>
<p>Mila McGrosky, a sophomore doing remote learning at the High School for Creative and Performing Arts, said she wanted to affix ribbons to her own family's house.</p>
<p>"I've been close with Natalie, and sometimes I babysit their kids," she said. "Natalie dropped off the materials on our porch. I could get to the roof of the porch from my room. I connected the ribbons to the end of the roof and looped it around the gutter below. It's a V-shape, in red and green."</p>
<p>What inspired her?</p>
<p>"Why not be part of something?" she said. "Because frankly, this entire situation makes it so important for everybody to participate in something. We're unable to interact much. This art project is making something good out of the situation."</p>
<p>Ms. Plecity said the project was "something I could do during [the twins'] nap time. We wanted to give people a reason to walk the block and look at something pretty.</p>
<p>"People have asked me, 'What do they mean?' I wish they meant something. I just thought it would be helpful."</p>
