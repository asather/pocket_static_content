<h1>Penn State assistant Terry Smith building foundation in defensive backfield</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the defensive recruiting coordinator and defensive backs coach, Terry Smith’s role forces him to stay planted in the present with an eye toward the future.</p>
<p>The Nittany Lions leaped toward a productive 2021 recruiting class Friday by getting a commitment from Zakee Wheatley, a four-star safety from Severn, Md. Wheatley committed minutes before Kalen and Kobe King from Cass High School in Detroit. Kalen is a 5-foot-11, 170 pounder who is a 4-star defensive back on Rivals, and Kobe is a 3-star linebacker.</p>
<p>Jaylen Reed, a four-star safety from Detroit, committed the day before. In 24 hours, the Nittany Lions signed four young men that could see time on the field as freshmen.</p>
<p>And Smith is working to get more.</p>
<p>“I think we’re doing a fantastic job, and we’re delighted with where we are,” the Gateway High School alum said. “We got some good commits here in the last week, and we’re anticipating a couple more coming up. We’re a little ahead of schedule. Blue-White weekend, we usually grab a few, and then it snowballs. Commitments usually come in rallies, and that usually starts around that Blue-White weekend.”</p>
<p>The spring game would’ve been this Saturday, had COVID-19 not canceled that and spring practice. Smith isn’t letting the time away keep him and the staff from building the next class.</p>
<p>“It started a week earlier, and we’re thrilled,” Smith said. “Everyone is working remotely from home, and to me, the recruiting has really picked up. It’s super busy. From the time I wake up, I’m on my phone until the time I lay down, just constantly recruiting and communicating with prospects, and it’s been great.”</p>
<p>Penn State signed 27 players in the 2020 cycle. Smith made it clear that the 2021 class will be significantly smaller.</p>
<p>“This year is going to be a smaller class,” Smith said. “You’re going to cut almost a 10-guys difference from last year’s class to this year’s class, so we have to be a little more particular in who we want, but it’s been great and we’re doing a really good job on offense, defense, and we have a couple of special teams guys we’re looking for, as well.”</p>
<p>The Nittany Lions already have seven on board. If the numbers hold, then there is only room to sign 10 more athletes at the most.</p>
<p><strong>But for now ...&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>If there is going to be a 2020 season, the Nittany Lions will need Tariq Castro-Fields to step up and fill the shoes of the departing John Reid.</p>
<p>Castro-Fields&nbsp;showed promise when healthy in 2019, when he had two interceptions with eight passes defended. Both of those numbers tied him with Reid for best on the team.</p>
<p>“We need a lockdown corner that can handle the best receiver of whoever our opponent is,” Smith said. “We expect Tariq to be that guy. His season last year was almost like two different seasons. In the first half of the season, he came out the gate looking like a first-round draft pick, played very well, and then suffered an injury.”</p>
<p>Smith wouldn’t specify what the ailment was for Castro-Fields. However, Smith did acknowledge its impact on his performance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“From that injury on, he was a different player,” Smith said. “He wasn’t as confident, he wasn’t as sure of himself, and because of the injury — not to make an excuse. He knows and recognizes it. We’ve talked about it.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Smith wasn’t shy in expressing how he’ll measure success for Castro-Fields.</p>
<p>“He’s a good cover corner, but now it’s time not just to be a good cover corner, go make plays as a cover corner,” Smith said. “Get the ball back, make interceptions, force fumbles, make big, game-changing plays.”</p>
<p>The Nittany Lions struggled at times with big plays in pass defense. They were ranked 13th in the conference with 251.5 yards allowed per game. If the crew is going to improve, it will start with the senior.</p>
<p>“The big thing with Tariq, obviously he’s the leader of the corner room,” Smith said. “You know, we’re looking forward to Tariq having a great offseason and Tariq — not to put pressure on him — needs to have a great year for us.”</p>
<p>Of course, Castro-Fields having a breakthrough is suitable for his own endeavors as much it is for the team’s playoff hopes.</p>
<p>“The peaks and the valleys are going to come, but we have to remain consistent through all of that and perform the same way, play-in and play-out,” Smith said. “Tariq understands that. It’s something he wants for himself. He wants to be a first-round draft pick.”</p>
