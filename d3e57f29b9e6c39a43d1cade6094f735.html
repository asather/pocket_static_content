<h1>Gov. Wolf vetoes bill that would have put moratorium on Polk closure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf has vetoed a bill that would have placed a moratorium on the planned closures of two state centers for people with intellectual disabilities.</p>
<p>“All people deserve the opportunity to live among their family and peers in integrated, supportive homes. Quality home and community-based care should be the priority for the individuals we serve,” Mr. Wolf wrote in his veto message, announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Community care results in better outcomes for individuals with disabilities. Individuals with disabilities should be offered an everyday life as fully integrated members of our communities. My goal is to serve more individuals in the community, reduce reliance on institutional care, and improve access to home and community-based services.</p>
<p>“This legislation does not promote this investment and transition to community-based care for individuals with a disability. Instead, this legislation continues the reliance on institutionalization and is a barrier to community living.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/01/13/Intellectual-disabilities-Polk-Center-White-Haven-closure-legislation-bill-Pennsylvania/stories/202001100116" target="_blank">said he would veto the bill</a>. The Republican-controlled state House and Senate sent him the legislation earlier this month.</p>
<p>Legislators could still override the governor's veto, though many observers see that as unlikely.</p>
<p>State officials <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2019/08/14/Closure-Polk-State-center-White-Haven-State-intellectually-disabled-venango-luzerne/stories/201908140079" target="_blank">last year announced their plans to close two of the four remaining state centers</a>, Polk Center in Venango County and White Haven Center in Luzerne County.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 906 would have established a task force to evaluate the centers and provide recommendations to the department prior to any closures. It would also have put a five year moratorium on any state center closures.</p>
<p>Institutional closures are part of a decades-long national trend that favors smaller group home settings over large institutions like Polk, which first opened in 1897. Many disability advocacy organizations favor the closures, saying funds can be better spent helping those on a waiting list for community-based services.</p>
<p>Family members, legislators, and state center employees have been fighting the closures, however.</p>
<p>Separately from the legislation, a group of 13 state center residents and their families filed a federal lawsuit last month, saying the closures are depriving residents of their rights.</p>
