<h1>Penguins on pause: Two ways to analyze Dominik Simon's season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Evaluating Dominik Simon’s 2019-20 season depends, largely, on the prism through which you choose to view the game.</p>
<p>On one hand, Simon is a darling of the “advanced”-metrics world. In Corsi For percentage — a ratio that shows the percentage of shot attempts created by a team versus the total shot attempts during 5-on-5 situations — Simon produced a 53.2%.</p>
<p>Let’s put that into context. The only Penguins forwards with a better shot share are Jake Guenzel (an All-Star who was on pace for another 40-goal season), Evgeni Malkin (who should be the team MVP) and Sidney Crosby (who is Sidney Crosby).</p>
<p>On the other hand, the more traditional stats tell a much different story. Simon recorded seven goals and 15 assists in 64 games. Those seven goals are third-fewest among Penguins forwards who played at least 50 games. The only forwards who scored less were Zach Aston-Reese and Sam Lafferty. The difference here is Aston-Reese plays on the shut-down fourth line that rarely gets an offensive-zone start. Lafferty was a rookie who often was also playing on that fourth line. Simon is often on Crosby’s right wing, playing next to one of the best players in the world.</p>
<p>So which side is right?</p>
<p>The answer probably lies somewhere in the middle. As the Corsi figures suggest, Simon can be a complimentary piece to Crosby thanks to his puck-possession skills and ability to navigate in tight spaces. He helps the top line hog the puck and rack up offensive-zone time. But at the same time, Simon’s shooting percentage of 6.9% was the second-lowest among Penguins forwards, certainly leaving something to be desired.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> On Oct. 29, Simon tallied a season-high three points during the Penguins 7-1 win over the Philadelphia Flyers. He scored once and assisted on two other goals.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> One key factor that’s sometimes overlooked with Simon is his salary. The 25-year-old made $750,000 this year, tied with fourth-line center Teddy Blueger for the lowest salary among regular Penguins forwards. It’s less even than mid-season call-up Anthony Angello ($925,000) and the rookie, Lafferty ($792,500). That point sometimes gets lost when looking at Simon’s value on a star-heavy team that’s always fighting to stay under the salary cap.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Simon will be one of the most intriguing decisions the Penguins have to make. Questions began to emerge about Simon’s place in the lineup when the Penguins reacquired Conor Sheary, who immediately supplanted Simon on Crosby’s right wing.</p>
<p>Now, with Jake Guentzel, Nick Bjugstad, Aston-Reese and Angello all healthy, the Penguins have 17 forwards to fill 12 spots. If Simon isn’t on the top line, where he seems to have chemistry with Crosby, he might just as easily find himself in the press box.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Simon will become a restricted free agent this offseason. His salary shouldn’t break the bank if the Penguins choose to keep him on the payroll via arbitration or in the form of a multi-year deal. It’s just a matter of if the Penguins choose to keep him in their long-term plans.</p>
