<h1>Pirates GM Ben Cherington addresses potential changes this offseason</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A year ago, they were big. As big as they could get, really, without owner Bob Nutting deciding to sell the team. But this offseason, any changes the Pirates make will likely be much more subtle.</p>
<p>Speaking on a season-ending Zoom call with local reporters Wednesday, general manager Ben Cherington and manager Derek Shelton talked a little about what might change, although, again, fair warning: None of it will be terribly big.</p>
<p>As for Shelton’s coaching staff, he said that “we’ve asked all of our coaches to go home and reflect after the season” and added that making changes is “something we’ll continue to talk about.”</p>
<p>With pretty much a new staff and just a 60-game season, it stands to reason that many will return. The most notable change the Pirates could or would make involves hitting coach Rick Eckstein, although multiple sources indicated that Pittsburgh is likely to keep him in place for 2021.</p>
<p>“In terms of the [coaching] staff, I’ll defer to Shelty,” Cherington said. “I’m really encouraged by a lot of what went on with our major league staff. We’re still in the middle of reflecting on the season, talking to staff about their own reflections on the season and just looking for ways forward.”</p>
<p>One position where the Pirates are making a change involves their senior director of minor league operations, a position <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/28/Sources-Pirates-need-farm-director-after-tweaking-Larry-Broadway-s-role/stories/202009280087" target="_blank">previously held by Larry Broadway</a>.&nbsp;The Pirates moved Broadway out of his old role a couple weeks ago, sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, although his new one is not yet finalized.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Cherington said it was a matter of Broadway perhaps doing a couple different things for the Pirates, who hoped to retain the longtime employee.</p>
<p>“I think there will be some reorganization in player development,” Cherington said. “Larry and I have talked about that and look forward to working with him. He’s got a ton of talent. We’ve talked that maybe this is an opportunity to start doing some different things for the Pirates, so we’re in the middle of that conversation.”</p>
<p>As for what the Pirates will be looking for in the person who replaces Broadway, Cherington didn’t share much, though he did make clear that it wasn’t so much about their unhappiness with Broadway as it was maybe allowing him to shift his focus elsewhere and bringing a different sort of voice to that position.&nbsp;One, Cherington hinted, that may have a little more experience working with and developing coaches.</p>
<p>“If you think about player development, we need great players, and we need great coaches with them,” Cherington said. “We need to identify the leadership that gives us the best chance to be great at coaching — and I mean every aspect of coaching. It’s not just the people in uniform on the field; it’s everybody, all the other staff, collaborating with that group. It’s how do we find the best possible coaches, continue to develop coaches, create the best environment for coaching to happen and ultimately [have] players get better?”</p>
<p>Last offseason, the Pirates added “two or three important people” to their informatics team, a move that Cherington said helped increase the Pirates’ “bandwidth.” This year, it does not appear to be so much about volume as it will be taking that staff and potentially shifting the focus of some people, Cherington said.</p>
<p>“I feel really good about the group we have in informatics,” Cherington said. “Maybe there will be additions, but more so I think our focus will be on how do we continue to put that group in the best possible position to make an impact.”</p>

<p><strong>Buying the build?</strong></p>
<p>It’s no secret that the Pirates’ struggles of late have frustrated fans. When they are allowed back in PNC Park, surely there will be a large group that wants — and deserves — to see more.</p>
<p>Cherington on Wednesday was asked about needing to be cognizant of that after the Pirates finished with one of the worst winning percentages in franchise history.</p>
<p>While he said he doesn’t spend a lot of time quantifying just how poorly the Pirates fared in terms of results, he does hope that fans will support the team as it seeks to acquire and develop more <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/28/pitstburgh-pirates-ke-bryan-hayes-derek-shelton-rookie-of-the-year-willie-mccovey/stories/202009280070" target="_blank">young players such as Ke’Bryan Hayes</a>.</p>
<p>“As a fan myself, that’s what I would be connecting to,” Cherington said. “That’s what I would hope our fans could connect to — being part of that journey, part of that process as we build this team. Ke’Bryan Hayes is an example, but there’s going to be more. Some of them are on our team now. Some are in the minor leagues. Some will be added next year.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to look too far around the league to see the paths that teams have taken to success. It’s usually built on acquiring, developing and integrating really good young talent. That’s what we’ve got to do. I think that’s an exciting thing to be a part of and be part of that journey, that development. Then when the wins start coming, they feel really good because they’ve been a part of it.</p>
<p>“As a fan, I know that’s something that resonates with me. I really hope it will with our fans. I believe it will because I think Pirates fans are really smart and care about that. They know that’s what we need to do. That’s been a foundation for Pirates success in the past.”</p>
