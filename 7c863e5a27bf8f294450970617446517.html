<p>The City of Pittsburgh plans to install permanent asphalt speed humps on Grandview Avenue in Mount Washington next week.</p>
<p>The permanent structures are coming after a three-month trial period showed <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/10/06/Pittsburgh-Mount-Washington-speed-humps-pavement-markings-Grandview-pedestrian/stories/201910060209" target="_blank">temporary speed humps did reduce motorists’ speeds</a> on the stretch of road in one of Pittsburgh’s popular tourist destinations.</p>
<p>Without the speed humps, about 61% of motorists traveled over the posted speed limit of 25 miles per hour, according to research from the city’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. The temporary speed humps reduced that number to 32%.</p>
<p>The five temporary rubber speed humps, which were between Bertha and Shiloh streets, were installed last fall and removed in January 2020.</p>
<p>At the same time as the installation, the city also painted ten additional crosswalks, converted 17 existing crosswalks to “high visibility, continental-style” crosswalks that resembled piano keys and began painting 27 “bump-outs,” or painted curb extensions, in the area.</p>
<p>Work on the new permanent speed humps is expected to start June 29 and last one to two days, according to a press release.</p>
