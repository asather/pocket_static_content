<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 04.23.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is draft day let’s chat!!!</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Good morning, Paul. If I were the GM...Forget a RB with the Steelers first pick. They can go with what they have along with a vet or a later draft pick and draft one next year when Conners contract is up. And those WR’s will look a lot better with Ben under center and might regress if they draft one with #2. If a pass rusher that can rotate (They rotate to a fault) and eventually replace Bud or a nose that can make an immediate impact falls to them, that’s the route I’d go. If not, then I’d consider a RB or WR with their first pick. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think linebacker is a pressing need because they have little depth there. And I also think nose tackle could be a direction they need to go. The receiver group is so deep they could get a good one at 102 or 124 so they don’t necessarily need to grab one at 49</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: Hey Paul...have you heard if the Steelers might be interested in selecting running back Antonio Gibson from Memphis in a later round if they don’t draft a running back in Round 2? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’ve heard a lot of things - I do believe they will end this draft with a running back. I’m not sure who or with what pick. I think if the right one is available at 49 they will grab him</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: Happy Draft Day Paul. Would you trade for Fournette for a late round pick? Would you trade JuJu to San Fran for their 31st pick in the first round? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would probably give up a 6th or 7th tor Fournette but nothing more. I would not trade JuJu Smith-Schuster. They are trying to add to their receiving corps not subtract from it</p>
<p><strong>Mary Lynn</strong>: Paul, could you see the Steelers taking A.J. Dillon in one of the late rounds in case Conner gets hurt again? He and Conner seem to have similar running styles. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: A lot of people seem to love Dillon for the Steelers and I get it but I don’t know how he adds a skill set they don’t already have. It doesn’t seem like a fit given what they already have at running back</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: I am loving the MJ series on ESPN and for those who didn't see first two episodes they are on the ESPN site. Yea or Nay, Rockets two rings while he was largely away need an asterisk? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No, there were still a lot of great teams and players during those two years. And who knows, with Hakeem and Drexler they might have got MJ and company in the Finals and beat them. Too many things can happen in a season for an asterisk in almost every case</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Can we do a SAVE THE O campaign? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is such an iconic place in Pittsburgh I bet someone will do their best to try and save it or revive it.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Duquesne signed six players this offseason? I thought they were bringing back a good team? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They are better and they are bringing back a really good team. But they can always improve and they can always improve the level or player they have on the roster</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Who do you HOPE Steelers can pick tonight. I think the Hulaire guy would be Hulariosly popukar….5''8' Swiss Army Knife. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: My personal preference of running backs would be J.K. Dobbins from Ohio State. I think he is the most complete back in the draft.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Russell 4HOF</strong>: At last, the draft is here! Is there anyone under the radar you would like the Steelers to take, someone who has caught your eye? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would love for them to take a shot, late of course, at this kid from Rhode Island -- Isaiah Coulter. A wide receiver with some size, physicality and strength. He is a guy who has a lot of tools but not a lot of hype. Someone will grab and love him.</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: I’m curious as to who makes the final call if a unanimous decision regarding which player to take can’t be reached. Would it be Colbert ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think that is a great question nobody has the answer to. Here is my best guess - if there is not a consensus only one vote matters: Art Rooney has the final say.</p>
<p><strong>Lamar</strong>: Paul, do you know if JuJu has a preference for playing outside or in the slot? Would the Steelers draft a receiver based on that preference? Thanks man. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This has been a discussion for a while - should they move him back to the slot where he had a lot of success or keep him outside. It probably depends on the type of receiver they draft. If they get a guy who can take the top off a defense and can play the outside, they might consider moving him back inside.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>: Hey Paul, who do you think the Steelers are most likely to draft in the 2nd round at 49th overall and beyond in other words like RB, WR, RT and DT among other positions I've heard from Ray, Brian and Jason the last 3 days plus several weeks <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I want them to draft a linebacker but listening to the experts like Ray and Gerry and others in town it seems like they are going to go either WR or RB</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: I think we should prepare for no sports of any kind till maybe next Spring. What do you say? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don't think so. In fact, I am fairly certain this golf challenge between Phil Mickelson/Tom Brady and Tiger Woods/Peyton Manning is going to happen next month. I also think the PGA Tour will get going in June. And WWE is already going. And the South Korean baseball league is up and running. And the German soccer league is talking about running soon. In short, I don't think we will see fans in the stands any time soon but I do think we will see sports by mid-to-late June</p>
<p><strong>Stan</strong>: Have any plans been made for the media to be able to interview Colbert and Tomlin when the Steelers make a pick via a video or telephone conference in light of the unprecedented draft conditions? Thanks Paul. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes, there will apparently be a zoom of some sort set up</p>
<p><strong>Odessa</strong>: Mr. Z. : Can you give us your opinion of an overrated and underrated player in this year’s draft? Thank you sir. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I will give you an underrated player and it is not a regional bias thing - Dane Jackson from Pitt. The thing about Pitt's corners under Pat Narduzzi is they are asked to play man on an island almost the entire game. They all can cover and Dane is physical player who will adapt to the NFL nicely. As for overrated I am going to give you three -- I am not a big fan of Tua, Justin Herbert or Jordan Love. Tua to me is propped up because of where he played but he seemed to get injured a tad too much for me and I don't know that he is as freakish of an athlete as some claim. Justin Herbert played in that Oregon offense and most of his passes were dinks and dunks and screens. And Love is being way overrated based on his workouts. I could be wrong but I think the only first round QB in this draft should be Joe Burrow</p>
<p><strong>General Chaos</strong>: So Paul there is a plan on the table again to eliminate some Minor League franchises in Baseball. Can we figure out a way to include the Pirates in that list ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Be nice!!!</p>
<p><strong>Eddie T.</strong>: Paul, who’s the better golfer..Brady or Manning? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: For some reason this question didn't register the first time - Apparently Peyton Manning is around a 4 handicap and Tom Brady is around an 8. Of course, given the fact that Brady is a known cheater, he probably is a 3 or 4 as well and fudges his scores so his handicap is an 8 - and then he uses the extra strokes to take money from people in matches.....</p>
<p><strong>Vince</strong>: Paul, I continue to be astounded about all of the mock drafts of so-called experts who continue to mock a quarterback to the Steelers in either the second or third round. Am I missing something or are they "in the know." I see us as drafting either a running back or a wide receiver in the second and the possibly a defensive lineman or edge rusher in the third round. What is your take? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is just laziness. Guys look at a depth chart and say "gee the Steelers need a quarterback" and then it becomes a herd mentality. Also, this year these guys have less information than in the past because of the circumstances so they are probably just grabbing what they can and going with it.</p>
<p><strong>Grant</strong>: Do you think this will be Colbert’s last draft? If so, who would you like to succeed him? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do not. He will be around for at least another year or two. And it seems like they are grooming Brandon Hunt, who is their pro scouting coordinator. However, Dan Rooney Jr. is the player personnel coordinator and I think he has some family connections that may help him get the job.........</p>
<p><strong>General Chaos</strong>: Drafting a punter ? Yes or no ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Maybe in the 7th round but more likely is they will sign one as an undrafted free agent and give him every opportunity to beat out Jordan Berry.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Without any spring rookie practices and who knows what kind of training camp, at which position does a rookie have the best opportunity to come in and contribute right away? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say running back, right. I mean, that seems to be the position that college players make the easiest transition to the NFL at anyway. Again, if they get a player like J.K. Dobbins he will be plugged right into the rotation and have a chance to contribute.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: If the NFL plays games with no fans, do you think artificial fan cheering will be added to the broadcast ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: God I hope not</p>
<p><strong>General Chaos</strong>: Bigger loss ? The O. Yinzers. Or the Pirates season ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Wow that is tough. I would say the O is a Pittsburgh institution and a place that people come to eat that is completely unique to here. We don't have many of those left. The Pirate season is a huge loss for a lot of people who depend on the Pirates for a check. And Yinzers will be back.</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Hi Paul. Go for a RB at No. 49. Even without the usual preseason work, that is a position where a player can make a big impact simply on instinctive skills. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yep, I totally agree with the second part but not sure that is why they need to take one at 49</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Paul does Art Rooney have a say on who is drafted or is it all on Tomlin and Colbert? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well like I said, Rooney is the boss and the boss always has a say</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Paul, best guess on NHL playoff format for this strange season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the playoff format will be the same - eight teams in each conference. The change could be in finishing the regular season and I am wondering if they might have to alter the early rounds, like make the first round best of five or something, in order to get it all in. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Wait where did you all go? There has to be more questions!!</p>
<p><strong>Mr Sunshine</strong>: Think the Steelers have Camp this Summer and move it to the South Side ? And will they finally do the smart thing make it permanent ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This is my best guess - the Steelers will train at the South Side facility and be in the hotel right down the street from it in order to minimize the contact with the outside world. I suppose they could do the same thing by going to St Vincent's but I cannot imagine there will be fans or visitors allowed in to watch and John Clayton said the other day there isn't likely to be a preseason or there will be maybe one preseason game instead of four. That means the Hall of Fame game involving the Steelers is not likely to take place. It also means the Hall of Fame ceremonies involving Bill Cowher, Donnie Shell and Troy Polamalu will likely be postponed.</p>
<p><strong>Swami</strong>: Write it down. The Steelers's will draft a QB on day 2. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would hope not but I think you may be right. I can't see them going into the season with Devlin Hodges as their third string quarterback and Paxton Lynch is like a unicorn, has anyone actually ever seen him in a Steelers uniform???? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: So reading that it appears this is an area of concern for scouts and is probably why he is rated around the 5th or 6th best running back in the draft even though he is clearly one of the best with the ball in his hands or catching it out of the back field.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Is Ben a Hall of Famer? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There is no question. He may not be a first-ballot guy because a lot of national media types who vote don't like him but he will be in by his third season of eligibility.</p>
<p><strong>Bonnie</strong>: Paul...the running back Clyde from LSU...do you think he can pass protect? He’s built well for the NFL game and has good speed, but trying to protect Big Ben would scare me. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I will defer to NFL.com's Lance Zierlein on this one - here is what he says about Clyde Edwards-Helaire:<br> "Compact, sudden back who runs low to the ground with power and balance to break tackles and the agility to bob, weave and shake them in tight quarters. Edwards-Helaire runs with instinctive eyes and quick-cut foot speed. He doesn't really have tells or tendencies and can alter the rush track when needed, which makes him so unpredictable for defenses. While he can create for himself, he's better off working inside-out as NFL linebackers might be able to outflank him on pure outside runs. He has pop behind his pads but lacks short-yardage size. He has the talent to become a good, three-down back in time, but needs to improve in pass protection."So reading that it appears this is an area of concern for scouts and is probably why he is rated around the 5th or 6th best running back in the draft even though he is clearly one of the best with the ball in his hands or catching it out of the back field.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Paul, thanks for doing these. Those of us that are supposed to be working from home appreciate the break! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I certainly enjoy them and enjoy the questions and interaction with people who love sports and are missing them as much as the rest of us!!</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: It will be odd with no fan noise. Once they did a game with no announcer. That was different...but football with no crowd reaction would be odd <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The fan noise does add to the atmosphere and that adds something to the broadcasts. But a lot of people watch games at sports bars and things of the such and have the sound down.</p>
<p><strong>Happy Day</strong>: Favorite song to wash your hands to ? "Happy Birthday" "Baa Baa Black Sheep" or something else ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: And on that note.......... thanks for all the great questions and for participating in the chat. The next time we do it next week we will know who the newest Steelers are. That should make for some excellent post-draft analysis. Until then, stay safe and have a great weekend!</p>
