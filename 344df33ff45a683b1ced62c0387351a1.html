<h1>Gerry Dulac grades the Steelers' 2020 NFL draft</h1>

<p>In all likelihood, the Steelers did not take a player in the NFL draft who, barring injury or unforeseen circumstance, will be a starter in 2020.</p>
<p>If that is how teams evaluate a draft — and, in a lot of instances, it is — the Steelers’ <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/25/steelers-draft-picks-2020-round-4-7-nfl-live-updates-anthony-mcfarland/stories/202004250044" target="_blank">six-player haul over the weekend</a> would not appear to qualify as a success, especially for a team that finished 8-8 and missed the postseason for the second year in row.</p>
<p>Even their top pick, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/26/chase-claypool-profile-steelers-nfl-draft-2020-notre-dame-football/stories/202004250057" target="_blank">Chase Claypool</a>, is not expected to come in and be their No. 1 receiver. He will merely be an addition — albeit <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/24/steelers-2020-nfl-draft-picks-round-2-3-chase-claypool/stories/202004240125" target="_blank">a big, fast, productive addition</a> — to a young corps of wideouts that includes JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and Diontae Johnson. You can even throw Eric Ebron in that group, too, based on the way the Steelers plan to use their new tight end.</p>
<p>But, as much as a team can with just a half-dozen picks, what the Steelers did do was add a player or type of player at positions that really needed to be addressed. Granted, they did not take a true inside linebacker who could pair with Devin Bush. And did they really need another running back who isn’t a true No. 1 back?</p>
<p>Here is a graded evaluation of the six draft choices, what impact they can have and what role they might play for the Steelers in 2020 and beyond:</p>
<p><strong>Chase Claypool, WR</strong> – It’s hard not to like a 6-foot-4, 238-pound receiver who runs a 4.42 and has an 80-inch wing span. Oh yeah, and had 13 touchdowns last season. Offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner called Claypool a “point-scorer” because he averaged a touchdown per game last season at Notre Dame. And that’s something the offense needs after having very few point-producers last season without Ben Roethlisberger. Claypool is not the type of receiver who beats coverage at the line of scrimmage, is Maserati-quick out of his break or is Antonio Brown-dangerous after the catch. He is not that type of playmaker. Those players were gone by the time the Steelers selected at No. 49. But Claypool is the type of dangerous deep threat who could open up room underneath for the Steelers other young receivers. Kind of like they had with Martavis Bryant, only more sure-handed.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: A</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Alex Highsmith, OLB</strong> – Even though he does not come from a Power Five school (Charlotte) the Steelers typically favor with higher choices, Highsmith has the perfect body type (6-3, 248) they covet when transforming college defensive ends into outside linebackers. More importantly, they addressed the most important position on their defense with a player who doesn’t have to be a starter but gives them someone to rotate with T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree without experiencing the type of dropoff they had with Anthony Chickillo. The Steelers have three Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks in their division. They need players who can pressure them. Highsmith’s development from one-time walk-on to a player who had 15 sacks and 21 ½ tackles for losses as a senior is indicative of his commitment and perseverance. What’s more, he gives the Steelers an outside linebacker who could eventually replace Dupree, either in 2021 or 2022, if they decide not to give him a long-term contract.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: A</strong></em></p>

<p><strong>Anthony McFarland Jr., RB</strong> – Unless McFarland can be anything near the home-run hitter he was two years ago at Maryland, or provide a change-of-pace impact with his speed and elusiveness, I’m not sure the Steelers needed to add another running back who won’t replace James Conner as the starter and won’t move ahead of Benny Snell Jr. if something happens to Conner again. That being said, I understand — and whole-heartedly applaud — the Steelers recognizing the need to continue to find playmakers for their offense. And McFarland is that. Anyone who can rush for 298 yards against Ohio State and break off runs of 52, 75 and 81 yards against them has to have big-play capabilities.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: B</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Dotson, G</strong> – I like this pick, almost as much as any, specifically because Dotson fills an immediate need of getting a young, developing guard and a player who is a tenacious run-blocker. And they got him late in the fourth round, which could eventually prove to be a steal. Dotson will not be a starter right now — he will back up free-agent pickup Stefen Wisniewski — but he has the type of aggressive mentality that eventually should fit in nicely next to Maurkice Pouncey. Dotson was overshadowed at Louisiana-Lafayette by his more heralded teammate, guard Robert Hunt, but he has many of the same dominating qualities as a “people-mover.” That’s what offensive line coach Shaun Sarrett called Dotson. Now it will be up to Sarrett to develop him like his predecessor, Mike Munchak, did with young linemen.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: B+</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Antoine Brooks Jr., S/ILB</strong> – This is probably the biggest boom-or-doom pick for the Steelers, depending on how he is eventually deployed in their defense. Kevin Colbert called Brooks “half a safety, half a linebacker,” which is how he was used at Maryland. That would actually satisfy two areas of need for the Steelers — a backup safety behind Terrell Edmunds and Minkah Fitzpatrick and someone to help step in to the position vacated with Mark Barron’s release. But Brooks’ strength, at 220 pounds, is being physical, playing near the line of scrimmage. It is not in coverage. They are not going to use him ahead of defensive backs Mike Hilton, Cameron Sutton or Justin Layne in their sub packages. So, if he is to be of immediate value, it would be at the hybrid linebacker spot next to Devin Bush. Otherwise, the Steelers still have a hole in their defense of how to adequately replace Barron, who was on the field 70% of time (750 snaps) last season.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: C</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos Davis, DT</strong> – It’s not fair to properly evaluate a seventh-round draft choice because their chances of making the roster, let alone helping the team, are not in their favor. But what I do like is the Steelers took a chance on Davis’ athleticism — he was clocked at 4.79 at the combine, a staggering 40-time for a 313-pound lineman — and brought in a young player, like Isaiah Buggs last season, who has a chance to develop in a couple years. There could be a spot on the roster for Davis, especially if the Steelers finally decide to move on from Dan McCullers after six unproductive seasons. But, depending what happens with training camp and preseason games, his opportunities to impress could be limited. He is likely headed for the practice squad.&nbsp;<em><strong>Grade: C+</strong></em></p>
