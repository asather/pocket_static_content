<h1>Beaver County reports 4 new nursing home deaths; Pa. nears 60,000 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania said it has more than 900 new cases of COVID-19 and 275 more deaths — nearly 200 of them at nursing homes or long-term homes — according to data released Thursday by the state health depeartment.</p>
<p>Five new deaths were in Western Pennsylvania — four in Beaver County and one in Erie. All of the Beaver deaths occurred at a nursing home, according to the state data.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported no new deaths from COVID-19 and six new cases. However, sometime after 4 p.m. Wednesday, the county separately updated its figures for the Kane Community Living Centers and reported two new deaths at the Glen Hazel home, which brings that facility’s total to 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state does not specify the names of homes where deaths occur. The county only provides data from each of the Kane centers. So far, none of the sites other than Glen Hazel have reported a death.</p>
<p>When asked about the specific homes on Wednesday, Allegheny County Health Director Dr. Debra Bogen declined to give the names, but said that several homes had reached out to the state for infection control assistance in addition to Kane.</p>
<p>With the new figures, Allegheny has a total of 1,551 cases of COVID-19 — 1,474 confirmed and 77 probable — since the first case was reported March 14. The death toll is now 139, 129 confirmed and 10 probable. Allegheny’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The county said 283 people, past or present, have required hospitalization. There have been at least 117 people admitted to an intensive care unit, and 67 of them have required mechanical ventilation. So far, there have been at least 21,488 tests administered.</p>
<p>Statewide on Thursday, the health department reported 938 new cases of COVID-19 and 275 deaths — both notable increases from the previous day —&nbsp;related to the disease, bringing the totals to 59,636 cases and 4,218 deaths from the virus.</p>

<p>Philadelphia continues to have the highest totals in the state, with 15,624 cases and 1,000 deaths, and the southeast region continues to see case growth far surpassing that of the rest of the state.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald and Dr. Bogen both struck a cautious tone at a separate press conference Wednesday. Mr. Fitzgerald described himself and Dr. Bogen as “nervous” about reopening.</p>
<p>“We’ve gotta be responsible,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “We’ve gotta be sure that we continue to practice all the mitigating strategies that have gotten us to this point — that have put us in a position to be able to have so many of our folks go back to work and make a living.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said that the county has a plan to scale up testing and contact tracing, and she said that the plan would allow the department to quickly bring on more case investigators and contact tracers as needed in the event of an increase in cases.</p>
<p>“We’re prepared, from a health department perspective, to be responsive,” Dr. Bogen said.</p>
<p>Public facilities would continue to be closed to organized sports and other large gatherings, Mr. Fitzgerald said, and he is “pessimistic” about public pools being open this summer.</p>
