<h1>Coatesville's Lonnie White Jr. verbally commits to Penn State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lonnie White Jr became the 12th member of Penn State football’s 2021 recruiting class when he renounced his commitment to play baseball at Clemson.</p>
<p>White plays quarterback and wide receiver at Malvern Prep in Coatesville, Pa. He expects to play wide receiver for the Nittany Lions.</p>
<p>White, a two-star recruit according to Rivals, had several offers to play college football. Pitt, Syracuse, Michigan, Maryland, Tennessee, Rutgers and Michigan State were among the more than 20 schools vying for him. But White announced on Twitter this week that he was staying in Pennsylvania to continue his athletic endeavors.</p>
<p>“Thank you to Coach Franklin and the rest of the staff for the opportunity to play in front of the best fans in the nation,” White said.</p>
<p>For the time being, the commitment from the 6-foot-2, 210-pound athlete gives the Nittany Lions the country’s 12th best recruiting class for 2021, according to Rivals.</p>
