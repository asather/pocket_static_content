<h1>White Oak council reinstates officer fired for domestic violence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>White Oak Council on Monday night voted, 4-3, to rehire a former borough<strong>&nbsp;</strong>police officer who had been terminated more than a year earlier over allegations he assaulted his wife.</p>
<p>Timothy Estep, who was hired by the borough in 1995 but terminated in December 2018, was reinstated without back pay and contingent upon a last-chance agreement.</p>
<p>The vote, during an online meeting broadcast on Facebook Live, broke down along political party lines, with three of four Republicans who voted in favor having ties to the police department.</p>
<p>It also drew harsh criticism from those against rehiring Mr. Estep, who was criminally charged but never convicted.</p>
<p>“I’m against ever bringing him back to work,” said 20-year council member Kenneth Robb during the meeting. “We just can’t have police officers beating up their wives.”</p>
<p>Mr. Robb said he believed that rehiring Mr. Estep presents the borough with potential civil liability.</p>
<p>“It could be used against him in any time and any circumstance. We’re asking for a lawsuit if we bring this officer back,” Mr. Robb said. “If anything happens as a result of the vote to bring him back and we get sued, I’m going to offer as additional defendants the people who voted to bring him back. It’s ridiculous.”</p>
<p>Mr. Estep was charged Sept. 17, 2018, with a single count of simple assault. According to the criminal complaint, White Oak police were called to his home about 12 p.m. that day, and his wife, Helene Estep, said that her husband had been drinking since the evening before, and that the couple was arguing.</p>
<p>Mrs. Estep told detectives that her husband threw her to the ground and struck her in the chest and face with his hand. The complaint noted that Mrs. Estep had bruising on her arm, face and neck, as well as redness on her chest.</p>
<p>That same day, Mrs. Estep obtained an emergency protection-from-abuse order from District Judge Thomas Miller, writing in her petition that her husband had been “getting physical, made bruises, black eye, twisted wrist, neck marks.”</p>
<p>On Oct. 11, 2018, Mr. and Mrs. Estep arrived at the district judge’s office together for his preliminary hearing. She informed the Allegheny County<strong>&nbsp;</strong>district attorney’s office she did not want to pursue the case, and the couple indicated they were worried about his pension. In an effort to save it, now-retired Assistant District Attorney Lawrence Sachs agreed to allow Mr. Estep to complete a batterer’s intervention program in exchange for dropping the charge.<span style="background-color: #ffff00;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong><br></strong></span></p>
<p>It was a decision later criticized by the office.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The disposition of this case was not handled properly by an ADA who is no longer with the office,” said spokesman Mike Manko<span style="background-color: #ffffff;" data-mce-mark="1"> on Tuesday.</span></p>
<p>Borough council voted, 4-2, to terminate Mr. Estep in December 2018 for domestic violence and conduct unbecoming an officer. Mr. Estep appealed to the White Oak civil service commission, which reduced his termination to a one-year suspension. The borough then appealed that decision to Common Pleas Court.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Senior Judge Joseph M. James overturned the civil service commission in September, saying that the borough was entitled to terminate Mr. Estep and that the allegations related to the 2018 assault of his wife were enough to rise to the level of conduct unbecoming an officer.</p>
<p>Mr. Estep filed a notice of appeal with the state Commonwealth Court three weeks later. That appeal was still pending Monday when borough council voted to reinstate him.</p>
<p>White Oak Councilman Lou Bender, the chair of the public safety committee who made the motion to reinstate Mr. Estep, said that was one of the things he considered in making his motion.</p>
<p>Were Mr. Estep to win his appeal, Mr. Bender said Tuesday, he could be entitled to back pay.</p>
<p>“White Oak Borough could be on the hook for $200,000-plus,” he said, noting the borough already spent nearly $20,000 on legal fees already. “He could be ordered back to work with no restrictions whatsoever on him.”</p>
<p>With the last-chance agreement, Mr. Bender continued, “If there’s one violation, no matter how minor, that officer will be terminated.”</p>
<p>Three of the four people who voted to reinstate Mr. Estep have ties to the police department. Mr. Bender is the former police chief. Councilwoman Julie Opferman is married to Sgt. Dan Opferman, and Councilman Ed Babyak is a former officer. Chuck Davis also voted in favor of reinstatement.</p>
<p>Ms. Opferman did not return a message, and neither Mr. Davis nor Mr. Babyak could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Estep’s attorney, Ronald Koerner, did not want to comment.</p>
<p>When council voted to terminate Mr. Estep in 2018, Mr. Bender abstained from that vote. He said Tuesday that he believed council should have honored the decision of the Civil Service Commission.</p>
<p>“I absolutely do not condone domestic violence, and I was very upset at the allegations made against Estep,” Mr. Bender said.</p>
<p>But, he continued, “I do know there is the presumption of innocence until proven guilty.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bender also said he worked with Mr. Estep for 23 years.&nbsp;During that time, he said, Mr. Estep had “nothing but a stellar law enforcement career on the job.”</p>
<p>During Monday’s meeting, Mr. Bender did not make his motion using Mr. Estep’s name, instead referring to him using only his former employee number.</p>
<p>Mr. Robb noted that the majority on borough council shifted in January, and that Monday night’s vote was along party lines.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what the Republicans are trying to do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Robb, Councilman George Dillinger and Mayor Ina Jean Marton said they were all surprised when the issue was brought up for a vote.</p>
<p>During the Facebook Live broadcast of the online meeting, about 50 people were watching.</p>
<p>“There was nothing on the agenda that this was ever being brought up,” the mayor said. “I was very surprised when they brought this up last night.”</p>
<p>She said she was disappointed in the outcome.</p>
<p>So, too, was Mr. Dillinger, who voted against reinstatement. He questioned the reasons for bringing Mr. Estep back — outside of camaraderie.</p>
<p>“That’s what’s appalling to me. It’s almost like behavior that’s condoned,” he said. “I think you have to do what’s right — what’s ethical, what’s moral.</p>
<p>“I just don’t think that’s normal behavior for a police officer.”</p>
<p>He questioned, too, how the vote occurred.</p>
<p>“Our meetings are now virtual,” he said. “The public can’t come in and look at the councilmen face to face and say, ‘Why are you doing this?’ ”</p>
<p>Melissa Melewsky, in-house counsel for the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association, praised White Oak for livestreaming its meeting.</p>
<p>But, she also said Tuesday that under the state’s Sunshine laws, no matter what forum is used, the public has to be given an opportunity to comment on issues before a vote takes place.</p>
<p>“They still can make their own decisions, but they have to hear from their constituents before they’re made,” she said. “The fact we have no opportunity to do that here at all is a problem.”</p>
<p>“The Sunshine Act still applies in an emergency.”</p>
<p>Mr. Dillinger said he hopes the community will make its feelings known on the issue.</p>
<p>“The only thing we can do is hope there’s public pressure put on these folks that made this decision and condone this behavior.”</p>
