<h1>Point guard Sincere Carry is Duquesne's 'ultimate underdog'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Back in December, Duquesne played Marshall in Cleveland, and it was a homecoming for Sincere Carry.</p>
<p>The game was about a half hour from where Carry played high school ball in Solon, Ohio, and as his legal guardian, Kevin Bekelja, puts it, everybody Carry and the Bekeljas knew in Cleveland was there.</p>
<p>Carry, the Dukes’ do-it-all sophomore point guard, entered that game averaging 12.1 points, 4.7 assists and 3.1 rebounds per game, and now it was time to show out in front of those he grew up with.</p>
<p>Except that didn’t happen at all. Duquesne got throttled by 22 points, while Carry tallied just five points, three rebounds and zero assists to go along six turnovers.</p>
<p>“I felt for him, because it was certainly not one of his better games,” Bekelja said. “As a matter of fact, it was probably his worst game he had at Duquesne.”</p>
<p>Though he certainly wasn’t content with it, Dukes coach Keith Dambrot wasn’t surprised. He’s been around Carry long enough to know the kind of person and player he is. Carry ticks with a drive to prove people wrong. Against the Thundering Herd and in front of his friends and family, that turned into a pressure to show what he can do.</p>
<p>In other words, as Dambrot says it, Carry has a chip on his shoulder that cuts both ways. It’s mostly a blessing, particularly when all eyes are on an opponent and Carry feels he can steal the show. But every so often, it can be a curse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Either way, it has helped shape Carry, and it’s nothing that’s going to change any time soon.</p>
<p>The Bekelja family moved from Philadelphia to Hermitage, Mercer County, for Kevin’s work; he helped his company open a new facility in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Kevin coached his daughter’s AAU basketball team, and Carry’s sister Marissa was on the roster. She became close with the family, and Sincere formed a bond with their son, Mike.</p>
<p>But the Bekeljas were accustomed to life in Philadelphia and grew uneasy in rural Hermitage. Eventually, they decided to move toward Cleveland, settling on Solon — about 60 miles west of Hermitage — as the destination.</p>
<p>Carry’s childhood had its share of ups and downs. Knowing the quality of the school district in Solon, and the bond his son and Sincere had formed, Kevin asked Sincere’s mother if they could take him along to Ohio, to which she agreed.</p>
<p>Once in Solon, Carry’s basketball abilities took off. The Bekeljas had a court in their backyard, where their two daughters, Dee and Jordan, Mike and Sincere would play along with other neighborhood kids.</p>
<p>This isn’t uncommon, neighborhood kids playing basketball. What separated this particular court, though, was the quality of play. Jordan went on to play at Clarion. Dee plays at DePaul, currently the No. 13-ranked women’s basketball team. Mike plays at the International Sports Academy in Willoughby, Ohio. These were high level talents in the Bekelja’s backyard, and Sincere fit right in.</p>
<p>“He was competitive from the start, whether it was in the backyard, whether it was AAU, whether it was school basketball, the one-on-one games we played every day,” Kevin said. “He and I would watch Allen Iverson films and then go outside and practice it. And I knew right away, we’d watch Iverson on film, and then we’d come out and he would get it right away. And I was like, ‘Hmm, he’s gonna be pretty good.’ ”</p>
<p>By the time Sincere hit sixth grade, there were YouTube videos of him playing. One currently has more than 18,000 views.</p>
<p>“It’s just all my highlights that whole year, my first year in Cleveland,” Carry said. “It’s crazy that I was doing some of that stuff since the sixth grade.”</p>

<p>Before his freshman year of high school ball, an AAU highlight tape garnered even more views. Carry visited West Virginia that fall. He was tracking toward large accomplishments.</p>
<p>Then came the injuries.</p>
<p>Sincere broke a growth plate in his hand his freshman season, and he was forced to sit out for an extended period of time. The years following brought bone chips in his knees. There was no structural or ligament damage, but Carry had to sit out again.</p>
<p>With that, the coaches stopped calling, the scholarship offers never came, the recruitment died.</p>
<p>“A lot of college coaches thought I tore my ACL,” Carry said. “But none of them contacted me to communicate and ask. They just all assumed it.”</p>
<p>Added Bekelja: “The only thing I can think of, I mean we ran it around and around in our head a bazillion times during the time when there was no one calling and no one writing and no interest at all, that it just had to be from the injuries and him not being able to be on the court.”</p>
<p>Fully healthy for his senior season, Carry came back with a vengeance. He averaged 23.3 points and eight assists per game that year, leading Solon to a runner-up finish in the state championship. He made first team all-state and was a finalist for 2018 Mr. Ohio Basketball.</p>
<p>The entire time, he waited for college interest. The only offer that came was from West Liberty, a Division II school in West Virginia’s panhandle.</p>
<p>Carry says he wasn’t necessarily worried about going D-I or D-II at the time. He just wanted to go to college for free. That doesn’t mean he wasn’t motivated.</p>
<p>Each game his senior season, he knew which kids on opposing teams were going to which colleges. They symbolized the opportunities Carry wasn’t afforded while he was injured.</p>
<p>“Once the season started ... you could tell he was on a mission,” Bekelja said. “... It was not a mission to go somewhere else. Because in our minds, he was going to West Liberty. And in his mind, he was going to West Liberty. But it was a mission to show everybody that they screwed up. And that’s what that whole entire season was about. Outside of winning with his buddies at the high school, it was about showing everybody that they messed up.”</p>
<p>Added Carry: “I mean, it just sucked. But I don’t know, I just always felt like something would come my way eventually, because I felt like I was killing it every year, but just nothing happened. But I just always thought that a team or a coach would offer me eventually, but I waited until after my senior year to get a Division I offer.”</p>
<p>Dambrot attended Solon’s state championship games — the semifinals and the finals — and rued what seemed to be a lost opportunity.</p>
<p>“So we go to the state tournament, and the semifinal game, I said, ‘Man, Terry, that guy’s good.’ ” Dambrot said. “And [Duquesne assistant coach Terry Weigand] said, ‘Yeah, I think he’s really good.’ And then we go to the finals and same thing, he’s really good. And I said, ‘It’s a shame that he signed at West Liberty.’ ”</p>
<p>Then, the rumblings began. Dambrot heard from another college coach that Carry may not be fully sold on West Liberty.</p>
<p>“Trust me, I have nothing but great things to say about West Liberty, but I knew at the time that that wasn’t his dream place to play,” Bekelja said. “But he certainly wanted to secure that he was going to be able to play after high school, because he loved basketball so much.”</p>
<p>Carry and Bekelja, meanwhile, heard the Dukes might be interested, if Carry could get his release from West Liberty.</p>
<p>They were aware of Dambrot because of his background at Akron, a close-to-home mid-major. So when the release came through, Bekelja called Dambrot and set up a visit for the same day. Carry came and committed immediately.</p>
<p>On the Bekelja’s car ride home, Dambrot called Kevin to ask him a question.</p>
<p>“[Dambrot] said, ‘Hey, your kid doesn’t care who I have here, does he?’ ” Bekelja said. “I said, ‘Nope.’ He said, ‘I love him. He [couldn’t] care less.’ He’s not asking, like, ‘Hey, who do you have returning point guard?’ It doesn’t matter. He just believes in himself and figures he’s gonna outwork anybody.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, Carry did just that. He started Duquesne’s first game of the 2018-19 season. In the second game, he dropped 32 points and eight assists on Illinois Chicago.</p>
<p>Over time, that type of scoring hasn’t been replicable; it remains his career high. Instead, Carry has developed every other facet of his game, becoming someone who fills the box score in multiple categories while also doing the things that don’t show up in the box at all.</p>
<p>“Whether he scores two, four or 15 [points], he should only be judged on whether we win or not,” Dambrot said. “If we win, he should be first team all-league. Now, he won’t be, but he should. If we win this league, it’ll be because he’s that good.”</p>
<p>Earlier this season, Dambrot called his point guard the ultimate underdog.</p>
<p>In some cases, that results in what Carry did to the Atlantic 10 scoring leader, St. Joseph’s Ryan Daly, this season. When Duquesne played the Hawks, Carry held Daly to three points, far off his 20.4 point-per-game average.</p>
<p>Against Marshall, that script was flipped. All of Carry’s people were there in his corner, and he struggled.</p>
<p>Kevin says he and Sincere talk after almost every game, discussing what went well, what didn’t, among other things.&nbsp;They didn’t talk much after the Dukes lost to Marshall.</p>
<p>“I was upset after the game, because I played really bad,” Carry said. “I just felt like I let my family and all my friends down who came to see me.”</p>
<p>The support Carry received from his family after playing the Thundering Herd helped him, though. Maybe if he gets another crack at playing in front of those people, he’ll use that experience for the good.</p>
<p>At the very least, Carry has gained some perspective from the last few years.</p>
<p>Asked if he feels like the ultimate underdog, Carry speaks beyond his basketball stats.</p>
<p>“Nobody in my family, my real family, has ever been to this point in life,” Carry said. “And I don’t think at the beginning, nobody ever thought I would be here. So I’ve always got a chip on my shoulder, and just playing against better competition, I think I’m always the underdog in those situations.”</p>
<p>For his part, Carry would never change that. While those around him feel he can be too hard on himself sometimes, Carry knows it’s what has driven him this far.</p>
<p>The chip is more like a boulder. With each bit of adversity, a little more weight piles on, and Carry goes harder to hold it.</p>
<p>“It’s where I come from, Farrell, Pa.,” Carry said. “I’ve just got a little bit of grit in me there. Then moving to Cleveland, just getting underrecruited. Playing in front of colleges and stuff, and nobody just even contacted me.</p>
<p>“I’ve just been doubted my whole life, and I’m not even supposed to be here. So I’m just trying to prove everybody wrong.”</p>
