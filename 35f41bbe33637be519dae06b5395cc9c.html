<h1>Pandemic may cause serious financial blow to Pittsburgh Public Schools</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Budget projections presented to the Pittsburgh Public Schools board Tuesday evening showed the district — already in a tough financial position —&nbsp;may face severe revenue losses because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district&nbsp;entered the year with a $25 million deficit and&nbsp;will likely see an increased shortfall because of the pandemic’s impact on local tax revenues, state and federal funding, and the increased costs associated with remote instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ronald Joseph, the district’s chief financial officer, told the board that the district could see a loss of up to $82 million in local revenue. He also said that although there are some areas where money has been saved, the district’s most significant expenditures continue to be paid.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“There’s a lot of discussion that when school districts are closed there is a substantial cost savings,” Mr. Joseph said. “But our major cost items, we’re still required to pay those.”</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph presented board members with several financial scenarios that the district could experience amid the pandemic. All of the projections showed an increase to the district’s deficit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario, Mr. Joseph said, would be if the revenues followed the same trend as they had through the end of April.</p>
<p>If that were to occur, the district would see a 13% loss in local revenue, or about $82 million. That would cause the district’s deficit to&nbsp;increase by almost four times to $95.9 million, and the fund balance would be negative by $7 million by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“If this was the case with nothing else happening —&nbsp;just that reduction in revenue — we would likely not be able to make it through the year in terms of operations,” Mr. Joseph said.</p>
<p>A more&nbsp;“optimistic” scenario he presented showed the loss of local revenue at $17 million would add only $5 million to the district’s deficit. However, the loss in revenue would push the date where the district would not be solvent up by one year from 2023 — which was projected in the 2020 budget — to 2022.</p>
<p>“So in 2022, based on the increases in the deficits, we would not pass a balanced budget ... and be out of money at the end of that year, or at some point during that year,” Mr. Joseph said.</p>
<p>Mr. Joseph also presented two projections from the Pennsylvania Association of School Business Officials that showed deficits of $62.5 million and $56.6 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>None of the projections took into account state and federal funding schools may receive, because too much remains unknown.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is projecting a $4 billion decrease in revenue, representing a 10% to 12% shortfall. Mr. Joseph said that means the district should not expect an increase in basic education funding in 2021, and there will likely be cuts to offset losses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state applied for $523 million through the federal CARES Act, about 90% of which would go to local education agencies, according to Mr. Joseph. PPS was slated to receive an allocation of $11.1 million through the CARES Act, though it may be less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Act 13 enacted by the state ensures that schools continue to pay some of their largest expenditures, including salaries, benefits and charter school tuition. While there have been some savings on overtime pay and costs for after-school programming, those expenditures have not decreased significantly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the district has spent more than $2.6 million for laptops, Wi-Fi hot spots, instructional packets and other items and services needed for remote learning since schools closed in March.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m not quite sure that the public truly understands the position that the school system is in,” board member Cynthia Falls said following the presentation.&nbsp;“That’s what a lot of people are thinking, that now because we’re not in school, we don’t have these bills, we’re not paying — some people think not even staff. And it’s like,&nbsp;‘No, wait a minute.’”&nbsp;</p>
