<h1>Paul Zeise: Hall of Fame voting process has become a farce</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are people convinced that the voting process in the Iowa Democratic caucuses was the biggest disaster of its kind of the year. They obviously haven’t taken notice of the Hall of Fame voting for both baseball and football.</p>
<p>Compared to what I’ve seen — and the explanations that have followed — from Hall of Fame voters, the Iowa caucus voting process was a well-oiled, fine-tuned machine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the biggest issue in these processes is simple: voters have begun to take themselves way too seriously and have increasingly decided they would be gatekeeper. This has led to votes that have ranged from absolutely idiotic, to downright dumb, to just misguided.</p>
<p>The latest and best example of this is Peter King, who is one of the best sports writers in America. I love his MMQB columns each week, I used to love what he did when he was with Sports Illustrated. He is both dialed in to the NFL and consistently breaks or advances stories.</p>
<p>I love King’s work, so it pains me to say this, but he should lose his right to vote for the Hall of Fame after what he did this past weekend. King didn’t vote for Troy Polamalu. That in and of itself is bad enough because Polamalu is by every definition a lock Hall of Famer. He is a no-brainer and should have been on every ballot.</p>
<p>Now, believe it or not, King’s biggest sin wasn’t that he left Polamalu off his ballot; it is <em>why</em> he left Polamalu off. Here is <a href="https://steelersdepot.com/2020/02/peter-king-explains-his-absurd-reason-for-not-voting-troy-polamalu-into-hall-of-fame/" target="_blank">the long version</a>&nbsp;of King’s explanation, but the short version is this: He left Polamalu off because he was trying to help other guys get in. He knew Polamalu would get in anyway, and even though he was one of the five best guys, he decided to leave him off the ballot.</p>
<p>That, in a nutshell, is what is wrong with the process. And now far too often we are talking about the voters and their votes as opposed to the actual classes. It is absolutely silly. Journalists are never supposed to be a part of the story, but they are increasingly becoming just that when it comes to Hall of Fame voting.</p>
<p>It is simple — stop trying to manipulate the process, stop with the holier-than-thou and pretentious stances about certain players, stop making ridiculous votes for obscure players or players who clearly aren’t Hall of Famers, and vote for the best players on the ballot every year.</p>
<p>Football makes it simple: vote for the five best players on the ballot. If writers did that every time, they wouldn’t have to manipulate ballots to get certain guys in. And if a guy needs ballots and voting to be manipulated to get in, they are not Hall of Famers. King admits he was supposed to vote for the five best players but decided not to. That’s all I needed to hear — take his vote for five years, at least, for dereliction of duty..</p>
<p>This shouldn’t be hard, but it is for some. Every year there is at least a handful of baseball writers who make ridiculous votes for players like Paul Konerko because he is a nice guy who had a decent career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The guy who left Derek Jeter off his ballot also should lose his ballot. He has made a wise decision, though, to keep his ballot secret because there is no explanation for it. Jeter should have been on every single ballot, as should a bunch of others.</p>
<p>It isn’t hard. Vote for the best players, the most worthy players, the Hall of Famers, and move on.</p>
<p>I hate the pretentiousness of the&nbsp;“anti-steroid” voters. I think they are misguided and using the&nbsp;“morals clause” as a cop out for not voting for Barry Bonds. The “morals clause” is a joke, too, because it leaves far too much up for interpretation and for voters to make ridiculous decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is a problem for the baseball Hall of Fame, but it is part of a larger problem with both Halls of Fame. There needs to be a different process for putting players in because this current system is broken. And when a voter can openly admit he didn’t vote the way he was supposed to because he was trying to manipulate the process, that’s a bigger problem.</p>
<p>The system needs fixed, and this responsibility needs to be handed to a different group of voters who understand what they are supposed to do.</p>
