<h1>Hallowine Trail is spread out over 3 destinations and 4 weekends</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Hallowine Tour was already spread out across Lawrence County at various Nova Destinations venues, but this COVID-19-crimped year, it’s spread out even more -— over four weekends of Oct. 8-10, 15-17, 22-24 and 29-31.</p>
<p>Tickets — $30 for individuals, $50 for twosomes and $15 for designated drivers -— are on sale for the self-guided tour stopping at Volant, New Wilmington and Pulaski, north of Pittsburgh. Only 50 tickets are available for each day. At each stop, participants will get a pre-wrapped snack item as well as drinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Knockin Noggin, it’s a one cider flight (four 5-ounce samples), one wine flight (four 2-ounce samples) and a 6-ounce pour of your favorite. &nbsp;</p>
<p>At Fractured Grape, it’s one wine flight and a 6-ounce pour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At adjacent Hop Asylum, it’s one beer flight (four 5-ounce samples) and a 5-ounce pour.</p>
<p>At&nbsp;Nova Cellars, it’s a wine flight and a 6-ounce pour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And at adjacent Brew 32, it’s a beer flight and a 5-ounce pour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While in each tasting room, staffers and guests must wear masks and follow other measures to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pennsylvania Pure Distilleries wins so many awards for its spirits that it’s almost not news, but this is big: The Shaler distillery’s Boyd &amp; Blair Potato Vodka has been ranked the top&nbsp;vodka and No. 4 overall spirit on the second annual Ultimate Spirits Challenge Top 100&nbsp;Spirits list.&nbsp;The vodka was 30th last year. Cofounder and master distiller Barry&nbsp;Young said in a release that he’s “thrilled to improve&nbsp;our ranking. ...&nbsp;My philosophy is not going to change and I am proud of this recognition that&nbsp;reflects the hard work and dedication we continue to put into our spirits.”&nbsp;See the full list at <a href="https://www.ultimate-beverage.com/upload/editor/2020/USC_2020_Top100_LR.pdf?r=1598878991" target="_blank">https://www.ultimate-beverage.com/upload/editor/2020/USC_2020_Top100_LR.pdf?r=1598878991</a>. These kudos elaborate on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/07/31/Drinks-Pennsylvania-Pure-Distilleries-wins-in-Ultimate-Spirits-Challenge/stories/202007310106" target="_blank">Ultimate Spirits</a>&nbsp;honors the distillery won this summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Winery Association got some drinks writers and others together Thursday via a Zoom session for “Camp Pennawine,” an online trip to and tastings from wineries in the state’s Susquehanna Valley. The fourth such camp had to be virtual due to COVID-19. But thanks to video,&nbsp;participants got to check out the vines with the Zimmerman family at Shade Mountain Winery &amp; Vineyard, one of the state’s largest with 30 different varieties of grapes, and taste two wines (to the tune of the propane cannons to scare away grape-greedy starlings). &nbsp;“Our yields are really low,” he said of this season, which was marked by a hard May frost, but the weather has been great since.&nbsp;“Quality-wise, it’s been a very good year.”</p>
<p>Fero Vineyards &amp; Winery’s Chuck Zaleski depicted and discussed wine production — “Best fruit I’ve ever seen” he said of this year’s crop, because of the extended California-like weather&nbsp;— after which he led a tasting of two wines. The 2019 Gruner Veltliner is one that is available at some state Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores.</p>
<p>Wineries also may direct ship to customers’ homes, which is a way that Pittsburghers can experience more of the wines being made by many small producers across this big state. Otherwise, as pandemic conditions and restrictions allow, the wine region and its wineries welcome visitors.

<p>Red Star Kombucha, which recently moved to a new space in Larimer, sold off its remaining fermented tea and equipment this week as founder Naomi Auth has decided, due to COVID-19 and other difficulties, to permanently close. As she posted on Facebook, “I have to walk into the future with an open heart and mind, trusting that what I'm supposed to be doing will be made clear.”</p>
