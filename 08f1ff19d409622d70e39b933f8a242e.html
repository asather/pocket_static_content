<p>The AmeriServ Flood City Music Festival is the latest festival to give up on 2020.</p>
<p>The Johnstown Area Heritage Association announced Friday that the music festival, which was set to run July 31 through Aug. 1 in Peoples Natural Gas Park, is canceled.</p>
<p>“We waited to make this decision as long as we could, hoping for more clarity on when large gatherings like concerts and festivals would be possible – but at this point, no one knows, and we cannot continue in a holding pattern,” said Ron Carnevali, festival chairman said in a statement. “It is now time to let our patrons, sponsors, volunteers, and artists know that the 2020 festival is canceled. We are deeply disappointed, as we’d done a great deal of planning and were even ready to announce a lineup.”</p>
<p>Along with the health risks, the chairman noted the challenges related to sponsorship support and selling advance tickets.</p>
<p>“Our sponsors are the lifeblood of the event and have been incredibly supportive, but many of them are feeling the financial effects of this crisis,” Carnevali said. “And in the current climate, it would be extremely difficult to sell advance tickets.”</p>
<p>Thus far, the Three Rivers Arts Festival,&nbsp;Deutschtown Music Festival, Millvale Music Festival, Thunder in the Valley and Delfest have all canceled.</p>
