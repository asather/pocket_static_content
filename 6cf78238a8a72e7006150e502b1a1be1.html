<h1>Penguins will take over the NHL Network on Wednesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL season may be on pause. But on Wednesday, Penguins fans who can't get to a TV will want to push record on their DVRs.</p>
<p>The NHL Network will run 13 consecutive hours of Penguins content. The special day of programming will highlight some of the franchise's biggest games and most significant historical moments.</p>
<p>The marathon begins at 10 a.m. with Game 6 of the 1991 Stanley Cup final. During that game, the Penguins beat Minnesota, 8-0, as Mario Lemieux hoisted the Stanley Cup for the first time.</p>
<p>At noon, the day continues with Game 4 of the 1992 Stanley Cup final in Chicago, another series-clinching game.</p>
<p>From 2 p.m. to 4 p.m., NHL Network will air “Pens Pulse.” That’s followed by “In The Room” from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Another Cup-clinching game follows at 6 p.m. This time, NHL Network will take fans back to Game 6 of the 2016 Stanley Cup final at San Jose. The day concludes with “Pittsburgh is Home: The Story of the Penguins.”</p>
<p>In addition to the content on NHL Network, AT&amp;T SportsNet will continue to show classic Penguins games and archived shows on Monday, Wednesday and Friday nights.</p>
