<h1>All Service Academies Ball</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>When and where:</strong> Dec. 30 at the DoubleTree by Hilton in Marshall.</p>
<p><strong>#ThankYouForYourService:</strong> It was a meaningful night for 170 guests at the 21st Western Pennsylvania All Service Academies Ball, which honors young men and women who attend one of the five U.S. service academies. The formal event kicked off with a cocktail reception, where partygoers mingled and some met the guest of honor, retired Brig. Gen. Dave Papak, U.S. Marine Corps, who said: “Great leaders are needed everywhere, from small communities to large cities to platoons across the world.”&nbsp;After the sit-down dinner — and red, white and blue candy bar — came dancing, casino games and a silent auction. The funds raised supported this year’s charity: <a href="https://ammv.us/" target="_blank">The American Merchant Marine Veterans — Three Rivers Chapter </a>and&nbsp;<a href="https://iatw.us/" target="_blank">It’s&nbsp;About the Warrior Foundation</a><a href="https://iatw.us/" target="_blank">.</a></p>
