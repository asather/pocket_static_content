<p>FORT MYERS, Fla -- Derek Holland got off to a great start with an experimental ending in the Piratesâ€™ 2-0 win in Grapefruit League action against the Minnesota Twins at Hammond Stadium.</p>
<p>Holland struck out Ehrie Adrianza and Josh Donaldson on a combined six pitches to begin the game.</p>
<p>Nelson Cruz slashed a line drive to right field for the first hit of the game. Holland quickly shut things down after the Cruz single by getting Eddie Rosario to pop up.</p>
<p>Holland worked a quick second inning with Alex Avila, Jake Cave, and Royce Lewis, making soft contact for outs.</p>
<p>Holland decided to work on his offspeed pitches in the third frame. It started well with two quick outs. However, Holland couldn't finish off the inning. The last batter he faced was Cruz, who he walked after hitting Adrianza with a pitch and giving up a double to Donaldson.</p>
<p>"I feel really good about today," Holland said. "After getting the pitch count where you want it to be, you've got to take the opportunity to work on stuff you haven't thrown. I got the results I needed to."</p>
<p>The Pirates also got a needed result with their first victory of spring. It was the first spring training win for Derek Shelton as the Pirates' manager.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Blake Weiman received an intriguing test during the bottom of the third inning. Rosario hit 32 home runs and drove in 109 runs in 2019. Now Weiman had to get him out with the bases loaded. Even in a spring training game, an at-bat like this gets the adrenaline flowing.</p>
<p>"You gotta stay within yourself and not get focused on who you're facing," Weiman said. "The manager puts the ball in your hands and you have a job to do. You have to get it done."</p>
<p>Weiman did. He rung up Weiman with a three-pitch strikeout.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>Montana DuRapau turned a smooth double-play on a comebacker to the mound. Ryan Jeffers hit a ball toward DuRapau, who quickly threw it to Jake Elmore at second base to get Pittsburgh native Alex Kirilloff. Elmore threw to Will Craig at first to complete the play.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Jose Osuna blasted a ball to left field. On most days, that would've been a home run. The whipping wind caught the ball, which landed in front of a confused left fielder. Osuna ended up at second with an RBI to give the Pirates a 1-0 lead.</p>
<p>Kevin Kramer belted a single to drive in Will Craig for the second run in the ninth inning.</p>
<p><strong>Of note</strong></p>
<p>Clay Holmes left the game after getting struck by&nbsp;a ball off Cruz's bat on his right ankle in the bottom of the sixth. Holmes will be re-evaluated Sunday morning.</p>
