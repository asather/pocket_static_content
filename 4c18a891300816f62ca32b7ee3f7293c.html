<h1>Peters school board’s 2020-21 budget includes tax increase </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Peters Township School Board on Monday unanimously approved imposing a 0.35 mill tax increase as part of the district’s $71.2 million budget for 2020-21.</p>
<p>The increase, which amounts to about $35 more in taxes per $100,000 of assessed property value, puts the district’s millage at 13.81 mills.</p>
<p>District officials cited an increase in debt service due to construction borrowing for the new Peters Township High School as well as teacher and staff salaries as the major contributors to the tax increase. The district has 24 teachers reaching the jump step, which comes with a salary increase. That’s nearly double the number of teachers in any other given year.</p>
<p>In other business, Roshelle Fennell of Reynolds Construction updated the board on the progress of the new high school.</p>
<p>The building along East McMurray Road is set to open in January in spite of a few setbacks created by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Ms. Fennell said the natatorium may not be finished by the time the building opens.</p>
<p>“This is the one area that is struggling,” Ms. Fennell said.</p>
<p>She said the pool contractor has been working, but he has “been hit hard” by COVID-19, and a lot of his employees not coming back to work.</p>
<p>Additionally, she said, the auditorium may not quite be finished for the opening of the school.</p>
<p>Board member Jamison Hardy said he was happy with the progress and was not concerned about the auditorium and natatorium not being ready when the building opens.</p>
<p>“Those areas will not prevent us from opening on schedule,” Mr. Hardy said, adding that the natatorium and auditorium really have no impact on academics in the school, and workers can continue finishing up in those areas while the students are back in school.</p>
<p>Additionally, at a June 22 meeting, the board discussed converting the current high school into a middle school.</p>
<p>The district plans to put the high school conversion process out to bid in September with hopes of signing a contract for construction in October. The estimated cost of the renovations to turn the current high school into a middle school is about $14.6 million, with alternates estimated at $2.5 million.</p>
<p>Superintendent Jeannine French updated the board on measures the district will be taking to reopen to students this fall after being closed since mid-March.</p>
<p>Ms. French told the board Monday that the administration will have a preliminary school reopening plan by the end of July. She said the administrative team has been working on a safety plan “since we closed school in March.”</p>
<p>“This is a very evolving situation,” Ms. French said. “Guidance evolves every day.”</p>
<p>She said the administration has been very thoughtful and has been taking its time looking at both public health and education.</p>
<p>“You can see a research study supporting whatever point of view you want to have,” Ms. French said, adding the district has been “cautious” and has looked at research studies carefully to make sure they have been peer-reviewed.</p>
<p>For example, Ms. French said, there was a study that showed that the attack rate of the virus is much lower in children than adults and that children are a lot less likely to be symptomatic.</p>
<p>“So, that’s a good thing for schools,” she said.</p>
<p>However, she added, there was also a study showing that the “viral load” in a child was no less than that of the viral load in adults and that transmission of the virus may be equal.</p>
<p>“From a public health prospective, that’s very concerning,” Ms. French said. “You potentially have children who are not symptomatic but have the potential to transmit disease.”</p>
<p>“Our challenge here is we have to engage in efforts we know are going to help mitigate the disease,” she said, adding that Peters wants children in the classroom. “But, if we’re contributing to the spread of disease, we are going to become a public health crisis, and we’ll be forced to shut down.”</p>
<p>The goal, Ms. French said, is to “have our children in our classrooms this fall — five days a week,” and the district is looking at all the ways to mitigate the disease and balance health and education.</p>
<p>“We know our children are best served in our classrooms,” Ms. French said.</p>
