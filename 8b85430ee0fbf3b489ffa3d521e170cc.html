<p>A male suspect is in custody after a school van in Lawrence County was struck by a bullet Tuesday morning with seven elementary-age children inside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No one inside the bus was injured, authorities said.</p>
<p>At around 8:43 a.m., the van was on its way to Shenango Elementary School and heading south on Ellwood Road when a bullet went through one window and exited out the window on the other side, according to district Superintendent Michael Schreck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Schreck said police told him that a male suspect was in custody but did not have any further details about the person.</p>
<p>Shenango Police and New Castle Police could not be reached for comment. On itâ€™s Facebook account, Shenango Police posted a message that they had a suspect in custody.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The school was placed on a two-hour lockdown that was lifted at around 11:30 a.m. when police informed Mr. Schreck that a suspect was in custody.</p>
<p>Mr. Schreck said parents of the children who were on the bus were notified about the incident and arrived at the school. One child went home. The others stayed at the school, Mr. Schreck said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Schreck said he is thankful for the quick response by the different responding police departments and is sending a letter to parents to notify them about what happened and the steps the district will take moving forward.</p>
