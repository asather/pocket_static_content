<h1>Raymond Bergman | A strong, quiet leader who bonded with students</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Beloved father, teacher and football coach Raymond “Ray” Bergman was known as tough but fair.</p>
<p>“The man would walk into the room and get a standing ovation,” said Cathy Roppa, who taught at Quaker Valley Junior High School in Sewickley when Mr. Bergman was principal.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergman, of Hampton, died February 7 of congestive heart failure. He was 94.</p>
<p>Those who knew him best called him “a man of few words,” and said his wife of 63 years, Patricia Day Bergman, did most of their talking. But what he lacked in words, he made up in his actions.</p>
<p>He always made an effort to bond with students who came from a difficult home or struggled in school, said Ms. Roppa, and he once took a group of “troublemaker boys” out fishing.</p>
<p>Marsha Wilkins, a former substitute teacher at Quaker Valley, said Mr. Bergman gave struggling kids leadership opportunities often reserved for the star students, like showing new kids around or ushering school plays. She said he changed school culture for the better.</p>
<p>On his 80th birthday, his grandchildren compiled a list of 80 reasons they loved their grandfather. The 80th reason read: “He’s simply the best man we ever knew.”</p>
<p>Born Jan. 19, 1929 on the North Side, Mr. Bergman graduated from North Catholic High School. After serving in the Army during WWII, he graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and later earned a masters from Duquesne University.</p>
<p>He began his English teaching career at North Catholic, but eventually moved to Quaker Valley, where he taught and coached football before becoming principal.</p>
<p>He was quarterback during his high school years and loved football all his life. He played into his 20s, but a fractured leg ended his playing days. He continued coaching and also served as a football official for the Eastern Association of Intercollegiate Football Officials and as Regional Vice President of the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>His Hall of Fame colleagues, including Paul Palmer and Dale Hamer, said he was a wonderful companion during the many road trips to company meetings.</p>
<p>His son Rick Bergman credits his long life to his love of physical fitness. He’d do calisthenics around the house, and get stares as he went for runs around the neighborhood “long before running was in vogue.”</p>
<p>His son said Catholicism was a “constant” for his father. His faith motivated the honesty and goodness for which he was known. Even in the last months, he’d attend Mass as much as he could.</p>
<p>As principal, Mr. Bergman fostered a tight-knit “family” in the school’s staff, and they continue to get together monthly, long after they’ve retired from Quaker Valley.</p>
<p>Jerry Veshio, a former teacher, coach and athletic director at Quaker Valley, said Mr. Bergman cared about the small things that contributed to staff culture.</p>
<p>He said Mr. Bergman once called him into his office when he didn’t attend the going away party of a fellow staff member. Although the gathering was after school hours and not mandatory, Mr. Bergman told Mr. Veshio he had disrespected his community by skipping the event.</p>
<p>Mr. Bergman’s 1986 retirement gave him a new lease on life. He spent his last decades travelling the world with his wife. He visited his son in Argentina at age 90.</p>
<p>He also devoted many hours of retirement to community service at the St. Vincent de Paul Association and delivering Meals-On-Wheels.</p>
<p>When his wife passed away last year, Mr. Bergman never fully recovered, said his son. He also was preceded in death by his brothers Bill, Gerard and Charles, and his daughter Marta Turnbull.</p>
<p>He was survived by his children Rick Bergman, Bobbe Warrick and Betsy Branham; his sister Rosemary Amurgis; his son-in-law, Scott Turnbull and 12 grandchildren.</p>
<p>The funeral Mass was Feb. 12. Burial was Feb. 14 at Holy Savior Cemetery in Richland.</p>
