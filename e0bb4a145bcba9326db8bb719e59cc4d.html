<h1>Keith C. Burris: Seeking the spirit in strange times</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Passover, Good Friday and Easter in lockdown. How does a nation pray in layer after layer of separation — with many in isolation?</p>
<p>Most of us are not contemplatives.</p>
<p>Indeed, even most monks do the bulk of their praying in community.</p>
<p>How do average people marry off their kids or bury their parents when the nation is in quarantine and we can only visit our old through glass and mourn the dead in groups of 10 or less?</p>
<p>And how does a holy person tend his flock and feed his own soul?</p>
<p>I asked Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of the Tree of Life synagogue how he is coping.</p>
<p>“For me,” he said, “it is a matter of being displaced a second time; of a congregation being made homeless a second time.” He and his flock are re-enacting the diaspora.</p>
<p>And yet he sees goodness, maybe even Godness, all around him.</p>
<p>We should use this time, with ourselves and our families, well he says. “It's not bankable.”</p>
<p>How do you sustain yourself? I ask the rabbi.</p>
<p>"Every Friday night I do services on Facebook. As I am speaking and the service is moving along, hearts, balloons and thumbs bubble up from the bottom of the screen. This tells me that what I am doing is important and it feeds me.”</p>
<p>We need to develop the same habits of neighborliness and kindness in good times as we see in dark times, says the rabbi. “We <em>will</em> change as a society. I have hope about how.”</p>
<p>As with the aftermath of the Tree of Life massacre, he has sometimes been overwhelmed with the acts of kindness he has witnessed. “Imagine if we got accustomed to it,” he says.</p>
<p>I spoke with the Rev. Tom Hall, of First Presbyterian Church in Pittsburgh — the city's oldest religious institution. He told me that the challenge for his church, from the start, has been how to create a community when there was not an organic one.</p>
<p>Early in the last century, when most mainline churches in Downtown Pittsburgh were leaving for the suburbs, his church rebuilt here — investing in a downtown with no natural church base.</p>
<p>Now people are back in Downtown Pittsburgh, but they are empty nesters, millennials, the homeless, and businessmen and women.</p>
<p>His challenge: How to stitch together a community of conviction.</p>
<p>The quasi-lockdown of the city, and the closing of all churches, is the latest challenge to reinvention.</p>
<p>But, says Rev. Hall, in all events and moments there is a simple truth: “God made us for each other.”</p>
<p>God says in Genesis, “It is not good for man to be alone.”</p>
<p>"Our God,” says Rev. Hall, “is a communal God — Father, Son and Holy Spirit.” Rev. Hall calls the notion that each person can be his own church and find God completely on his or her own “a lie.”</p>
<p>He goes on to note that the word deacon means “compassionate servant.” This, he says, is what Jesus was, and why deacons are essential to the leadership of his church, especially in outreach.</p>
<p>His church must, for the moment, reinvent its service model. It must be practical in a changed context. “Our homeless and walk-in ministry must be brought to the people individually, where possible,” he says.</p>
<p>How has his job changed in a COVID-19 world? It hasn't really, except in application. “I must be there for the people … live what I preach ... walk the walk.”</p>
<p>It's hard but not complicated.</p>
<p>Tom Hall tells me that his wife, Jana, keeps him centered by “warning me against distractions and busyness.”</p>
<p>“I remind myself of God’s promises and all the ways that I have been blessed.</p>
<p>"When God blesses you, it is so you can bless others.”</p>
<p>Finally, I spoke with Bishop David Zubik, of the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh. I know he is a bishop, but I think of him as a pastor.</p>
<p>“A pastor is how I think of myself,” he says.</p>
<p>He tells me how very hard it was for him to actually close churches and cancel Masses.</p>
<p>It was a relief to know his predecessor had to do the same in 1918.</p>
<p>"We became the risk,” the bishop says. The choice was no choice at all. But it was painful to enact.</p>
<p>"But some 22,000 people joined us for Mass last Sunday,” he tells me. Knowing people are there and praying with him lifts him. Virtual connection becomes reality — something holy instead of remote.</p>
<p>"I imagine the faces in the pews as I say Mass. I don't know them, but I see them ... I also have Post-it notes in my breviary for all the people I have been asked, or volunteered, to pray for. I imagine those people, too.”</p>
<p>Two of my children live in Brooklyn, N.Y. They each now have Post-it notes in the bishop's breviary.</p>
<p>"Our busyness is not helpful for families.</p>
<p>"My prayer is that this is an invitation to families to get to know each other. Maybe again. Maybe for the first time.”</p>
<p>We have been given a chance to reconnect, vertically and horizontally, as it were — to draw closer at a distance.</p>
<p>Most people want to be close to God in some way. Pope Benedict XVI once told an interviewer that there are as many ways to do that as there are people.</p>
<p>"And my hope,” says Bishop Zubik, “is that this pandemic may bring people closer to God. Not in a snapping of fingers and making bad things instantly go away sort of way, but in a genuine way.</p>
<p>"There is a silver lining in this heavy cloud, there for the taking.”</p>
