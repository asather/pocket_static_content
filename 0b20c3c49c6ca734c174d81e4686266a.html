<h1>State Rep. Bill Kortz to retire from 38th District seat</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State Rep. Bill Kortz, a Democrat who has represented Pittsburgh's southeastern suburbs for seven terms and who recently played an integral role in expanding Sunday hunting in Pennsylvania, announced his retirement on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Kortz, the Democratic chairman of the House Game and Fisheries Commission, will retire from his 38th District seat at the end of the current legislative session on Nov. 30.</p>
<p>"Retiring certainly wasn’t an easy decision, because I enjoy helping residents with home heating assistance, rent rebates, PennDOT and tax preparation, to name a few," Mr. Kortz wrote in a statement. "But, it’s now time for me to take care of my health and step aside for future leaders of this great district."</p>
<p>Having previously worked for three decades as an operations manager for U.S. Steel, Mr. Kortz was first elected to the state House in 2006 after Harrisburg was rocked by the legislative pay raise scandal. Mr. Kortz once cited the pay raises — given to lawmakers and public officials in the early morning hours — as a catalyst for his start in politics.</p>
<p>In his retirement announcement, Mr. Kortz touted his committee's leadership on the Sunday hunting law as one of his successes. Signed into law in October, the bill expanded hunting on three Sundays per year.</p>
<p>Since Mr. Kortz will finish out the session, voters will choose his successor as normal in this year's elections. West Mifflin Mayor Chris Kelly is pursuing the Democratic nomination and is seeking the county committee's endorsement.</p>
