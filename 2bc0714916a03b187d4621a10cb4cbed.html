<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 06.17.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we will be starting our chat soon so get those questions ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, let's get started...go!!</p>
<p><strong>Ebonheart</strong>: Given today's climate, is there any chance that the NFL would just consider NOT playing the anthem before games these days? The whole Anthem before sporting events seems a post WW2 phenomenon that never seemed to go away. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It became a TV thing. Teams used to be in the locker room when the anthem was played. That would seem to be a simple solution to the issue, but, if that happened now, the league and networks would be assailed for trying to run from and even hide from what is happening.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: Do you think with Ben's arm repaired that he will be actually better than the last 3-4 years? Even without AB? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think he was pretty good the last 3-4 years.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Gerry Do you think fans will be able to watch some of the practices at Heinz Field? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Absolutely not. I'm not sure if the media will be allowed.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: Just a comment, I believe the teams with the most returning staff and player vets who know systems will have a HUGE advantage over other teams with the loss of practice time. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No question about it. It's a big setback for a rookie coach and rookie staff. It's not so much a huge advantage for teams such as the Steelers but it is a drawback for a new head coach</p>
<p><strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Hi Gerry! Who do you think locks down the final WR spot on the roster this year, Switzer or Deon Cain? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Big Ed, they are different types of receivers of course. Switzer is a possession guy who has a good relationship with Ben. Cain, who I really like, is a lot like the other receivers in body type and style. So, to your question, I'm betting Switzer.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - Thanks for the chats. Is Mark Barron's replacement on the roster, or do you think an add will have to be made down the road? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think the Steelers are looking to bring in anyone now who will step in and play that position on a regular basis. They would have done that by now.</p>
<p><strong>odb</strong>: what did james washington do to big ben? ben avoided throwing to him like staying away from the virus. He may have dropped a couple a balls but he was a second rounder for a reason.I hope big ben has a better rapport with all his receivers and not just switzer, but maybe it is personal.your thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think that is or will be an issue at all. And I wouldn't exactly say he has a great rapport with Switzer. If anyone, he has a great rapport on the field with JuJu, as it should be.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Gerry. Taking the actual backup QB situation out of it, I'm just curious about the locker room dynamic and Mike Tomlin in particular. How would the locker room handle Colin Kaepernick? Do you think Tomlin secretly wishes he could be the guy to end our long national nightmare and put this guy on a roster? If any org could withstand the heat, I think it's Pittsburgh. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: In this situation, the decision would not be up to Tomlin. It would go above him. But I also don't think he harbors any thoughts of establishing a legacy by being the guy to bring back CK.</p>
<p><strong>Entmd</strong>: Hi Gerry, do you see any scenario where Dupree has a great year, Juju has a mediocre year where Dupree gets long term deal and JuJu isn’t resigned? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not really. One is not dependent on the other. I think Bud plays 2020 and 2021 (maybe) on the franchise tag and that's it. After they pay Watt, I don't see them being able to pay Dupree the kind of money he could get on the free-agent market. I don't see Bud ever signing a long-term contract here.</p>
<p><strong>Puddintane</strong>: Is it that hard to find a long snapper you have to $1mil? All these colleges and practice squad players can’t learn the skill? Btw I was a long snapper. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sign up</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Gerry, do you think it is possible for Big Ben to play past his current contract if he plays well this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Of course it's possible. Lot of factors depend on it, Number one being if the team has a legitimate chance to win the Super Bowl, say, in 2022 (provided he feels good). But I think this could be his last deal.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I’m so hopped up on BR7 grape cool aid lm going to the Rivers Casino to bet the Steelers to win their Conference and Super Bowl. Is this a above average bet or should I save the time and gas? Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Depends how much you are willing to lay.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Dixon</strong>: Gerry- Has there been any talk about expanding NFL rosters or practice squad rosters in case a team encounters a virus outbreak? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm sure there has.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hello, Gerry. The way the NFL handles people who run on the field by not televising them. Is there a chance the NFL does the same thing with players taking a knee. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think TV started doing that last time, but given the current climate of our country and the inflammatory issues surrounding it, I don't think they will do that this time. It will become a big topic again, especially if all the players and coaches start joining in.</p>
<p><strong>B Pos</strong>: I suspect Claypool will see his snap count increase over the season, mostly over the second half. Who sees more snaps the first 8 games, Claypool or Washington? Who finishes the season with the most TD"s between the two. <br> <strong>Bigedbarr71</strong>: Gerry, who do you think is the 3rd string QB is this year? Duck or Lynch? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Lynch <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, little glitch in the system. As for Claypool-Washington, JW will get the majority of snaps and majority of catches, especially in first half. Like all rookies, Claypool's progress will be slow because of the pandemic shutdown and likely lack of preseason games to get acclimated.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: ordinaryfanman- Is there any update on how the NFL is going to handle an active player contracting Covid19 ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nothing stated, but, like Roger Goodell said the other day, there are going to be cases once the season starts. It will be shocking if there isn't.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: Will Gilbert III actually be able to be an improvement over Barron? Barron was beat often in coverage and he was hurt all the time to practice? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's what we will find out....if and when we find out. But I don't expect Gilbert to come in and be the immediate answer to that issue.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: More or less injuries due to no practices or OTA's? Tunch and Wolf talk a lot about hardening the body in camp back in the day. I wonder if that's true. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no question there will be more injuries, especially with no preseason games as I suspect. Teams will go right from 5-6 weeks of practicing to real games, with no warmup games in between. I have already been told to expect that.</p>
<p><strong>Ryno</strong>: Do you think at some point we will see the blackout rules completely go away? I live in Pennsylvania and inevitably missed two or three games every season because of Ravens games in another state. Or perhaps the possibility of being able to stream certain games individually without a season pass? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know the answer to that question because I thought all games were accessible in some form or another.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: Which of this year's Rookies gets the most snaps? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Claypool and Highsmith because they're the top two picks and the Steelers always try to get their top guys on the field to get them live-game experience and expedite their progress. I think Dotson is another possibility for sure.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: With little or no fans in the stands, I think game field audio will be tremendous for the TV viewers. It should be very eye opening to hear the trash talk and such on the field. Have you reported or watched from sideline or always in the press box? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Game-field audio would be tremendous, except the networks would have issues with the language. So would the FCC.</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: I expect Snell to make a big jump in year 2. Who else do you expect to make an impact this year, Bush, Edmond's, Minka? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, its unreasonable to expect Fitzpatrick to make a bigger impact than he already has. And it wasn't like Bush was a disappointment as a rookie. As a No. 1 pick, Edmunds needs to be more of an impact guy</p>
<p><strong>DaveInCincy</strong>: With the cap to be the same from reports, do you really think the Steelers will do many extensions besides Cams? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No I don't. I think Cam is the only target for an extension right now.</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: Watching the baseball owners &amp; players fiddling while the ship is sinking is very sad, but there's a harsh reality for all of these leagues - cash flow is going to be way down. How does the NFL handle this next year when salary caps stay flat or go down? Also doesn't it make it harder to sign big contracts (like for Cam Heyward) knowing that the cap isn't expanding and may even be contracting? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm sure it does make it harder because of the uncertainty of the cap, but the league, with all its wealth, can always borrow against future years to prevent any major issues.</p>
<p><strong>B Pos</strong>: Any idea if the Steelers are one of those unnamed teams who want the season postponed? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know, but I will try to find out. My guess is they would be against that.</p>
<p><strong>CD in NC</strong>: CK was beaten out by Blaine Gabbert before he started taking a knee and opted out of his contract with the 49ers. CK just is not very good anymore. Political statements don't when football games, talent and coaching does. Enough about CK, move along. Do you concur? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do. If a team thought he could really help them, they would sign him. We see GMs and owners sign players who have had problems, legal or otherwise, far beyond anything Kaepernick did.</p>
<p><strong>The Peanut Gallery</strong>: It’s week 3 of the NFL season. A player tests positive for Covid. Would whole team have to quarantine for two weeks? Seems inevitable this will happen. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I still don't know what will happen. Neither does the league.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - I saw that the Rooney's purchased some minor additional share of the Steelers in the recent transactions. What percentage do they now own of the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They didn't purchase additional shares. They sold additional shares from a stockholder to two other investors. They still own the majority shares, but the percentage is unclear</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: If "Lead Boots" Switzer makes the team, what percentage is his skill set vs Cain's and how much is his relationship with Ben? I personally think Cain is the obvious choice here. Ben will get over it! DJ is the same body type as "lead boots." We need to keep Cain's type of pedigree in that room and not worry about hurting feelings. JW and JuJu may have shorter shelf lifes with the team then some may think. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Look, I like Cain, too, but they have 4 other receivers in front of him -- JuJu, JW, DJ and Claypool -- not to mention a new TE who offer the same type of receiver. I'm not advocating Switzer, but he's more of the possession receiver who offers something different, even if what he's been offering hasn't been much. I think that's what it will come down to.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Dixon</strong>: Gerry- Following up on my question about expanded rosters, which players may benefit from this? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's hard to predict right now. Nothing is happening.</p>
<p><strong>AvoidFakeNews</strong>: Hi Jerry, I own a beautiful color rush jersey but it's number 84 and I refuse to wear it now bc of AB. It's too nice and expensive to throw away. Can you convince a WR/TE to take number 84 or equipment manager to assign that number to a player, so I can just put a patch over the name and salvage it? Or I'm gonna have to cover Brown with duct tape and write in "Clown". <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Haha. I think the latter is your best option. Or hope another "Brown" coincidentally ends up with 84 <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we're out of time. Thanx for the questions. See you next week</p>
