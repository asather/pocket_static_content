<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Masks are required for all Ohio school staff and “strongly recommended” for most children in third grade and up, the governor announced Thursday as coronavirus cases surge across the state.</p>
<p>Gov. Mike DeWine said state health officials fully support opening school buildings in the fall semester, the same day he introduced a new tool to assess the coronavirus threat in each of Ohio’s 88 counties, several of which are experiencing worrying spikes. On Thursday, the state reported its biggest one-day increase in new cases since April.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said he’s leaving it up to Ohio’s more than 600 school districts to decide how exactly to bring students back to classrooms after switching to remote learning in March. The state has come up with guidelines on symptoms, social distancing, and disinfection that districts must follow to help keep students safe.</p>

<p>A major part of that will be developing a policy on facial coverings. But Mr. DeWine, who compared it to what’s being done now at businesses, said he’s not reconsidering a statewide order for wearing masks in public, as cities including Dayton and Bexley have done to curb rising infections, though he didn’t rule it out in the future.</p>
<p>“These are big steps that they’re taking based upon the data that they’re seeing,” he said. “We’re going to continue to monitor it, but please don’t anyone assume that because I’m not issuing any orders today that I don’t think this is a crisis. We are at a crisis stage in Ohio. This thing could go one way or another, and we can control it collectively by what we do every single day.”</p>
<p>At schools, masks will only be required for teachers and other employees, while children are strongly urged to wear one unless it’s unsafe for them to do so.</p>
<p>“We wear masks to protect each other, often because people are sick and they show no symptoms. Masks can be especially useful and are strongly recommended at any grade level during periods of increased risk, when physical distancing is difficult,” the governor said, adding that certain activities, such as riding school buses, will be extra challenging.</p>
<p>Districts across the state have spent the summer planning what school will look like with coronavirus still a threat. Toledo Public Schools said it will announce plans soon for reopening that will involve a mixture of in-person and remote learning. The district has already said it’s offering a fully online option for families that don’t feel comfortable returning to the classroom.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working for several months on potential outcomes on what we’d do with reopening schools,” deputy superintendent Jim Gant said. “Nothing shocked us per say with what the governor stated, but we want to make sure we look at the specifics to make sure we’re applying it appropriately.”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said he understands the challenge remote classes pose for families, and believes it’s important for students to return to brick-and-mortar schools. The state’s position aligns with the American Academy of Pediatrics, which says students should return to school for the benefits of social and emotional development, mental health support, healthy meals, and exercise. But it runs counter to advice from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommending remote learning for a lower chance of spreading the disease.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a strong consensus among teachers, school principals, parents, and the public around Ohio that our kids need to get back into the school building,” Mr. DeWine said. “Some kids ... did not get exactly what they should have been given [when schools closed].”</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine’s announcement comes as the number of new coronavirus cases in Ohio spikes to its highest levels since April’s peak. More than 1,300 new cases were reported on Thursday, a sharp rise driven by hot spots in southwest and central Ohio. Lucas County reported 21 new coronavirus infections, for a total of 2,577 cases since the state began tracking.</p>
<p>As the state enters a new phase of the public-health emergency, Mr. DeWine rolled out a heat map that identifies which counties are experiencing surges. The four alert levels are based on seven indicators, including emergency room visits, ICU occupancy, per capita cases, and the share of infections identified outside congregate-living settings. The map will be updated once a week on Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Lucas County is one of 28 counties at an alert level “orange,” meaning citizens should exercise a high degree of caution to avoid increased exposure and spread.</p>
<p>Huron County is one of seven “red” counties, the highest current rating. Residents there are advised to limit activities as much as possible. Mr. DeWine said the county’s alert rating is due to outbreaks in the agricultural sector.</p>
<p>The governor said testing alone isn’t why Ohio’s numbers are going up. He attributed the surge to people who aren’t wearing masks and gathering in large groups at bars or for religious services.</p>
<p>“We shouldn’t think that this is all caused by 20-somethings who are going to bars,” he said. “Yeah, that’s a problem, but it’s not the whole problem.”</p>
