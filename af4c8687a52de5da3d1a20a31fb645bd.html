<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Penn Hills man with DUI charges dating back 10 years was sentenced to a maximum of seven years in state prison by an Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge on Monday.</p>
<p>John Davis, 60, pleaded guilty to 13 charges in December that include DUI, registration and licensing charges. He has had six DUIs in the past 10 years, according to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office.</p>
<p>On Monday, Judge Thomas Flaherty sentenced him to 2-7 years in state prison, followed by three years probation.</p>
<p>He was sentenced on charges in four separate DUI and habitual offense cases dating back to 2018. In most, he was charged after being involved in single-car accidents. There were no serious injuries to Davis or others, according to the county DA’s office.</p>
<p>Davis faced DUI and other charges in March 2018 after his car went over a hillside in Braddock, and another DUI with other vehicle infractions in February 2019 when police found he had crashed a car into a railroad safety arm in Dravosburg.</p>
<p>On March 22, 2019, he was pulled over after 1 a.m. in East Pittsburgh after police noticed the front driver's side of the car was damaged and learned his car's registration was expired.&nbsp;He was charged with driving without a license, habitual offenses and vehicle registration.</p>
<p>Davis was again charged in April 2019 with DUI and other offenses after his car hit a utility pole in Lincoln-Lemington-Belmar.</p>
