<h1>Broadway star Nick Cordero emerges from coma, his wife says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The coronavirus-stricken Broadway actor Nick Cordero has awoken from the medically induced coma he entered in late March, his wife, Amanda Kloots, announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Kloots said Cordero’s doctor relayed that the actor is still weak but is responding to commands at Los Angeles Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.</p>
<p>“It’s a great day,” Kloots said in an Instagram Live stream. “Nick is awake. He is hearing us. He is seeing us.”</p>

<p>Cordero, 41, had his leg amputated last month. And two weeks ago, Kloots said her Tony-nominee husband’s blighted lungs had holes in them “where obviously you don’t want holes to be.”</p>
<p>But early this month, Kloots said Cordero was doing well after undergoing a tracheostomy.</p>
<p>In recent days, she said he was progressing. Tuesday, the news arrived that he was awake.</p>
<p>“It is finally confirmed,” Kloots said in a livestream.</p>
