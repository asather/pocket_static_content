<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 04.20.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, people. Just got off a Zoom press conference call with Mike Tomlin and Kevin Colbert. Technical difficulties prevented me from asking a question. I wasn't the only one, but as someone who fancies himself a younger, relatively tech-savvy reporter, it was hurtful. Let's chat anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Diana</strong>: If best available WR and RB left at 49 are Claypool, Pittman, CEH and Akers ( very possible ) how’d you rank them one thru 4 if it’s your pick Brian? Stay safe! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, you too. I'd go Claypool, Pittman, Akers, Edwards-Helaire.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Does having Matt Canada as the QB coach make the Steelers more open to drafting Jalen Hurts? It would seem to me after watching what Canada did for Pitt he could turn Hurts into an immediate threat on offense with the possibility of becoming the heir apparent to Ben Roethlisberger. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Probably not, no. Canada didn't have a QB like Hurts at Pitt anyway. I see what you're saying, but still, don't think there's any correlation there.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Niners have no picks in rounds 2-4 and may look to trade 31, second of two first round picks, to get picks later. Would you trade our 2nd and one of our 4ths for that pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure, but I don't think the 49ers would do that. At least they shouldn't, according to the oft-cited NFL draft trade value chart.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: have other nfl teams signed XFL players? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Did Ben or Tomlin have any response to Bradshaw's latest comments on Steeler QB's? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't believe they were asked, and I can't imagine they would care very much.</p>
<p><strong>J Daven</strong>: The Steelers biggest need a veteran back-up QB. Rothlesburger is still questionable and may not have the zip in his pass. What do you think? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Disagree. I think their biggest need is a player who can help the offense the most when Ben Roethlisberger is healthy. Whether you agree or disagree, Art Rooney II himself basically already told everyone the Steelers won't look into a free-agent QB: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/05/Art-Rooney-II-Steelers-team-president-veteran-quarterback-Ben-Roethlisberger-running-game/stories/202002050167" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/05/Art-Rooney-II-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Jimbo</strong>: Do you think the Steelers should try to get a veteran backup QB just Incase Big Ben can’t finish up the year healthy? Last year seemed like a wasted time with With Duck and Mason. How can we think anything would be different this year. Thanks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Because Mason Rudolph, a third-round pick two years ago, might actually *gasp* improve? I know, I know, it's not a sexy take to suggest that Rudolph can and will get better. And I'm not saying he will, just that the Steelers' rationale behind sticking with him as the backup is that they still believe.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: With the Steelers’ selection on Thursday, what one position (other than QB) would you be most surprised by? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'll be surprised if the Steelers select anyone Thursday</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Brian do you think the start of the season may get pushed back this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I do</p>
<p><strong>SteelHeart</strong>: Hi Brian, Everyone is talking WR and RB, but if there is an OLB that can help in 2020 and start for Dupree in 2021, could that be their #49 pick ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure, but to me, it's all about the early help and as much of it as you can get. There's no guarantee Ben will be his old self this season, let alone next. It's Super Bowl or bust. We all know that. A pass-rusher who rotates in for TJ Watt and Bud Dupree is not contributing to a championship in 2020 nearly as much as a wide receiver, in my opinion.</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: BB, realistically WR Duvernay is about The 15 WR rated, projections are like 2 dozens will be gone by end of the 3rd Rd, so he will be gone by 102.. Top 7 RB will be gone also.. so I think we only have one chance to get someone great at 49, from those 2 positions and that’s about it.. why not trade down if possible? Better have 59 and about 80 than 49 and 102 (2 shots this way) what’s your view? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not a bad idea. But I still think I'd just stick with No. 49 and draft the best receiver on my board if I'm the Steelers. You don't necessarily NEED an immediate contributor with your third-round comp pick. But that's a logical option, for sure.</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: What are the chances J.K. Dobbins falls to #49, and how would he fit in as a lead back for the Steelers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hard to say, but I'll guess that there's a decent chance he's there. To me, Jonathan Taylor and even Cam Akers from FSU might be better fits for the Steelers. Their long speed is what's missing most in this backfield.</p>
<p><strong>Dr. L</strong>: If S Jonathan Taylor is there in the second, you take him. If S Ashtyn Davis is there is the third, same thing. These are ideal first two targets, then OL and DL. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think you mean RB Jonathan Taylor. But what if Taylor isn't there, do you take Davis? Just trying to make sure the Steelers have your draft plan fully ironed out, Dr. L.</p>
<p><strong>Moshe from Cleveland</strong>: we Realistically can’t sign Dupree long term should we therefore draft an olb with our first or second pick <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure. Would be really ideal to get a linebacker who can do both edge and inside linebacker type stuff. There are a few guys like that who might be in the mid-round range.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Medium Chest</strong>: Hi Brian, do you think the Steelers have interest in Fournette? Also wondering what to expect from Justin Layne if anything, I rarely read anything about him. Stay safe <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I can't see that. As for Justin Layne, basically had a redshirt rookie season from a defensive standpoint. Steve Nelson (and Joe Haden for that matter) performed so well that they can afford to develop him slowly.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: Do you find any of this past week’s (XFL &amp; NFL practice squad) signings interesting or likely to make the team? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Everyone's interesting in their own way, I suppose. But no, if I were doing a roster projection right now, I probably wouldn't have any of them making it.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Good Afternoon Brian. If both Jordan Love and Jalen Hurts were both available at #49 would you take, if either ? Thanks for keeping us informed. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Only if I could flip them for pieces who can help me in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Rocky B</strong>: Besides being bizarre, how would having “no fan” games affect your job? I assume you’d still sit in the normal press box. Or maybe they’d spread the media out more into the empty seats? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't even know if us media would be permitted to attend games in that scenario, actually. But if we do, I can think of some folks I wouldn't mind socially distancing from.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Will the league catch up to Lamar Jackson and make the Ravens more beatable this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Shouldn't the league be more concerned about catching up to Patrick Mahomes?</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: I feel like the Steelers are always looking for a fast, shifty small back, but they haven't worked out as once they get to the NFL, there are alot of fast guys and if you're small you're easy to tackle. Is Edwards Helaire another one of these guys? How can he pass protect at 5'7"? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, I can't really see them drafting him. He might work out well in other offenses though.</p>
<p><strong>Moxey</strong>: Brian who you wish was the pick at 49? Being kind of reasonable, someone that could be there maybe.. we know that drafts are the unknown but.. give us 2 names!! You’ll be happy with, Thanks.. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, Moxey. I don't really "wish" for anyone, except for maybe guys whose names are fun (or easy) to say/spell. But I did write up some guys at each position who have the best stories or would be the most fun to root for from a human-interest perspective.

<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Ah crap. You know what I meant, lol. With pick 49, what position would surprise you? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Outside of QB, K, P? Long-snapper.</p>
<p><strong>Locked inside my head</strong>: I think its Akers or Taylor. No huge needs and Ben needs a lighter load coming off injury. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Could be. Much like my stance on Rudolph, I'm not ready to completely cash in my chips on James Conner just yet either. Am I an idiot? Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Brian - I saw several people report that Colbert noted when asked about drafting a RB that they will have a healthy James Conner this year. How do they know he will stay healthy and isn't it a risk to assume he will given his history with injuries? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What Kevin Colbert keeps coming back to is that Conner's injuries, at least in 2019, were acute rather than issues that will continue to pop up. Not sure about that myself, but at least that's the company line.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Steelers aren’t going to draft Hurts! Give up on it Steelers fans!!!!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: AK has spoken</p>
<p><strong>Pat</strong>: Brian,<br> Thanks for the chats...<br> <br> at #49 if only choosing between WRs, and these are available, who do you take and why:<br> Aiyuk, Claypool, Hamler, Pittman, Raegor, Shevault?<br> <br> I say Aiyuk or Shevault, I just see them easily transitioning into the NFL and our team playing what JUJU played as slot earlier on in his career. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think I really like Claypool, honestly. Aiyuk and Shenault are very good, but the Steelers don't necessarily NEED another slot-type. JuJu can do it, and Diontae Johnson might play a lot more there too. Just a big fan of Claypool's size and speed combination.</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: why not Fournette for a next year 3rd or 4th - <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: For a 4th, maybe. But they'd probably have to move some more money around to make it work salary wise, and it'd most likely be a one-year rental.</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: I know it is not popular but if we win or loose with Ben in his final years why not trade a future pick if their is someone we really like. <br> <strong>Chris</strong>: Any chance we see steelers trade juju for a first round pick. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Different strokes for different folks.</p>
<p><strong>SD Stiller</strong>: How do you remain patient with all of the questions about us drafting a QB? It's NOT happening people! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm just a very nice person.</p>
<p><strong>steve</strong>: are you guys doing any podcasts during the draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: We won't podcast during the draft, but we'll be chatting, so look out for that. And hopefully we'll get out a new podcast as soon as possible once we know what the Steelers did. Gonna have our final draft preview pod tomorrow, too, which you can always find here: <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Steeler Joe</strong>: My wife asked a great question I can’t answer: With the draft being virtual this year, will they provide the top prospects with one hat for every NFL team? So he can put on the right one when he’s picked? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure, how fast can Amazon Prime ship stuff these days?</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, if Steelers draft an Olineman are they more likely to draft LT over G? Or will they try to draft both? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Gotta think they're more likely to draft a tackle at this point. You really have three starter-capable guards in David DeCastro, Matt Feiler and Stefen Wisniewski. You might not even have two at tackle, depending on how Chuks Okorafor and Zach Banner develop.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Brian i cant understand why people are so down on Rudolph. the jets have sam darnold , cleveland has baker mayfield and dont forget rosen . these guys were all drafted in the first round have played for three years and have done nothing . Hastings a big time Ohio state q.b. drafted by washington and Kyle Murray to Arizona both did play that well last year and both were first round picks . give rudolph a chance morons <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The last two times we saw him play a lot, he stunk. There's no way around that, and some are forever soured on him. The Jets game he looked OK until his injury. But the nature of being a backup QB in the NFL means that he might not get that chance again in regular season action.</p>
<p><strong>pozone</strong>: Brian, If both are there do the Steelers take Reager or Akers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm pretty firmly in the WR over RB camp, so give me Jalen Reagor. But my beat partner Ray Fittipaldo has a very good piece online now about running backs, specifically Cam Akers, that has me rethinking a bit: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/20/pittsburgh-steelers-nfl-draft-running-back-jonathan-taylor-cam-akers-jk-dobbins/stories/202004210004" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/20/pittsburgh-ste...</a></p>
<p><strong>stephen</strong>: is there any truth to the rumor of NE trading 3 3rd round picks for our #49? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't know! But I do know New England's three third-round picks are all pretty low, and the Steelers really don't have THAT many holes they need to throw mid-round prospects at. If I were the GM, I'd probably rather have No. 49 and a late third than four late thirds.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Do you think the speculation about Edmunds playing hybrid LB/S has any merit? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, that'd be an interesting use of Terrell Edmunds. He struggled last year in coverage as a safety, so that could certainly help him. But I imagine he'd have to bulk up and improve his tackling, as well. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK draft lovers, that's all the time we have for today. I'm glad you were all here. It was nice.</p>
