<h1>New $88 million engineering building up for vote by Penn State board</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Plans for a new $88 million research and teaching building for Penn State University's College of Engineering will be up for approval Friday afternoon as the board of trustees meets.</p>
<p>The development dubbed West 2, slated for a site near the western edge of Penn State’s main University Park campus, was endorsed on Thursday by the board’s finance, business and capital planning committee. It is part of a decade-long initiative to enhance the Penn State College of Engineering and its facilities</p>
<p>Payette, an architecture firm from Boston, was hired last year to design two new engineering buildings.</p>
<p>The building project going before trustees will include 105,000 square feet for flexible classrooms, multi-use design studios, “cornerstone to capstone” maker spaces, a high-bay research lab, faculty offices and research spaces, Penn State officials said in a project summary.</p>
<p>It will be built adjacent to the West Campus Parking Deck currently under construction.</p>
<p>The board also is expected to act on Penn State’s appropriation request for the 2021-22 fiscal year and discuss topics from COVID-19 to the resumption of Big Ten football this fall, backed by President Eric Barron.</p>
