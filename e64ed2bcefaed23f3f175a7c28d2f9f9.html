<p>LEXINGTON, Ky. — After calls for answers in the Louisville Metro Police Department shooting that killed a young black woman who had been asleep in her apartment, the chief of the department reportedly announced Thursday he would step down.</p>
<p>Breonna Taylor, 26, died after being shot multiple times by police in the early morning of March 13, according to police and court records. A police sergeant and two detectives had gone to Taylor’s apartment to conduct a narcotics-related search warrant.</p>
<p>A lawsuit filed by Taylor’s mother argued that no drugs were found in Taylor’s apartment after the shooting, and that the person police were looking for had already been arrested by Louisville police before the shooting happened.</p>
<p>Attorneys for Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, later argued in a court motion that the police did not knock or announce themselves before bursting into the apartment. Walker then fired at the officers, who were not in uniform, striking Sgt. Jonathan Mattingly in the leg, according to the motion and lawsuit. The officers returned fire.</p>
<p>“Shots were blindly fired by the officers all throughout Breonna’s home and also into the adjacent home, where a five-year-old child and a pregnant mother had been sleeping,” attorneys for Taylor’s mother wrote in the lawsuit. “Breonna Taylor was shot at least eight times by the officers’ gunfire and died as a result. Breonna had posed no threat to the officers and did nothing to deserve to die at their hands.”</p>
<p>The FBI’s Louisville office announced Thursday that it had begun investigating the shooting.</p>
<p>“The FBI will collect all available facts and evidence and will ensure that the investigation is conducted in a fair, thorough and impartial manner,” the agency said in the release.</p>
<p>Activists and officials nationwide had been calling for an external investigation for weeks. Gov. Andy Beshear joined the calls for review last week.</p>
<p>“The public reports concerning the death of Breonna Taylor are troubling,” Beshear said in the statement last week. “Her family and the public at large deserve the full facts regarding her death. The commonwealth’s attorney, the U.S. attorney and the Kentucky attorney general should carefully review the results of the initial investigation to ensure justice is done at a time when many are concerned that justice is not blind.”</p>
<p>Mattingly, the police sergeant who was shot by Walker, underwent surgery and was expected to make a full recovery, Louisville police said in March.</p>
<p>Walker was charged with first-degree assault and attempted murder of a police officer. He was later released to home incarceration after a motion in which his attorneys argued to a judge that he was trying to protect himself when he fired his gun, according to court records.</p>
<p>Well-known civil rights attorney Ben Crump is now representing Taylor’s family.</p>
<p>Crump, along with his co-counsel Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker, released a statement Thursday afternoon saying that Louisville Metro Police Chief Steve Conrad’s resignation was a significant step for Taylor, her family and the city of Louisville.</p>
<p>“But this is just the beginning of that journey,” the attorneys said in the statement. “We look forward to further investigation, including by the FBI, into the chain of events that led to Breonna’s tragic and preventable death. It is our expectation that the next Chief of Police will be someone who wears the badge with honor, moves the police department forward, and nobly protects and serves the residents of Louisville.”</p>
<p>Taylor was a certified EMT and was working at two Louisville hospitals at the time of her death. She was remembered by family members as being a “young, beautiful human being,” according to her mother’s lawsuit.</p>
<p>“While today marks an important milestone, the fight has just begun,” Crump said in Thursday’s statement. “We will not rest until everyone involved is held accountable, and Breonna Taylor gets the justice she so deserves.”</p>
<p>Conrad released a statement on the Louisville Metro Police Department’s Facebook page Thursday announcing he would leave the department after June 30.</p>
<p>“You all are weathering a lot right now and I know how challenging this is,” Conrad said in the statement. “Approach this as we approach all our struggles — as a team. Look out for each other. Show compassion to the community, even when it might not be shown to you. And remember what a privilege this job is.”</p>
