<h1>Pirates place Kyle Crick, Clay Holmes on 10-day injured list</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates manager Derek Shelton has talked a few times recently about needing more time for the water in his bullpen to find its level. Early on, roles are not defined, in large part due to the long layoff, and playing games is the only way for its shape to crystallize.</p>
<p>That process will take a little longer now, as the Pirates on Tuesday placed a pair of relief pitchers on the 10-day injured list — Kyle Crick with a right shoulder/lat strain and Clay Holmes (retroactive to July 25) with a right forearm strain.</p>
<p>Taking their place will be Geoff Hartlieb, who was recalled, and Miguel Del Pozo, who was selected to the major league roster.</p>
<p>Crick is the more obvious of the two, as his velocity thus far has been a few ticks below normal. In a 6-5, 11-inning loss on Monday, Crick was not effective and gave up a two-run, game-tying double to Brewers designated hitter Ryan Braun. Two days earlier, Crick allowed four earned runs in 2/3 of an inning in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The two exhibition outings Crick had were also problematic — a total of 1 1/3 innings, five earned runs, two walks, three strikeouts and one home run allowed.</p>
<p>In all, Crick’s work thus far has fallen below expectations for a guy the Pirates need this season, especially as closer Keone Kela continues to deal with complications from coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>Crick was really good in 2018, pitching to a 2.38 ERA in 60 1/3 innings with 65 strikeouts and just 23 walks. The right-hander, however, regressed last season, with a 4.96 ERA in 49 innings with 61 strikeouts and 35 walks.</p>
<p>Right-index finger surgery ended Crick’s season early, but he looked very good during both portions of spring training.</p>
<p>As recently as July 15, Pirates general manager Ben Cherington sounded plenty pleased with Crick.</p>
<p>“He looks like he really took advantage of the time between March and now,” Cherington said. “He looks good physically. … We're excited. He's a guy that's got a chance to miss bats. He's got really good stuff. He wants to pitch toward the end of the game. Excited to see him out there pitching. Encouraged by how he looks."</p>
<p>Crick’s velocity was alarming, however, as his four-seam fastball has averaged 91.4 mph this season, down significantly from 95.3 mph in 2019 and 95.8 the year before that.</p>
<p>Without Crick, the Pirates have a significant hole to fill, and doing that will undoubtedly be a process.</p>
<p>Nick Burdi should get the bulk of save opportunities at this point, provided he’s healthy and available. Manager Derek Shelton did not use Burdi on Monday because it would’ve involved pitching back-to-back days — something Shelton didn’t want to do with Burdi coming off season-ending surgery for thoracic outlet syndrome.</p>
<p>But if Burdi goes the ninth, the Pirates can go a couple different routes. Michael Feliz was terrific Sunday in St. Louis but struggled with his fastball command Monday. He’s a wild card.</p>
<p>JT Brubaker looked really good in his MLB debut, especially when it came to his spin pitches, although pitching in high-leverage situations may be too much, too fast. Provided he keeps the ball in the yard, Richard Rodriguez could also give the Pirates a proven late-game option.</p>
<p>Nik Turley has also been solid in spurts, although Brubaker may be more sensible if they look to keep Turley as a left-handed option they can use in various situations.</p>
<p>The loss of Holmes is not quite as big, even though he showed some signs while working back from a fractured foot in spring training. Some of his lower-leverage work could go directly to Hartlieb or Del Pozo, while Chris Stratton has also been a reliable long man for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Holmes has pitched once thus far, allowing two hits and no runs in 1 1/3 innings Friday in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The Pirates did not have to make a 40-man roster move to add Del Pozo, as Kela does not currently count against that total.</p>
