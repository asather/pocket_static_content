<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis announced on Sunday night that two people in his state have tested positive for the coronavirus, and one is from Manatee County, where the Pirates are currently holding spring training.</p>
<p>Bradenton, where both Pirate City and LECOM Park are located, is one of several cities in Manatee County, along with Anna Maria, Bradenton Beach, Holmes Beach and Palmetto.</p>
<p>In addition to announcing news conferences Monday in Tampa and Miami, DeSantis directed Surgeon General Scott Rivkees to declare a public health emergency.</p>
<p>The Pirates could not be reached for comment, although there’s no reason to believe they’re affected more than anybody else in Manatee County.</p>

<p>Officials in Florida had tested 15 people for COVID-19, had four others “under investigation” and were monitoring 150 others as of Friday.</p>
<p>According to a statement issued by the Florida Department of Health, the Manatee County patient is an adult without a travel history to the countries restricted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>That patient and the one from Hillsborough County — who had traveled to Italy — are in isolation.</p>
<p>According to the New York Times, 88 cases of coronavirus have been identified in the United States. The virus, which is also known as COVID-19, has spread rapidly around the globe. Minor cases can cause flu-like symptoms, while more than 3,000 people worldwide have died in more severe situations.</p>
