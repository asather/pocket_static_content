<h1>Mars waiting on WPIAL decision regarding Michael Carmody suspension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael Carmody’s status for the PIAA basketball playoffs is in the hands of the WPIAL, but Mars won’t find out until Thursday whether Carmody can play.</p>
<p>Carmody, Mars’ standout senior center who averages 19 points and 19 rebounds a game, had a hearing Wednesday with the WPIAL over a two-game suspension he is facing because of his actions after the WPIAL Class 5A championship game last Friday. Mars plays in the first round of the PIAA playoffs Friday.</p>
<p>The WPIAL informed Mars Monday that it was levying a two-game suspension on Carmody. But Carmody, his parents and Mars requested a hearing in front of the WPIAL board of directors to discuss the suspension and for Carmody to apologize for his actions.</p>
<p>Mars lost to Laurel Highlands, 52-51, in the championship. After the game, Carmody ran towards an official and complained about the lack of a foul call on a last-second shot that Mars’ Mihali Sfanos missed. Carmody then kicked the basketball to half court into celebrating Laurel Highlands players.</p>
<p>Carmody (6-7, 290 pounds) was also called for an intentional foul during the game for throwing an elbow towards Laurel Highlands’ Rodney Gallagher.</p>
<p>Amy Scheuneman, associate executive director, said the WPIAL couldn’t reveal the board of directors’ ruling on the suspension because it is a matter of student discipline. The WPIAL will send a letter to Mars administrators Thursday&nbsp; morning informing them of the league’s decision. Mars coach Rob Carmody, Michael’s father, said Mars will wait to get the letter before it responds.</p>
<p>But judging from comments from Scheuneman and WPIAL executive director Tim O’Malley, it sounds like Carmody will be suspended.</p>
<p>“What was done there [at the game] was universally accepted as being unacceptable,” O’Malley said. “Something happened that shouldn’t have happened. So the board had to respond to it.”</p>
<p>Rob Carmody said, “Michael has apologized to his teammates, me his coach, his mother and he owed the WPIAL an apology for how he responded at the end of that game.”</p>
