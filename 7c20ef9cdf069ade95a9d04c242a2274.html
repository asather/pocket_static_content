<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Emergency services, trash collection and building inspections are among the city services that will continue during widespread efforts to curtail the COVID-19 pandemic, though&nbsp;“non-essential” city offices and facilities will shut down Monday, according to the mayor’s office.</p>
<p>“We will provide continuous operations throughout this crisis. City government never shuts down and public services will be offered continuously throughout this pandemic,” said Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto in a press release.</p>
<p>The mayor announced Sunday night <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/15/Pittsburgh-gatherings-over-50-people-ban-Mayor-Bill-Peduto-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202003150150" target="_blank">a ban on gatherings of 50 people or more</a>.</p>
<p>Emergency services, including paramedics, fire, police will continue to operate normally. Animal control will respond to&nbsp;“life safety matters only.”</p>
<p>City 311 operators will continue to take calls, though “some issues may not be addressed immediately as crews may be limited or helping to handle pandemic-related issues.”</p>
<p>City offices at the City-County Building and 200 Ross St., Senior Healthy Active Living centers, and recreation centers are among the services closed as noon Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Grab-and-go meals may be distributed from a small network of these centers in coming days, but those services have not yet been finalized. Further announcements will be made regarding food access when plans are ready,” the city said.</p>
<p>City parks will remain open, but the city is warning against using playground equipment&nbsp;“as their cleanliness cannot be guaranteed.”</p>
<p>Permits and intake applications will continue to be reviewed by the city’s Department of Licenses, Permits and Inspections, and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure. Those seeking permits are urged to use the city’s online portal at <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/onestoppgh/" target="_blank">pittsburghpa.gov/onestopgh</a>. Licensing late fees will be forgiven, according to the city. Questions relating to Mobility and Infrastructure work should be directed to&nbsp;DOMIpermits@pittsburghpa.gov.</p>
<p>The Office of Municipal Investigations and the Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations will continue intakes.</p>
