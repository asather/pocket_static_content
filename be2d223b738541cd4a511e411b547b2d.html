<h1>Parade, Celtic rock, a wake and more St. Paddy's Day happenings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last week, WalletHub, a personal-finance website, released its annual report naming Pittsburgh the No. 4 city — behind Chicago, Boston and Philadelphia — for St. Patrick’s Day celebrations.</p>
<p>It compared such metrics as Irish pubs (got ’em), restaurants per capita (yep), St. Patrick’s Day hotel rates (whatever) and St. Patrick’s Day traditions, such as our big festive green parade that seems to go on for three hours.</p>
<p>We managed to place fourth without WalletHub even counting the fact that we have Bastard Bearded Irishmen and Ploughman’s Lunch.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s two Celtic-rock institutions will be firing up as part of St. Paddy’s Day festivities that will run for nearly a week.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights:</p>
<p><strong>St. Patrick’s Day Parade</strong></p>
<p>“Everyone can be Irish for a day” is the premise of the Pittsburgh St. Patrick’s Day Parade, which is one of the oldest — dating back to 1869 — and one of the largest in the country, with 22,000-plus participants.</p>
<p>It takes place every year on the weekend before St. Patrick’s Day, so it will be this Saturday beginning at 10 a.m. along Grant Street and the Boulevard of the Allies, Downtown</p>
<p>Taking the streets will be marching bands, dance troupes, animal groups, floats, things you can’t quite figure out and, naturally, all beloved local politicians. Sometimes there are national ones, too, such as when Vice President Joe Biden marched down the Boulevard in 2012.</p>
<p>The 2020 Parade Grand Marshal, as named by The Irish Society for Education and Charity that oversees the parade, is Tim Finnerty. He graduated from Bishop Canevin Catholic High School and went on to work for the Pennsylvania Railroad, Conrail, and the Union Railroad as a fireman, brakeman and conductor before getting his law degree from Duquesne University in 1976. He is currently an assistant county solicitor, overseeing the Department of Court Records. He also was a member of the Pittsburgh Rugby Football Club from 1966 to 1985, so don’t mess with him.</p>
<p>The 2020 Miss Smiling Irish Eyes is Stephanie O’Donnell, an Irwin native, Penn-Trafford High School graduate and Slippery Rock University freshman who studies exercise science and plays on the women’s volleyball team. Her court members are Courtney McGinley and Kelly Bench.</p>
<p>Although many of the people attending will be downing a few during the day, drinking can’t start at the parade. The rules state that no alcohol is permitted along the route. Also prohibited are political speech, campaigning, protest, etc., to keep the focus on being Irish, if only for the day. Organizers advise, “Leave your issues at the curb.”</p>
<p><strong>A Wake for Tim</strong></p>
<p>Unless you’re one of his neighbors, you won’t find Pittsburgh icon Donnie Iris on St. Patrick’s Day weekend.</p>
<p>But you will find Donnie Irish.</p>
<p>The cheekily named group will be at Mullaney's Harp and Fiddle in the Strip District on Thursday presenting A Wake for Tim, a tradition they inherited from Pittsburgh band Red Hand Paddy. The band and mourners gather around a “real live corpse” for an Irish wake, based on the Dubliners ballad “Finnegan’s Wake” that is filled with fun and merriment.</p>
<p>It’s at 7 p.m. at 2329 Penn Ave. More on Mullaney’s below.</p>
<p><strong>Bastards on Carson</strong></p>
<p>A few hours after the post-parade activities wind down, about when you’re ready for a nap, the doors will open at the Rex Theater on the South Side for the annual bash with Bastard Bearded Irishmen.</p>
<p>BBI is Pittsburgh’s answer to The Pogues, Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys, etc., serving standards and originals in rowdy folk-punk form.</p>
<p>This is not a new-album year for the band, but, says frontman Jimmy Smerecky, the crowd can expect “bigger and more confetti cannons, projectors — just all around bigger and better.”</p>
<p>They are joined by Brave The Sea, a band from Newark, Ohio, that started out in 2015 as The Pirate’s Life, doing traditional Celtic tunes and Flogging Molly, Dropkick Murphys and Alestorm covers before also adding their own material and changing the name. Also on the bill is 500 Miles to Memphis, a twangy Cincinnati, Ohio, band adding some punk to country, Americana and bluegrass. The doors open at 5 p.m. and the music starts at 6 p.m. Tickets are $15 at eventbrite.com.</p>
<p><strong>Ploughman’s Lunch Reunion</strong></p>
<p>“We're taking the sham out of the shamrock,” says Karl Mullen, the Dublin-born frontman for Ploughman’s Lunch.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the closing of the Bloomfield Bridge Tavern brought the long-dormant Celtic folk-rockers back together for a spirited sendoff to their former home base.</p>
<p>Now, PL assembles again to celebrate both St. Patrick’s Day and the 20th anniversary of the Thunderbird Cafe in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>The group — also featuring multi-instrumentalist Steve Sciulli, drummer Dennis Childers and bassist Hugh Watkins — formed in the early ’90s as a Celtic spin-off of Pittsburgh punk pioneers Carsickness. They debuted with the 1993 cassette “Whiskey From the Field” and made three more records, including a 1999 self-titled album for J-Birds Records, before Mullen moved on to the Boston area.</p>
<p>He recalls once playing seven gigs on a St. Patrick’s Day.</p>
<p>“A few Irish bars,” he says. “Station Square, a morning radio show, the parade, a private party and on to the BBT, which was so packed we could hardly get to the stage with our gear.”</p>
<p>This gig will feature Mullen’s daughter Maura, his cousin Pat Kilbride, fiddler Megan Williams, sax player Don Roehlich and poetry readings by Mayor Bill Peduto, the Post-Gazette’s Tony Norman, Quantum Theatre’s Karla Boos and Mary Harvey.</p>
<p>Mullen, now in his mid-60s, says this gig could be his last with Ploughman’s Lunch, but we won’t allow that.</p>
<p>It’s at 8 p.m. Tuesday at 4023 Butler St. Admission is $15 at roxianlive.com.</p>
<p><strong>Casey visits Calliope</strong></p>
<p>Karan Casey, deemed by The Washington Post to be “the Irish equivalent of Emmylou Harris,” performs a Calliope show at the Roots Cellar, Pittsburgh Center for the Arts, on Friday.</p>
<p>The Celtic singer-songwriter made her name in the mid ’90s, playing traditional Irish music in the Philadelphia band Solas before going solo.</p>
<p>The show is at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $35; $10 full-time student; calliope.org.</p>
<p><strong>St. Pat’s Party in the Garden</strong></p>
<p>The Wintergarden at PPG Place, Downtown, might not be right on the parade route, but it’s not far off.</p>
<p>PPG is starting what it hopes to be a new tradition with a party in the glass house with Irish food, corned beef and turkey sandwiches, green beer, cocktails, a bagpiper, DJ and live music from The Bachelor Boys.</p>
<p>Tickets are $25 in advance, $30 at the door. Admission price includes two tickets for food or beverage of your choice. Additional tickets can be purchased there for $6 each. This event is 21-and-older and runs from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Family-Friendly St. Patrick’s Celebration</strong></p>
<p>Arcade Comedy Theater celebrates St. Patrick’s Day in “authentic old-world fashion” at the monthly Smallest Show in Town, hosted by Chris Leone.</p>
<p>Jon Bindley, of Bindley Hardware Co. and the Honky Tonk Jukebox, is the musical guest for “Good Music, Good Cheer,” doing traditional Irish favorites and, surely, some classic country. It being March 14, the house band will also be making some special Pi Day tributes.</p>
<p>It begins at 6 p.m. at 943 Liberty Ave., Downtown. Tickets are $12 and $7 for kids at showclix.com.</p>
