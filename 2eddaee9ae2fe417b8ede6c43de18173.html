<h1>Defense helps Fox Chapel stay undefeated with win against Penn-Trafford</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two of Fox Chapel’s top players were missing, sitting on the bench nursing ankle injuries. Then the Foxes’ shots were missing — and with regularity. Fox Chapel shot 27 percent through three quarters.</p>
<p>But there is something that never seems to be missing from Fox Chapel this season.</p>
<p>Defense.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel plays it better than just about everybody in the WPIAL, and the number on the right-hand side of Fox Chapel’s record is still zero because of defense.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel put on another impressive defensive display Friday night against visiting Penn-Trafford and the Foxes walked away with a 53-38 victory in a big WPIAL Class 6A Section 3 game that wasn’t pretty, unless you like good, hard defense.</p>
<p>“We always harp on defense. We know defense travels for us,” said Fox Chapel sophomore Eli Yofan, who led the Foxes offense with a career-high 26 points.</p>
<p>Well, the defense didn’t have to travel against Penn-Trafford. It stayed right at home in the Foxes den. But Yofan’s point is well-taken.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel came into the game with the No. 2 scoring defense in the entire WPIAL, allowing only 43.9 points a game. The most points the Foxes have allowed is 51. That defense is one of the main reasons Fox Chapel is now the only perfect team in the WPIAL. Heading into Friday, the other was Brentwood, but the Spartans lost to Serra.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel, the Post-Gazette’s No. 1 Class 6A team, now is 12-0 overall and 4-0 in its section. The Foxes are a heavy favorite to win a section title outright (without a tie) for only the second time in 33 years. The other was 2007.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel’s patient offensive style doesn’t give opposing teams many possessions and helps hold down scores. But this defense is still impressive. Will the Foxes be able to hold opponents down come playoff time? Well, Fox Chapel coach Zach Skrinjar said this is the best defensive team he has coached in 11 seasons.</p>
<p>“We’ve really embraced defense, but our guys embracing it is the key,” Skrinjar said. “You can teach defense all you want, but getting high school guys to defend consistently is not easy. But these guys love defense — and we love that they love it.”</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford (8-4, 2-2) features one of the leading scorers in the WPIAL in senior guard Zach Rocco, who came in averaging 24 points. Rocco scored 20, but it was a “tough” 20. Fox Chapel’s sticky man-to-man defense, with Shane Susnak guarding Rocco most of the time, limited Rocco to eight shots in the first three quarters.</p>
<p>Penn-Trafford was able to get only 23 shots in the first three quarters and finished the game with only 31 attempts. Rocco shot 14 times, but the rest of the team took only 17.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel led at halftime, 26-19, and limited Penn-Trafford to five field-goal attempts in the third quarter. Fox Chapel took a 33-23 advantage in the fourth quarter and was never threatened.</p>
<p>“If we’re giving up 23 points at the end of three quarters, I think we’re going to win every basketball game we play,” Yofan said with a laugh.</p>
<p>Although Yofan is only a sophomore, he has become to the go-to guy for Fox Chapel because of the ankle injuries to Arnold Vento (15 ppg) and Sam Brown. Yofan, a 6-foot guard, is turning into one of the best sophomores in the WPIAL. He is athletic, slashes to the basket well and, of course, plays pretty good defense.</p>
<p>No other player reached double figures for Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>“We had a very poor, off night shooting,” Skrinjar said. “We were able to stay ahead and pull ahead more at the end with some shots, but also because of our defense.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of funny because we sometimes work so hard on defense that we have to rest on offense a little bit, which sounds maybe a little weird. But it’s something I think we have to do.”</p>
