<p>Port Authority officials Sunday said the transit agency will comply with a new state health order requiring bus riders to wear face coverings unless they can provide an economic or health reason why they can’t. Children 2 years old and younger are exempted.</p>
<p>Riders who refuse “will cause a delay in service as the vehicle will not proceed,” according to a Port Authority release Sunday, but riders will not be forcibly removed.</p>
<p>The latest step by the Pennsylvania Department of Health to control the COVID-19 pandemic was issued Saturday evening and goes into effect at 8 p.m. Sunday, the same time a health department order requiring face coverings in businesses and other public areas where other people are present.</p>
<p>"The state's order clearly means riders should wear face coverings while on transit vehicles," said Port Authority CEO Katharine Kelleman in a release. "We want to do our part to uphold this statewide order and protect both our customers and employees."</p>
<p>The Port Authority already had already been encouraging riders to wear face coverings as well as taken other steps to avoid spread of the virus such as having riders enter the bus through the rear door and limiting the number of riders to maintain more distance between people.</p>
<p>Riders who refuse to wear a face covering, but not cite one of the exceptions, will cause a delay in service as the vehicle will not proceed. Port Authority will not forcibly remove these riders from vehicles. The Authority will address these cases individually in a safe and reasonable manner.</p>
