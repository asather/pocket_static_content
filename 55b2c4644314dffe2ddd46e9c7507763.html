<h1>City-County Building approaches historic finish line</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council is set to consider whether to designate the City-County Building as a historic structure, according to an agenda for council’s Tuesday meeting, posted online.</p>
<p>The resolution set to be introduced Tuesday indicates that the Grant Street building was nominated for historic status by Mayor Bill Peduto and Allegheny County Rich Fitzgerald. It says that the city’s Historic Review Commission and City Planning Commission have conducted initial public hearings and recommended the designation.</p>
<p>Council would also need to conduct a public hearing, followed by tentative and final votes, before the designation would take effect.</p>
<p>When a building is designated as historic in the city, minor physical changes to its exterior must be approved by the city’s historic preservation planner, and major changes by the Historic Review Commission.</p>
<p>The City-County Building was completed in 1917. It was designed by the architectural firm Palmer, Hornbostel &amp; Jones of New York, and is known for its Grand Lobby, Mayor’s Suite, Council Chamber and state Supreme Court courtroom.</p>
