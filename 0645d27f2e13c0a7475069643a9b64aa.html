<h1>WHO: 1 in 10 people may have contracted COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GENEVA — The head of emergencies at the World Health Organization says its “best estimates” indicate that roughly one in 10 people worldwide may have been infected by the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Dr. Michael Ryan, speaking Monday to a meeting of the WHO’s 34-member executive board focusing on COVID-19, said the figures vary from urban to rural, and between different groups, but that ultimately it means “the vast majority of the world remains at risk.”</p>
<p>The estimate — which would amount to more than 760 million people based on current world population of about 7.6 billion — far outstrips the number of confirmed cases as tallied by both WHO and Johns Hopkins University, now more than 35 million worldwide.</p>
<p>Experts have long said that the number of confirmed cases greatly underestimates the true figure.</p>
<p>In the United States, there are 7.42 million cases and 209,734 reported deaths as of Monday, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.</p>
