<h1>Sunday hunting and Saturday start discussed at Game Commission</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While releasing the 2020-21 hunting seasons, members of the Pennsylvania Board of Game Commissioners were expected to propose dates for Sunday hunting at their first quarterly meeting on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>In an historic vote late last year, the state legislature approved three days of Sunday hunting, mandating that one occur on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, following the Saturday start of the statewide firearm deer season. This year the Sunday falls on Nov. 29.</p>
<p>The other Sunday hunting dates were left up to the Game Commission. Members were expected to propose Nov. 15, the final Sunday during the Oct. 5-Nov. 16 antlered and antlerless archery deer season, and Nov. 22, the Sunday before the statewide Nov. 23-27 black bear season.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday start</strong></p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s firearm deer season began on the Monday following Thanksgiving from the early 1960s until 2019. Last year, the opening was held on the Saturday following Thanksgiving, a controversial move the Game Commission said was expected to increase hunting opportunities for hunters unable to take a Monday off school or work. The Saturday start was intended to bolster license sales, which have been declining.</p>
<p>Following initial complaints from some hunters, the board agreed to review the decision in 2020. Members were expected to discuss the Saturday start at the Friday and Saturday meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Kortz stepping down</strong></p>
<p>State Rep. Bill Kortz, D-Allegheny, chairman of the House Game and Fisheries Committee, announced last week that he will retire. A lifelong hunter, Mr. Kortz was instrumental in the recent passage of the Sunday hunting law. He is expected to serve through the 2019-20 legislative session.</p>
<p><strong>Fishing TV</strong></p>
<p>The Clarion River, Pennsylvania’s 2019 River of the Year, is ready for its closeup.</p>
<p>In May a production crew and host Mark Melnyk are expected to spend a week fishing and filming for an episode of “The New Fly Fisher,” an outdoor TV series. The episode was to focus on the river and its native trout fishing and air on the World Fishing Network, Sportsman Channel Canada and some PBS stations in 2020-21.</p>
