<h1>In Kansas City, Pirates relish trip to Negro Leagues Baseball Museum </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY — As soon as Cole Tucker saw the Pirates’ 2020 schedule, he was hopeful this might happen. Then when COVID-19 came around and put things on pause, the Pirates’ shortstop-turned-outfielder started to worry.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But on Friday morning, before the Pirates opened a three-game series against the Kansas City Royals at Kauffman Stadium, Tucker did something he’s always wanted to do and toured the <a href="https://nlbm.com/" target="_blank">Negro Leagues Baseball Museum</a>.</span></p>
<p>The Pirates were able to arrange for a couple of private tours — one for coaches and staff, another for players, split to maintain social distancing — and Tucker spent Friday morning with roughly a dozen teammates learning some important historical lessons.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We made it happen,” Tucker said. “It was awesome. It was certainly worth getting up early for. And it was it was something I’ve wanted to do for a long time.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Tucker said he went to the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, N.Y., when he was 11 or 12 but was able to nerd out much more this time around. He even enjoyed learning about the media angle of the Negro Leagues and hearing some behind-the-scenes stories.</span></p>
<p>The most impactful part, Tucker said, was seeing the timeline of the Negro Leagues spread out along with American history and the civil rights movement, watching how baseball sort of mirrored society and the two became intertwined through legends such as Josh Gibson, Buck Leonard, Satchel Paige and more.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We’re major league players, but we don’t know everything about baseball,” Tucker said. “We don’t know all the rules, we don’t know the history. Days like this really kind of smack you in the face and remind you of that. It was really awesome.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It was the second time visiting the museum for Pirates manager Derek Shelton, who said he attended with David Price (then a Rays pitcher) back in 2012. This time, however, meant more to Shelton because of Pittsburgh’s many connections — specifically the Homestead Grays, Pittsburgh Crawfords and Gibson.</span></p>
<p><span>“The thing that stands out now, being the manager of the Pirates, is how much impact Pittsburgh had on the Negro Leagues, and being able to look at that through a different lens and focus,” Shelton said. “I think if you’ve never gone, it’s something that you should definitely see.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Davis recalled</strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Pirates are auditioning a bullpen arm who’s probably worth monitoring the rest of the season.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">After placed <strong>Tyler Bashlor</strong> on the 10-day injured list with lower back inflammation, they recalled left-hander <strong>Austin Davis</strong> from the taxi squad to take Bashlor’s spot on the active roster.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The 27-year-old Davis, whom the Pirates acquired for cash and a player to be named later from the Phillies on Aug. 26, has had success in the minor leagues but hasn’t been able to translate that to the majors.</span></p>
<p>Davis has a 5.86 ERA in 58⅓&nbsp;big league innings, though he has 64 strikeouts during that time. (He also has 27 walks and has hit five guys.)</p>
<p><span>In the minors, Davis has a 2.99 career ERA with 336 strikeouts in 319⅓&nbsp;innings.</span></p>
<p>“I think the fact that he’s left-handed, fastball jumps out of his hand, that’s what we really like about him,” Shelton said. “Curveball to go on top of it. He has thrown in Altoona a few times. Was with us as part of the taxi squad. The fact that&nbsp;‘Bash’ is dealing with the back thing, just a good opportunity to take a look at him.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">No Cederlind?</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">One pitcher Pirates fans have been clamoring for did not get the promotion, although he is with the Pirates here — hard-throwing reliever <strong>Blake Cederlind</strong>.</span></p>
<p><span>Shelton said selecting Davis over Cederlind was more a function of wanting the major league group to watch Davis in person, where they technically have intel on Cederlind from spring training.</span></p>
<p>“I think there’s a chance we could see Blake before the end of the season,” Shelton said, “but I think it was an opportunity for us to get a look at a guy that we haven’t had eyes on.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Talking lineup</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">For the third consecutive game, Shelton had <strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong> in center field Friday night.</span></p>
<p>While the Pirates like what Tucker and <strong>Anthony Alford</strong> have done, they’re clearly not closing the book on potentially playing Reynolds in center, either.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">And for the record, it’s a position Reynolds has repeatedly said he likes playing.</span></p>
<p><span>Another interesting lineup permutation came in the No. 3 spot, where rookie Ke’Bryan Hayes received a promotion. Part of that had to do with spreading out guys who could hit left-handed — that’s why Reynolds hit fourth — but it also seems the Pirates might be testing Hayes.</span></p>
