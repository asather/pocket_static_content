<h1>PUC again delays discussion about utility shutoff ban</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Public Utility Commission did not take up the issue of utility terminations at its meeting on Thursday, even though Chairwoman Gladys Brown Dutrieuille earlier this month solicited comments and said she would discuss the moratorium on Aug. 27.</p>
<p>Instead, the chairwoman thanked utilities and stakeholders who wrote in to make proposals ranging from lifting the ban immediately to establishing a public comment process before a decision is made.</p>
<p>But the PUC meeting adjourned without any further debate over when is the right time for utilities to resume shutting off non-paying customers.</p>
<p>The ban, put into place in mid-March to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, has become the subject of an ideological split at the commission — with two PUC members supporting lifting the ban as soon as possible and the other two concerned about putting more consumer protections in place before that happens.</p>
<p>Although a motion to lift the ban was not on the agenda today, a petition put forward by several consumer advocate groups and opposed by several utilities was.</p>
<p>The petition, filed by advocates of low-income groups, seeks “a robust public review process to fairly evaluate, on the record, whether the termination of utility service to a person’s home will exacerbate the current public health crisis or otherwise hinder the response and recovery from COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Utilities, including Downtown-based Duquesne Light, say that is already happening since Ms. Dutrieuille asked for comments earlier this month.</p>
<p>Even the fate of the petition, however, was postponed until the PUC’s next meeting on Sept. 17.</p>
