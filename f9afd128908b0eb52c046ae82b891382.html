<h1>Emsworth's primary lock will close for repairs starting in late August </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced Monday that a part of the Emsworth Locks and Dams, located 6.2 miles down the Ohio River from the Point, will temporarily close for a few months in the fall for major repairs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The corps’ repair fleet will empty the primary lock chamber — a process called dewatering — to perform maintenance on the downstream lock gate anchorages and test its new bulkhead closure system.</p>
<p>The lock’s closure is scheduled to start at 6 a.m. Aug. 31 and end on Nov. 13.&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Heidish, the navigation project manager of Operations and Maintenance for the corps’ Pittsburgh District, said in a press release that dewatering the lock is needed to repair the downstream gate anchorages and evaluate the upstream ones. He described both ends of the lock as&nbsp;“severely deteriorated.”</p>
<p>Due to the deterioration, Mr. Heidish said the anchorages also are experiencing “excessive movement” during operation.</p>
<p>During the work on the primary chamber, tows will be available at the smaller auxiliary chamber. That chamber, which is&nbsp;56-feet wide by 360-feet long, will remain open, but will have closures of 16 hours or less during the first and last three weeks of the project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Col. Andrew Short, the district commander, said in the press release that they have&nbsp;“methodically” planned the dewatering of the Emsworth lock for the past two years. Providing scheduled dates ahead of time allows shippers to plan ahead for alternative modes of transporting their commodities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An estimated 20 million tons of commodities pass through the upper Ohio River locks system. On average, around 2,700 tow boats with barges pass through the Emsworth Locks every year,&nbsp;with coal being the main commodity shipped through, according to Mr. Heidish. The coal is then used for power generation or steel manufacturing.</p>
<p>Closing the Emsworth Locks would financially impact businesses that rely on the waterway, as shippers would need to plan alternative modes such as trucks or rail.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Heidish, alternative methods are more costly and could put a strain on businesses that cannot afford the extra cost. He said one year’s worth of shipments through the Emsworth Locks typically equals an estimated $265 million dollars in savings for the shippers over alternative modes of transportation.</p>
<p>However, an unscheduled last-minute closure of the locks would have an “even greater impact,” he said. Switching modes at the last minute would be more expensive and the alternative transportation may not be available right away, thus impacting the arrival time of shipments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are focused on safe and efficient operations at Emsworth for both the repair party and commercial and recreational river users,” Mr. Short said.&nbsp;“These much-needed maintenance improvements will help facilitate navigation along the Ohio River in the years to come.”</p>
<p>As the locks along the Ohio River continue to age, maintenance will become even more necessary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carol Vernon, a spokeswoman for the Corps, said most locks have a 50-year life span. While the Emsworth Locks opened in 1938, some of its structural components were built in 1919.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The reason why their&nbsp;usable life is extended is because of the maintenance the Corps does, including the dewatering and maintenance plans like the Emsworth’s,” Ms. Vernon said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The last time <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2010/05/17/Repairs-reflect-dire-need-to-replace-river-locks-1/stories/201005170115" target="_blank">repairs were made to Emsworth’s lock chamber was in 2010</a>, after officials were “fearful of a collapse” due to large, visible cracks, gaps and pockmarks in the concrete towers on either side of the lock.</p>
<p>This lock repair comes after a series of pushes by bipartisan lawmakers — both locally and nationally — calling for more investment in repairing aging infrastructure, including locks along the Ohio River. Recently, there was a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/insight/2020/07/26/Ohio-River-Montgomery-Dashields-Emsworth-lock-dam-water-infrastructure-Conor-Lamb-Congress/stories/202007220013" target="_blank">push by Congress to approve a boost in federal funds</a> to help repair the cracking Montgomery Lock located on the Ohio River in Beaver County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In February, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it would spend $7.7 million this year with funding from previously allocated money to aid the engineering and design of the Upper Ohio River Navigation Project. The project’s plans call to replace each auxiliary lock with a new, larger lock chamber at each facility with dimensions of 110 feet by 600 feet. This project includes the Emsworth and Dashield locks. Dashfield Lock, in Edgeworth, is the next lock downstream the Ohio River from Emsworth.</p>
