<h1>Peduto listens to protesters’ concerns as demonstrations continue in front of his home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Protests in front of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto’s house continued Wednesday as a group of about 50 people gathered around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto was sitting on his front steps alongside civil affairs unit members, where he then told protest leaders they can come up and talk to him. Protest leaders sat next to Mr. Peduto where they brought up their concerns. Many protest leaders asked Mr. Peduto how he will hold law enforcement accountable as, they say, police have lied on press releases about their interactions and arrests of protesters.</p>
<p>One leader discussed how the man arrested Saturday is the nicest man they know, which hurt them even more that he was arrested.</p>
<p>At around 9 p.m., Mr. Peduto went inside his house.</p>
<p>After Mr. Peduto went back inside his house, protest leaders criticized the interaction, telling the crowd they felt they weren’t heard, and that Mr. Peduto was “talking in circles.”</p>
<p>Around 10:20, protesters moved to Mellon Park at the intersection of Elysian Street and Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Once reaching Mellon Park, police ordered protesters to get onto the sidewalk as they would be subject to arrest.&nbsp;After police pushed protesters who had bicycles into the park, they declared that the park closed at 9 p.m. and said people had to disperse from the area.</p>
<p>Police took one man face-down on Fifth Avenue and arrested him. Around 10:40, two pops were heard after the police deployed a crowd-control device. A cloud of what appeared to be smoke left protesters coughing and moving away.</p>
<p>Around 11 p.m., many protesters had left the area.&nbsp;</p>
