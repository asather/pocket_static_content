<p>Mike Sullivan is getting some recognition for the Penguins’ perseverance in 2019-20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coach earned top honors Thursday in a Professional Hockey Writers Association midseason vote for the Jack Adams award, which goes to the NHL’s coach of the year at season’s end. Columbus’ John Tortorella was second, and St. Louis’ Craig Berube was third.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sullivan has been considered a top candidate for the award most of the season as the Penguins have stayed toward the top of the standings despite some costly injuries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No other Penguins appeared in the top three of voting for any other award. The full list of players, coaches and executives honored is below.&nbsp;</p>
