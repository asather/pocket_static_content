<h1>Steelers bring back quarterback Josh Dobbs, safety Sean Davis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers are bringing back two of their former players — quarterback Josh Dobbs and safety Sean Davis — after they were cut by their respective teams, according to a team source and national reports.</p>
<p>The return of Dobbs could mean that Devlin Hodges, who started six games in 2019, will be released and placed on the practice squad.</p>
<p>Curiously, it was the performance of Hodges in last year’s preseason that led to Dobbs being traded to the Jacksonville Jaguars. Dobbs was released by the Jaguars on Saturday.</p>
<p>Davis, a former starter until he sustained a season-ending injury at the start of the 2019 season, was not re-signed in free agency. He signed with Washington and was given a $2 million signing bonus but was released by the team on Saturday.</p>
<p>The Steelers have been searching for depth at safety, which is why they signed veteran Curtis Riley last month to back up MInkah Fitzpatrick, who was acquired in a trade after Davis was injured. Riley is expected to be released.</p>
<p>The return of Hodges and Davis is another indication of coach Mike Tomlin wanting to rely on players who are familiar with the Steelers system because of the pandemic-shortened preseason.</p>
<p>Also, the Steelers have brought in punter Dustin Colquitt, son of former Steelers punter Craig Colquitt, as a possible replacement for Josh Berry. Colquitt was released by the Kansas City Chiefs in April and needs to pass a physical and COVID-19 protocols.</p>
