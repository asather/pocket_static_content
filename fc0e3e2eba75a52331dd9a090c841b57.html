<h1>Some Steelers aren't too happy with reports of NFL's escrow proposal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Is the NFL about to experience a small taste of the turmoil Major League Baseball just went through?</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero reported that&nbsp;the NFLPA informed its board of representatives that the league has had discussions about holding 35% of players’ salaries&nbsp;in escrow in an effort to make up for the inevitable lost revenue during the 2020 season due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>If this sort of situation feels like deja vu, that’s because MLB and its players’ union just went through a nasty negotiation process that was held up for weeks, partially over players wanting to be paid fair value for putting their health at risk. Those two parties were eventually&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/23/mlbpa-players-will-report-health-safety-protocols/stories/202006230125" target="_blank">able to strike a deal</a>&nbsp;months after spring training was first suspended.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>NFLPA executive Don Davis told Pelissero the union reacted to the NFL’s proposal by essentially telling the league to&nbsp;“<a href="https://twitter.com/TomPelissero/status/1280634430000975872" target="_blank">kick rocks</a>,” an indication that a battle between the two parties over pay may be just beginning.</p>
<p>Plenty of players voiced their opinion on the issue via social media, including several Steelers. Second-year linebacker Devin Bush went on a lengthy tirade with his thoughts.</p>
<p>Safety Terrell Edmunds retweeted all of Bush’s thoughts on the matter.</p>
<p>Cornerback Joe Haden quote-tweeted his agreement with a sentiment put out by veteran safety Darius Butler on Pelissero’s report. Steelers tight end Eric Ebron also retweeted Butler’s GIF reaction.</p>
<p>All-Pro and Steelers defensive captain Cam Heyward retweeted this snarky joke regarding the proposal by DEC Management, an agency that represents a number of NFL players.</p>
<p>Receiver Ryan Switzer retweeted an equally incredulous reaction from super agent Drew Rosenhaus.</p>
<p>Steelers offensive lineman Zach Banner — who also on Wednesday made a point to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/08/desean-jackson-zach-banner-steelers-nfl-anti-semitism-jewish-community/stories/202007080117" target="_blank">publicly denounce anti-Semitism</a> after Eagles receiver DeSean Jackson’s social media posts landed him in hot water this week — might have accidentally said the quiet part out loud while expressing his thoughts on fellow players who may or may not want to play football in 2020.</p>
<p>And finally, Plum native and ex-NFL punter Pat McAfee said he thinks this proposal might be the opening salvo of a brewing war between the NFL and its players.</p>
<p>Other high-profile NFL players also responded with exasperation toward the escrow report, including Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (fresh off his <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/paul-zeise/2020/07/06/patrick-mahomes-contract-kansas-city-chiefs-super-bowl-paul-zeise/stories/202007060092" target="_blank">massive new contract</a>), Saints receiver Michael Thomas, Titans offensive lineman Taylor Lewan, Eagles cornerback Darius Slay and Bears receiver Allen Robinson II.</p>
<p>We’ll see how the story progresses. As any MLB fan could probably tell you, buckle up.</p>
