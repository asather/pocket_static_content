<p>ORLANDO, Fla. — SpaceX’s historic Falcon 9 rocket launch lifted off Sunday, with its capsule successfully landing in the Atlantic after detaching from the deliberately destroyed rocket.</p>
<p>The “Flight Abort Test” was designed to prove to NASA the viability of a mechanism meant to save astronauts’ lives by triggering if there is a problem.</p>
<p>The rocket lifted off from KSC’s Launch Complex 39A at 10:30 a.m., shepherding the Crew Dragon capsule into the sky.</p>
<p>After about 90 seconds, the rocket’s main first-stage engine shut down as “SuperDraco” thrusters shot the astronaut transporter away from the Falcon 9 to safety.</p>
<p>The parachutes were deployed and the capsule splashed down in the Atlantic a few minutes later, a little ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>The mission had been planned for Saturday but the company determined that winds and conditions around the landing site of a human-rated capsule that would splash down in the Atlantic Ocean were not good enough for the mission.</p>
<p>The launch was the next major step in SpaceX’s effort to launch humans from U.S. soil.</p>
<p>“Congratulations to the @NASA and @SpaceX team for a successful In-Flight Abort Test!” said NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine in a Tweet. “This critical test puts us on the cusp of once again launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil. Spacecraft recovery operations are underway.”</p>
