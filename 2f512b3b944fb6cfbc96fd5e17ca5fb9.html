<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump vowed his administration would end what he called “mob violence” in U.S. cities following the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of Minnesota police and blamed, without evidence, leftist groups for clashes with police and property damage around the nation.</p>
<p>“The mobs are devastating the life’s work of good people and destroying their dreams,” Mr. Trump said in Cape Canaveral, Fla., in remarks following the first launch of U.S. astronauts into orbit from U.S. soil since 2011.</p>
<p>“There will be no anarchy,” he said. “Civilization must be cherished, defended and protected. The voices of law-abiding citizens must be heard and heard very loudly.”</p>
<p>The successful rocket launch by Elon Musk’s SpaceX, which is carrying two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station, had served as a chance for Mr. Trump to take a victory lap for an electoral promise to re-establish American dominance in space. It’s also a symbolic step: The U.S. is resuming manned spaceflight just as most of the country begins to emerge from lockdowns from the coronavirus pandemic. Mr. Trump touted the launch as part of his “America First” agenda.</p>
<p>Instead, the day was overshadowed by demonstrations in Minneapolis; Louisville, Ky.; Atlanta; Washington, D.C.; and dozens of other American cities, evoking the political strife and racial division that have accompanied Mr. Trump’s presidency. Protesters demanded justice for George Floyd, who died earlier this week after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes during an arrest for an alleged counterfeit $20 bill.</p>
<p>The now-former officer, Derek Chauvin, has been arrested and charged with third-degree murder and manslaughter. He is white. Mr. Chauvin and the three other Minneapolis officers who responded have all been fired.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump didn’t specify how his administration would act against violent protesters.</p>
<p>“The leadership of the National Guard and the Department of Justice are now in close communication with state and city officials in Minnesota,” he said, “and we are coordinating our efforts with local law enforcement all across the nation.”</p>
