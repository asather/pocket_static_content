<h1>For advertisers, making a pitch is no hit during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When hugs and kisses just won’t do, we can all take comfort in … relaxed car loan payments?</p>
<p>It’s a brave new world out there amid the COVID-19 pandemic, and advertisers are learning that what looked like a slam dunk winner since — well, forever — might now be cringeworthy.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Take Hershey: The giant Pennsylvania chocolate maker quickly suspended its “Heartwarming the World” ad.&nbsp;That nice 94-year-old man distributing candy bars looks like a coronavirus threat to himself and the community.</p>
<p>“Sadly, we have decided to temporarily replace two of our ads that feature human interaction, including hugging and handshakes, due to the current sensitivities surrounding the COVID-19 virus,” Jill Baskin, chief marketing officer for Hershey Co. told trade magazine AdAge.</p>
<p>The ads have been replaced by product-centric spots.</p>
<p>Advertiser Perceptions, a data firm that provides intelligence for company branding, recently reported that 9 in 10 companies were taking some steps toward changing their approach. Almost half (49%) planned to postpone campaigns until later in the year, 45% were stopping existing campaigns and 48% planned to change their budgets in light of the pandemic.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the human element in advertising is going by the wayside. Indeed, a number of companies have chosen to take the “we’ll be there for you” approach.</p>
<p>“I cannot overstate that understanding, empathy and emotional connection [are] what’s going to drive the right outcome,” said Chris Loretto, executive vice president of Adtaxi, a California-based digital marketing firm.</p>
<p>A good local example is Oakmont’s Thermo-Twin Windows.&nbsp;The employee-owned company is known for its family oriented ad campaigns.&nbsp;On March 23, when the extent of the pandemic had reached the Pittsburgh area, executive vice president Dennis LeVan met with CEO Bob Sciullo.</p>
<p>Thermo-Twin employs roughly 80 in its Pittsburgh-area operation, with a three-person sales team in Erie.</p>
<p>They decided to pull their current ads, which were running on the three local television stations as well as online and social media platforms.&nbsp;“We didn’t think it was the right time to talk sales to people,” Mr. LeVan said.</p>
<p>When Thermo-Twin reached out to WTAE about pulling the ads, he said, the station’s local sales manager, D.J. Cavanaugh, had an idea. Why not let the station come up with a more human-focused advertisement?</p>
<p>Mr. LeVan said Thermo-Twin normally uses a different agency but the company was willing to give the station’s creative a shot.</p>
<p>“It came together incredibly fast,” he said. “We started discussing it probably around 3 o’clock in the afternoon via email. A lot of people had input into this.”</p>
<p>“I said ‘This is Monday. If we get something by Friday, I’ll be surprised.’”</p>
<p>Two hours later, there was a rough lookover.&nbsp;Shooting new images was out of the question, but there was a selection of stock footage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By 8 p.m., the 30-second, $1,000 ad was basically completed. It began running two days after it was conceived.</p>
<p>In it, children frolic and families smile as they make the best of sheltering at home. The voiceover begins, “During these trying times, the team at employee-owned Thermo-Twin is hitting the pause button, just like so many of you.”</p>
<p>Video of a small boy peeking through opened shutters on a neon-colored play house is accompanied by, “Now is not the time to sell you windows. Now is the time for family.”</p>
<p>It concludes with, “Be at home, and stay safe. We will all get through this period, and when we do, check in on Thermo-Twin.</p>
<p>“We’ll be here, like we always have. Till then, be safe, Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>“We said, ‘Oh my goodness, this is <em>exactly</em> what we were thinking,’ ” Mr. LeVan said.</p>

<p>“People are just looking for normality and again, comfort,” Adtaxi’s Mr. Loretto said. “Even for a brief moment of getting someone’s mind off of being concerned; that’s the magic there.</p>
<p>“And how do you do that as a brand or a company, even if it’s ‘We are here for you’ and nothing else? It’s that sensitivity you’ve got to be cognizant of.”</p>
<p><strong>No sales pitch</strong></p>
<p>Since mid-March, giant companies such as Chevrolet and Ford have echoed such sentiments with new ads. But what looked acceptable even three weeks ago might be a bit off-key now: the Chevy spot shows neighbors checking in on neighbors, in person. Co-workers, side by side. No social distancing, yet.</p>
<p>Even the part about selling you a car&nbsp;— delivered to your door and featuring interest-free financing for 84 months, with deferred monthly payments for 120 days&nbsp;— is still, at the end of the day, a sales pitch.</p>
<p>In contrast, the Ford ad begins with vintage photos of the World War II effort of manufacturing of tanks and planes, to remind you that Ford is “built to lend a hand.”</p>
<p>And then the nitty gritty: a website is listed for those who might be struggling to keep up with their auto financing. No sales pitch.</p>
<p>Simple is best, according to Mike Giunta, senior vice president and creative director at Pittsburgh’s Garrison Hughes ad agency. You want to have your company out there, but just being relatable might not be enough.</p>
<p>“Everyone is going out with the same message&nbsp;— we’re all in this together. Which is a good message, but it’s joining the chorus.</p>
<p>“I think there is that sweet spot advertisers are trying to find … Simple is good, if it’s a good idea. And it lets you cut through even limited dollars and production.”</p>
<p>A notable example is the recent 30-second spot filmed as a selfie by Perdue Chicken chairman Jim Perdue. Dressed in a chambray shirt and baseball cap, he holds the phone at arm’s length as he stands near a company loading dock.</p>
<p>“At a time like this, we appreciate the people who feed America: the farmers, the truck drivers, the restaurant workers, the shelf stockers, folks who are rarely seen and even more rarely thanked.”</p>
<p>Another Perdue selfie ad shows the chairman standing in front of a grocery freezer.</p>

<p><strong>Treading carefully</strong></p>
<p>When the product to sell is advice and representation, businesses have to tread carefully as well. The Chaffin Luhana Foundation helped organize the March 23 distribution of 10,000 free sandwiches in Oakmont.</p>
<p>Eric Chaffin is managing parter and co-founder, with Roopal Luhana, of the Greentree law firm Chaffin Luhana LLP. The firm recently began running an ad with video of that sandwich event, there’s a “we’re in this together” vibe.</p>
<p>“Our messaging for 10 years has been ‘Doing good by doing right,’ ” Mr. Chaffin said.</p>
<p>The firm’s three offices employ 40 people, including nine attorneys. They’ve been working remotely with clients since the outbreak.</p>
<p>Mr. Chaffin said the ad, which has been running in the Pittsburgh market, might be uplifting: “We are confident that by showing others and our brand doing good, it inspires others to do good as well.”</p>
<p>He added he is aware that in focusing on his firm’s deeds, there might be the danger of coming across as self-serving. He isn’t worried, saying the history of helping others lends authenticity.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>It’s one thing to put out ads, it’s another to keep consumers informed. Changing company hours and shifting policies for safety require measures such as updated web information and social media alerts. That sends a helpful message, as well.</p>
<p>“I think we are seeing businesses that are doing really well in marketing rather than just advertising,” Adtaxi’s Mr. Loretto said.</p>
<p>“Making sure their Google pages have updated hours, what sort of services do they provide, what clearly they don’t.</p>
<p>“I think that’s part of the 360 everyone needs to consider, putting more emphasis on social, on more content and outreach and connecting with people, rather than selling.”</p>
