<h1>Federal appellate court dismisses claim against state court system over handling of Fayette murder case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal appellate court has ruled that a claim against the Administrative Office of the Pennsylvania Courts will be dismissed but not before noting "inexcusable failures" in the state's criminal justice and mental health systems.</p>
<p>A panel of the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday said the state's court system can't be held liable by advocates for Craig Geness, a mentally disabled man accused of murder at a Fayette County assisted living facility.</p>
<p>Mr. Geness spent nearly a decade in custody while awaiting trial. The charges were eventually dropped, after which he and his lawyers sued various state entities, including the AOPC.</p>
<p>The 3rd Circuit said the administrative office has legal immunity despite the fact that Mr. Geness's case languished in the system for almost 10 years.</p>
<p>"Though we exclude AOPC as a potentially responsible party, the human suffering endured by Geness due to the mishandling of his case cannot be overstated," wrote Judge L. Felipe Restrepo.</p>
<p>Mr. Geness was living at McVey Personal Care Home in Uniontown when he was charged Nov. 17, 2006, with aggravated assault and later homicide after another resident fell off the roof and died. The incident was initially considered an accident until the victim's daughter told police that her father may have been pushed.</p>
<p>Ten months after he was charged, Mr. Geness was transferred to a psychiatric facility and then returned to prison. He was deemed incompetent to stand trial, yet no action was taken by the court and he remained in jail for years, the 3rd Circuit said.</p>
<p>His case was repeatedly subject to the court's montly "call of the list," a review of all pending trials, but it was subjected to repeated continuations and lingered for years.</p>
<p>An order to transfer Mr. Geness to a psychiatric facility was not obeyed, according to the Judge Restrepo, and five years after his arrest Mr. Geness was transferred to another long-term care facility while the murder case remained pending.</p>
<p>Finally in December 2015 a judge dismissed the murder charge after the district attorney's office said Mr. Geness was unable to stand trial.</p>
<p>The following year Mr. Geness and his lawyers filed a federal lawsuit over how his case was handled, saying the state agencies involved violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and his due process rights.</p>
<p>A federal judge, Mark Kearney, refused to grant the AOPC immunity from the suit.</p>
<p>The judge said that because the AOPC allegedly failed to take action to expedite the case or report its status to the Supreme Court, AOPC was not immune from the suit.</p>
<p>The AOPC appealed.</p>
<p>In his decision, Judge Restrepo reversed the lower court on the grounds that the suit fails to state a plausible claim under the Americans with Disabilities Act. He said the AOPC had no power over the disposition of the Geness case. He also said Mr. Geness was unable to make an argument that AOPC's failure to contact the Supreme Court about the case is somehow connected to his disability.</p>
<p>The opinion does not impact the lawsuit's other claims against the state and the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services.</p>
<p>Judge Thomas Ambro issued a dissenting opinion, saying the the suit should be allowed to continue to determine why the AOPC did not alert the Supreme Court as to what was happening.</p>
<p>The judge said Mr. Geness was in custody without a trial for more than nine years before the case was dismissed, even after it was determined early on that he was not competent to stand trial.</p>
<p>"To say that Mr. Geness suffered a grave injustice at the hands of the system for justice is inadequate," the judge wrote. "There are no words.‚Äù</p>
