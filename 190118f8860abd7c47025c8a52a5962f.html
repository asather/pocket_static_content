<h1>Hitting the mark: Target to open a store in Downtown Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s a bullseye. Target is coming to Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis based discount retailer will open an urban format store on the first floor of the old Kaufmann’s/Macy’s building, right under its famous clock at the corner of Smithfield Street and Fifth Avenue.</p>
<p>Michael Samschick, president and CEO of Core Realty, the building’s owner, confirmed Thursday that Target has committed to occupying about 22,000 square feet of space on the first floor.</p>
<p>“It is exciting news that Target is official, signed and sealed,” he said. “We’re very lucky. There were other cities slated as well. We were so fortunate to have them come to the plate.”</p>
<p>The store is expected to open early next year, Mr. Samschick said.</p>
<p>Target confirmed the deal in a statement.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to bring an easy, convenient shopping experience to additional guests in the community with this new Target store,” a spokesperson stated. “As we get closer to opening the store, we’ll have more specific details to share — including how the shopping experience will be tailored to serve local guests and the grand opening date.”</p>
<p>Landing Target is quite a coup for Core, which has struggled to complete the redevelopment of the iconic Downtown landmark, one that hosted generations of shoppers, since buying it for $15 million in 2015.</p>
<p>The retailer has been in its sights from nearly the start of the project, which has been plagued by delays, liens, lawsuits and other issues.</p>
<p>But with the signing of Target and the addition of a new investment team headed by Philadelphia-based Lubert Adler, Mr. Samschick believes the development has turned the corner.</p>
<p>“In the next six months, the building will be all but done,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Samschick said Lubert Adler has put together a team of investors that includes Chicago-based Adventurous Journeys Capital Partners, owner of the Graduate Hotel chain and the Chicago Athletic Association. He said they plan to spend close to $50 million to complete the project.</p>
<p>“They’re going to create something that’s never been seen in the Pittsburgh market, let alone any other state,” Mr. Samschick said.</p>
<p>The type of store Target plans to open Downtown typically ranges from 12,000 to 80,000 square feet. That’s a lot smaller than the 145,000-square-foot East Liberty Target.</p>
<p>Inventory at each of the smaller format stores can be, um, targeted to the location and could include apparel, food, home goods, beauty products, and other items.</p>
<p>Target has been moving to the smaller formats in recent years, particularly in urban locations and near college campuses.</p>
<p>The retailer has been toying with the idea of a Downtown Pittsburgh location for some years. McKnight Realty Partners tried to interest Target and other retailers in the 19,000-square-foot former Office Depot space in the old Gimbels building on Smithfield years ago but couldn’t get a deal.</p>
<p>John Jackson, the Cushman &amp; Wakefield/Grant Street Associates senior vice president who spent more than three years recruiting Target, said the retailer’s impact will extend far beyond the building itself.</p>
<p>“Target is not only the catalyst to transform the building but the Smithfield corridor itself,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s going to reinvigorate life back to the Smithfield corridor. It’s a little tired looking right now.”</p>
<p>Core and Mr. Jackson managed to close the deal in the middle of a pandemic that has battered the retail industry as a whole. Mr. Jackson said the deal was in the works long before the virus hit and that Target had done considerable homework on the Downtown market before committing.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh has a great story to tell and retailers and companies alike just need to be educated on all that Pittsburgh has to offer. Target certainly did its research and now you see the end result,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Jackson said he is&nbsp;“very close” with another user for the second floor of the building. Target, he added,&nbsp;“will certainly help to fill the building with quality tenants. Everybody wants to be near Target. They’re a wonderful company and a wonderful operator.”</p>
<p>He credited the mayor’s office, the Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, and the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corp. with helping to recruit Target.</p>
<p>A survey of Downtown residents and pedestrians conducted by the PDP three years ago found high demand for a discount/mass retail chain, with Target being number one on the list.</p>
<p>“Target and their wide range of products from groceries to home goods is a tremendous addition to Downtown,” said Jeremy Waldrup, PDP president and CEO. “Our conversations with Target’s leasing team had stressed how the growth in Downtown’s residential community — up over 35% in the last decade,&nbsp;our dense office market, and access to the regional transit system all played integral roles in their decision-making process.</p>
<p>Over the last few years, Core has struggled to complete the Kaufmann’s/Macy’s redevelopment, known as Kaufmann’s Grand on Fifth.</p>
<p>The only retail tenant to open so far is the Waffles, INCaffeinated restaurant on the Fifth Avenue side of the building.</p>
<p>Core has finished only about half of 311 planned apartments and has yet to produce other amenities promised to residents, some of whom have broken leases and left the building because of a host of problems, ranging from a mouse infestation to broken elevators and other maintenance issues.</p>
<p>Only last weekend, the lone elevator to the apartments broke down, forcing residents who ventured out to hoof it up at least seven flights of stairs to get to their units.</p>
<p>Core made arrangements for some residents to stay at the Even Hotel, located on floors five and six of the building, while repairs were being made.</p>
<p>Mr. Samschick said the elevator work should be completed Thursday. With a new investor in tow, he vowed that other promised amenities would be finished soon.</p>
<p>Lubert Adler and the others, he said, have “really committed to creating something that’s one of a kind.”</p>
<p>Core began looking for another investor after a deal with Florida-based Fontainebleau Development to acquire the property collapsed this past spring.</p>
