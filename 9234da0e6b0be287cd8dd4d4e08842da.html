<h1>Report: GNC gets temporary reprieve on debt payment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GNC shares were up 15% at one point Thursday afternoon after Bloomberg Law reported that the Pittsburgh-based vitamin and supplement retailer has received permission from its lenders to move this weekend’s debt repayment due date back to Aug. 31.</p>
<p>The report cited unnamed “people with knowledge of the matter” for the information. GNC officials could not be immediately reached for comment.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, GNC President and CEO Ken Martindale said the company was in discussions to extend a May 16 repayment deadline as it continues to look for ways to restructure and refinance some or all of an estimated $700 million debt.</p>
<p>The company raised the possibility that it might file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy prior to May 16 after earlier acknowledging it did not have the cash to make the minimum payment required.</p>
<p>The debt has been a cloud hanging over GNC for many years and the COVID-19 pandemic —&nbsp;which forced the closure of many of the retailer’s stores — could not have come at a less opportune time for the company.</p>
<p>By the end of April, Mr. Martindale said, about 40%, or roughly 1,400, of GNC’s corporate and franchise stores had closed as did 25% of its international locations. Since then, about 100 domestic stores have reopened.</p>
<p>As of Monday, he added, nearly 3,800 store associates had been furloughed and more than 200 corporate staff —&nbsp;representing more than 40% of its corporate workforce —&nbsp;have been furloughed through at least the end of May.</p>
<p>The company recorded a $200.1 million loss for the first quarter, compared with a $15.3 million loss for the same period a year ago.</p>
