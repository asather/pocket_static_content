<h1>Businesses can face fines of more than $300 as police enforce governor's order to close all nonessential businesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police in Pennsylvania on Monday began enforcing an order given by Gov. Tom Wolf and the state health secretary last week that all physical locations of nonessential businesses be shut down to further prevent spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Businesses can be fined more than $300 if found in violation, according to state laws surrounding disease control.</p>
<p>The closure order — signed by the Liquor Control Board, the Department of Health and the Department of Agriculture — went into effect 8 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said they will patrol as usual and plan to investigate 911 calls and other complaints regarding businesses not complying with the order. If necessary, officers will complete a report for follow-up to potential non-compliance cases, according to city police spokesman Chris Togneri.</p>
<p>He said police hope not to cite anyone, adding&nbsp;“we are all in this together.”</p>
<p>“We are confident that this will not be an issue,” Mr. Togneri said in a statement.&nbsp;“The Pittsburgh business community wants to do what’s right for the greater safety of the community and we believe they will follow the guidelines and mandates. We understand that this is a difficult time for business owners ...”</p>
<p>Enforcement of the order was to originally start Saturday, but a large number of waiver requests from businesses prompted the Wolf administration to delay enforcement for two days. The order was issued after the state recorded its first COVID-19 related death two weeks ago in Northampton County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A revised list from Gov. Wolf shows businesses in accounting, payroll administration and tax preparation are now permitted to keep physical locations operating, as are insurance-related businesses.&nbsp;Insurance agencies and brokers are not to conduct in-person sales, however.&nbsp;All natural resources and mining industries are also to remain in operation. An original list released on Thursday stated those involved in forestry, logging and mining were to shut down their in-person facilities.</p>
<p>According to state police, the closures are enforceable through criminal penalties, under the Disease Control and Prevention Law of 1955 and the Administrative Code of 1929.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under the Disease Control and Prevention law, those who violate the governor’s mandate can&nbsp;be sentenced to pay a fine of no less than $25 and no more than $300. Failure to pay the fine could lead to imprisonment in the county jail for no more than 30 days, the law states. In addition, the Administrative Code of 1929 says those who violate orders from&nbsp;the Department of Health will be sentenced to pay a fine of no less than $10 dollars and no more than $50 to the county where the violation was committed.</p>
<p>Bars and restaurants that serve alcohol on-site were ordered to close last week by the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board.&nbsp;Businesses that violate The Liquor Code law will face misdemeanor charges and fined up to $500, and potentially jail time.</p>
<p>State police spokesman Trooper Steve Limani suggested people not call 911 to report violations, as officials&nbsp;“cannot handle the phone calls and the emergency ones as well.”&nbsp;He said state police does not have a particular team dedicated to checking businesses.&nbsp;Should anyone be fined, police are required to inform the public, Trooper Limani said.</p>
<p>“Our troopers are out handling the day to day activity and responding or self responding when needed,” he said in an emailed statement.&nbsp;“[You can] call the police department in the area that the business is located directly. There is not a set protocol on how we find non-compliant businesses. We will deal with them as they are brought to our attention or discovered otherwise.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County Police Superintendent Coleman McDonough said they will also investigate complaints of businesses not complying within their primary jurisdiction. Notices that includes businesses outside the county’s primary jurisdiction will be referred to the police within that area, Mr. McDonough said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police will not be on patrol looking for businesses in violation, he said.</p>
<p>“Our first course of action will be to strongly encourage our officers and detectives to educate business owners on the benefits of compliance with the order, in hopes of their voluntary compliance,” Mr. McDonough said.</p>
<p>Whether or not citations are immediately issued, or if warnings will be given first are up to “the police officer’s discretion,” Trooper Limani said.</p>
<p>“... It is our job to follow along with and enforce the governor’s directives to ensure public safety,” he said.</p>
