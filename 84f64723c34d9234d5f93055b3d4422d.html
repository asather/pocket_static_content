<h1>Beaver Falls nursing home has spike in COVID-19 cases among staff, residents — and at least 1 death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beaver County nursing home has shown a dramatic increase in COVID-19 cases among residents and staff, and reported at least one resident death from the infectious disease, according to state data released this week.</p>
<p>The state’s weekly long-term care facility update released Tuesday showed that Providence Care Center, a 180-bed nursing home in Beaver Falls, had a spike in the past week of 19 new COVID-19 cases among its 144 residents, pushing the total to 27 cases. The data also showed 27 new COVID-19 cases among its 106 employees, pushing the total among employees to 32, or 30% of its staff.</p>
<p>The same data also showed Providence in the past week had anywhere from one to four residents die from COVID-19. The exact figure is not known because the state reports exact figures only for five or more cases at specific facilities. When there are fewer than five deaths, it indicates that with an asterisk in the data.</p>

<p>In an emailed statement to the Post-Gazette on Thursday, Mark Fox, the president of Grane Healthcare, the parent company of Providence, did not mention anything about a death or deaths in the nursing home. Instead, he wrote that the rise in cases simply was the result of more testing and those with positive test results were “largely” asymptomatic among both staff and residents.</p>
<p>“In response to [the] local community outbreak, Providence has initiated an aggressive COVID testing program of all residents and staff,” Mr. Fox wrote, in part. “The effect of that increased and recurrent wide-scale testing recently resulted in a number of positive test results of largely asymptomatic staff and residents. Following the course approved by the Department of Health, Providence Care Center has taken immediate precautionary measures to isolate and contain the virus within our facility. Additionally, we are working closely with state and local partners and taking advantage of all available resources to contain the virus and minimize the risk to our facility.”</p>
<p>He did not respond to a series of questions sent by the Post-Gazette about the outbreak.</p>
