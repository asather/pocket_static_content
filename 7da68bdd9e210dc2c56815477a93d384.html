<h1>Ron Cook: Bob Huggins is a West Virginia legend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I went to Morgantown, W.Va., Friday night to attend Bob Huggins’ annual fish fry for the benefit of cancer research in honor of his late mother, Norma Mae. The crowd at Mylan Park Event Center was mind-blowing, estimated at 1,700. Over the years, the event has raised more than $6 million. “It’s bigger than Christmas!” Huggins said, gleefully.</p>
<p>Former West Virginia great and Hall of Famer Rod Thorn was the honored guest Friday night. A year ago, it was Mountaineers legend and NBA logo, Jerry West. The year before that, it was Kentucky coach John Calipari.</p>
<p>All of it is because of Huggins.</p>
<p>What happened the next day was just one more reason Huggins is a West Virginia legend.</p>
<p>One of 876, actually.</p>
<p>By beating Missouri, 74-51, Saturday at WVU Coliseum, the Mountaineers gave Huggins his 876th win as a college basketball coach, tying him with Adolph Rupp for seventh place on the all-time list. Four more wins will put Huggins into sixth place ahead of Dean Smith. Only Roy Williams, Jim Calhoun, Bob Knight, Jim Boeheim and Mike Krzyzewski have more wins.</p>
<p>“You’re tying coach Rupp? Whoa!” close pal Calipari said Sunday to Huggins in a video. “You know what this means? It means you can really coach. You’ve done it everywhere you’ve been. But the other thing, you’re really old!”</p>
<p>Huggins knows it.</p>
<p>His reaction Saturday after his latest win was typically low-key.</p>
<p>“My dad was one of the winningest coaches in the history of Ohio high schools. They used to say to him, ‘That was win number whatever.’ Or, ‘You just tied so-and-so.’ His response always was, ‘That just means I’m old.’ ”</p>
<p>Also typical of Huggins was his deadpan delivery of the punch line.</p>
<p>“You look at every one of those guys on the list, they are old.”</p>
<p>At 66, Huggins still is going strong, still is feisty. Earlier this month, after a loss at Kansas, he was fined $10,000 for calling the referees “three blind mice.” He also still is winning games, a lot of games.</p>
<p>West Virginia is 16-3 and ranked No. 14. ESPN’s latest bracketology has the Mountaineers as a No. 2 seed in the NCAA tournament. They no longer are “Press Virginia,” relying on a half-court game instead of full-court defensive pressure. They are led by talented freshman Oscar Tshiebwe, a McDonald’s All-American from Kennedy Catholic High School in Hermitage, Pa. Tshiebwe could be a one-and-done player and might be Huggins’ best player since he had Kenyon Martin on his Cincinnati teams in the late-1990s.</p>
<p>This will be the 10th NCAA tournament appearance for Huggins in his 13 seasons at West Virginia. He has been honored as the national coach of the year six times. He took the Mountaineers to the Final Four in 2010 and did it with Cincinnati in 1992, but he will tell you his 2000 Cincinnati team was his best team. It lost to Tulsa in the second round of the tournament after Martin’s right leg was broken in the conference tournament.</p>
<p>“We were the best team in the country,” Huggins said. “There wasn’t anyone even close.”</p>
<p>Huggins is again a nominee for the Naismith Hall of Fame, the 2020 class to be announced in April at the Final Four. He should have gone in years ago, but voters have appeared to hold the fact he hasn’t won a national championship against him. It’s hard to think they will keep him out this year with his wins total reaching such a staggering number.</p>
<p>“I have never been caught up in that,” Huggins said.</p>
<p>Huggins said he continues to coach because he loves basketball and loves the relationships with his players. I’ve talked to him several times about how there isn’t a tougher coach in college basketball. He won’t apologize for it.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything else. I grew up playing for my dad. If we had a four-hour practice, we thought it was an off day …</p>
<p>“This idea that you coach them too hard or work them too hard is absurd. Guys want to get better. I am what I am. I think time has verified that my guys care about me as much as I care about them.”</p>
<p>The players know how much Huggins cares.</p>
<p>Ask Martin.</p>
<p>“Someone asked Kenyon once, ‘You went to the University of Cincinnati, right?’ ” Huggins said. “His response was, ‘No, I went to the University of Bob Huggins.’ ”</p>
<p>Ask Da’Sean Butler, the star of West Virginia’s 2010 team. He tore up his left knee in the national semifinal loss to Duke. Huggins rushed on the court to comfort Butler, who was in tears. He got on his hands and knees and cradled Butler’s face with both hands. There have been few more poignant moments at any sporting event.</p>
<p>“He told me loved me and that I was a special kid,” Butler said.</p>
<p>Huggins has told the story how he turned down a chance to leave Cincinnati to coach the NBA’s Miami Heat for $5 million a year. He related a conversation he had with former Cincinnati point guard Nick Van Exel.</p>
<p>“I told him if I took the Miami job, I could take care of my family forever,” Huggins said. “He said, ‘Coach, how much money do you need? These guys need you just like I needed you. I called my wife and said, ‘I can’t go.’ I couldn’t leave the players.”</p>
<p>The NBA’s loss was college basketball’s gain.</p>
<p>It still is college basketball’s gain.</p>
