<h1>ESPN expert sees Pirates taking college hitter with No. 7 pick in MLB draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The MLB draft can be harder for fans to wrap their minds around than, say, the NFL or NBA drafts.</p>
<p>College, and even moreso high school, baseball is broadly less popular than college football and basketball. Plus, the players selected in the MLB draft don’t make it to the majors for years down the road, if at all.</p>
<p>Still, for a small market team like the Pirates, it can’t be overstated how important the draft can be. The free agency market is harder to play for them, so strong farm systems resulting from strong drafts is the most direct way to success.</p>
<p>The importance is increased even more this year, since the MLB draft has been reduced to just five rounds, leaving the Pirates with six selections — one in each round plus a compensatory pick. Fewer selections mean a smaller margin for error.</p>
<p>With that, the Pirates need to hit on their picks. Especially their No. 7 overall selection.</p>
<p>ESPN expert Kiley McDaniel, who spent multiple years in various front office roles with different teams, including the Pirates, hosted a conference call on Thursday in which he discussed some of the story lines for the draft.</p>
<p>For the Pirates, he feels they simply need to bolster their farm system. Sure, there are some positional holes to fill, like at catcher, but he feels they should just be looking for the best player whom they project to be in the majors in two or three years, to help what will hopefully, for the Pirates’ sake, be an upward-trending team by then.</p>
<p>“They really need to just restock the farm system, and I think ideally it would be guys that’ll be there in the next two or three years, so that they can, from today, start loading up toward their next playoff team and not have a guy that’s ... like multiple years in rookie ball, but luckily in the top 10 there’s not really prospects like that,” McDaniel said. “Even high school guys are expected to move quickly. That’s why I would expect them to look college with their second or third picks, when those guys are options.</p>
<p>“I don’t think needs really come into play here. I think it’s just who’s the best prospect.”</p>
<p>As for whom that may be, McDaniel threw out a couple of names.</p>
<p>Arkansas outfielder Heston Kjerstad fits the bill of just a good, college hitter. The left-hander hit .332 in his freshman season with the Razorbacks, .331 as a sophomore and was hitting .448 through 16 games before the 2020 season was halted. Projections have him in and around the top 10, depending on where you look.</p>
<p>If the Pirates do try to fill a need, McDaniel believes NC State catcher Patrick Bailey might be the target. Of course, Bailey could be a top-10 pick anyway as the highest-rated catcher in the draft. He hit .302 in three seasons with the Wolfpack, including six home runs in just 17 games in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McDaniel simply feels the Pirates may go the college route to ensure their selection is further along in their development to be ready to compete in MLB sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>“I would expect them to go college hitter, but it sounds like they’re considering all aspects because like I said, at the top of the draft, you’re not getting those two-year rookie ball guys,” McDaniel said. “Even the high school kids are going to move pretty quickly.”</p>
<p>The Pirates could certainly look elsewhere, though. According to multiple reports, there has been growing momentum linking them to Oregon high school pitcher Mick Abel. As is the case with drafting high schoolers, this would be a bet on Abel’s upside versus playing it safe with a college player who has more track record. But Abel is the consensus top high school pitcher, according to McDaniel, and while he wasn’t thought to be on the Pirates’ radar even a few weeks ago, McDaniel has heard rumblings that he is a real possibility for them at No. 7.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that most of the top high school players, save Florida outfielder Zac Veen, are supposed to remain on the board at No. 7, according to McDaniel, so the Pirates could take their pick there, depending on how they view the remaining options.</p>
<p>Given the importance of the Pirates hitting on as many of their draft picks as possible, it makes sense that McDaniel sees them going with college hitters after their first-round pick, for the reasons outlined above.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that sentiment isn’t exclusive to the Pirates. McDaniel says teams may be down on high schoolers in general this year, since their shortened season means scouts didn’t get as close a look at them as they normally would have.</p>
<p>“Teams are telling me that they are drastically reducing the amount of high school players that they are willing to meet the price for,” McDaniel said. “So in the case of even players that have multi-year history, were good over the summer, check all the boxes, if they just didn’t see them this spring or they didn’t have higher-level scouts see them this spring, they’re just not getting what they thought they were going to pay them if they could have seen them for maybe one more month.</p>
<p>“So there’s going to be a lot of college players getting pushed up, and the high school players that are in demand, that everyone feels comfortable with, will go quickly in those first 30-50 picks, and then I think it’ll be even more college-heavy than it is normally.”</p>
