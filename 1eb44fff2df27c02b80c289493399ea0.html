<h1>Tony Norman: Taking Communion in the age of the coronavirus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last week, my wife casually suggested that we stock up on $100 worth of nonperishable foods and other supplies in response to the coronavirus. I laughed.</p>
<p>Was my wife — a woman who prides herself on being logical to a fault — feeling like a “Doomsday prepper” all of a sudden? This was weeks after a box of medical face masks mysteriously materialized on the bottom shelf of the kitchen hutch, though she isn’t a practicing surgeon as far as I know.</p>
<p>“Do whatever you think is necessary,” I said with only a hint of exasperation, though the tone in my voice suggested I wanted nothing to do with that errand. My only suggestion was that she pick up extra bags of dog food if she truly expected the worldwide supply chain that undergirds capitalism to be disrupted for more than a few days.</p>
<p>At Giant Eagle and other stops along Apocalypse Boulevard, she picked up boxes of canned foods, supersize bags of Asian rice, many long boxes of pasta, cans of tuna fish, jars of peanut butter, lots of condiments, jugs of juices and enough toilet paper to last two nondiarrhetic adults until the winter of 2024.</p>
<p>Because I want to avoid eating what amounts to the nutritionally banal standard American diet in our future bunker, my plan is to consume a lot of beans, water, frozen fruits, vegetables and what’s left of the wilting plant-based food supply while society slowly collapses.</p>
<p>On Sunday, I attended a church in Oakland where I’ve been a familiar face for decades. During the passing of the peace — the time in the service when parishioners greet each other with handshakes and sometimes hugs and kisses — things proceeded normally enough, but there were notable exceptions.</p>
<p>There were more fist bumps than usual, more clasping of forearms, more air handshakes and something resembling elbow-to-elbow strikes. Was this a church service or a warm up before a mime performance?</p>
<p>When Communion was served, there was more attention than usual paid to it because the ritual of dipping crackers into cups of juice intinction-style was suddenly looking pretty suspect from a public health perspective. But there’s no way to put social distance between oneself and the sacrament without defeating the purpose of the sacrament, which is rooted in radical community intimacy.</p>
<p>Still, I received the host and dipped it into what I hope will turn into actual wine some day. Alas, because the bulk of American Christians have always paid lip service to temperance and abstention from alcohol, it will probably always be a commercial variety of grape juice.</p>
<p>My only thought while dipping the host was that consecrated wine might actually kill traces of COVID-19 that might be floating around the cup. I’m self-aware enough to know that such a notion reflects the wishful thinking of someone who knows as little about epidemiology and the spread of viral diseases as President Donald Trump does.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn’t thinking much about COVID-19 until Mr. Trump began weighing in on the subject with some of the most blatant lies, misleading statements and willfully ignorant observations of his presidency.</p>
<p>During an appearance on propaganda outlet “Hannity” on Fox News on Wednesday, the president disputed the host’s casual assumption that the global death rate from COVID-19 is 3.4%.</p>
<p>“I think the 3.4% is a false number,” Mr. Trump said with no proof whatsoever. “Now, this is just my hunch, but [it is] based on a lot of conversations with a lot of people that do this.”</p>
<p>Medical professionals are dutifully horrified by Mr. Trump’s hunches because they run counter to their estimates about global mortality rates.</p>
<p>To date, Mr. Trump has casually lied about everything from the number of Americans who have contracted and died from COVID-19 to the number of months it would take to develop, test and approve a vaccine for widespread use.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump also exaggerated the efficiency of American testing protocols for the disease, blamed the Obama administration for coronavirus test kit shortages, accused Democrats of exaggerating the seriousness of the crisis to undermine his presidency and, in a transparent attempt to allay Wall Street fears that wiped $6 trillion in wealth from the market last week, downplayed how deadly COVID-19 can be.</p>
<p>“A lot of people will have [COVID-19] and it’s very mild,” Mr. Trump told a credulous Sean Hannity Wednesday night. “They’ll get better very rapidly. They don’t even see a doctor; they don’t even call a doctor. You never hear about those people,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>“So you can’t put them down in the category of the overall population in terms of this corona flu and/or virus. So you just can’t do that. So if, you know, we have thousands or hundreds of thousands of people that get better just by, you know, sitting around and even going to work —&nbsp;some of them go to work, but they get better,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>So far, the stock market has reacted to Mr. Trump’s incoherent optimism by continuing to dive after a brief recovery earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around the world, historic sites are closing, festivals are being postponed, whole cities are without traffic for the first time and governments are responding to COVID-19 as if it were capable of decimating an unacceptable percentage of its populations, regardless of how small, if not held in check.</p>
<p>In America, we sift through conflicting medical pronouncements about COVID-19 while mostly ignoring presidential tweets and comments about a rapidly spreading virus the famously germaphobic commander in chief obviously doesn’t understand. Even Vice President Mike Pence has been compelled to admit for the first time that there aren’t enough medical kits in America to test everyone for the disease.</p>
<p>I wasn’t nervous before Mr. Trump tried to reassure the American people that regardless of what happens beyond our borders, we have COVID-19 under control here. It would be foolhardy and the height of magical thinking not to be nervous now.</p>
