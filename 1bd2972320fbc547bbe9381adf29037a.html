<h1>Mt. Lebanon School District, school directors provide cyber education options </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In anticipation of the need for cyber learning in the Mt. Lebanon School District, school directors at a July 15 virtual meeting unanimously approved a $296,940 contract to provide cyber education options for its students this fall.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon will partner with the Allegheny Intermediate Unit for its Waterfront Learning Services, which uses the learning management system Edgenuity to create online courses that can then be customized by Mt. Lebanon teachers.</p>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon School District plans to offer a cyber academy for students and parents who do not feel comfortable coming back to school in August because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Some parents commented during the meeting that the teachers and parents did not have enough information on the cyber program and requested that the board delay its vote.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure how a vote can be held without [the information] being viewed by the community,” said resident Michael Babbich.</p>
<p>Superintendent Tim Steinhauer said “time is of the essence” as far as getting a learning management system in place for the start of school in approximately five weeks.</p>
<p>“This is a framework to allow for a stronger online program,” said board President Sarah Olbrich.</p>
<p>Ms. Olbrich stressed that Mt. Lebanon’s curriculum will be taught in the cyber academy by Mt. Lebanon teachers.</p>
<p>“We are not outsourcing the teaching of our students,” she said.</p>
<p>Marybeth Irvin, assistant superintendent of elementary education, presented information on Waterfront Learning and Edgenuity at the meeting and said the district recognized the need for a learning management system in March when schools closed.</p>
<p>“We needed something that was going to be flexible,” she said, adding that there is always the possibility that all students will have to do online school at some point in the school year.</p>
<p>Ms. Irvin said Edgenuity is customizable and comes with “foundational content provided.”</p>
<p>“We have great courses, but we don’t have them built online,” Ms. Irvin said.</p>
<p>She said the district’s team can take the framework for the courses that is already built in to Edgenuity and customize it for Mt. Lebanon’s courses.</p>
<p>“It’s easier than starting from scratch,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Irvin added the program can also be used by teachers in brick-and-mortar classrooms.</p>
<p>Additionally, Edgenuity can be used either synchronously or asynchronously -- meaning there can be live teaching or office hours with teachers or teachers can record their lessons and upload videos for students to watch at their convenience.</p>
<p>The cyber academy students will be fully graded as in traditional classrooms -- unlike the pass/fail model the district used when it went online at the end of the 2019-20 school year.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to replicate a Mt. Lebanon education,” Ms. Irvin said, adding the curriculum will not differ from what is taught in a brick-and-mortar classroom.</p>
<p>Ms. Irvin said advanced placement courses will be provided and students enrolled in the cyber academy will have the opportunity to participate in athletics and activities as they are available.</p>
<p>The virtual meeting was attended by more than 1,200 people, thus commenting was limited.</p>
<p>Ms. Olbrich invited parents and residents who did not get the chance to comment during the July 15 meeting to fill out a survey on the district’s website at www.mtlsd.org or to email the board at SchoolBoardEmailList@mtlsd.net</p>
