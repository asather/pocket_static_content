<h1>Even after 2019 struggles, Mason Rudolph 'confident' he'll be an NFL starter someday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mason Rudolph has endured a career’s worth of disappointment, punishment and heartache … and he has played in only 10 NFL games.</p>
<p>He is coming off a season that is part encouraging, part forgettable, a season in which he was knocked unconscious at Heinz Field, clubbed on the head with his own helmet on national television, accused of using a racial slur that led to the melee in Cleveland, lost his job to an undrafted rookie free agent, and suffered a season-ending injury to his left shoulder.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it wasn’t bad.</p>
<p>“I think when I look back at last year, I didn’t run our offense at the level to meet the Pittsburgh Steelers’ standard,” Rudolph said Saturday before the Steelers participated in their first scrimmage of training camp. “You look at the film and you look at your deficiencies and the way to improve. There is a lot of meat on the bone there.”</p>
<p>All this as the stand-in for Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Rudolph, the 76th overall pick in the 2018 draft, had never appeared in an NFL game until Roethlisberger was injured in Week 2 against Seattle. But he compiled a 5-3 record as a starter, threw more touchdowns (13) than interceptions (9), and had the best passer rating (82.0) and yards per game average (176.5) on the team.</p>
<p>To be sure, there was the four-interception game in Cleveland and being yanked for Devlin Hodges a week later in Cincinnati. But in case he needed any validation, Rudolph proved to himself he is capable of being more than Roethlisberger’s backup one day.</p>
<p>“I am confident that I will be a starting quarterback in the NFL, and right now, my job is to prepare and push Ben and help our guys in any way that I can,” Rudolph said. “And, obviously, in training camp, improve and take advantage of every single day.”</p>
<p>The Steelers never have to worry about Rudolph’s preparation, whether in season or out. He spent the offseason looking over every snap he took in 2019, everything from his best passing performances of the season — 251 yards and two touchdowns against the Miami Dolphins and 242 yards and a touchdown against the Los Angeles Rams — to the debacle in Cleveland and the miserable first-half performance in Cincinnati that led to his benching.</p>
<p>All three of Rudolph’s losses as a starter were on the road. And he threw three touchdowns against six interceptions in those games.</p>
<p>“I went back and watched every single rep a couple of times,” Rudolph said. “I made notes and reached out to people and asked for their opinions, whether that was people on our staff or people outside of our direct building. I kind of had a feeling of what I need to work on, but it is always great to have another set of eyes and someone else bringing something to your attention.”</p>
<p>The Steelers tried to assist in that development by hiring Matt Canada as quarterbacks coach, alleviating offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner of the dual role he held for two seasons. In hindsight, the move might have been served last season when Rudolph and Hodges were each playing in an NFL game for the first time.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Steelers saw enough of Rudolph in 2019 to apparently convince them they did not need to sign a veteran quarterback in the offseason. Players such as Jameis Winston and Cam Newton were never a serious option.</p>
<p>Both coach Mike Tomlin and general manager Kevin Colbert said several times during the offseason they are “comfortable” with Rudolph as their No. 2 quarterback. And Rudolph appreciated the show of faith.</p>
<p>“It has been great to have a quarterback coach now be a part of our organization to help myself as well as the other guys in the room,” Rudolph said. “I am very confident about myself. I think when the organization supports you and has faith in you moving forward, it is always going to build your confidence.”</p>
<p>In what was a disappointing — but probably fitting — end to his calamitous season, Rudolph suffered an injury to his left shoulder against the New York Jets that was initially thought to be a mere dislocation. But as the pain worsened, it was later discovered he had something more serious —&nbsp;posterior sternoclavicular dislocation, an injury that can threaten several vital structures near the medial clavicle, including the trachea and aorta.</p>
<p>Rudolph had surgery immediately upon returning to Pittsburgh and had a two-month recovery period. But before he was injured, he came off the bench to replace Hodges and completed 14 of 20 passes for 129 yards and a touchdown with a 104.0 passer rating — an important rebound performance for him and the coaches.</p>
<p>“It was unfortunate ... with the injury there and kind of being removed when you felt like we were heading in the right direction with a chance to make the playoffs there,” Rudolph said. “Every game you can pull something from it. I am very confident right now going into this year. Putting a finishing touch [on it], even with the injury and losing the game, there are things to build on.”</p>
