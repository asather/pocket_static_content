<h1>Wolf moves to create councils meant to target health care costs </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf took a first step Friday to set up new councils targeted to controlling health care costs while also aiming to improve access to medical care and address treatment disparities caused by poverty, joblessness and lack of health insurance.</p>
<p>At a news conference in Harrisburg, the governor signed an executive order creating the Interagency Health Reform Council among state agencies involved in health. The council has an ambitious initial goal of making recommendations by Dec. 30 on such things as the joint purchase of medications.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf also plans to create five Regional Accountable Health Councils across the state to develop ways of reducing disparities in the health care system and promote the purchase of health care services based on the highest value to the consumer.</p>
<p>Finally, the governor said he will work with the legislature to create a Health Value Commission, a body that will be charged with keeping health care payers and providers accountable for spending growth and ensuring the long-term affordability and sustainability of the health care system by setting spending benchmarks.</p>
<p>“We need to do what we can to stem the tide of rising costs,” Mr. Wolf said. “Even before the pandemic, there were signs that health care needed reform.”</p>
<p>Rising health care costs have been a target for politicians in recent years. President Donald Trump has touted his efforts to control prescription costs and the Affordable Care Act, put in place during President Barack Obama’s term, included tools meant to reward outcomes rather than running up bills for tests and high-cost care.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s new plan mirrors one introduced in Massachusetts in 2012 when a health policy commission — an independent government agency — was created to lead an effort to make health care more affordable for the state’s residents.</p>
<p>That commission has had some success. With hospitals and doctors across the state meeting benchmark goals most years, employers and consumers spent an estimated $7.2 billion less on health care between 2013 and 2018 than they would have if the state’s spending growth had matched the national average, according to a March report by the Commonwealth Fund.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Like Massachusetts, Pennsylvania’s approach will rely on enlisting health care providers and insurers as partners in reaching spending benchmarks, state Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman said.</p>
<p>“It’s not a mandate, not regulatory approval,” Ms. Altman said. “It’s transparency, it’s setting targets.”</p>
<p>The plan is to tap people with health care experience, although that process has not started yet.</p>
<p>The new councils and commission will not set limits on health care spending by hospitals, Mr. Wolf said, but rather set goals that have been collaboratively developed with medical providers.</p>
<p>“This is absolutely not a cap,” he said. “It’s an attempt to pressure the health care system to be more transparent in the decisions they make on health care costs.”</p>
<p>Among the forces driving up health care costs is consolidation of health care providers, which happens when big hospital chains acquire community hospitals, said Doug Jacobs, a physician and chief innovation officer at the state Department of Human Services.</p>
<p>Such transactions can occur outside public view. That would change under Mr. Wolf’s plan.</p>
<p>“These&nbsp;kinds of acquisitions often lead to higher health care costs,” Dr. Jacobs said. The deals will start to get scrutiny through “public interest reviews,” he said.&nbsp;“The ability to heal often reside outside the doctor’s office.”</p>
<p>The governor’s program seems to dovetail nicely with UPMC’s DNA, a spokeswoman for the Pittsburgh-based health system said.</p>
<p>“As one of the country’s leading integrated provider-insurers, UPMC is always striving to provide high-quality care at the lowest cost,” Susan Manko said in a statement.</p>
<p>Medicaid patients, who are typically four times as costly to treat as people with commercial health insurance, are driving up health care costs because they are often impoverished, so cost-control efforts should start with eliminating health care disparities and meeting basic human needs, said Jeffrey Cohen, an Allegheny General Hospital physician who aims to turn a closed Bellevue hospital into a tool to control health care costs.</p>
<p>Poverty, hunger and difficulty accessing doctors’ offices and hospitals are among the social factors that can hurt a person’s health.</p>
<p>“The cost of health care can be measured by social determinants,” Dr. Cohen said.</p>
