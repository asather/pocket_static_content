<h1>Kenny Chesney's Heinz Field show is moved to June 2021</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Kenny Chesney&nbsp;Chillaxification Tour, which was scheduled to hit Heinz Field on May 30, has been scheduled to June 12, 2021.</p>
<p>Yes, that is a Saturday.</p>
<p>“I kept talking to experts, city officials, team owners, medical people, looking to understand how we were coming along with resolving the health issues,” Chesney explained in a statement. “I had kept hoping that as time passed, information would not only increase, but there would be some sort of solution so people could come back together. But things weren’t getting any clearer, so I did the hardest thing for me, but obviously best option for the safety of No Shoes Nation, my road family and everyone at the buildings involved.”</p>
<p>It will feature the same lineup with Florida Georgia Line, Old Dominion and Michael Franti &amp; Spearhead.</p>
<p>“So much goes into the stadium shows, people have no idea,” Chesney said. “Take all of that, then factor in all the other issues that come with rescheduling, making sure there aren’t conflicts with baseball or other events nearby – and maintain the kind of quality we want to bring. There were so many questions, so many unknowns, but I believe music makes a difference in people’s lives, so everyone on my team, the promoter’s team and all of the people we deal with have worked overtime trying to get this sorted out.</p>
<p>Original tickets are automatically valid for the rescheduled show dates. Patrons unable to attend the rescheduled shows have 30 days from June 15 to request a refund at the point of purchase.</p>
