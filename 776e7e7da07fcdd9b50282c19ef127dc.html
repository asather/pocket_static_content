<h1>“Abuse certainly didn't stop”: Fewer people calling for help, but services are still available</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After several weeks of closed schools and businesses and most people spending far more hours in their homes than they did previously, calls to local and state abuse hotlines have declined.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But fewer calls to domestic violence and child abuse hotlines likely doesn't actually mean less violence is occurring, advocates say.</p>
<p>Advocates for victims of domestic violence in particular emphasize services are available and shelters remain open for those who need them.</p>
<p>“We're still open. We're still serving,” said Nicole Molinaro, president and CEO of the Women's Center &amp; Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, which operates a Pittsburgh shelter, in addition to other services such as therapy and legal advocacy programs.</p>
<p>Hotline calls to her shelter have declined by more than 30%, according to an update Ms. Molinaro shared with other local human service providers earlier this week. Local filings seeking Protection from Abuse orders have also declined, but police calls about intimate partner violence are up, she said.</p>
<p>Call volume has also decreased to the hotline run by Center for Victims, which operates an Allegheny County-based emergency shelter for domestic violence victims, but officials there stress services are still available.</p>
<p>“We are here, we are open, we are live and in-person. We are operating our shelter as we normally do,” with additional safety precautions for social distancing, said Bethany Wingerson, director of domestic violence services at Center for Victims.</p>
<p>Why are they getting fewer calls? Ms. Wingerson believes it's due to a combination of victims having less access to call because they have less out-of-the-house or alone time, and perhaps an incorrect assumption that shelters are closed.</p>
<p>“For folks that might be in a situation where they don't feel safe... . Those services are still there,” said Commonwealth Victim Advocate Jennifer Storm.</p>
<p>Calls also have declined to hotlines for reporting child abuse operated by the state and Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Between March 9 and March 30, Allegheny County saw a decrease of 51% in calls reporting suspected child abuse or neglect.</p>
<p>“Everybody's staying at home. There's a stay-at-home order. When that happens, these kids become invisible,” said&nbsp;Jacki Hoover, deputy director of the county’s human services office of Children, Youth, and Families.</p>
<p>“Abuse certainly didn't stop,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There's been a roughly 50% reduction in daily average calls to ChildLine, the state’s child abuse hotline, since the state put in place significant social distancing measures, according to Erin James, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Human Services.</p>
<p>“While we wish that a data trend of fewer child abuse reports could be reasonably interpreted to indicate fewer instances of child abuse, we know this is unlikely to be the case. Rather, one unfortunate effect of temporary school closures is the lack of interaction between children, their teachers and other mandated reporters in school settings,” she said, referring to people who are professionally required to report suspected abuse.</p>
<p>In addition to the ongoing pandemic and stay-at-home order that has closed schools and most child care facilities, many families are also facing the stressors of potentially unstable housing, lost jobs or income, and in some cases a loss of support from other relatives who might have assisted with child care.</p>
<p>Those compounding stresses can mean people might “not make good decisions,” Ms. Hoover said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County caseworkers are still making home visits for investigations and continuing to work on active cases. The agency can also help families in need and can connect them to things they might need such as infant formula, diapers, or a safe place for a baby to sleep such as a pack and play, she said.&nbsp;They’ve also made online videos for families about <a href="https://vimeo.com/404580678" target="_blank">safely storing medications</a> and how to <a href="https://vimeo.com/404580697" target="_blank">properly soothe a wailing baby</a>.</p>
<p>“We are still out, doing our investigations and providing family support. If families need something from us, we are able to give them the support they need,” Ms. Hoover said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Center for Victims hotline is 1-866-644-2882.&nbsp;The Women's Center hotline is 412-687-8005 or <a href="/" target="_blank">outreach@wcspittsburgh.org</a>.&nbsp;Protection from Abuse orders can still be filed in Allegheny County at the Pittsburgh Municipal Court building, 660 First Avenue, Pittsburgh, PA 15219.</em></p>
<p><em>To report suspected child abuse or neglect, call 1-800-932-0313 or&nbsp;412-473-2000.</em></p>
