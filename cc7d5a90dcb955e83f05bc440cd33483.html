They’ll likely never see the $500 million a federal court ordered North Korea to pay them when a judge ruled the pariah nation responsible for the 22-year-old Cincinnati-area man’s death.</p><p>They probably will never get answers about exactly what happened to their son in custody that led to his arrival back in the United States in a vegetative state.</p><p>But the Warmbiers stood with Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey and Ohio Sens. Rob Portman and Sherrod Brown last month to support a bill in Otto Warmbier’s name aimed at getting a modicum of accountability. The bill sanctions banks that do business with North Korea, despite its record of human rights abuses.</p><p>Mr. Warmbier was arrested in North Korea in 2016, allegedly for stealing a propaganda poster in a hotel, while there on a tour with other college students. He was released a year later in a vegetative state and died shortly after.</p><p>The Otto Warmbier North Korea Nuclear Sanctions and Enforcement Act was attached to a defense spending bill and is aimed mainly at the Chinese banks that continue to work with North Korea even as most of the world has isolated the rogue nation that not only disregards basic human rights, but also threatens the United States and pursues a dangerous nuclear weapons campaign.</p><p>The U.S. has had sanctions in place against North Korea for years, but experts believe Kim Jong Un’s regime can evade the worst effects of these thanks to Chinese financial institutions that continue to work with North Korea to circumvent the economic restrictions.</p><p>While President Donald Trump’s diplomacy was credited with getting North Korea to release the gravely ill Otto Warmbier in 2017, his administration has not had much success in getting North Korea to give up its nuclear ambitions.</p><p>Mr. Trump has also made unfortunate statements about the role of Kim in Mr. Warmbier’s death, saying he believed the dictator when he said he knew nothing of what had happened to the Ohio college student.</p><p>It is crucial for the U.S. to keep up economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea, which makes the sanctions measure named for Mr. Warmbier vital to U.S. foreign strategy. North Korea cannot be allowed to become an even bigger menace on the global stage, and it must, at some point, be held to account for what it did to Otto Warmbier.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/2020/01/04/Pres-sur-ing-North-Korea/stories/202001010112</original_url>
