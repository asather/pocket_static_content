<h1>The good and bad of the Pirates' 2020 ZiPs projections</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Clint Hurdle and Neal Huntington are gone. Derek Shelton and Ben Cherington have replaced them as manager and general manager, respectively. And still, 10,000 simulations may not be nearly enough to give the Pirates much hope in 2020. At least according to some top predictive statistical models.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dave Szymborski’s industry-leading ZiPs projections for the club were <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/2020-zips-projections-pittsburgh-pirates/" target="_blank">released Wednesday at Fangraphs</a>, and they paint a pretty grim picture for most of the roster.</p>
<p>“The team has little star power to actually build around and while they have a number of solid players in the lineup — Josh Bell, [Bryan] Reynolds, and Gregory Polanco are all good — they lack an impact player who seems likely to be part of the next good Pirates team, as the Braves had with Freddie Freeman when they entered their rebuild,” Szymborski wrote in breaking down the offense.</p>
<p>“The offense won’t be Detroit-lousy, but the ceiling is very limited and it’s hard to see a scenario in which they flip the script.”</p>
<p>Of course, such projections aren’t always on the money. Last year, ZiPs called for first baseman Josh Bell to hit just 17 homers. He more than doubled that by socking 37. It also vastly overestimated the value the Pirates would get from third basemen Colin Moran and Jung Ho Kang.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most players, however, usually finish somewhere in the ballpark of their projected production. For example, ZiPs nailed Kevin Newman providing value at shortstop and Adam Frazier seizing his opportunity to start at second base.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For that reason, ZiPs and models like it provide a nice base line for reasonable expectations. So let’s dive into the outlook for the year ahead.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Catcher</strong></p>
<p>Not much love here for one of the Pirates’ few meaningful acquisitions of the offseason. Luke Maile is expected to perform exactly at replacement level behind Jacob Stallings. The good news is that ZiPs sees the latter as a competent starter amid the departures of Francisco Cervelli and Elias Diaz, calling for adequate slashes of .256 average/.310 on-base/.380 slugging to go with Stallings’ traditionally steady defense.</p>
<p><strong>First base</strong></p>
<p>Bell will be the team’s most valuable position player at a projected 2.6 wins above replacement, but ZiPs expects some substantial regression. The model has him at just 27 homers and an OPS of .858, down from 37 homers and a .936 OPS a year ago.</p>
<p><strong>Second base</strong></p>
<p>This should still be Frazier’s domain, and his alone. ZiPs has him a 2.5 WAR, putting him a hair behind Bell for the team lead. No other candidates for playing time are even close — Kevin Kramer is the closest competition at 0.7 WAR, so Frazier faces no real competition.</p>
<p><strong>Third base</strong></p>
<p>It’s Ke’Bryan Hayes time. Or at least it should be. With starter-level playing time, the prospect is projected as the team’s third most valuable position player at 2.2 WAR. Moran, the incumbent, isn’t even close at 0.8 WAR, mostly because his glove work is poor. Hayes, by comparison, would be the team’s best defender and provide reasonable production from the plate — 10 homers and a slash line of .247/.314/.393. Whether he’ll actually win the job in spring training remains to be seen, but ZiPs likes him a lot whenever he arrives.</p>
<p><strong>Shortstop</strong></p>
<p>The close call between Newman and Gonzalez last year is no contest now. ZiPs projects replacement level production from Gonzalez in a bench role, while Newman should be among the team leaders with 2.0 WAR. Kind-of prospect Cole Tucker — in and out of the big-league lineup last year — is the preferred backup. ZiPs anticipates some pop with plus-defense.</p>
<p><strong>Outfield</strong></p>
<p>Get ready for some regression from Bryan Reynolds, who ZiPs puts in center field in Starling Marte’s absence. Not enough to call it an outright sophomore slump after his breakout rookie campaign, just a noticeable step back. ZiPs has him at 2.0 WAR, down from 3.2 a year ago, and a slash line of .265/.329/.423. Those numbers were .313/.377/.503 in 2019. Gregory Polanco is projected for a nice bounce-back campaign beside Reynolds — 1.2 WAR and a slash line of .246/.323/.455. Left field, however, is looking like a black hole minus Marte. Jason Martin and Guillermo Heredia are penciled into that spot for now at a combined value barely above replacement level.</p>
<p><strong>Starting pitchers</strong></p>
<p>They should be fine, but not much more than fine. The projections for Joe Musgrove, Chris Archer, Trevor Williams and Mitch Keller have all of them posting ERAs between 4.14 and 4.29 and WARs between 1.6 and 1.9. Not bad, but certainly not good either. ZiPs likes Chad Kuhl, returning from Tommy John surgery, as the fifth starter with a 4.33 ERA and 1.0 WAR. Steven Brault is expected to take a big step back from his strong second half. For a full season, he’s not pegged for much more than replacement level production.</p>
<p><strong>Bullpen </strong></p>
<p>One word: woof. ZiPs projects only three guys to post sub-4.00 ERAs, and two of them barely fit even that criteria. Keone Kela leads the way at 3.40 and is followed by Nick Burdi (3.86) and Kyle Crick (3.93.) And Burdi seems far from a sure thing coming off <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/26/nick-burdi-injury-update-pirates-bullpen-2020/stories/202001260146" target="_blank">arm surgery</a> in June. Guys including Richard Rodriguez and Michael Feliz could be in the neighborhood of useful, but ZiPs is pretty clear that it sees no true shut-down guys in this group. Just a lot of mediocrity, at best.</p>
