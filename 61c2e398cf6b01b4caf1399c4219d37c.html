<h1>Drive-in Easter services offered on Armstrong County big screen </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the global pandemic continues into the weekend, an Armstrong County church found a way to still preach to the masses while practicing social distancing for Easter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvest Baptist Church in Harrison will be broadcasting Easter services at the Riverside Drive-In theater in Parks Township this weekend, allowing families to view a recorded sermon from their vehicles on the big screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The church is offering six viewing times with two shows a night between Friday and Sunday. Two showtimes were already sold out Friday afternoon as the church warned of limited space.</p>
<p>Harvest Baptist encouraged people in cars to attend a free 7:45 p.m. or 9:15 p.m. time slot each night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We can't wait to celebrate the resurrection of Jesus with you at Riverside Drive-In,” read a post on Harvest Baptist Church’s Facebook page.</p>
