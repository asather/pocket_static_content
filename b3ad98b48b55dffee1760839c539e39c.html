In&nbsp;“The Other Einstein,” Ms. Terrell tells the story of physicist Mileva Maric and her unhappy marriage to the emotionally abusive Albert Einstein.</p><p>The following is a Q&amp;A with Ms. Terrell about her project to reclaim these important women from the shadows of history.</p><p><strong>PG:</strong> What was the inspiration for "Lady Clementine?”</p><p><strong>Terrell:</strong> I encountered Clementine Churchill while I was knee-deep in World War II research for my last novel,&nbsp;“The Only Woman in the Room” and kept bumping into Winston Churchill — the ubiquitous cigar, the Homburg hat, the famous speeches, and the “V” for victory sign.</p><p>I couldn’t help but wonder about his family, his wife in particular. I found it peculiar that I knew nothing about the spouse of one of the most recognizable men in history, even though I knew he had a marriage lasting many decades. Who was she? What was she like? Where was she during all these world-changing events? So I went down the rabbit hole of research, as I often do when I’m intrigued, and I learned that Clementine Churchill was not only the quintessential women behind the man, but she was also standing beside him — and often in front of him — helping him lead through some of the most critical moments in modern history.</p><p>I knew the story of this bright, complicated, loyal, bold, and sometimes contentious woman deserved to be told.</p><p><strong>PG:</strong> You've become a chronicler of the lives of women who have been obscured by the shadow of their famous spouses/lovers (Einstein, Carnegie, Churchill). How did this become such a rich vein of exploration for you?</p><p><strong>Terrell:</strong> I really do feel like I am on a mission — to excavate from the past the most important, complex and fascinating women of history and bring them into the light of present-day where we can finally hear their moving stories, appreciate the breadth of their contributions and learn from the insights they bring to modern-day issues.</p><p>But your question is how I arrived at this mission. It actually started when I was a girl, a voracious reader with a wonderful aunt — who also happened to be an English professor and a rebellious nun — who was determined to expose me to the larger mysteries of the past and the different perspectives lurking in history.</p><p>While she fed me a steady diet of phenomenal literature, it was Marion Zimmer Bradley’s “The Mists of Avalon” with its ground-breaking, female-centric telling of the famed Arthurian legends — in which the focus was on Arthur’s wife Guinevere and his sister Morgan le Fay — that really opened my eyes to the hidden world of women’s stories.</p><p>I began asking myself how history is really fashioned, and I wondered why these women’s stories were not part of the history I’d been told. I became fascinated with unearthing the unknown stories of women from the past, and after a long stint as a New York City lawyer, I finally began unearthing those women through fiction.</p><p><strong>PG:</strong>&nbsp; This seems like a genre you've carved out for yourself. Are there other writers taking a similar approach?</p><p><strong>Terrell:</strong> Certainly, there are other tremendous historical fiction writers shining the light on key women from the past, which is thrilling. The more stories that are shared, the more we begin bring these women out from the shadows into the light of modern day where we can see their capabilities and contributions. I believe people are thirsting for these stories, and they can serve as yet another means by which we can ensure women’s voices are heard.</p><p><strong>PG:&nbsp;</strong> You're no longer the obscure novelist from Western Pennsylvania. What has been the most satisfying result of your much higher literary profile and appearance on the bestseller lists in recent years?</p><p><strong>Terrell:</strong> I feel such a responsibility to these women about whom I write, and I feel as if I’ve met part of that obligation to have the readership of their narratives grow.</p><p>To have their lives and their contributions known, and even honored, is precisely what they deserve and what our society needs to shift the lens and see women where they’ve been all along — hidden in plain sight. In fact, I’ve just started an Instagram account to pair with this mission — #shift.the.lens.</p><p><em>Tony Norman is the PG’s book review editor: <a href="mailto:tnorman@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">tnorman@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;or 412-263-1631.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/books/2020/01/03/Marie-Benedict-Heather-Terrell-Lady-Clementine-Winston-Churchill/stories/202001040019</original_url>
