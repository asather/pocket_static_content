<p>Also, to recognize the pressures on staff from the COVID-19 pandemic, hourly associate wages will increase $2 an hour through at least May 2 and the associate discount will increase to 35% through April. Current retail store managers also will receive a $1,000 bonus.</p>
<p>The company has instituted a senior shopping hour from 9 to 10 a.m. for those 60 and older who may be more susceptible to the effects of the virus.</p>
