<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority has received a $141.7 million grant Tuesday as part of stimulus funding during the coronavirus pandemic, the Federal Transit Administration announced in a release.</p>
<p>The funds are part of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act — better known as the CARES Act — which went into effect March 27, providing $25 billion for public transit operations to respond to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Port Authority will use the funds to continue transit service as the pandemic persists and were expecting such a figure when CARES Act funding eligibility was released April 3.</p>

<p>The agency&nbsp;was projecting revenue losses and added expenses from the COVID-19 emergency in April to reach $30 million by June 30.</p>
<p>FTA acting Administrator K. Jane Williams emphasized the funding will aid in essential travel services and supporting transit workers unable to work due to public health concerns.</p>
<p>“We know many of our nation’s public transportation systems are facing extraordinary challenges and these funds will go a long way to assisting our transit industry partners in battling COVID-19,” Ms. Williams said in a statement.</p>
<p>In addition, the FTA issued a safety advisory for public transit agencies to develop and implement policies to carry out preventative measures consistent with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance such as sanitizing high-touch areas and providing personal protective equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>CARES Act funding can be used to cover 100% of such costs.</p>
