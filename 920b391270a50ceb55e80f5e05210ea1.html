<h1>McConnell vows quick vote on Trump pick to fill Ginsburg seat </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said he would schedule a vote to confirm President Donald Trump’s nominee to succeed Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg after her death Friday.</p>
<p>Americans gave Republicans a Senate majority “because we pledged to work with President Trump and support his agenda, particularly his outstanding appointments to the federal judiciary,” Mr. McConnell said in a statement shortly after Justice Ginsburg’s death was announced Friday evening. “Once again, we will keep our promise. President Trump’s nominee will receive a vote on the floor of the United States Senate.”</p>
<p>With 53 Republicans, Mr. McConnell can afford to lose three senators and still confirm a pick with Vice President Mike Pence casting a tie-breaking vote.</p>
<p>On Friday night, Democrats quickly demanded that any move to replace Justice Ginsburg be left for the next president.</p>
<p>“The American people should have a voice in the selection of their next Supreme Court Justice. Therefore, this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president,” Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a tweet.</p>
<p>Days before she died, NPR reported, Justice Ginsburg dictated a statement to her granddaughter saying, “My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.”</p>
