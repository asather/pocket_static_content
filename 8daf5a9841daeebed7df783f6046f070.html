<h1>It's still the time of year for Oktoberfest beer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oktoberfest beers started hitting shelves and coolers back in August, and Oktoberfest celebrations traditionally are held in September, yet here it is October and there still are plenty of them to enjoy, including some fresh new ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available this week on draft and in cans, is Octa, the annual seasonal release from Dancing Gnome Beer in Sharpsburg. Because the brewery is nationally renowned for its hazy, hoppy pale ales, people may be surprised to hear how much owner/brewer Andrew Witchey loves the malty German classics.</p>
<p>“Marzen is probably my most favorite style across the beer spectrum,” he says.</p>
<p>His newsletter last week was a primer on the lager “biers” traditionally associated with the massive Munich Oktoberfest, which was not held this year because of COVID-19. Its cancellation has been rare — only done for wars or the occasional cholera outbreak — since the first festival in 1810 in honor of King Ludwig I’s marriage to Princess Therese of Saxony-Hildburghausen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The big beer served at that gathering for the first century-plus was Marzen -— full-bodied with specialty malts that “bring&nbsp;forth a warm caramel, and dark stone fruit sweetness, balanced out by the herbal German hops,” Mr. Witchey writes. He goes on to explain that in more recent times, Oktoberfest’s prime pour evolved into a Festbier, a lager that is “much lighter and less malt forward than a Marzen, which comes in handy when you're slugging down full liter pours.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year, Dancing Gnome also brewed a new Festbier, which was released last week (a four-pack of 16-ounce cans is $10).</p>
<p>Like the Octa, it’s meant to be very German, but this one has two nontraditional twists: It’s made with Bloody Butcher corn as well as Munich malts that were grown and malted in North Carolina.&nbsp;The specialty corn “provides a very unique and pleasant spice component to the beer, especially when paired with the floral and spice forward German Tettnang hops.” Dry and light at 4.5%, the fall-flavored beer will have you drinking pint after pint, whereas the Octa is a bit heavier.</p>
<p>Both should be available to quaff outside in the brewery’s garden during its fourth-anniversary party on Saturday morning and regular hours that afternoon (reservations required for both).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for Oktoberfest beers, “I do think that customers appreciate them and look forward to them mostly for the anticipation of the time of year,” says Mr. Witchey, who loves fall beers in general. He acknowledges Dancing Gnome’s O-fests are coming out later than most, but&nbsp;are “true to the celebration” in Bavaria, which goes until October’s first Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a normal year, Hofbrauhaus Pittsburgh on the South Side would import a batch of Munich-made Oktoberfest for its two weekends of Oktoberfest celebrations in September. This year, head brewer Shawn Setzenfand says, they decided to go with their own house-brewed Festbier for September and October.&nbsp;“We didn’t think anyone would mind having it for two months instead of one.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Indeed, before September’s end, and even with greatly scaled back Oktoberfest celebrations, customers toasted through half of the 68 barrels they brewed. There should be plenty left to “Prost” this month at the brewery or at home with takeaway growlers and crowlers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The two brews are similar, but the Oktoberfest is golden and a bit stronger at 6.3% alcohol-by-volume than the amber, 5.8% alcohol Festbier, which Mr. Setzenfand describes as&nbsp;“more of an American-style Oktoberfest.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>A wide range of Oktoberfest styles and flavors are being offered by restaurants, breweries and beer distributors such as Creekside Beer in Sewickley. Owner Michael Porreca says customers have been buying up those beers at a pace that’s 75% to 200% more than last fall. It is in great part due to the pandemic,&nbsp;but also because of “growth of our local #DrinkPGH section, which brings customers in from all over the area.”</p>
<p>Hot-selling local Oktoberfests include the cans from Penn Brewery, which did not hold its big celebrations this September on the North Side, where some fans drink it out of plastic jugs.</p>
<p>The show is going on, albeit toned down, at Lawrenceville’s Church Brew Works, which is serving O-fest beers and foods through Sunday. Owner Sean Casey says that&nbsp;“it was the spirit of doing the fest that counted.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>From noon to 4 p.m. Saturday at its Community Park, the Butler County town of Slippery Rock is holding an Oktoberfest featuring pours from North Country Brewing as well as Big Rail Brewing and Missing Links Brewery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another of the local breweries Creekside carries is Braddock’s Brew Gentlemen. It released its Oktoberfest just last week, having skipped a season last year as it expanded its brewhouse. Crowlers (750-milliter cans) can be ordered online from the brewery for $8. The gentlemen say their&nbsp;“interpretation keeps it traditional: an amber-colored lager with an initial toasted malt sweetness followed by a clean, balanced Noble hop finish.”</p>
<p>You can find versions from breweries big (Sam Adams, Yuengling, Straub, Sierra Nevada, Bell’s, Great Lakes) and small (McKees Rocks’ Abjuration and Charleroi’s Four Points, though good luck finding any of that Marzen left anywhere), and domestic as well as German (Bitburger, Paulaner and more), for those who want to keep it old school.</p>
<p>At Corapolis’ Cobblehaus Brewing, the motto is “Olde World Styles, New World Twists.” But until he got the necessary equipment this year, owner/brewer Scott Mills hadn’t made any lagers. He’s made three, including a Festbier, and last week he debuted the brewery’s first Oktoberfest, named Oktoberhaus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Available on tap there and to go by growler&nbsp;($16) and crowler ($11), it is&nbsp;“very traditional and on the higher end of the ABV scale at 5.9%,” he says. “It has a sweet maltiness and is amber in color, medium bodied with toasted bread/biscuit aroma and flavor.”</p>
<p>Speaking of which, Oktoberfests are perfect for pairing with so many hearty foods of the season that cooler weather makes us crave.</p>
<p>Bellevue’s Lincoln Avenue Brewery has an Oktoberfest that is to be released next week, when it’s done lagering (cold aging).</p>
<p>“We are planning to do a big bratwurst feast with locally made brats from Tom Friday’s Market the weekend the Oktoberfest drops. I’ll keep you posted,” owner Grant Saylor says.</p>
