<h1>Gene Therapy: Port Vue journo wins again with HBO doc</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not a lot of people growing up in Port Vue figure they can save the world, but Marie McGovern had it somewhere on her to-do list as she flourished at Serra Catholic, cultivating a love for newspapers and a curiosity about the audacity of journalism.</p>
<p>“Wanted to be a journalist,” she said as the reason she fled for Syracuse, always a top producer when it comes to that species. “Wanted to save the world, from tyranny, from crime, and all of that other stuff.”</p>
<p>Still a bit of a work in progress is all that, maybe you’ve noticed, but Ms. McGovern was doing it about as well as it can be done from the city desk at the New York Daily News when some 21st century realities started to get annoyingly loud. About 200 newspapers have dropped dead since 2004.</p>
<p>“We used to circulate well over a million papers daily,” she said. “And it was falling off a cliff. I mourn the loss every single day. I just think, ‘Who’s going to keep an eye on everybody? Who’s going to call people out?’ Having it on the web is nice, but having it scream from a headline in the newspaper is really something else.”</p>
<p>With just about everyone in the industry looking for a landing spot, Ms. McGovern and Daily News editor-in-chief Martin Dunn started StreetSmart Video, a flashpoint of timing and talent with what feels like an ever-gathering momentum. Marie’s gritty New York-noir series, “3AM,” had a successful run on Showtime a few years ago. She was executive producer on “Seaver,” the poignant portrayal of the late New York Mets icon, and her latest project, co-produced and co-directed with Mr. Dunn, debuts on HBO next week.</p>
<p>“Wildcard, the Downfall of a Radio Loud Mouth,” excavates to the bedrock the complete riches-to-prison rags story of Craig Carton, who for 10 years captained the wildly successful “Boomer and Carton” morning show on New York’s WFAN. By 2017, Carton was making $2 million a year while attracting blistering drive-time ratings. It’s not a terribly unique trick to draw big radio numbers for being, as one of the show’s testifiers put it, “happy to portray himself as a [jerk],” but Carton was a quiet, generous, introspective personality away from the mic, as deft at keeping difficult, toxic secrets as he was at roasting a caller to the show.</p>
<p>It was only after he’d served time at the U.S. Penitentiary in Lewisburg, Pa., that Ms. McGovern and Mr. Dunn unwrapped the idea for this project, but they’d long known the market for celebrity-mocking in New York was perpetually muscular, extending well beyond the media. When Carton was sentenced, Judge Colleen McMahon mocked him from the bench: “Hi, Colleen from New York, first time, long time,” then gave him three-and-a-half years.</p>
<p>“We met Craig back in 2015 and we had a development idea with regard to a sports chat show,” Ms. McGovern remembered. “We thought he would be a great face for the show. We filmed this pilot, it doesn’t go anywhere. But our paths would cross on occasion. When he got arrested in 2017, we reached out to him because we know what a nightmare it can be in New York especially if you’re someone with any kind of name. We just said, ‘Not sure of any of the details but we’re still your friend and we’re here for you.’ All he texted back was a quick, ‘Thanks.’ ”</p>
<p>Carton would later find out about “Seaver,” and contacted Ms. McGovern and Mr. Dunn: “The Seavers are notoriously private; if they trusted you with their story, I’d like to tell you mine.” Which he did. For four hours. They were stunned.</p>
<p>Carton frequently talked about sports-betting on the show with Boomer, the former NFL quarterback Boomer Esiason, but usually left out the fact that he really liked to gamble, and one other critical fact — he was preternaturally good at it. Then, on one show, Carton told Boomer that he could take his $10,000 bet and turn it into $25,000 at the blackjack table in Atlantic City, which he did. That’s when callers to the show and some extraneous high rollers started sending Carton money to gamble with.</p>
<p>Things got nuts. He won $325,000 in nine minutes one night, lost $2 million in 24 hours another time. He got involved in a scheme to sell event tickets on the secondary market that collided with his gambling and triggered his tailspin. He borrowed $2 million from a hedge fund and gambled it away.</p>
<p>He was charged and convicted of wire fraud, securities fraud and conspiracy and, in 2018, was sentenced to 3 1/​2 years in jail and ordered to pay more than $4 million in restitution. He was released from prison in June.</p>
<p>At his sentencing, Carton blurted out that he’d been sexually abused by a summer camp counselor in 1980, the first time he ever said that to anyone. That abuse, Carton explains in “Wild Card,” kept him from ever becoming a fully formed person, a narrative he laid out for Simon &amp; Schuster in the 2013 book “Loudmouth.”</p>
<p>The publishers confirmed for Ms. McGovern and Mr. Dunn that they withheld that chapter. Carton said he was told it didn’t fit with the theme of the book, the comic, loudmouth genius of Craig Carton. When that chapter got axed, Carton went back into his psychic hole.</p>
<p>But the abuse is foundational in the HBO documentary, and linking it to Carton’s downfall had to have been a delicate dramatic application, one few filmmakers can execute.</p>
<p>“I think it would be irresponsible to say that there is a direct link,” Ms. McGovern said. “But every counselor, every therapist we have talked to with regard to addiction, some specifically regarding gambling addiction, have said that addictions don’t arise out of nowhere. Usually there is some kind of trauma buried deep within a person, but usually an addiction, especially where gambling is concerned, is triggered by a trauma where a person seeks relief, comfort, escape, solace, whatever you want to call it, to rid the mind from thinking about past traumas.”</p>
<p>Carton on the radio was an act. I’m an jerk, you’re a dope, the Mets suck, day after day, year after year, but sometimes it got real. Watch the clip where Carton talks about Jerry Sandusky and Joe Paterno. That’s no act.</p>
<p>Carton’s a free man now. Debts have been paid. Demons have been faced. Any day not hunched over a blackjack table is a good one. “Wild Card,” from Marie McGovern and Martin Dunn, is a story with wallop.</p>
<p>It might not change the world at the rate you’d like, but that’s what journalists do.</p>
