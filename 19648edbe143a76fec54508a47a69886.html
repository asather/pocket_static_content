<h1>Girls 2A semifinals: Bishop Canevin eliminates Ellis, Laurel surges past Serra</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>From 2016-18, Bishop Canevin appeared to be putting together a girls basketball dynasty after winning three consecutive WPIAL championships.</p>
<p>The Crusaders had their quest for a fourth consecutive WPIAL crown cut short a year ago in the semifinals, but after a one-year hiatus, Bishop Canevin is going back to Petersen Events Center. The Crusaders (18-6) punched their ticket to the title game with a 46-44 win against Ellis School (18-7) Monday night in a WPIAL Class 2A semifinal matchup at West Allegheny.</p>
<p>“Canevin has such a tradition of being there every year that I think it’s kind of expected for us,” first-year coach Jim Kaczorowski said. “But for us, it’s really exciting for us, because they lost a lot from last year.”</p>
<p>Senior guard Alyssa Pollice led Bishop Canevin with 15 points , while senior point guard Diajha Allen finished with 11 and junior guard Savanah Abbott added 10.</p>
<p>“I’m so excited, I can’t even put it in words,” Pollice said. “I couldn’t wait for the clock to hit 0:00 and say, ‘We’re going to the Pete.’”</p>
<p>Junior guard Natalie Jasper led all scorers with 23 points for the Tigers, and senior guard Natalie Graf contributed 17.</p>
<p>“We had to give up something,” Kaczorowski said. “We knew [Graf] was a good shooter. We also know that Jasper likes to get to the hoop. So we tried to pack it in a little and make it a little more difficult for her to score inside.</p>
<p>“She’s going to score. She’s a heck of a player.”</p>
<p>Pollice scored 12 of her 15 points in the first half to help spark the Crusaders to a 24-15 halftime lead. Bishop Canevin stretched its lead to double digits and led, 36-23, going into the final quarter, but Ellis wouldn’t go away quietly.</p>
<p>The Tigers started the fourth quarter on a 10-0 run as Jasper and Graf attempted to will their team back into the game. Jasper consistently drove into the lane for tough baskets, and whenever the Crusaders closed in on her, she kicked it out to Graf for a 3-pointer.</p>
<p>With momentum slipping away for Bishop Canevin, Abbott made four clutch free throws along with a driving layup to extend the Crusaders’ lead late in the fourth. Ellis kept clawing back until the final buzzer sounded, but Graf’s final 3-pointer was too little, too late, and Bishop Canevin held on for the win.</p>
<p>“I feel like we worked hard for it,” Allen said. “I don’t know what to say right now. I’m just really excited.”</p>
<p><strong>Other semifinal</strong></p>
<p>Laurel had shirts made for this season with the phrase “Why not?” printed across the back, a reference to their goal of playing for a WPIAL championship despite the perceived odds being stacked against them.</p>
<p>Laurel answered its own question by playing its way into the first WPIAL championship appearance in school history.</p>
<p>The Spartans (17-7) have embraced their underdog role all the way to the title game after knocking off Serra Catholic, 48-32, in a semifinal played at Peters Township. Regan Atkins poured in a game-high 21 points and Faith Gibson chipped in nine to lead the charge for the Spartans.</p>
<p>“We were definitely the underdogs in that game,” Atkins said. “No one was expecting us to go to the championship.”</p>
<p>It was a suffocating defensive effort that sealed the victory. Laurel held the Eagles (17-4) to 12 points in the first half. The Spartans locked down Rayna Andrews, one of the leading scorers in the WPIAL at 17.3 points per game, and held her to just four points in the game.</p>
<p>“We showed a lot of poise,” Laurel coach Matthew Stebbins said. “We controlled the tempo. To hold them to 32 points is impressive.”</p>
<p>The Spartans were in control the entire game and never trailed. Serra Catholic made things interesting in the fourth, though. Nicole Pawlowski sank a 3-pointer to cut the gap to seven points (39-32) before the Spartans answered with a 9-0 run to end the game.</p>
