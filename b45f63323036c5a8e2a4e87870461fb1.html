<h1>Pitt announces its 2020 Hall of Fame class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Men's basketball star Brandin Knight, prolific women's scorer Jennifer Bruce and Pro Football Hall of Fame running back Curtis Martin highlight the 2020 Pitt Athletics Hall of Fame class, a 13-member group that was announced Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Knight, a point guard from 1999-2003, led Pitt to consecutive Big East regular-season titles, two Sweet 16 appearances and the program's first Big East tournament title. The two-time All-American still holds Pitt records for career assists (785), career steals (298), season minutes played (1,284 in 2001-02) and more. Knight, who also served on Pitt's coaching staff from 2006-16, had his No. 20 jersey retired in 2009.</p>
<p>Bruce, like Knight, is considered one of the most decorated players in Pitt basketball history. She is the second all-time leading scorer in Panthers history — men's or women's — with 2,295 points, behind Lorri Johnson, who was inducted in last year's class. A three-time All-Big East honoree, Bruce still ranks in the top 10 in blocks, rebounds and steals in Pitt history.</p>
<p>And Martin, an Allderdice graduate, rushed for 2,643 yards at Pitt despite missing most of his final year due to injury. He was a third-round draft choice in 1995 and went on to a Pro Football Hall of Fame career, rushing for 14,101 yards total with the New England Patriots and New York Jets.</p>
<p>The rest of the class is listed below in alphabetical order:</p>
