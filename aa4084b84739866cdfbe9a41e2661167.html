<h1>Girlfriend testifies Shelton didn't return until 3 a.m. the night of the Wilkinsburg shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cheron Shelton dropped his girlfriend, Channel Falls, and their two sons off at home about 8 p.m. on March 9, 2016.</p>
<p>Ms. Falls testified Thursday that she expected him right back.</p>
<p>“He was supposed to go get us some hamburger buns,” she said.</p>
<p>Instead, Ms. Falls continued, he didn’t return.</p>
<p>At 10:41 p.m., she sent him a message on his cellphone.</p>
<p>It read: “SMH [shaking my head.] I already see where this is going. Just gonna keep calm and watch you lose everything before your very eyes.”</p>
<p>Thirteen minutes later, police said, five people and an unborn child were gunned down in the backyard at 1304 Franklin Ave. in Wilkinsburg. Investigators said Shelton targeted a man at the barbecue that night, Lamont Powell, who he believed had killed his best friend three years earlier. Powell was injured in the shooting and testified against Shelton on Tuesday, the second day of his capital trial.</p>
<p>A co-defendant in the case, Robert Thomas, had the charges against him dismissed on Monday by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski just an hour before the trial against both Shelton and Thomas was scheduled to begin. The judge ruled that the prosecution did not have enough evidence against Thomas to sustain its case.</p>
<p>Police have said Shelton fired 30 shots from an assault-style rifle that night, while Thomas fired 18 shots from a handgun.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky called Ms. Falls to the stand.</p>
<p>She told the jury that her family went to see Shelton’s mother during the day on March 9, 2016, and then went home.</p>
<p>Shelton didn’t return, she said, until after 3 a.m. And when he did, Ms. Falls continued, he was wearing different clothing.</p>
<p>“He threw up on himself,” she testified.</p>
<p>Ms. Falls said she was mad at Shelton when he finally returned and met him outside. She then drove him back to his mother’s house.</p>
<p>On direct examination, Mr. Chernosky asked Ms. Falls what she meant by her text message to Shelton, who she had listed as “Babycakes,” in her phone’s contact information.</p>
<p>She answered, “It basically means he wasn’t taking our relationship seriously.”</p>
<p>The prosecution spent much of Thursday morning’s court session going over cellphone records that they say belong to Shelton, Thomas and Ms. Falls.</p>
<p>According to testimony, the numbers prosecutors say belonged to Shelton and Thomas called each other the night of the shooting 33 times between 8:04 p.m. and 12:15 a.m.</p>
<p>There were no calls between 10:46 p.m. and 10:56 p.m., former Allegheny County homicide Detective Scott Towne said .</p>
<p>Other witnesses Thursday included Shelton’s mother, Desdrene Smith, who told the jury that her son had access to her four-door Lincoln, and did not need permission from her to use it.</p>
<p>A Wilkinsburg detective testified earlier in the week that in the minutes after the shooting, he saw Shelton get into a white Lincoln whose license plate traced back to Ms. Smith.</p>
<p>Before testimony began Thursday the judge presiding over the trial held a man in contempt who he said attempted to intimidate a juror on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In addition, Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski removed the woman who had been serving as Juror No. 16.</p>
<p>Lonnie Jenkins, 37, will serve six months in jail, after Judge Borkowski ruled that he purposely attempted to influence the juror as surveillance videos were played Wednesday in the trial.</p>
<p>"Mr. Jenkins positioned himself, despite much open seating, in close proximity to the juror and made remarks," the judge said. "She perceived him directing the comments toward her."</p>
<p>At one point, the judge continued, Jenkins said of the video, "'Ain't this some [expletive.]'"</p>
<p>"She indicated she was very uncomfortable because he was staring at her," the judge said.</p>
<p>The juror, who was interviewed by the court and sheriff's deputies, said she thought to herself, "'Oh my God, he keeps looking at me. I wished he would move. There were five empty seats. He chose to sit there.'"</p>
<p>Defense attorney David O'Bara, who was appointed to represent Jenkins at the contempt hearing, asked the judge to allow the man to be released from jail and be precluded from attending the trial.</p>
<p>"I apologize to the court if anybody felt any type of way," Jenkins said. "I grew up with these people. I sat there and listened. I have a job. I'm just trying to get back to work."</p>
<p>However, Judge Borkowski ruled that Jenkins willfully disrupted the proceedings Wednesday and required an expenditure of resources by his staff, as well as sheriff's investigators.</p>
<p>The judge said the 6-month sentence was in part because of the way Jenkins' actions made the juror feel.</p>
<p>"Her right to serve as a juror has been compromised," the judge said.</p>
