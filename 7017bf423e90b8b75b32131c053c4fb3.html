<h1>Addi Twigg brings Janis Joplin vibe to Pittsburgh band Cisco Kid</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Tangled in Sin,” the new release from Cisco Kid, will put a smile on the face of anyone who’s been to a Ramble at the Rex.</p>
<p>Those events, hosted by WDVE’s Randy Baumann at the now-shuttered South Side venue, brought together talented young musicians who share a love for the classic rock of the late ’60s/early ’70s, particularly the psychedelic country soul of The Grateful Dead, The Allman Brothers, The Band, Neil Young and Little Feat.</p>
<p>It was at a Ramble that members of Pittsburgh band Cisco Kid, which takes its name from the WAR song, encountered soul belter Addi Twigg. They invited her band, The Telephone Line, to open their release party for “Beautiful Day to Die” at Mr. Smalls in 2017. A few months later, she sang backup when they opened for The Commonheart on New Year’s Eve.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2018, Cisco Kid singer Nick Guckert told the band he was leaving to focus full-time on his other group, The Living Street.</p>
<p>“That kind of brought us to a crossroads where we had to figure out what to do,” says drummer Marc Martinka. “I told the guys, ‘Hey, I'm thinking about asking Addi. We've worked with her and she's just a next level singer.’ I said, ‘If she turns us down, what's the worst that could happen? That's that.’ ”</p>

<p>“Marc came to me and said, ‘I know this is a long shot, and I know you're already pretty busy, but you're our first choice: We would love to have you sing with us,’” Twigg says.</p>
<p>She had a few things to think about, the first being her own band.</p>
<p>“I had to have a heart-to-heart with The Telephone Line to assure them that it wasn't gonna change our dynamic and that The Telephone Line is still like my baby. And, of course, all those guys are so cool about everything, they were like, ‘Yeah, no, we totally understand.’ ”</p>
<p>The second thing was an image issue she wanted to address with Martinka.</p>
<p>“I’ve never considered myself like a cool kid,” she says, “so I was like, ‘I don't know, am I taking away some of your coolness factor?’</p>
<p>“Nick Guckert,” she explains, “is a beautiful singer, and he definitely has a certain vibe. And I loved their sound so much when he was singing with them. I was definitely worried that I would change the dynamic, shift it in a way that wouldn't fit the band.”</p>
<p>Assured that they were perfectly happy with her level of coolness, she made her debut with Cisco Kid at the Deutschtown Music Festival in July 2018. The next step for the band was writing material for a singer who follows in the footsteps of Janis Joplin and Aretha Franklin.</p>
<p>“Our last record was a little more jammy,” Martinka says. “We got a lot of comparisons to The Grateful Dead in that there are long, long passages of instrumental stuff, but the vibe of it was still kind of set in that sort of ‘60s/’70s psychedelic kind of stuff. So it’s not a jump in genres and styles.”</p>
<p>“Tangled in Sin” is best compared to Janis with Big Brother and the Holding Company, circa 1967 —&nbsp;a pretty remarkable sound to re-capture in 2020.</p>
<p>To help, Cisco Kid —&nbsp;which also features guitarist Brian Swed, guitarist/keyboardist Rich Stanley and bassist Martin Connolly —&nbsp;expanded beyond the core group to include Baumann and James Hart (The Harlan Twins, Andre Costello and the Cool Minors) on keyboards, Read Connolly (The Beagle Brothers) on pedal steel and backing vocals by Markila “Kiki” Sherman (The Buckle Downs) and Rosanna Spindler (Buffalo Rose). It was mastered by Nate Campisi at Mr. Small’s Studio.</p>
<p>“We wanted this EP to be a ‘Cisco Kid and friends’ kind of thing,” Martinka says. “We were thinking about Joe Cocker’s ‘Mad Dogs &amp; Englishmen’ and how there were all these kind of collaborative bands back then. Pittsburgh has so many top-notch musicians in such a small city that also happen to be into the same kind of music.”</p>
<p>As a teenager, Martinka was into alt-rock, grunge and hip-hop but says as he got a little older, he gravitated back to the classic rock he found in his parents’ collection.</p>
<p>“And that happened to intersect with the time that I was learning to play my instrument and I just fell in love with the production and the writing and the sound. It was a very creative time for music and there's a lot to draw from that. There's a lot of room to put a new twist on those foundations.”</p>
<p>Fitting some of the Southern gospel soul influences of that era, the songs written by Martinka and Stanley, like “Devil’s Den” and “Evil in You and In Me,” touch on sin, redemption and other themes that Twigg was well versed in.</p>
<p>“I grew up in the church,” she says. “It’s where I learned to sing and harmonize. I miss singing hymns, but that’s about the only thing I miss. That upbringing definitely influenced my performance on these songs, but more emotionally than vocally, especially on ‘Evil in You and In Me.’</p>
<p>“There’s this mixture of desperation, disgust and disappointment that resonates with me because I felt all those things in waves after leaving the church 20 years ago. Performing songs like this bubbles up some of those emotions again, but these days I’m left with a sense of clarity and gratitude instead.”</p>
<p>Cisco Kid intended to release the EP with a show back in April but such things have been stalled by the pandemic and will continue that way for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>“We're not practicing because I'm high risk,” Twigg says. “My husband and I, who is also in The Telephone Line, we’re being pretty strict about things, so neither band is practicing, and I think a lot of people are in that same boat, high risk or not.”</p>
<p>In lieu of playing drive-in shows or anything of the sort, Cisco Kid has been teasing “Tangled in Sin” effectively online, with song clips, profiles of the guests on the record and a video of her and Swed doing a socially distanced cover of Amy Winehouse’s “You Know I'm No Good.”</p>
<p>Martinka plans to make “Tangled in Sin” part of a series of differently themed EPs.</p>
<p>“I’m set up to record from home,” Twigg says, “so we’re going to keep things going during the shutdown.”</p>
<p><em>“Tangled in Sin” will be released on all major streaming and download platforms (Spotify, Bandcamp, Apple Music, and Amazon Music) on Friday.</em></p>
