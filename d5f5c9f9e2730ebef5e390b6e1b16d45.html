<h1>Anglers asked to stay off smallmouth bass nests in Lake Erie tributaries</h1>

<p>ERIE, Pa. -- Steve doesn’t want his neighbors to know he spoke to an outsider about his fishing secret. It’s a lifelong passion that the Erie resident hides, and he didn’t want his last name to be used in this report.</p>
<p>Every year when the time is right, Steve loves catching stream-spawning smallmouth bass.</p>
<p>“Everybody up here knows about the runs but we don’t talk about it,” he said. “People come to Erie from all over to catch smallmouths in the lake, and [the state Fish and Boat Commission] sets the season based on the spawn in the near shore. But the fishing is even better when they’re running in the creeks.”</p>
<p>Smallmouth bass spawn when the water temperature reaches 60 degrees. On Tuesday, near-shore water temperatures off Erie County remained in the high 40s to mid-50s. Generally, the streams warm earlier and a small percentage of smallmouths take advantage of the opportunity to give their progeny a head start. This year, a major tributary reached 60 degrees on May 6, and the smallmouth run was on.</p>
<p>Stream temperatures rise quickly in the spring, and soon exceed the smallmouths’ comfort level. The spawn generally lasts just a few weeks.</p>
<p>“I caught about 50 before lunch,” said Steve. “I came back later in the day and caught more. I release them, so no harm done, but that’s why we keep it quiet.”</p>
<p>Steve baits his spinning outfit with live bait under a bobber, but he has friends who fish for stream-spawning smallmouths using spinners or flies.</p>
<p>Unlike steelhead trout, which were introduced to the Great Lakes and stocked to provide a fishery, smallmouth bass are native to those waters and the Ohio River watershed. It is likely that a subset has been spawning in tributaries since the last Ice Age. The fish look the same as their lake-spawning cousins, but if the genetic separation has been maintained long enough there could be subtle morphological differences.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no genealogical study has explored the issue. No nighttime electrofishing surveys have documented spring smallmouth density in the tributaries. No angling culture has developed around the explosive Erie County runs that extend no farther upstream than Route 5.</p>
<p>“It just started,” said Britany Hueble, owner of Poor Richard’s Bait and Tackle Shop in Fairview. “When the water gets too warm for steelhead, the smallmouths come in. They stay near the mouths in water that’s 4 or 5 feet deep. It’s sort of a local secret. Quite a bit more people go out in [Presque Isle] Bay for them.”</p>
<p>Like largemouth and spotted bass, smallmouths are not true bass linked to the striped bass family. Collectively called black bass, they are more closely related to sunfish, crappies, rock bass and other panfish.</p>
<p>The smallmouth spawn is triggered by increased hours of sunlight and water temperature. Males arrive first to spawning waters, clearing a circular depression of sand, gravel or rocks by fanning with fins and blowing water over small debris. The redds are generally 15-30 inches across.</p>
<p>“The mating smallmouth pair swim above the nest, rubbing against each other and then rest on the bottom of the nest,” states an overview provided by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. “While resting on the bottom, spawning occurs and lasts for 5 seconds. The spawning pair will then encircle the nest from between 25-45 seconds before preparing to spawn again. This paired spawning ritual can continue for up to two hours.”</p>
<p>Afterward, females may leave the nest and spawn with another male. Typically, several females will spawn in the same redd at different times, each depositing 2,000-7,000 eggs per pound of body weight. In streams the eggs are constantly washed by the current, but during heavy flows they may be washed away. Depending on water temperature, eggs hatch two to nine days after being laid, and mass hatchings may be separated by several days. Males aggressively guard the eggs and fry. The young fish leave the redd after five or six days and move into the lake.</p>
<p>Bass eggs and fry are eaten by just about everything in the water, but the bottom-dwelling round goby has become a major predator of bass eggs since arriving in Lake Erie in the 1990s. Anglers may unwittingly help the goby. In a study of smallmouth nest predation in Lake Erie conducted by Ohio State University in 1999-2001, researchers found that when anglers temporarily pulled males off the redds in catch-and-release conditions, the goby could clean out the redd.</p>
<p>“We quantified how many smallmouth bass offspring were consumed by round goby when nest-guarding smallmouth bass males were present, removed and recovering from angling-related stress,” stated the study. “For an average smallmouth bass nest … round goby could consume all offspring from an unguarded nest in about 15 minutes.”</p>
<p>To protect the spawn, bass fishing in Pennsylvania lakes including Lake Erie, Presque Isle Bay and tributaries is strictly catch-and-immediate-release April 18 through June 12. It is a violation to intentionally target bass on a nest.</p>
<p>“You can look down and see bass on the redds in the creeks,” said Steve. “We catch them going to and from the redds, but we leave the redds alone. Everybody doesn’t do that. Maybe they don’t know any better. That’s why we don’t talk about it. We hope people understand, follow the regulations and preserve the resource.”</p>
