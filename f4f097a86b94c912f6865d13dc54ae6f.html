<h1>As COVID-19 postponed series, Pirates dealt with anxiety of playing again too quickly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last weekend — for the second time in a week — the Pirates were sitting and waiting to hear exactly when they’d play.</p>
<p>Their series with Cincinnati was eventually canceled after someone with the Reds tested positive for COVID-19, and it will be made up later in the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For pretty much all of Saturday, though, all anybody knew for sure was that the last two games of the series were postponed. For a time, it seemed they might make it up in a doubleheader on Monday, since both teams had that day off. The other option was to call it off altogether and make it up on a future date.</p>
<p>As that decision was being mulled over, all the Pirates players could do was hold tight in their hotel until the choice was made.</p>
<p>“Saturday, basically all I did was sit in my room and play Fortnite with [pitchers Chad Kuhl, Chris Stratton and Jameson Taillon],” catcher Jacob Stallings said. “We weren't really allowed to do much else. We could go out on a walk and maybe you go and walk and order food to go, but we couldn't go stand in lines or anything. And then Sunday was more stressful and more up in the air because there were just kind of mixed feelings about playing on Monday with the incubation period. And some guys were definitely uncomfortable with that, and ultimately MLB decided for us not to play.”</p>
<p>That last point is an important one to Stallings — and, apparently, multiple other players. For one, manager Derek Shelton said that, as far as he knows, Major League Baseball and the players’ association take feelings into account with these decisions; the players are human, too.</p>
<p>With these cancellations, much of the focus turns to how a baseball team can possibly keep operating with intermittent stops and starts followed by long breaks. That could, in theory, mess with players’ routines, and Stallings acknowledges that’s true. The same will be true during the rest of the season, when the Pirates will play a whole lot of games in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Stallings, though, says he isn’t personally concerned with that as much as he is the potential proliferation of infections around baseball or the Pirates’ clubhouse.</p>
<p>“I would say for me, the more challenging part is just the big picture part of it,” Stallings said. “Obviously, MLB and the teams and the players want to get the season in, but with the outbreaks, it’s just concerning, not only from a baseball, playing games standpoint, but just from health and safety. We don’t know much about the virus in the grand scheme of things, and I was right next to a lot of their players for a couple days, so there was anxiety for me, just, ‘What if? What if? What if?’ Thankfully, all of us are testing negative. ...</p>
<p>“It’s frustrating having games canceled, for sure, but I think my focus or my worry was more so on the health of our players and myself.”</p>
<p>That’s especially the case since the timing of the discovery of a positive test came late on Friday night, after the Reds and Pirates had finished playing a full game.</p>
<p>Understandably, that is what drove much of the Pirates’ concerns. It was lessened by the subsequent negative tests which have allowed the Pirates to return to play against the Cleveland Indians this week, but it was still there.</p>
<p>“I think we made the right decision in terms of Monday and not playing,” Shelton said. “If our players didn’t have anxiety about what’s going on, it would concern me. Because we’re dealing with a global pandemic and we’re dealing with adjustments and how things go, then you hear about a player who tests positive and you have concerns about your family and your wife. This makes it bigger than everything.”</p>
<p><strong>Pirates suffer another bullpen injury</strong></p>
<p>As if the Pirates hadn’t suffered enough injuries to their bullpen, they sent another pitcher to the injured list before Tuesday’s game against the Indians.</p>
<p>Right-hander Yacksel Rios, who was called up to the Pirates from their alternate training squad in Altoona after right-hander Michael Feliz was sent to the 45-day injured list, has also been sent to the IL. Rios’ stint is only 10 days, retroactive to Saturday, and is for right shoulder inflammation.</p>
<p>In his place, the Pirates will recall right-hander Nick Mears. Mears was first brought to Pittsburgh on Aug. 8 to help the hampered bullpen. He threw one inning against the Detroit Tigers on Aug. 9, and he was promptly optioned back to Altoona.</p>
<p>This marks the ninth pitcher on the Pirates’ 40-man roster who is currently on the injured list.</p>
