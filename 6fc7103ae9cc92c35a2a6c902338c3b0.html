<h1>Pirates takeaways: Chad Kuhl’s performance key for starting rotation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates were down two starting pitchers at the beginning of this shortened season with Jameson Taillon and Chris Archer out with injuries. Mitch Keller and Joe Musgrove have also been hurt.</p>
<p>But while the Pirates have gotten plenty of practice when it comes to subtracting starting pitchers from their rotation, the solid work of Chad Kuhl has given them an important add for 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>Although Bryan Reynolds was the most noticeable story from the Pirates’ 7-2 victory over the Brewers on Friday at PNC Park, do not overlook what Kuhl did in giving Pittsburgh five innings of one-run ball, again looking like a key part of the starting rotation for the rest of this year and beyond.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say at this point that Kuhl is fully recovered from the Tommy John surgery that cost him all of the 2019 season. In 19 innings, Kuhl has 19 strikeouts and a 2.84 ERA.</p>
<p>“I think it's a testament to the hard work he put in,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “The physical work of rehab is challenging. The mental is even more challenging.</p>
<p>“To get a win Friday, especially with the fact that as well as he's pitched sometimes on the back end of a piggyback or front end of a piggyback where he didn't have an opportunity [for a win], it was really nice to see.”</p>
<p>Kuhl wasn’t enamored with his outing. He said he was “scuffling” and “starting to lose some command,” but he did an excellent job relying on his fastball to keep the Brewers off the barrel.</p>
<p>Despite three walks and only one strikeout, Kuhl induced a lot of soft contact and let his defense work.</p>
<p>“The fastball, I thought, was really good,” Kuhl said. “The first couple innings, I felt like it was the best I'd had it. Fell into some trouble through the later innings, but I was able to use the two-seamer. Just able to go back to what I've been using my whole career. So it worked, especially to lefties.”</p>
<p>The only significant damage Kuhl allowed was a solo homer to Ben Gamel in the second inning. Kuhl was trying to throw a back-foot slider but didn’t quite get it where he wanted. Gamel turned on it and hit it 425 feet to right-center field.</p>
<p>“You’re playing with fire when you try to get into those zones where, if you miss by a couple inches, it’s going to be right into a nitro zone for a hitter,” Kuhl said. “It’s a dangerous pitch, but it just didn’t get to the spot. It was hit, and he put a good swing on it.”</p>
<p>Similar to Steven Brault in his last outing, Kuhl said he was not thinking about how long he’d be able to go. He actually blamed himself for throwing too many pitches in the fourth and fifth innings, costing himself a chance at going back out for the sixth.</p>
<p>But Kuhl enjoyed the chance to go out and pitch, to give the Pirates innings and give his teammates a chance to win the game. With all the injuries they’ve had to starting pitchers, it’s something that hasn’t happened too terribly much.</p>
<p>The right-hander ended up earning his first win since June 15, 2018, and his encouraging performance offered a glimpse at what could be possible when the Pirates get back to full strength.</p>
<p>“I was just focusing on winning,” Kuhl said. “I really just wanted to win today. The guys in the clubhouse let me know how long it had been. It was a good feeling, really cool that all the guys in that clubhouse could celebrate with me.”</p>
<p><strong>Tucker heating up</strong></p>
<p>Cole Tucker is one of the most talkative players on the Pirates roster, but he’s quietly been showing some offensive improvements.</p>
<p>He had three more hits Friday, and over his past five games (three starts), Tucker is now 6-for-12.</p>
<p>"I think it's a confidence factor,” Shelton said. “When you get a few hits, you start to be a little bit more confident. He's put in a lot of hard work.</p>
<p>“I think we can see the fact that he's more comfortable in the box, more grounded in the box, and he's in a better spot. When you do that, you have more consistent at-bats, and you're able to battle yourself not only from pitch one through the at-bat but even with two strikes, which we saw [Friday].”</p>
<p>Tucker and Colin Moran both had three-hit nights, complementing the four-RBI game from Bryan Reynolds, who homered and tripled.</p>
<p>Moran even laid down a bunt when he saw open space up the third-base line.</p>
<p>“We had contributions from a lot of guys,” Moran said. “In a shortened season, a lot of stuff gets amplified. There are a lot of good hitters on our team that we have faith who are going to come out of a little bit of a rut.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Some minor moments that influenced the win …</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Josh Bell going first to third on a single in the fourth inning.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;A terrific, diving catch from Reynolds to rob Christian Yelich, which Kuhl certainly appreciated.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;“I think I saw the catch probability was like 20%,” Kuhl said. “Just a heck of a play. You tip your cap. He’s done a great job all year throwing guys out and making plays. Just tip your cap. Awesome play.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Geoff Hartlieb giving the Pirates four big outs. He looked much more confident, especially using his slider to strike out Keston Hiura to end the seventh inning.</p>
<p>Shelton said he was most impressed with Hartlieb’s fastball and his willingness to challenge hitters.</p>
<p>“The consistency of his fastball is what's really stood out to me and how he's been able to use it,” Shelton said. “I think we're seeing a kid that's starting to grow up on the mound. You're seeing confidence, you're seeing the aggressiveness and the ability to go after guys.”</p>
