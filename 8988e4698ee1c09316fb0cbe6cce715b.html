<h1>Brian O'Neill: How to dance in quarantine, doo-dah, doo-dah</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A great song can trigger a memory, and not always a great one, which leads to the question:&nbsp;What will wind up on the Pandemic Playlist?</p>
<p>Funny you should ask.</p>
<p>Two Sundays back, in the lockdown days that already seem a long time ago, my friend Mark Erickson, of Mt. Lebanon, started a Pandemic Playlist on Facebook.</p>
<p>“Don’t Stand So Close to Me” by The Police was a gimme. So was George Thorogood’s “I Drink Alone.” Mr. Erickson started there, asked for other suggestions and in a cyberflash had more than enough songs for a two-album set.</p>
<p>“I Think We’re Alone Now” by Tommy James and the Shondells, “Don’t Come Around Here No More” by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, and “U Can’t Touch This” by MC Hammer are among those on The Obvious List.</p>
<p>Peggy Lee’s “Fever” and “I Want a New Drug” by Huey Lewis and the News (my suggestion) made The Medical List.</p>
<p>And Billy Idol — who, come to think of it, always looked like he was in mid-pandemic — provided the ultimate A and B sides for life inside and outside during the lockdown: “Dancing With Myself” and “Eyes Without a Face.”</p>
<p>“That is the definitive track for the next 18 months of our life,” Mr. Erickson, 55, said.</p>
<p>He heads up a tech company’s sales team when he isn’t haunting Facebook, and in one of those video conference calls that has become&nbsp; the norm, he told his colleagues what he’d been doing. He shared the song titles. In short order there were about 60 more titles, such as&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5XcKBmdfpWs" target="_blank">“Too Much Time on My Hands”</a>&nbsp;by Styx.</p>
<p>I’m not a big fan of that band named for a river in hell, but I can understand why Mr. Erickson would ask,&nbsp;“How do you miss that?” To no one’s surprise, he also found others going over the same terrain. Matt Piltz put a&nbsp;<a href="/open.spotify.com/playlist/6EMaBkPlYrRftkKoQ7iU2E?si=TTwLMtfjQK-TK4VlY8Um9A" target="_blank">quarantine party playlist</a> on Spotify with more than 100 songs that runs six hours and 39 minutes.</p>
<p>Oh, these kids today with their hip and their hop and their Spotify. I’m just glad both Mr. Piltz and the Erickson squad remembered to include&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdpAop7gp0w" target="_blank">“Keep Your Hands to Yourself”</a> by that one-hit wonder from 1986, The Georgia Satellites. That took me back to bygone days of mixed tapes and keg parties in Roanoke, Va., and the Satellites’ lead singer, Dan Baird, leaning into his earthy twang for a song about a woman who is more than a match for him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I pulled out the old album, dropped the needle on the first track — yes, there’s still a turntable in my living room — and smiled for three minutes and 26 seconds of jangly guitars and down-home humor. And I wondered what memories are being made with this and other songs that have a new timeliness in our semi-quarantine.</p>
<p>Mr. Erickson’s friend, Andy Booth, an information technology director for a commercial printing company, has had zero work lately in his longtime sideline as a wedding disc jockey. But for most of the past two months, for a couple of hours every Saturday starting at 5 p.m., he has entertained his neighbors on Mt. Lebanon’s Markham Drive by playing music just outside his front door. Kids bike in the street, neighbors sip adult beverages from lawn chairs up and down the block and, occasionally, couples even dance in their driveways.</p>
<p>Police have been OK with that as long as the partiers stay on their own property, Mr. Booth said, and neighbors stay at least six feet apart. With a cooler and a folding chair, Mr. Erickson is more than fine to go all George Thorogood with his own beer.</p>
<p>Mr. Booth plans to play again from 3 to 5 p.m. on Memorial Day.&nbsp;Requests? He has “Stayin’ Alive” by the Bee Gees,&nbsp;“Cold Sweat” by James Brown, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Ra1DEd1ueA" target="_blank">“Rockin’ Pneumonia and the Boogie Woogie Flu”</a>&nbsp;by Huey Smith or Johnny Rivers, or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKNxeF4KMsY" target="_blank">“Yellow</a>” by Coldplay. Others, from Mr. Piltz’s playlist, seem strangely made for this moment:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLsXXthjnk8" target="_blank">“Wuhan Girl”</a>&nbsp;by Le Villejuif Underground,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7OsyCNcFyZ0" target="_blank">&nbsp;“Lysol”</a>&nbsp;by The Melvins and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi6yGuvKv_E" target="_blank">&nbsp;“Who’s Zoomin’ Who?”</a>&nbsp;by Aretha Franklin.&nbsp;Frank Sinatra’s defiant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9024VFH8rQ" target="_blank">“I’m Gonna Live Till I Die”</a> also works.</p>
<p>There is no shortage once you start thinking about it. I followed The Georgia Satellites with another bar-band classic from the 1980s,&nbsp;<a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-making-of-have-a-good-time-but-get-out-alive-by-the-houserockers/" target="_blank">“Have a Good Time (But Get Out Alive)”</a> by the Iron City Houserockers. It sounded good on my turntable. It should sound even better when we can all hear a jukebox again.</p>
