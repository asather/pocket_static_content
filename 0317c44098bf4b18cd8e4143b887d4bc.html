<p>Three works have been chosen as winners for the 2020 EQT Young Playwrights Contest, in its 21st year at City Theatre. The one-act plays emerged from entries throughout the region by students in grades 7-12.</p>
<p>Winners will have their plays professionally produced by City Theatre and presented in the Young Playwrights Festival, tentatively scheduled for January 2021. The works also will be published in City's Young Playwrights Anthology,</p>
<p>“While we aren’t sure exactly what the Young Playwrights Festival will look like this year due to COVID-19, City Theatre is committed to creating a platform for students’ voices and ensuring our audiences have access to their stories," said Katie Trupiano, the South Side company's education director.</p>
<p>The winning works are: "How to Not Fail AP World History with Just a Little Paranormal Assistance" by Elena Eiss (eighth grade, Pittsburgh CAPA); "A Banshee Wails" by Amelia Kovach (11th grade, Sharpsville High School); and "Fracture" by Rivers Leche (12th grade, Winchester Thurston).</p>
<p>Honorable mentions, which comes with a staged reading, are "Sweet and Sour" by Reyna Borrello (eighth grade, Belle Vernon Middle School), "Grand Visions" by Zoé Soteres (12th grade, Winchester Thurston), "The Battle of the Exes" by Erin Brody (11th grade, Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School) and "Purple Ocean" by Sebastian Mueller (ninth grade, Pittsburgh CAPA).</p>
<p>City Theatre, closed since mid-March due to COVID-19, recently announced a play-development partnership with Pittsburgh Playhouse and continues to look ahead, making plans and preparations for its fall season. The announced opening work is Manuel Cinema's multimedia "Frankenstein," scheduled for Sept. 19-Oct. 11.</p>
