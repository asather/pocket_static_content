<h1>Revised Port Authority budget proposal includes more maintenance workers to clean vehicles, stations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Port Authority says it will need even more maintenance workers to keep up with sanitizing vehicles every day as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The authority’s preliminary $485.6 million budget recommended for approval by the board’s finance committee Thursday calls for adding 68 maintenance workers. That’s up 10 from when the budget was introduced last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When the virus emergency began in March, the authority increased&nbsp;sanitizing its vehicles and stations from monthly to daily and has used mostly employees on overtime. Since the daily cleaning is the new industry standard, the agency will add employees to do the work.</p>
<p>Overall, the budget is an increase of about $24 million over the current spending package and slightly different from the initial $485.2 million plan.</p>
<p>Despite what CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman called a&nbsp;“financially crazy” time due to additional expenses as well as low ridership fare revenue during the pandemic, she said the agency has prepared a normal budget. That will make it easier to identify revenue shortfalls and cost increases that should be eligible for reimbursement from $141.75 million in federal funds approved by Congress to reimburse the agency for virus-related expenses, she said.</p>
<p>Chief Financial Officer Pete Schenk said the authority expects to use all of the federal money by the end of next year to cover lost revenue and additional expenses, including a $20.5 million deficit for the fiscal year ending June 30. That’s about $1 million less than initially expected due to lower expenses in May, he said.</p>
<p>The agency expects to use about $61 million of the additional federal funds to cover expenses in the past three months and the rest to balance the new budget. That money will cover revenue loss, additional expenses and projected losses in state or Allegheny County subsidies due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pandemic has caused a sharp reduction in ridership and a corresponding drop in fare revenue. For April and May, fare revenue was down $14.9 million in April and May compared to the previous year as ridership lagged as much as 80% below last year on some days.</p>
<p>“The [federal money] is making us whole,” Ms. Kelleman said.</p>
<p>The full board is scheduled to vote on the budget next Friday.</p>
