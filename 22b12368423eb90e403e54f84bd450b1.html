<h1>Letters from Pirates camp: The dreaded week-ending injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — A long hallway runs parallel to our clubhouse here at Pirate City. One side houses the equipment room, where players needing batting gloves or a sweatshirt or, really, anything can get those last-minute items. Across from that is the office of Pat Hagerty, the Pirates’ minor league equipment manager.</p>
<p>The hallway almost always smells of menthol, the result of the training room being only about 40 feet away, down another hallway perpendicular to this one.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, as the first group of campers prepared to play their game at LECOM Park — a highlight of camp — this hallway was the site of some unfortunate news, the type of thing that every person who attends Pirates Fantasy Camp hopes to avoid: a week-ending injury.</p>
<p>Glenn Merlin, a 77-year-old Greensburg native and one of the guys I’ve been traveling back and forth with all week, has to head home thanks to a shoulder injury he suffered during our evaluation game. In the hallway, Merlin was telling a few friends and received a sympathetic hug from Julie Seidman, another veteran camper.</p>
<p>At some point Tuesday, Merlin will pack up his hotel room and drive home by himself, stopping overnight somewhere to sleep.</p>
<p>“I’ll just kind of take my time,” Merlin told me on our drive to Pirate City this morning. “I feel OK as long as I’m not raising my arm. But it’ll be a long drive.”</p>
<p>Then Merlin started shaking his head. Even though he’s 77, he’s in very good health. This is either his 26th or 27th year coming to this camp. Not once has he had to make this lonely drive home.</p>
<p>Merlin actually played baseball until he was 60, then reluctantly switched over full-time to softball, something he never thought he would do.</p>
<p>“I always told my wife, ‘I’ll never play softball. That’s for old men.’ ” Merlin joked. “And I just quit doing that two years ago.”</p>
<p>Getting hurt at fantasy camp is a bummer for everyone, especially for the man or woman who has to drive however many hours back home, not knowing what the MRI might show.</p>
<p>Merlin actually had X-rays done at nearby Manatee Memorial Hospital. Although the doctors there said they didn’t think anything was broken, the depth of the injury was inconclusive.</p>
<p>“I said to them, ‘I’m OK to play now, right?’ ” Sherlock said. “They said, ‘Um, no.’ … I knew that was coming.”</p>
<p>And I knew this next part was coming, when I asked Merlin whether this experience will change his mind at all on coming back.</p>
<p>“No way,” Merlin said. “I’ll be back.”</p>
<p>The goal will actually to be healthy by May, Merlin said, for a few reunion games these guys play at PNC Park and Sean Casey’s Miracle League Field in Upper St. Clair. “’I’ll work like heck to get my arm right and get down there,” Merlin said. “That’s a fun three days.”</p>
<p>That sort of mentality is amazing to me. It’s basically what led me here in the first place, to find out why people like Merlin do this … and also why they keep doing it year after year.</p>
<p>Credit to the Pirates here: If a camper has to go home early, they usually do get credit for next season. Merlin will likely only pay about half price, assuming he’s able to go to camp in 2021.</p>
<p>Merlin owns his own business, which is really two companies: Pitt Rental Center and Pitt Industrial Diamond Products, both located on Route 30 in Irwin. The first sells party supplies along with trees at Christmas and pumpkins around Halloween. The latter handles construction supplies.</p>
<p>It’s something Merlin and his brother have done for 51 years, since Merlin graduated from Duquesne University with his MBA at age 22 and figured what the heck, why not?</p>
<p>“We decided to give it a try,” Merlin said. “We had nothing back then and got up to 90 employees at one time. We’re down from that now.”</p>
<p>Merlin is definitely one of the older campers here, but that also has its benefits. Steve Blass calls him the Magician, for obvious reasons. Merlin, Jim Fitzgerald and Mark Mansour, my traveling party for the week, have troves of stories from past years of closing down bars, hanging out with Pirates players on the third floor of Pirate City, you name it. They know everyone.</p>
<p>The same for basically everyone who attends it, fantasy camp for Merlin provides a respite from the real world, from work, from having to be responsible. Here, you simply need to have fun and stay healthy.</p>
<p>It’s a legal drug that nobody, under any circumstances, wants to give up.</p>
<p>“I think it’s the camaraderie,” Merlin said. “Not so much being with the pros but getting to know people. And, if someone’s not here, you miss ’em. You wonder what happened to them. It’s just a great week. For the most part, the weather’s great. You can get away from all your problems”</p>
<p>I joked with Merlin that he didn’t really get away from his problems. He actually created a new one for himself.</p>
<p>“That’s the game,” Merlin said. “But I love it.”</p>
