<h1>NHL free agency: Expect Jim Rutherford, Penguins to be quiet early</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You better grab a seat before reading the shocking paragraph that follows.</p>
<p>When NHL free agency begins at noon Friday, the Penguins won’t be adding Alex Pietrangelo to solidify the right side of their third defensive pair or Taylor Hall to compete with Jason Zucker for a spot on Evgeni Malkin’s left wing.</p>
<p>The Penguins entered Thursday with about $4.7 million in salary cap space, per CapFriendly, and they still need to sort out salaries for Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello, restricted free agents whom the team tendered this week.</p>
<p>That leaves little wiggle room in the budget for Pittsburgh general manager Jim Rutherford to grab the last few items on his offseason shopping list.</p>
<p>“We won’t be in on the big free agents on Friday,” Rutherford acknowledged once again Wednesday. “But we will be looking at adding more players.”</p>
<p>In past offseasons, many of the NHL’s top free agents put pen to paper in time to pop bottles at an afternoon happy hour. But free agency this year is going to be complicated by the financial fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which led to the cancellation of regular-season games and the loss of revenue.</p>
<p>Some NHL teams will be hesitant to pursue pricey free agents. The Penguins, with strong ownership and a competitive core, have not slashed their player payroll despite reports early in the offseason that stated they would do so.</p>
<p>Their problem is that the salary cap ceiling for the 2020-21 season, which the NHL is now hoping to start Jan. 1, stayed flat at $81.5 million. That left Rutherford less room than initially expected to piece together a contending team.</p>
<p>“Can we strengthen different areas? We’re going to have to see where guys fall,” he said. “We don’t have a lot of cap space. Not a lot of teams do.”</p>
<p>What areas are left for the Penguins to address? We’ll get to that shortly.</p>
<p>Most of this offseason overhaul was completed before the Stanley Cup was even handed out. In separate deals, the Penguins said goodbye to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/24/patric-hornqvist-trade-penguins-panthers-nhl-stanley-cup/stories/202009240175" target="_blank">Patric Hornqvist</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/11/nick-bjugstad-wild-penguins-trade-nhl/stories/202009110170" target="_blank">Nick Bjugstad</a> and welcomed <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/25/kasperi-kapanen-trade-penguins-maple-leafs/stories/202008250091" target="_blank">Kasperi Kapanen</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/25/mike-matheson-penguins-trade-patric-hornqvist-deal/stories/202009250137" target="_blank">Mike Matheson</a>.</p>
<p>This week, they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/10/05/jack-johnson-buyout-penguins-jim-rutherford-contract/stories/202010060043" target="_blank">bought out Jack Johnson</a>, declined to extend a qualifying offer to Dominik Simon and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/10/07/matt-murray-trade-penguins-senators-jonathan-gruden/stories/202010070121" target="_blank">moved on from Matt Murray</a>. The Murray trade, Rutherford’s fourth since the Penguins were stunned by the Montreal Canadiens in the play-in round, provided them with future assets and more financial clarity.</p>
<p>“Because of the new CBA we have now and the lower cap, we get forced to do things that we didn’t think that maybe we’d have to,” Rutherford said.</p>
<p>All that wheeling and dealing solidified the top six up front, with Kapanen slotted to skate alongside either Sidney Crosby or Malkin. Rutherford likes his top four defensemen, too. Matheson, a speedy puck-mover type, should be an upgrade over Johnson on the third pair. Tristan Jarry is the new go-to guy in goal.</p>
<p>Most of the lineup spots are already spoken for. But the Penguins would still like to add at least one more player on defense, at center and in the crease.</p>
<p>The Penguins are prepared to enter the season with Chad Ruhwedel skating on the right side of their third defensive pair. He played pretty well last season and is on a bargain contract. Zach Trotman is still in the fold. Prospects Josh Maniscalco and Will Reilly should start the year in the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>Ideally, the Penguins would add another affordable veteran defenseman to compete with Ruhwedel. But they could just opt to save the cap space and wait until the trade deadline to determine if they need an upgrade on the right side.</p>
<p>At center behind Crosby and Malkin, the Penguins have Teddy Blueger, Jared McCann and Lafferty. Blueger is ready for more responsibility after centering a pesky shutdown line last season. The team hung onto McCann and Lafferty, but both of those youngsters might be better served skating on the wing.</p>
<p>The Penguins want a veteran insurance policy. Brad Richardson, Carl Soderberg and Tomas Nosek are three unrestricted free agents who make sense. Rutherford will have plenty of options to pick through after more NHL players than usual did not receive qualifying offers from their respective teams this week.</p>
<p>“There were a bunch of guys not qualified, which everybody in the league expected,” the GM said. “There will be a lot of conversation about those guys.”</p>
<p>Rutherford has indicated that the Penguins would like a third goalie, too. Barring something unexpected, Casey DeSmith will be back with the NHL club in 2020-21 after spending all of last season with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the AHL.</p>
<p>“Casey DeSmith two seasons ago was very good for us. He had good numbers. So I’m comfortable with that,” he said. “We’re going to have to get more depth.”</p>
<p>They need another goalie to split time with Emil Larmi in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and possibly assume backup duties in Pittsburgh if Jarry or DeSmith misses time. It’s unclear if Dustin Tokarski could be brought back to fill that role.</p>
<p>With little cap space and no pressing needs they can realistically fill, Friday should be a great day for a nap. Rutherford will have to wait for guys like Pietrangelo and Hall to pop those champagne bottles before getting down to business.</p>
<p>“I would suspect if we do anything in free agency, it wouldn’t be in the first few days,” he said. “It will be when guys start to slip through the cracks. … We’ll just be looking now to add the right pieces if they come at the right price.”</p>
