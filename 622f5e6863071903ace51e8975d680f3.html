<h1>Protesters decry conditions at jail, seek release of more inmates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About 25 cars circled the Allegheny County Courthouse on Grant Street Wednesday to protest conditions at the jail and the continued incarceration of more than 1,600 inmates there during the COVID-19 pandemic — the same day that the county posted information that 11 residents in an alternative housing program have tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>According to the county’s website, 11 residents at Allegheny County Treatment Alternative, a 50-bed contracted facility, have tested positive, as well as three employees. Of those residents who tested positive, nine have been released to their residences, the county said, and officials are working to release the others.</p>
<p>There have also been four inmates and two staff members who have tested positive at the jail, whose population, as of Wednesday afternoon was 1,617, including federal detainees.</p>

<p>Since March 16, 1,095 inmates have been released from the jail as part of a collaborative effort among judges, court staff, the district attorney’s office, defense attorneys and the jail to reduce the population.</p>
<p>However, Bret Grote, of the Abolitionist Law Center, said that those efforts have basically stopped now.</p>
<p>“That leaves several hundred people in a dangerous, densely crowded space because of probation detainers or bailable offenses,” he said.&nbsp;“The pandemic must facilitate a seismic shift and reorientation in the purpose and risk of incarceration, not a mere temporary respite from a status quo in which systemic racism and structural poverty are the primary determinants of who ends up cycling in and out of jail.”</p>
<p>Warden Orlando Harper said that jail employees are working tirelessly to keep the remaining inmates safe.</p>
<p>“With a decline in population and a dedicated staff that’s focused on combating COVID-19, the Allegheny County Jail has maintained its concentration on safety for inmates and employees,” he said. “The Allegheny County Jail has worked to effectively reduce or mitigate the spread of illness throughout the facility and continues to ensure that all precautions are taken appropriately and that the health, safety and security of all inmates, and employees remains the primary focus.”</p>
<p>Fawn Walker-Montgomery, one of the organizers of Wednesday’s protest over jail conditions, chanted&nbsp;“inmates’ lives matter,” and&nbsp;“denying health care is violence,” into a megaphone as the cars, decorated with similar signs, circled the building that houses the county’s top decision-makers.</p>
<p>“We just cannot ignore that there are people suffering in the jail,” she said. “You cannot pick and choose when you practice humanity.”</p>
<p>She, along with other advocates, have said that inmates at the jail do not have access to the personal protection equipment that they should during the pandemic; that they are not being kept a safe distance from other inmates and that even though there is now additional space in the jail because of the release of more than 1,000 inmates over the last month, they are still not being held in single cells.</p>
<p>“We need more people to talk about what’s going on inside the jail,” Ms. Walker-Montgomery said.</p>
<p>Inmates at the Allegheny County Jail have reported conditions that they variously describe as “dirty,” “inhumane” and “cruel and unusual punishment,” resulting from the jail’s response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>According to one inmate and relatives of others, inmates at the jail have been restricted to an hour or less out of their cells per day, with dining and recreational time severely restricted or nonexistent. Phone calls have been restricted as well.</p>
<p>They’ve also complained that the commissary was closed, and the jail has not provided adequate hygiene supplies, including toilet paper, soap and toothpaste, or personal protective supplies like masks and gloves.</p>
<p>Corey Hatch, who pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct in October and then allegedly violated his probation, said that he has been provided one roll of toilet paper a week for him and his cellmate, and, due to the closed commissary, he has been unable to order other hygiene products.</p>
<p>He said that he has filed for release during the pandemic while awaiting trial because of his asthma and other medical conditions, but that he has seen no response despite “seeing murderers go free.” Mr. Hatch’s hearing, he said, has been postponed twice because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Christopher Hammond of the Hill District said that he has received short phone calls from his brother, Damon Hammond, who is at the jail awaiting trial on charges of sexual assault of a minor. In the most recent call, which Christopher Hammond said took place on Saturday, the two had just six minutes to talk. He said his brother described many of the same conditions Mr. Hatch reported, including the closed commissary, the lack of hygiene supplies -- including two weeks without toothpaste -- and the lack of adequate separation between prisoners.</p>
<p>“They’re being treated inhumanely,” Christopher said. “They’re not separating them properly.”</p>
<p>Warden Harper said social distancing has been a consistent focus at the jail, which is communicated to staff and inmates.</p>
<p>“Chairs have been separated in common areas, and we have reduced the amount of inmates allowed out of cell to 10 at a time,” he said. “While single-celling inmates is always a consideration, classification and separation issues and ongoing suicide risks are also incorporated into any such decision.”</p>
<p>Warden Harper said that the commissary was closed for only 10 days -- from April 10-20 -- after the company that contracts with the county would not staff it because of virus concerns. He noted, however, that there has been no shortage of hygiene products for inmates.</p>
<p>As for toilet paper, inmates were being limited to one roll each early on during the lock-down to control inventory and because of concerns about a national shortage, Warden Harper said.</p>
<p>“Toilet paper was not being shared in cells,” he said. “Certainly, if an inmate had run out, they’d be provided another roll. After recent discussions internally and with our supplier, we ended that limitation.”</p>
<p>Warden Harper discounted complaints that there is an inadequate supply of gloves and masks, saying there are enough for inmates, employees and contractors.</p>
<p>“The safety of our inmates and employees is our main concern at the ACJ, so we have staff members taking inventory of PPE on a daily basis,” he said. “Numbers are collected from across the facility so we may ensure we have an adequate supply moving forward. Inmates are issued masks on a daily basis, but it is not mandated that they wear them.”</p>
<p>As for concerns about limited phone calls, the warden said that since March 18, every inmate has been given one free, five-minute call to compensate for the suspension of visits. Inmates are also able to make calls with money in their commissary account, he said, although he acknowledged that calls are limited to certain times to ensure social distancing.</p>
<p>“We recognize that this is not an easy time for anyone. Many people including those who work at the jail, or who are housed there, are concerned about their own health and those of their loved ones,” Warden Harper said.&nbsp;“Every decision regarding changes at the facility are made with the care and safety of all of those in the facility uppermost in those considerations.”</p>
