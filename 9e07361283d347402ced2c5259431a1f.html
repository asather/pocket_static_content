<h1>East Liberty pastor, two worshipers recovering from COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The pastor and two worshipers at Eastminster Presbyterian Church contracted and have largely recovered from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Rev. Paul Roberts probably contracted the illness, caused by the coronavirus, after greeting the two at church on Sunday, March 8, said the Rev. Sheldon Sorge, general minister of the Pittsburgh Presbytery. The two had just returned from a Colorado ski area where an outbreak has been reported.</p>
<p>After the three began feeling symptoms in midweek last week, they self-quarantined. Eastminster, located in East Liberty, also shut down and, like most churches, livestreamed its Sunday services. The Eastminster staff also self-quarantined. No one else in the congregation or their other circles of contacts appears to be affected as of Wednesday, said Rev. Sorge.</p>
<p>He spoke in a phone interview shortly after speaking to Rev. Roberts, who asked him to answer press inquiries.</p>
<p>“He’s feeling better. The fever’s gone,” Rev. Sorge said. The other two worshipers are&nbsp;“getting better, too. That’s good news.”</p>
