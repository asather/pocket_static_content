<p>Less than 48 hours after the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/lifestyle/2020/08/23/Delta-Foundation-dissolve-bankrupt-COVID-19-Pittsburgh-gay-Pride-cancel-LGBTQIA-fest/stories/202008230147" target="_blank">Delta Foundation voted to dissolve</a>, the Pittsburgh LGBTQ Coalition and TransYOUniting announced they plan to take continue Pittsburgh Pride in 2021.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Pride 2021 will be held June 4-6, with the parade on June 5, a Saturday.</p>
<p>The exact locations for the event will be announced later, but organizers say they still expect the celebration to be held Downtown.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Pride 2020 had originally been scheduled for July, then postponed until the fall before it was ultimately canceled due to COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>The groups wanted to move the Pride celebration back to June to “bring Pride back to the internationally recognized month of celebration for the LGBTQ+ community,” Kenny West, the founder of the Pittsburgh LGBTQ Coalition, said during the announcement on Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Next year’s event will be the first celebrated in Pittsburgh through a collaboration of LGBTQ+ organizations across Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“This ensures that Pittsburgh Pride will be inclusive and a safe space for all members of the LGBTQ Community,” said Mr. West.</p>
<p>Delta Foundation, which had been hosting Pride events since 2007, has been criticized for not being inclusive enough, specifically to those in the community who identify as transgender.</p>
<p>“It is sad that Delta is not around anymore,” Mr. West said. “It’s sad to see non-profits go, but this is about something more. This is about inclusivity and diversity. This is about bringing love back to a community; this pride will be for the people.”</p>
<p>On Saturday, nine member’s of Delta’s board of directed voted unanimously to wind down its operations, with another board member abstaining.&nbsp;Board president Martin Healey said&nbsp;Pittsburgh Pride generated more than 90% of Delta’s annual funding. Without the revenue stream, he said, Delta had no way of moving forward.</p>
<p>The organizers that gathered Monday in Downtown said they expect the 2021 event to be larger than previous years.</p>
<p>“We wanted to make sure we got this information out to the community to let the community know we are here, we are still going to do pride, and pride is still going to be for us,” Dena Stanley the founder of TransYOUniting said.</p>
<p>The organizers welcome other groups to join the collaboration and would like individuals to register on their website.</p>
<p>More specific information about Pittsburgh Pride 2021 is expected to be released at a later date.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh LGBTQ Coalition and TransYouniting also announced Monday that they will be holding a weekly justice program called F.J.E Wednesdays, which stands for freedom, justice and equality.</p>
<p>They will be hosting rallies every Wednesday at 6 p.m. at the City-County Building to address issues like voting rights, accountability and diversity within the Pittsburgh police departments, housing security and gentrification as well as LGBTQ+ rights.</p>
