<h1>Ammon Rec Center will get a technology upgrade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins and FNB Corp. are teaming up to contribute $100,000 toward the creation of a technology-driven learning center at the Ammon Recreation Center in the Hill District.</p>
<p>The announcement, made Thursday, said the the Ammon Rec2Tech Education Center will feature a computer lab and “maker space” to create STEM learning opportunities for Hill District students and families.</p>
<p>“Partnerships with our business community are key to making Pittsburgh a city for all, and these investments by the Penguins and F.N.B. in our programming in the Hill District are a great example of the work we can do in neighborhoods citywide,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a release.</p>
<p>The new facility is expected to open by mid-2021 and will be managed and operated by Citiparks employees, the announcement said.</p>
<p>Rec2Tech is a nationwide initiative founded in 2015 by the Digital Harbor Foundation in Baltimore. The initiative’s website said its goal is to call upon government, civic and community leaders to support the transition of underutilized public spaces into technology centers to provide STEM — science, technology, engineering and mathematics —&nbsp;learning opportunities for local communities.</p>
<p>“The innovation center at Ammon provides a critical hub for youth in the Hill District to connect with technology, explore new horizons and build digital literacy skills that are to their success in school and the workplace,” said David Morehouse, the Penguins president and CEO.</p>
<p>The facility is not the only upcoming partnership between the Penguins and FNB in the Hill District. Penguins officials filed notice with the Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority in April that they were ready to move ahead with plans for a 24-story office tower at the former Civic Arena site. The tower will serve as FNB’s new corporate headquarters.</p>
<p>“Our investment in Ammon goes above and beyond our proposed investments in the Lower Hill development, and we are proud to partner with City Councilman [Daniel] Lavelle and the Mayor’s Office on a project that will have a positive impact on youth and families in the Hill District,” said Kevin Acklin, the Penguins’ senior vice president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Penguins and FNB will continue to work with the city and the Hill District to develop “additional STEM and financial education programming at Ammon over the coming months and years,” the announcement said.</p>
