<h1>Study says working from home during pandemic saved U.S. drivers $90.9 billion</h1>

<p>Most of the economic impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has been negative: high unemployment, business closures, transportation agencies reeling from revenue losses due to low traffic.</p>
<p>But <a title="Upward study on commuting costs" href="https://www.upwork.com/press/economics/where-remote-work-saves-commuters-most/" target="_blank">a seven-page study released Thursday</a> claims there’s one area where Americans have benefited dramatically: Working from home instead of driving to work has saved more than $90 billion in time and actual costs since the pandemic began in March.</p>
<p>Upwork — a Mountain View, Calif., agency that specializes in matching freelance professionals with temporary jobs — concluded that working remotely has become so popular during the pandemic that many people won’t return to driving and the national economy will go through a major shift in the next couple of years. Adam Ozimek, the agency’s chief economist, said he expects Americans to spend the money saved on commuting in other areas such as eating out more often, home improvements or more lavish vacations.</p>
<p>In a survey of 1,000 people, Mr. Ozimek said he found people now working from home previously commuted 46.3 minutes a day to get to work and back. Extrapolated across the country, that translates to Americans spending about 32.9 million hours less each day commuting and eliminating the pollution that comes from 890 million miles driven each day.</p>
<p>Using the standard average cost of 20.54 cents per mile for operating a car, Americans are saving $183 million a day in commuting costs. In time, valued at $12.50 an hour, the savings amounts to $411 million a day.</p>
<p>Since the start of the pandemic in mid-March, that amounts to more than $90 billion or an average of about $2,000 for each person who previously drove to work.</p>
<p>The study also ranked 261 cities based on commuting time, meaning residents in cities with higher commuting times would save more money working from home than those on the low end. East&nbsp;Stroudsburg, Pa., where many people live and commute to New York City, has the longest commute at 83.6 minutes, followed by New York City-Newark (76.2 minutes) and Washington, D.C. (71.9 minutes), while the shortest time is Wichita Falls, Texas (29.8 minutes).</p>
<p>Pittsburgh has the 27th-longest commute time at 56.5 minutes.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp;Ozimek said he’s convinced working from home has been enlightening for many people who hadn’t realized how much time they spend driving to and from work,&nbsp;a figure that has increased by about 11 minutes a day since 1980. He expects many workers to lobby to continue working remotely after the pandemic ends.</p>
<p>“[Not commuting] really is a big-picture change,” Mr. Ozimek said.&nbsp;“I think commuting is something you get used to. But it eats into people’s lives. When you don’t have to do it, you realize how much time it takes and what else you could be doing.”</p>
<p>Of course, the downside is that businesses that benefit from commuter spending&nbsp;— gas stations, parking garages and auto repair shops&nbsp;— lose out if that spending doesn’t occur. As a result, the economy will have to go through&nbsp;“a period of adjustment” and “short-term stress” while it responds to spending shifts, Mr. Ozimek said.</p>
<p>“It won’t be as drastic as what we see now [with business closures and unemployment],” he said.&nbsp;“The economy will come back. People will spend differently, maybe go out to eat more often, buy more clothes, go on bigger vacations.”</p>
