<h1>Meadville glass plant to downsize, lay off 108 as COVID-19 impacts market conditions </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A plant in Meadville, Crawford County, that makes flat glass for automobiles is shutting down a production line and cutting 108 jobs effective June 10.</p>
<p>Vitro Automotive, a Mexican-based glass company&nbsp;which owns the facility, said economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic pushed the company to downsize.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Automakers have scaled back production dramatically since the onset of the global virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Also, Vitro said the production line will soon require $40 million worth of upgrades.</p>
<p>“Float-glass production lines require significant reinvestment and rebuild about every 10 years” and the line “was last rebuilt in 2009,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>Another glass line will continue to operate at the plant.</p>
<p>Those targeted for layoffs include 90 hourly and 18 salaried workers.</p>
<p>The plant currently employs 272.</p>
<p>Those laid off will receive health care through Aug. 31, Vitro said.</p>
<p>Vitro said both lines had been running at about 60% capacity prior to the coronavirus spread because of “lingering challenges in the U.S. automotive markets.”</p>
<p>Current market conditions don’t support a rebuild of the line that will be shut down, Vitro said.</p>
<p>“We already faced a difficult combination of factors … including a growing oversupply of automotive glass in the marketplace … but the latest economic impacts from the coronavirus outbreak are just too much of a hurdle to invest $40 million in rebuilding it,” said Dave Shaffer, Meadville plant manager.</p>
<p>The company said it will consider rebuilding the line, “if there is a business case to justify the investment.”</p>
<p>Vitro acquired the Meadville plant in 2017. It was originally operated by PPG and later, Pittsburgh Glass Works.</p>
<p>Vitro shuttered PPG’s original glass plant in East Deer in 2018.</p>
