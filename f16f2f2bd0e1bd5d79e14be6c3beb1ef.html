<h1>Tour the Montour goes virtual, but you can still ride it</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like so many other events, the Tour the Montour bicycle ride and fundraiser for the Montour Trail is going virtual due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The 18th annual group ride on the popular rail trail, which had 500 participants last year, was scheduled for September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There still is a real-life bicycling component: From Saturday through September, bicyclists&nbsp;are encouraged to ride the mileage that they would have ridden — 6 miles&nbsp;(the family fun ride), 12 miles, 15-24 miles, 44 miles and 62 miles (a metric century).</p>
<p>“Any mileage. Any time,” Tour the Montour director Patricia Friedsam says in a news release. “As many stages as you want, or all in one bike ride.”</p>
<p>You can do it on the Montour Trail (<a href="https://montourtrail.org" target="_blank">montourtrail.org</a>) or anywhere else, alone or with friends, as long as you stay 6 feet apart.</p>
<p>“Use a stationary bike if you choose,” says Ms. Friedsam. “Just celebrate the fact that in the midst of a pandemic, we can still be outdoors.”</p>
<p>Registered participants will receive a commemorative T-shirt and a chance to win prizes, including a two-night stay at Seven Springs Mountain Resort and a cycling kit from Aero Tech Designs.</p>
<p>The cost to register is $25, $15 for children up to age 12, at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bikereg.com/tour-the-montour-trail-ride" target="_blank">www.bikereg.com/tour-the-montour-trail-ride</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are now more than 60 miles of completed trail west and south of Pittsburgh, from Coraopolis to Clairton, including a 46-mile contiguous section. Named Pennsylvania’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2017/01/26/Allegheny-River-Montour-Trail-hailed-for-drawing-attention-to-state-s-natural-assets/stories/201701260178" target="_blank">Trail of the Year </a>in 2017, it is to eventually become part of the coast-to-coast <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2019/05/08/Great-American-Rail-Trail-Pittsburgh-bike-cross-country-route-Allegheny-Passage/stories/201905030099" target="_blank">Great American Rail-Trail</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Sept. 13-19, signs will be posted along the trail to mark official tour out-and-back distances.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Riders are encouraged to post photos and descriptions of their rides on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/43518292159" target="_blank">Montour Trail Enthusiasts Facebook group.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
