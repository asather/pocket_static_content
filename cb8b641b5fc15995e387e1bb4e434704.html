<h1>National Guard, temporary manager move in to troubled nursing home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of 38 Pennsylvania National Guard members began at least a week’s worth of work Monday providing support to the troubled Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center nursing home in Beaver County that is battling the state’s worst COVID-19 nursing home outbreak.</p>
<p>“The focus for both us and the facility is to get residents who are non-COVID and those who have recovered from the disease and separate them from those who have it, and save lives,” said Capt. David Boyles, a spokesman for the unit of guard members who volunteered to help, most of them from Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The step-up in the state’s efforts to respond to the outbreak came on the same day that the state hired a temporary manager for the facility, Allaire Health Services of Freehold, N.J.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“We will be there to help and assist and get the facility to a high level of standards, a level of services the residents deserve,” said Ben Kurland, Allaire’s CEO.</p>
<p>The dual moves since Friday were received with hope but skepticism from some of the local politicians and families who have been pushing the state and Comprehensive Healthcare, Brighton’s owners, to do more to respond to an outbreak that has infected at least 322 of the residents and killed at least 71 of them in a building that had about 460 residents in March.</p>
<p>Bringing in the guard “is an important step,” said U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, who represents Beaver County and has been critical of the company’s and the state and federal response to help Brighton’s residents. “I believe Brighton deserves all the help it can get the residents and their families.”</p>
<p>“But it’s only one step and it doesn’t relate to the management issues I’m focused on,” he said. “We need to make sure this temporary manager feels accountable and really works to stop the spread of this virus.”</p>
<p>The Beaver County commissioners jointly put out a statement Monday criticizing Gov. Tom Wolf for threatening sanctions against Beaver County and its businesses if they don’t follow the state’s quarantine rules, saying, in part: “If the Governor and his administration are so interested in saving lives, only they can answer the question why they ignored multiple requests for help and statistical counts coming out of Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center by waiting over six weeks to only now send in the National Guard.”</p>
<p>Lt. Col. Keith Hickox, a statewide guard spokesman, said Brighton was the ninth long-term care facility — and the largest — in the state to receive medical assistance from the guard during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the fifth at which the guard has provided hazardous environment training. Three other nursing facilities have received lesser levels of guard help.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, when asked during her daily online news conference why Brighton, which has the worst outbreak, wasn’t the first nursing home to get the guard’s assistance instead of the ninth, said that “nursing homes have had significant issues in terms of staffing throughout the state and so the determination was that the National Guard had to be in other places and now it’s in Brighton.”</p>
<p>Jodi Gill, whose father, Glenn Gill, 81, is still a resident at Brighton, was “happy to see the National Guard come in,” but she said she was “not sure what I think about this Allaire group. I have concerns with them.”</p>
<p>In addition to providing contract management, Allaire owns three nursing homes, one of which, Allaire Rehab and Nursing in Freehold, currently has a one-star rating —&nbsp;the worst possible&nbsp;— from the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services, which oversees nursing homes for the federal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb noticed that too.</p>
<p>Allaire “owns a nursing home that has a worse rating than Brighton,” he said, noting that Brighton, with all of its problems over the past two years, still has a two-star CMS rating.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurland said the current rating is not reflective of the building’s overall quality.</p>
<p>“That facility historically has done extremely well. The star rating for it is typically between three and five stars,” he said. “That building is just a stellar building.”</p>
<p>Told what Mr. Kurland said, Ms. Gill replied: “I’m sure the owners of Brighton would say the same thing” about having had higher ratings in the past.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kurland said his company’s past success as a manager for a struggling nursing home is more pertinent.</p>
<p>He said Allaire was hired in July 2019 by the state of New Jersey to temporarily manage New Grove Manor nursing home in East Orange, N.J., when it was placed on CMS’s Special Focus Facility program, which is a list of the nation’s worst nursing homes. Brighton for two years has been an SFF candidate nursing home because of its poor performance.</p>
<p>Mr. Kurland said his company helped New Grove Manor “graduate” from the SFF program just last month and it is no longer on the list.</p>
<p>He thinks that experience will help in managing Brighton.</p>
<p>“I do think there’s a lot of work that needs to be done” at Brighton, he said. “We feel we’ll be able to lend the staff and the residents the help to do what’s needed.”</p>
<p>His company will send “several” people to work on-site for an undetermined amount of time. The state will decide when a temporary manager is no longer needed.</p>
<p>The state said in a press release that Allaire “will remain in place until Brighton is able to achieve substantial compliance with the recommendations or the rate of infection at Brighton is substantially reduced.”</p>
<p>While no one from Allaire was on-site Monday, the National Guard began its work over the weekend, first by assessing the problems at the building beginning this past Friday, before the public even knew the guard was coming to help, Brighton’s owners said in emailed answers to questions.</p>
<p>“The entire Brighton community is grateful to receive the vital assistance we have been seeking since the beginning of this global pandemic,” Brighton’s owners said in an emailed statement. “Our chief goal is to defeat COVID-19 and preserve the health and well-being of the most vulnerable Pennsylvanians.”</p>
<p>Guard spokesman Lt. Col. Hickox said the contingent consists of two teams, one with 27 members providing nursing and medical support, and another of 11 members who will train facility staff for cleanup in hazardous, virus-contaminated environments.</p>
<p>"The medical staff deployment, including nurses and medics and two board-certified geriatric doctors, will generally be focused on non-acute residents who have tested both positive and negative, while the regular facility staff focuses on more acute care patients," Lt. Col. Hickox said in a phone interview Monday.</p>
<p>"We have lots of doctors in different specialties, but few in geriatrics because we don't generally have older people in the military," he said. "But here these doctors are playing a pivotal role and are a testament to the great blend of skills we have in the guard."</p>
<p>He said the deployment at Brighton was requested by the facility and the state Department of Health and is expected to last at least a week, although that could be adjusted longer, depending on the facility's staffing needs.</p>
<p>"It depends on how many staffers are out because they've tested positive or suspect that they are positive for the virus and have quarantined themselves," Lt. Col. Hickox said. "That can put a facility at a low staff-to-resident ratio and is something we've seen at other sites."</p>
