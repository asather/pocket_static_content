<h1>Next COVID-19 bill from Congress will provide more small business loan fixes, Lamb says</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Congress will move to shore up the federal small business loan program and provide more unemployment benefits and health care spending, likely delaying any major stimulus package like infrastructure investment, Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, said on Thursday during a Pittsburgh Technology Council webcast.</p>
<p>Lawmakers will attempt to extend and strengthen the $2.3 trillion rescue bill signed into law March 27, Mr. Lamb said, as the small business lending program faces a shaky rollout since opening last Friday.</p>
<p>The next package will take “a little more of the ‘stop the-bleeding’ approach before we ‘cure the patient’ with infrastructure spending and some of the broader economic things we need to do,” said Mr. Lamb, who serves on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.</p>
<p>He struck a tone of optimism with the loan package known as Paycheck Protection Program, which essentially covers small businesses’ payroll in the coming weeks. Negotiating the rescue package, “We kind of fired everything we could at the wall to see what would stick and what would succeed — and I think this is one that’s going to succeed,” he said.</p>

<p>He acknowledged there have been some “horrible administrative glitches” causing long wait times. He said roughly $100 billion in loans have been authorized as part the $350 billion program, so he believes the government has time to make the necessary fixes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“No one needs to panic and think that someone else is getting the money besides them,” Mr. Lamb said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said the program needs to expand better access to businesses that don’t have a strong current relationship with commercial banks carrying out the loan program — like Huntington, PNC and Dollar Bank.</p>
<p>This could be some of the smallest businesses, like a mom-and-pop&nbsp;shop, or long-standing businesses that have simply paid off debts, he said.</p>
<p>“People like that are being left out of the current execution of this program,” Mr. Lamb said.&nbsp;“So I think when we go to refill the coffers with more money, were going to try to create some new avenues to the people who were not reached very well the first time around.”</p>
<p>A government program of historic proportions, he added, “always comes with some administrative complexity.”</p>
<p>Lawmakers in both parties have realized the rescue legislation, known as the CARES Act, is proving to fall short of what is needed.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the Senate failed reach an agreement to replenish the small business loan program.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., put forth a bill containing $250 billion in aid to small businesses.</p>
<p>Democrats, apparently caught off guard, objected and offered an alternative. The Democratic bill, in addition to the small business money, tacked on $100 billion for hospitals, $150 billion for state and local governments and an expansion of food assistance. Senate Republicans rejected the Democratic proposal.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why Leader McConnell would not go along with that,” Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said in an interview after the bills failed. State and local government budgets&nbsp;“have been absolutely decimated.”</p>
<p>Because lawmakers are not in Washington, the Senate sought to move forward by unanimous consent to avoid bringing senators back to Washington amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;The Senate is on a break until Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said there is unlikely to be consensus on a measure he called “CARES two.” Senators will probably debate another round of legislation, he said, when they are scheduled to return on April 20.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell could delay the Senate’s return until May.&nbsp;</p>
