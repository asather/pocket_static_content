<h1> High school wrestling: Mt. Lebanon senior wins fourth title at Allegheny County tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Luke Stout joined an exclusive club at the Allegheny County tournament, which concluded Saturday at Fox Chapel High School.</p>
<p>Stout, a Mt. Lebanon senior, became the fifth wrestler in the 19-year history of the tournament to win four titles with his 8-3 win over Bethel Park’s Luke Montgomery in the 195-pound final.</p>
<p>“It’s exciting. That’s one of the goals I wrote down at the beginning of the season,” said Stout, who also received the outstanding wrestler award. “It’s pretty cool to come out and execute it.”</p>
<p>The other four-time county champs are&nbsp; Plum’s Sean Clair (2002-05), Shaler’s Nick Nelson (2004-07), North Allegheny’s Dom Forys (2011-14) and North Hills’ Gage Curry (2013-16).</p>
<p>Stout was joined atop the winner’s platform by two teammates, his younger brother Mac, and Jackson Gray.</p>
<p>Mac Stout, a sophomore, claimed his second title with a 3-1 win in the 170-pound final over Hampton’s Tyler Kocak, who was making his third appearance in the finals. Gray posted a 5-4 win over Pine-Richland’s Nathan Lukez in the 145-pound final.</p>
<p>“It’s a really good feeling to know that all my hard work is paying off,” Mac Stout said. “It’s great for the team to go three for three in the finals.”</p>
<p>The 152-pound final also featured two returning champs. Pine-Richland’s Cole Spencer won his second title with a 3-0 win against Quaker Valley’s Conner Redinger. Both won a title in 2018.</p>
<p>“It feels a lot better than last year,” said Spencer, referring to his third-place finish. “Last year was a bump in the road. This title shows that I’m back on track.”</p>
<p>Spencer’s title clinched the team title for Pine-Richland. It was the Rams’ second county title and first since 2005. And they won by the smallest margins, outscoring North Allegheny 223- 222.5.</p>
<p>Anthony Ferraro also won a title for Pine-Richland. Ferraro recorded a 14-0 major decision in the 106-pound final against Montour’s James Walzer.</p>
<p>North Hills’ Sam Hillegas became a three-time champion with a 9-2 win over North Allegheny’s Max Stedeford at 138 pounds. A knee injury forced Hillegas to withdraw from the county tournament his freshman year.</p>
<p>Others who won a second county title were South Park’s Joey Fischer, Elizabeth Forward’s Ryan Michaels and Hampton’s Justin Hart.</p>
<p>Fischer posted a 5-4 win over North Allegheny’s Dylan Coy in the 120-pound final.</p>
<p>Michaels recorded his 100th career victory with an 8-0 win over Hampton’s Zachary Wright in the 126-pound final.</p>
<p>Hart won the 182-pound crown with a 10-2 major decision of Quaker Valley’s Patrick Cutchember. Hart was making his third appearance in the finals.</p>
