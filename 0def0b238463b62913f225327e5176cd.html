<h1>Pirates Blake Cederlind, Socrates Brito test positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton revealed two positive tests for COVID-19 among Pirates players on Sunday — reliever Blake Cederlind and outfielder Socrates Brito.</p>
<p>Shelton made the announcement on a Zoom call with local reporters, praising the two for their permission to convey the information.</p>
<p>“Very much appreciated,” Shelton said. “Very much respect the other people that we have who don’t feel that it’s necessary to talk about, but I think it is [important] for people to realize that it is real in the game."</p>
<p>On Saturday, Shelton said that the Pirates have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/04/Pittsburgh-pirates-derek-shelton-summer-camp-covid-19-MLB/stories/202007040055" target="_blank">“organizationally” had a few positive tests</a> but said he was unable to elaborate.</p>
<p>The next step is contact tracing, finding out who both were around, and then they have to have two negative tests before they can return. In the meantime, they will be isolated.</p>
<p>Shelton said he was unable to say, per HIPAA, whether they were symptomatic.</p>
<p>Cederlind is a hard-throwing right-hander who finished last season at Class AA Altoona. After a strong spring training, he could contend for a bullpen job if he’s back quickly enough during summer camp.</p>
<p>Brito is a depth outfielder and was slated to begin the season at Class AAA Indianapolis, although he will be among the first few candidates to get a chance if there are injuries.</p>
