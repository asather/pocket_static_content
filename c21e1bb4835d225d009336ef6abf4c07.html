<h1>'It has taken us over the top': $850,000 in grants awarded under new URA program</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A commercial kitchen project in Homewood designed to help small food-based entrepreneurs is getting a boost thanks to a new pilot program formed to make it easier to fund neighborhood projects.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Urban Redevelopment Authority announced the first $850,000 in grants under the Neighborhood Initiatives Fund program Tuesday. The 18 grants awarded will impact 30 city neighborhoods, according to the URA.</p>
<p>One of the beneficiaries is a commercial kitchen being built by the Bible Center Church in Homewood. The $100,000 URA grant will allow the church and its community and economic development division known as the Oasis Project to complete the kitchen and have it open in May.</p>
<p>“It has taken us over the top, which is a beautiful thing,” said Cynthia Wallace, Oasis Project executive director. “Not only for our church but the community, this is huge.”</p>
<p>The church has been raising money for the project for the past five years. Ms. Wallace said the commercial kitchen will provide an opportunity for food-based businesses operating out of homes to get to the next level.</p>
<p>“If they don’t have a commercial kitchen to operate in, they can’t take their business to scale,” she said.</p>
<p>The 3,200-square-foot commercial kitchen and training space is being built inside the lower level of a former Rite Aid at 717 N. Homewood Ave. It is part of the church’s Oasis Project, which includes a business academy designed to help African American, female and other minority entrepreneurs and a cafe that provides jobs and job training.</p>
<p>Bible Center Church was one of three groups to receive $100,000 grants, the highest awarded. The others were the Northside Partnership Project for a McNaugher School heating upgrade and the Hazelwood Initiative to improve a gravel lot at Second Avenue and Tecumseh Street.</p>
<p>Sonya Tilghman, Hazelwood Initiative executive director, said the goal is to transform the lot into “something useful and inviting to the neighborhood.”</p>
<p>She noted that the lot sits at a strategic junction in the neighborhood near the Carnegie Library and the Hazelwood Green redevelopment. It also is next to a building owned by the Hazelwood Initiative that includes three businesses. Improvements could include signage for the businesses.</p>
<p>“It’s a busy corner. It’s right at the library. It’s potentially one of the key corners in the neighborhood because of the access below the tracks and to Hazelwood Green,” she said.</p>
<p>The NIF program awards two levels of grants — under $20,000 with no matching fund requirements and $20,000 to $100,000 with matches required from non-URA and non-city sources.</p>
<p>Nonprofits and community-based organizations are eligible for funds for a variety of projects, including vacant property reclamation and stewardship, historic preservation and brownfield development.</p>
