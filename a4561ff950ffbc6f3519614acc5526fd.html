<h1>Pitt basketball adds 3-star guard Femi Odukale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">On Sunday, Pitt lost one of its guards as it was revealed that Ryan Murphy would graduate and transfer from the program. Two days later, the Panthers gained one.</span></p>
<p>Femi Odukale, a guard in the 2020 recruiting class, announced Tuesday that he has committed to Pitt and coach Jeff Capel, filling one of the two scholarships they had open.</p>
<p>The 6-foot-5 Odukale is listed as a three-star prospect by both 247 Sports and Rivals, the latter of which ranks him as the No. 47 player at his position nationally. He chose the Panthers over a group of finalists that included Massachusetts, Seton Hall and St. Bonaventure.</p>
<p>Odukale attends Commonwealth Academy, a private school in Springfield, Mass., but is originally from Brooklyn. His verbal pledge will give next season’s Pitt team at least three scholarship players from New York City, with forward Justin Champagnie and 2020 signee Max Amadasun being the others.</p>
<p>The commitment comes less than a month after taking an official visit to Pitt in late February, when he was on hand for the Panthers’ 59-56 loss to Virginia.</p>
<p>He joins a group of incoming freshmen that already includes Amadasun, center John Hugley and forward Noah Collier, all of whom have signed with the program. Both Hugley and Collier are ranked as top-150 recruits in their class by Rivals.</p>
<p>During his recruitment, Odukale has been well-regarded as a ball-handler and defender. He’ll provide some depth to the Pitt backcourt that, as of now, is set to include Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens, both of whom just completed their sophomore seasons, as well as Ithiel Horton, a Delaware transfer who sat out last season in compliance with NCAA rules.</p>
