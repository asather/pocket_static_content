<h1>Deval Patrick, Latecomer to the 2020 Race, Drops Out</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Former Gov. Deval Patrick of Massachusetts dropped out of the Democratic presidential race Wednesday, just three months after entering it, ending a last-minute campaign that seemed to fizzle out almost as soon as it had begun.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick had hoped to capture delegates in his neighboring state of New Hampshire and to carve away former Vice President Joe Biden’s support among black voters in South Carolina. But while Mr. Biden has lost support, Mr. Patrick did not gain any. In the New Hampshire primary Tuesday, he received less than 0.5% of the vote.</p>
<p>“I believed and still believe we had a strong case to make for being able to deliver better outcomes,” he said in a message to supporters. “But the vote in New Hampshire last night was not enough for us to create the practical wind at the campaign’s back to go on to the next round of voting.”</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick was the third candidate to end his campaign after the New Hampshire primary, following entrepreneur Andrew Yang and Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado, both of whom dropped out late Tuesday night.</p>
<p>In South Carolina, local Democratic officials said that while Mr. Patrick generated enthusiasm among some older black Democrats, who remembered him as the second black elected governor in history, he had little name recognition among younger voters.</p>
<p>And in a significant setback, he failed to secure a spot on the ballot in Michigan, which will hold its primary March 10 and will be a key battleground if the race is undecided after Super Tuesday, one week earlier. The Michigan Bureau of Elections concluded that Mr. Patrick had entered the race too late to be automatically included on the ballot and that efforts by his supporters to collect enough signatures had fallen short.</p>
<p>The departure of Mr. Patrick, who once served as assistant attorney general for civil rights, leaves just one person of color, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, running in a Democratic primary that began as the most diverse in history.</p>
<p>Mr. Patrick began his campaign Nov. 14, reversing his decision a year earlier not to run. By the time he entered, other candidates had a huge head start. Four debates had already passed.</p>
<p>He cast himself as the candidate best suited to unite moderates and progressives amid worries that none of the contenders already in the field would be able to build a coalition capable of defeating President Donald Trump. His stump speeches drew from his compelling life story — he grew up in poverty on Chicago’s South Side before ascending to the upper echelons of business and politics.</p>
<p>But Mr. Patrick also came to the campaign with some potential baggage, given a growing progressive movement in the Democratic Party that is deeply suspicious of big business. His career included positions as corporate counsel at Texaco and, more recently, as a managing director at Bain Capital, a private equity firm.</p>
<p>And, unlike Michael Bloomberg, the billionaire former mayor of New York City who was also a latecomer to the race, Mr. Patrick did not have enough of a personal fortune to finance his own campaign. There was also little evidence that he had a donor base large enough to make up for months of lost fundraising.</p>
<p>In his message to supporters Wednesday, Mr. Patrick expressed irritation at the focus on the timing of his campaign.</p>
<p>“Many in the media have noted that I entered the race ‘late,’” he said. “As a direct and limiting consequence, I’ve met many people on the campaign trail who lament how they wished I had entered the race sooner. As I hope you know, I entered this race when I could, and not a moment before I should have. More importantly, I entered the race months before anyone had cast a vote.”</p>
