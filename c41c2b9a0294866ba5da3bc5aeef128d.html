<h1>Pennsylvania's new mask rules should have no effect on Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Pirates take the field Friday for their first official summer camp workouts at PNC Park, manager Derek Shelton doesn’t expect to see his players taking grounders or fielding fly balls while wearing a mask.</p>
<p>Before Wednesday, that much was obvious. Major League Baseball players, coaches and team personnel must wear masks at the ballpark, per the 2020 Operations Manual, but there’s an exception when players are on the field, in the dugout, in the bullpen or engaged in “strenuous activities.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem that the Wolf administration’s move Wednesday to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/01/pa-masks-required-anyone-who-leaves-home-covid-19-cases-increase-pennsylvania/stories/202007010145" target="_blank">require all Pennsylvanians to wear a mask</a> when leaving the house will have any effect on the Pirates or the Phillies, as they’re playing by a different set of rules.</p>
<p>Over 100 pages of them, in fact, which is the length of the onerous Operations Manual that includes plans for every-other-day testing, sanitizing procedures and literally hundreds of ways intended to keep people safe.</p>
<p>All of that was mutually agreed upon by MLB and its teams, the MLB Players Association and government officials, and nothing that transpired Wednesday undoes any of the protocols that were previously in place.</p>
<p>“We’re abiding by Major League Baseball’s protocols, and really, that would probably be the only answer I have,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said on a Zoom call with local reporters when asked whether Gov. Wolf’s mandate would affect the club in any way. “Whatever Major League Baseball says we have to do, we’re going to do.”</p>
<p>Of the four major North American professional team sports, baseball is most conducive to adhering to social distancing guidelines. However, it’s not exactly perfect.</p>
<p>The catcher and the umpire come within six feet of one another, and the batter’s box is within six feet of them. There may be a close play at second base. Perhaps two outfielders converge on a ball.</p>
<p>But MLB also has more stringent testing policies than normal Pennsylvanians, thus why the rules are different when comparing regular people going for a run to the Pirates taking the field.</p>
<p>There is the outside chance that Pennsylvania could slide back into the yellow phase — where gatherings of 25 or more are prohibited — of Gov. Wolf’s previous reopening plan, although the state health department has maintained that there currently are no plans to do that.</p>
<p>Shelton said the Pirates aren’t worried about that and will continue following MLB’s current health and safety protocols.</p>
<p>“I think if that was a situation that happened, we would cross that bridge,” Shelton said. “But everything that we’re mandated by and we’re following is coming from Major League Baseball, in all respects to COVID stuff.”</p>
<p><strong>Who’s on third?</strong></p>
<p>Don’t write Ke’Bryan Hayes on your opening day lineup card just yet. It still looks like it’s Colin Moran’s job.</p>
<p>Although Hayes is the Pirates’ top position player prospect, from the sound of one of Shelton’s answers, it doesn’t not look like they’re ready to turn over the full-time third-base job to him quite yet.</p>
<p>Hayes has won three consecutive Gold Gloves in the minors and plays major league-caliber defense, although his bat has lagged behind.</p>
<p>It looks like Shelton will start with Moran, see how things go, then potentially try to get Hayes into the mix as the situation dictates, assuming his bat comes along during summer camp.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s an open competition,” Shelton said. “I think you’re going to see Colin there a lot. I think you’re going to see other people there. Colin could bounce over and play first if we decide to DH Josh [Bell] that day. But I think you’re going to see Colin there.</p>
<p>“That’s probably a place we have a lot of people to bounce. Colin could DH on days we decide that best fits our lineup. With ‘Key,’ he had a really good spring. We realize there are things to do development-wise, and we have to continue to work through those things.”</p>
<p><strong>‘A little creative’</strong></p>
<p>Shelton has a pretty good idea on his top four starting pitchers: Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams, Mitch Keller and Derek Holland.</p>
<p>The fifth? That could be interesting.</p>
<p>Steven Brault may wind up being the guy if he pitches like he did during large chunks of last season. Or Chad Kuhl, who’s recovering from Tommy John surgery, could emerge.</p>
<p>The Pirates may also employ an opener, something they did a handful of times last season, achieving middling results while cobbling together innings with their bullpen.</p>
<p>Shelton isn’t about to tip his hand on this, but he did promise that the fifth starter spot might be somewhat experimental, at least to start.</p>
<p>“It gives us the opportunity to be extremely creative because I think we have a very good idea of who the first four guys are going to be, again depending on health,” Shelton said. “And then after that, I think you’re going to see us get a little creative with that last spot.”</p>
