<h1>Water main break closes portions of Becks Run Road</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police have shut down Becks Run Road, between Wagner Street and East Carson Street, due to a water main break Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The break happened shortly before 2:30 a.m. on Wagner Street near the intersection of Mountain Avenue in the St. Clair neighborhood of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Water could be seen shooting out of the water main "like a geyser," police said, and spilling onto the road.</p>
<p>It was unclear when the road would reopen.</p>
<p>According to Pittsburgh Post-Gazette news partner KDKA, the water main break is about a half-mile from East Agnew Avenue, where a massive water main break occurred in September of last year.</p>
