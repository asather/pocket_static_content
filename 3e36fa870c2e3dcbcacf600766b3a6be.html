<h1>Paul Zeise: Zach Banner signing might be the Steelers' most underrated move</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers made a flurry of moves last week, and many of them grabbed headlines for obvious reasons. It was the Steelers, and that always grabs headlines, but the NFL is dominating the sports news cycle since it is the only major professional league currently operating as (mostly) normal and generating fresh news.</p>
<p>Eric Ebron was the biggest move, but those smaller, under-the-radar type moves&nbsp;are usually just as important as the larger, more high profile ones. Teams that win championships win with depth, role players and younger players who develop into starters.</p>
<p>That’s why I think one of the most underrated moves the Steelers made last week was to re-sign tackle Zach Banner. His&nbsp;deal is for one year and will cost the Steelers $1.75 million. With it, they enhance their tackle depth and give themselves some flexibility as they build their post-Ramon Foster offensive line.</p>
<p>Banner became a bit of a folk hero last season because he was a part of the Steelers’&nbsp;“jumbo package”. He was probably better known to many fans as&nbsp;“No. 72” because he would be announced as&nbsp;“No. 72 is reporting as eligible” at Heinz Field. That was met with loud cheers and ovations, and his legend grew each week.</p>
<p>The thing that might’ve been missed, though, is the reason why he was a good player for that role: his athleticism. Banner has good feet, he’s athletic (though maybe not athletic enough to be a fullback according to Mike Tomlin) and he definitely has size (6 foot 8, 360 pounds). He has a chance to be an excellent tackle if he keeps working at it.</p>
<p>The Steelers basically gambled that Banner will be a player that gives them an option at tackle. And they did it for almost no money. Banner, in signing the one-year deal, is&nbsp;“betting on himself,” which means the Steelers will be getting a highly motivated player who is playing for his next contract.</p>
<p>Alejandro Villenueva will be the left tackle, but the right tackle spot could be an interesting battle.</p>
<p>The Steelers could opt to move Matt Feiler to Foster’s vacant left guard spot. He would likely have to battle newcomer Stefen Wisniewski for the starting job, and that would leave Banner, 26, and 22-year-old Chuks Okorafor to battle for the right tackle spot.</p>
<p>Linemen who have position flexibility are extremely valuable as it gives the coaching staff the ability to figure out the best combination of players and get the five best lineman on the field at all times.</p>
<p>The Steelers offensive line needs a boost from last season as the unit, overall, wasn’t great. The addition of a fullback (Derek Watt) and Ebron suggests the coaching staff is going to take some steps to bolster the running game.</p>
<p>That’s where Banner comes in, as run blocking is what he clearly does well. He will obviously have to prove he can do it on a consistent basis and handle all the things in terms of protection that are thrown at tackles. That’s what training camp is for.</p>
<p>If Banner can prove he can be an every down starting tackle, he should become a fixture on the Steelers’ line for many years to come.&nbsp;</p>
