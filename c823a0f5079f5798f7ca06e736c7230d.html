<p>Thinking outside the box has rarely been so literal, or so challenging, as when it comes to sending “She Kills Monsters” into “Virtual Realms,” the 2020 incarnation of Qui Ngyuen’s popular fantasy-adventure play.</p>
<p>For the University of Pittsburgh, there was a will, and no there’s a way.</p>
<p>When Theatre Arts Department head Annmarie Dugan heard that the playwright had translated his play, she jumped at the chance to send Pitt’s UP Stages back into the realm of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>
<p>The call came to Ricardo Vila-Roger and Kelly Trumbell, who previously co-directed Pitt’s stage version in 2018 and ‘19 at two different venues -- as school was ending, seniors were figuring out next steps and COVID-19 continued to play havoc with theatermakers everywhere.</p>
<p>“When Annmarie, our department chair, got word of this play's existence,” recalled Trumbell, “she immediately reached out to Ricardo and she was like, “I know it's your summer vacation …’”</p>
<p>It turned out that returning to “She Kills Monsters,” as the second university performance of “Virtual Realms,” was an offer Vila-Roger and Trumbell could not refuse.</p>
<p>Now Pitt student actors and designers are back to slaying dragons, this time with a livestream of the play about sisters, grief, secrets unraveled and some fierce D&amp;D warriors.</p>
<p>“The school year ended so strangely and abruptly, and this is such a great way to all come together and to create something in a really strange time,” said Trumbull.</p>
<p>“Also,” said Vila-Roger,” because we were thinking that maybe the beginning of next season is going to start online, this gave us a really low stakes way for us to beat the learning curve.”</p>
<p>The directors have been particularly blown away by the work of the design students, using Skype and another program to create out-of-this world backdrops for the players, while adhering to the script.</p>
<p>The playwright is “very prescriptive about like, ‘A box opens with a narrator saying ... And then another box pops up,’ " Vila-Roger said.</p>
<p>Within that framework, “They've come up with an entire design, so it's not just a bunch of people in floating squares and a black background. It's going to be a lot more involved.”</p>
<p>Pitt performed the coming-of-age salute to geek culture in 2018 to such a receptive response, it moved Downtown -- for a one-night performance in 2019, at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, courtesy of the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Multiple Choice event.</p>
<p>Vila-Roger was starting previews to appear in the Pittsburgh Public Theater production of “Indecent” when the play had its Downtown performance.</p>
<p>Trumbull recalled that the move gave students the feeling of what it's like to be in a touring show, translating lighting, sound, design and performances to a different venue.</p>
<p>And then they came face to face with an audience packed with a fandom unlike anything she had seen before.</p>
<p>“Everybody who was there was a D&amp;D fan,” she recalled, “so they knew all these inside jokes. Performing it at Pitt was wonderful, because we're performing for our fellow students, families, friends, and the larger Pittsburgh theater scene. But when we moved Downtown, to be able to perform a show about Dungeons &amp; Dragons for people who live for Dungeons &amp; Dragons is just an amazing experience.</p>
<p>“She Kills Monsters” debuted off-Broadway in 2011 to positive reviews, with the New York Times review praising its use of D&amp;D as a “potent metaphor” in a “deceptively breezy and rather ingenious comedy.”</p>
<p>Since then, as noted by the Times Elisabeth Vincentelli in a July 2 article, the play “has blossomed into one of America’s most popular shows, with 797 productions (performed and planned) between 2013 and next year. Of those … a whopping 652 were done on school and college campuses.”</p>
<p>After Pitt's upcoming online production was mentioned in that Times article, more than 530 people signed up to tune in to the free livestream at 7:30 p.m Sunday. The show will then be available to stream until July 26.</p>
<p>“She Kills Monsters” has made its way into popular culture for some of the same reasons that “Frozen” was such a phenomenon for Disney, but it goes beyond its focus on sisters and female characters. It is about loss, connection and identity ...&nbsp;“so many other things that are very common in college and high school, for everyone,” Trumbull said. “I think that's what makes it so universal and also so malleable.</p>
<p>“Qui Nguyen's been rewriting this script for years now,” she continued, “and it just keeps getting better and better. He's really able to hone in on the present moment and what's important. I feel like, when we performed this play two years ago at Pitt, it meant something different to me than it does now.”</p>
<p>“She Kills Monsters” starts with grieving Agnes (Julia Kreutzer) discovering the Dungeons &amp; Dragons journal of her younger sister, Tilly (Ariana Starkman), who at 15 has been killed in a car accident. Straitlaced Agnes, a recent college grad and a teacher at Tilly’s school, learns she knew little about her sister.</p>
<p>Agnes seeks a connection through Tilly’s D&amp;D world, and enlists the help of a “dungeon master,” Chuck (Dennis Sen). The older sister finds Tilly has escaped bullying and sought self-discovery in a fantasy world of supermodel elves, dominatrix warrior women and nasty ogres.</p>
<p>The D&amp;D fans at the August Wilson Center got every nuance, and they were loving it.</p>
<p>“I've honestly never experienced an audience like that in my life. I don't know if the students will ever experience an audience like that in this life again. Because it was just such a perfect night. It was really great,” Trumbull said.</p>
<p>And for their next trick, they and their student cast and creative team have to reinvent the wheel of how “She Kills Monsters” will come to a new audience, in the new age of livestreamed performance.</p>
<p>“Every time Ricardo and I go to a production meeting, we're like, ‘Oh my god! How are you doing this?’” Trumbull said before a Sunday rehearsal.</p>
<p>Some of cast members are returning and some are new to the show, but all are new to performing for a digital platform.</p>
<p>“One of the fun things about rehearsals, they're all like, ‘We're nervous,’ and we're like, ‘Oh, we're nervous too. We've never done this before. Let's explore it together.’ Then, I think that has helped take some of the fear out for them,” Vila-Roger said.</p>
<p>And now they are armed with creativity and ready to slay that theatrical dragon of 2020, the livestream performance.</p>
<p>“She Kills Monsters” goes live at 7:30 p.m. Sunday.
