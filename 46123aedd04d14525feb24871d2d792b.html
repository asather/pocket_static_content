<h1>Dan McCarthy takes one-shot lead at Frank B. Fuhrer Invitational</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dan McCarthy caught a late flight Sunday night from Utah, landed in Detroit at 11 p.m. and drove five hours to Pittsburgh, arriving at his hotel at 3:30 p.m. He got two hours of sleep before heading to the Pittsburgh Field Club for his 8:40 a.m. tee time in the Frank B. Fuhrer Invitational.</p>
<p>For McCarthy, a member of the PGA Tour’s Korn Ferry Tour, that was a good travel schedule.</p>
<p>At least he didn’t have to drive from Kansas.</p>
<p>“I had my clubs and all my clothes,” McCarthy said. “That was good.”</p>
<p>Traveling to Western Pennsylvania to play in the $200,000 three-day tournament has been an adventure out of “Space Jam” the previous two years for McCarthy. But he didn’t let it bother him in 2018, when he won the $40,000 first prize with borrowed clubs and WalMart-bought clothes after his flights were rerouted. It didn’t bother him last year he made his tee time and contended after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/golf/2019/06/25/frank-b-fuhrer-invitational-2019-dan-mccarthy-david-bradshaw-pittsburgh/stories/201906250150" target="_blank">driving 15 hours from Kansas</a> because of cancelled flights.</p>
<p>And it didn’t let it bother him Monday, either, when he followed an opening 68 with a 64 in the afternoon to shoot 8-under 132 and take the 36-hole lead.</p>
<p>“It was a relatively calm trip,” McCarthy said.</p>
<p>McCarthy holds a one-shot lead on Irwin native and mini-tour player Dan Obremski (67-66-133) and four shots on defending champ Michael Gligic (71-65), a PGA Tour member who stopped here before heading to the tour’s Rocket Mortgage Classic in Detroit.</p>
<p>Gligic went to the Detroit Golf Club last weekend to play a couple practice rounds, just so he could come to the Field Club and try to win the $40,000 first prize and pay homage to the tournament host.</p>
<p>“I’ve been coming for six years, when Mr. Fuhrer gave me a chance back then, and I’ll keep coming as long as he’ll have me,” said Gligic, who earned a battlefield promotion to the PGA Tour after finishing in the top 25 on the Korn Ferry Tour in 2019.</p>
<p>Former PGA Tour player <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/golf/2020/06/27/Steve-Wheatcroft-pga-tour-korn-ferry-tour/stories/202006270017" target="_blank">Steve Wheatcroft</a>, a two-time winner on the Web.com (now Korn Ferry) Tour who lost in an eight-hole playoff to Gligic last year, shot 71-73—144.</p>
<p>Riley Wheeldon, a native of British Columbia, Canada, who played collegiately at Louisville, is a member of PGA Tour Canada (McKenzie Tour), but that tour has been canceled this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. None of that tournament rust, though, showed up in the first round when he eagled two of the three par-5s and shot 65 to take the first-round lead. He is tied with Gligic at 136.</p>
<p>Former three-time tournament champ David Bradshaw, who injured his ACL and meniscus in a skiing accident in the spring, shot 64 in the afternoon and is alone at 137.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to fight through it,” Bradshaw said. “It hurts when I walk down hills.”</p>
