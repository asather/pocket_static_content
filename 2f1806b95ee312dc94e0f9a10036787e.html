<h1>UPMC, county sued in lawsuit over drug testing of new mothers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County woman is suing UPMC and Allegheny County in Common Pleas Court, alleging in a seven-count civil lawsuit that the Pittsburgh-based health care giant screened her for illegal drug use without her knowledge, then passed questionable test results along to child protection authorities for investigation.</p>
<p>Cherell Harrington, who delivered her son at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital in 2017, claims that UPMC gave her medical information to Allegheny County Children, Youth and Families, which opened a child abuse investigation, resulting Ms. Harrington being targeted with “highly intrusive, humiliating and coercive child abuse allegations,” according to the lawsuit.</p>
<p>She was&nbsp;“subjected to multiple home inspections” by county officials and her child’s medical and dental records were reviewed as part of the probe.</p>
<p>This is the second such lawsuit filed against UPMC since 2014, and one of a handful of legal actions or ethical complaints filed around the country over false positives on quick screening urine drug tests that triggered child abuse investigations and turned the joy of giving birth into a nightmare of custody concerns.</p>
<p>Laws on testing new mothers and infants for drugs vary across the country, with a few states criminalizing positive results and more than a dozen others classifying positive results as a form of child abuse.</p>
<p>Lawsuits or ethical complaints have been filed in New York, California, Alabama, Maryland and a handful of other states over the last decade after mothers say they received unconfirmed or false positive results from eating poppy seed bagels or salad dressing, taking doctor-approved Valium and using prescribed asthma inhalers.</p>
<p>The Child Protective Services Law requires police officers, teachers, clergy and others to report suspected cases of child abuse, said Margaret S. Coleman, the lawyer representing Ms. Harrington along with the ACLU of Pennsylvania. But reporting maternal drug abuse to the authorities is limited to instances where the child is harmed or affected in some way.</p>
<p>Ms. Harrington’s urine drug test results were “unconfirmed positive” while a second drug test was negative, the lawsuit said. Her newborn&nbsp;had no signs of maternal drug use.</p>
<p>UPMC officials were not available for comment on Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>A drug test for a second Allegheny County woman, Deserae Cook, who delivered her daughter at UPMC Mercy Hospital in 2018, came back clear, but she told hospital authorities that she’d used marijuana before becoming pregnant, according to the lawsuit, which describes Ms. Cook as a putative member of a plaintiff class in the case against UPMC.</p>
<p>Her admission spurred a referral to CYF authorities, which resulted in a child abuse investigation that included inspections of her home, review of her children’s medical records, health insurance and doctor’s visits. The basis of the probe by county authorities was prompted by admitting that she had used marijuana.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Ms. Harrington is seeking unspecified compensatory damages, legal fees and reimbursement for related costs for breach of physician-patient confidentiality, privacy violations and other claims.</p>
<p>Ms. Coleman, from the Law Office of Timothy P. O’Brien, Downtown, is seeking class-action designation of the lawsuit to represent other mothers who had similar experiences at UPMC hospitals after March 11, 2018.</p>
