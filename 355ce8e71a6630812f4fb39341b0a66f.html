<h1>Ross board of commissioners appoints Democrat to take the seat of Republican </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The chair of the Ross Democratic Committee will replace the only Republican on the township’s board of commissioners.</p>
<p>Frances Salachup was appointed by an 8-0 vote Monday to replace Jeremy Shaffer, who resigned because he moved to Pine.</p>
<p>Four residents had applied for the position and were interviewed last month, but two dropped out, leaving Mrs. Salachup and Republican Matt Drozd.</p>
<p>Approximately 30 members of the North Hills Republican Committee held a peaceful demonstration in front of the Ross municipal building before the commission meeting, asking commissioners to instead appoint Mr. Drozd.</p>
<p>Although the demonstration was held at the municipal building, the meeting itself was virtual with all commissioners and staff in their homes.</p>
<p>“A group of citizens, including myself, do feel that the votes from Ward 8 were cast for someone that would represent certain principles and certain values,” said David Barkovich, who spoke for the North Hills Republicans before and during the meeting. “A Republican was voted overwhelmingly into that seat.”</p>
<p>He added having both parties represented on the commission will provide “a variety of viewpoints.”</p>
<p>“So many books on leadership and organizational management all say that you do not want to have a bunch of people who all agree to you,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Barkovich said the Allegheny County Council and many municipalities, such as neighboring McCandless, fill vacancies with someone from the same party as the person who resigned.</p>
<p>Mr. Shaffer was originally elected in 2013 and was re-elected in 2017.</p>
<p>“The ward voted. They wanted a Republican candidate,” Pamela Horne said during the meeting. “It’s what the people wanted. And I think it is fair to represent both sides.”</p>
<p>Patrick Hodge noted Mr. Drozd previously represented Ross on the Allegheny County Council. “He understands every aspect. I wish to have more diversity with the candidates, and I wish to add more experience with a candidate that has years and years of service in Ross Township.”</p>
<p>But commission President Steve Korbel said Ross residents vote for the person, not the party.</p>
<p>“The people do not vote for a Republican or a Democrat or a Libertarian when they vote for commissioner. They vote for a candidate. If you are a good candidate, you win, regardless of your party,” he said. “There isn’t a Republican or a Democrat way to pave our streets, to plow the snow. … We need someone who is dedicated to our community and has been dedicated to our community for a very long time.”</p>
<p>He added he was “dismayed at the attempt to over-politicize this. This isn’t Washington, D.C. This isn’t Harrisburg.”</p>
<p>Mr. Korbel, as well as commissioners Jack Betkowski, Daniel DeMarco, Joseph Laslavic, William McKellar, Patrick Mullin, Jason Pirring and Sarah Poweska, voted to appoint Mrs. Salachup. She was then sworn in at her home by District Judge Richard Opiela.</p>
<p>In a related move, commissioners voted 7-1 to appoint Samantha Cascone to the vacancy board to replace Walter Salachup, Mrs. Salachup’s husband, who died Feb. 3 and was re-appointed after his death. At the time, commissioners said the reappointment, which had been in the works before he died, was to honor Mr. Salachup’s service to the township. The vacancy board is a little-used group that meets if there is a vacancy on the board of commissioners and the commissioners cannot agree on a candidate.</p>
<p>Mr. Korbel abstained on the vacancy board appointment because Ms. Cascone is his sister-in-law.</p>
<p>In other business, the board unanimously approved the transfer of a liquor license from Cheswick for Ocean Treasures, a seafood restaurant that will be in North Hills Village.</p>
<p>Commissioners also agreed to have one meeting next month, on Aug. 17.</p>
