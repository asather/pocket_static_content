<h1>ACC commissioner John Swofford tries to answer college football's big questions amid pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>John Swofford spent an hour Thursday afternoon answering — or at least attempting to answer — questions dealing with college athletics' albatross: COVID-19 and what the next five months will look like. On a virtual call with reporters, the ACC commissioner fielded inquiries on pretty much every issue that faces football, specifically, in a truly unprecedented time.</p>
<p>The final question of the afternoon, fittingly, looked just beyond the current pandemic: What happens if there's a second wave? What if COVID-19 happens <em>again</em>?</p>
<p>Swofford let out a half smile before opining in his North Carolina drawl.</p>
<p>“Sometimes I feel like right now all we deal with is hypotheticals. And that's a tough world to live in because of the inability to narrow those potential paths that we go down to only a few. Right now, there are well beyond a few,” Swofford said before seemingly wrapping his answer. An ACC spokesperson started to conclude the call before Swofford politely interjected and continued.</p>
<p>“There just aren't a lot of answers at this point in time,” he added. “... I've been in this a long time. And intercollegiate athletics has never been in a more challenging situation in my career than it's in now.”</p>
<p>That was the tenor of Thursday's talk. Uncertainty. Complication. One question leading to two more.</p>
<p>As a Power Five commissioner, he's one of a select few ultimate decision-makers in college sports, and even Swofford doesn't know what the first week of September will look like.</p>
<p>Still, until any concrete roadblocks emerge to dissuade it, the ACC is moving forward with the “anticipation” of playing football in the fall, with a minimum six weeks of practice time to prepare for the upcoming campaign. That would put a return to campus for players and coaches in mid-July. Swofford said all the conference institutions, including Pitt, “intend to open in various fashions” to make a return to the field feasible.</p>
<p>That could change, Swofford admitted. But that's how the conference is operating while developing contingency plans B, C, D and E just in case.</p>
<p>To that end, three COVID-specific questions highlighted Swofford's conference call.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of seasons are being considered?</strong></p>
<p>At the ACC virtual meetings this week, Swofford said a base budget was approved to work from as different scenarios come into play. Those scenarios include a “relatively normal” fall football season; an abbreviated season; not playing football and only playing basketball; and not playing sports altogether.</p>
<p>Swofford expects neither the third nor the fourth options to occur. And if it's an abbreviated season, a conference-only slate would be an option.</p>
<p>Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke said Tuesday night on a Facebook Live event that the ACC member institutions have come together and determined that conference play is their “priority” if a shortened season is required. Swofford did not necessarily reiterate Lyke's message, but he didn't deny that reality, either.</p>
<p>“I know it's part of our discussions,” Swofford said of a conference-only schedule. “But that's only one of multiple paths that this could take.”</p>
<p>Swofford added that Notre Dame's existing relationship with the ACC would&nbsp;“come into play” in that conference-only scenario. The Fighting Irish play six football games per season against ACC foes and are scheduled to play Pitt on Oct. 17 at Heinz Field.</p>
<p><strong>What if every team isn't cleared to play?</strong></p>
<p>The ACC is a conference featuring schools from Boston College all the way down the East Coast to Miami. Including Notre Dame, the conference spans 10 states. That could make it difficult to start a season with every program good to go.</p>
<p>“The states have a great deal to say whether games can be played and under what circumstances,” Swofford said. “The hope is that all 15 schools, counting Notre Dame, can be on the same page. But there are a lot of decision-makers in this beyond us in athletics. So it's complicated, but appropriately so.”</p>
<p>Swofford said the conference will have to wait and see how state government officials, medical experts and university presidents alike handle their unique, local situations. But if a few schools are not given the green light, the ACC won't rule out continuing a football season with fewer than its full 15 participants.</p>
<p>Swofford said he and the ACC athletic directors have not discussed that topic specifically, though he imagines they will. No threshold — whether it's three-fourths of the teams or two-thirds or half — has been decided upon. But he's open to the possibility, even in this “premature” stage.</p>
<p>“I don't think some schools not being able to compete necessarily keeps the majority who could compete from competing,” Swofford said.</p>
<p><strong>Do students need to be on campus to begin football activities?</strong></p>
<p>On a mid-April conference call with Vice President Mike Pence, the Power Five conference commissioners, including Swofford, reportedly made it clear that there will be no college football without regular students on campus.</p>
<p>Swofford supported that thought, saying that it seemed "foreign" to have practices and games going on without an accompanying student body.</p>
<p>“Most people I talk with in college athletics and higher education agree that's a foreign thought,” he added.</p>
<p>However, the commissioner was not against the idea of football players being the first students to return to campus.</p>
<p>“It's not that out of the ordinary. We've been bringing players to campus before the fall semester started for regular students for preseason camp forever. And so that wouldn't be terribly different,” Swofford said. “What would be different in today's world is if they were back and there was no summer school going on.</p>
<p>“But I don't think we'd be bringing any student-athletes back without an anticipation and expectation that the institution would be opening, however that institution defines opening, in the fall.”</p>
<p>Note the phrase “however that institution defines opening.”</p>
<p>Theoretically, universities might not have to be at full student-body capacity to get football players in the practice facility and on the field.</p>
<p><strong>NIL thoughts</strong></p>
<p>In addition to COVID-19 concerns, Swofford said the primary topic of conversation at the ACC's spring meetings was name, image and likeness (NIL) changes.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, the NCAA's board of governors announced recommended rule changes, allowing athletes to cash in on their NIL with third-party endorsements and other opportunities.</p>
<p>Swofford believes NIL has “a place in college athletics,” but said there's “great concern” that updated rules and their implementation might create more problems than they solve.</p>
<p>“There's a lot of focus in our discussions right now on the compliance aspect of it, on keeping inappropriate people out of the recruiting process,”&nbsp;the commissioner said. “We already have issues and problems with that, as we all know. We don't want to make that worse. It's about trying to find the right sweet spot that appropriately opens the NIL jar to our student-athletes without undermining the basics of the collegiate model and its place in higher education. That's really, really challenging.”</p>
<p>On the topic of group licensing, which is not supported in the NCAA's new NIL suggestions, Swofford concurred with the board of governors.</p>
<p>“Group licensing has some issues in terms of college athletics, as I understand it from our legal counsel,” Swofford added. “It relates to an employee-employer relationship. Some states have right-to-work laws and prohibit unions and other states don't. To unionize, you'd need to collectively bargain. And that doesn't apply to intercollegiate athletics. So that gets to be a pretty complicated issue.”</p>
<p>Sorry, “NCAA Football” video game hopefuls.</p>
