<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>British Grand Prix organizers say they are talking to the government about the viability of holding the Formula One race on July 19 with no fans amid the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The season was due to begin in March but no races have been possible so far.</p>
<p>Silverstone circuit managing director Stuart Pringle wrote an email to ticket buyers saying he is “extremely disappointed to tell you that we are unable to stage this year’s British Grand Prix in front of the fans.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pringle says organizers left the decision for as long as possible “but it is abundantly clear given the current conditions ... that a Grand Prix under normal conditions is just not going to be possible.“</p>
