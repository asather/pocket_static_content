<h1>For WQED chief engineer Paul Byers, 50 years included life in 'Mister Rogers' Neighborhood'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Paul Byers wanted to be a professional basketball player. That didn’t pan out, but the sport helped him begin a career with WQED Multimedia that tops the 50-year mark July 7.</p>
<p>“Basketball wasn’t in the cards, although I was pretty good,” said Mr. Byers, who has been the company’s chief engineer for the past 24 years. “But it’s a funny story how that kind of leads into how I got to work here at WQED.”</p>
<p>When he was a student at the University of Pittsburgh, he had a cousin who was married to Joe Colaizzi, the first director of a little show called “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”</p>
<p>“I asked him, ‘could you help get me a job?’ and he said, ‘yeah,’ because I think he knew I was a good basketball player.”</p>
<p>At the time, there was a heated in-house rivalry between the production and engineering staffs.</p>
<p>“Joe was kind of captain of the production team and he wanted me to play [for him], but ironically I ended up in the engineering department,” said Mr. Byers, a local kid who graduated from Edgewood High School and now lives in Hampton Township.</p>
<p>In college, he worked weekend shifts. His position now has him overseeing all of the company’s technical operations for television, radio and web. His duties also include the workings of WQEJ-FM in Johnstown, which simulcasts the Pittsburgh radio programming.</p>
<p>“Paul is literally the glue that holds WQED broadcast operations together,” said WQED Multimedia president and CEO Deb Acklin.</p>
<p>“I like to know how things work,” Mr. Byers said. “So the technology has always fascinated me, and the changes over 50 years? It’s just unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Recalling his duties back in the early 1970s, he noted, “there was no cable or satellite television, WQED-FM was not yet on the air, and editing was done on 2-inch videotape by cutting it with a razor blade and splicing it back together.”</p>
<p>Field footage was shot on 16 mm film with a separate magnetic soundtrack. The 1980s were a boom time for big advances, including the use of videotape.</p>
<p>Later, WQED became the first Pittsburgh market station to produce high-definition broadcasts in-studio.</p>
<p>Outside of the studio, Mr. Byers has served on the PBS Engineering Advisory Committee and was chairman of state and regional groups.</p>
<p>Looking back over his career, which included time on the production crew for “Neighborhood,” Mr. Byers collected any number of fond, yet odd, stories. One of his favorites, he said, is “the elevator story.”</p>
<p>The elevator at WQED Multimedia on Fifth Avenue in Oakland was designed to carry freight as well as people. It’s not the speediest — “even though it only has to go from the ground to the third floor, I think it takes about five minutes.”</p>
<p>One day in the early 1970s, he, Fred Rogers and a few others stepped into the car. At the front was Michael Douglas, a young man who worked the floor crew for the show and would later go on to movie fame as Michael Keaton.</p>
<p>“Keaton was at the front, pushing the button for the floors people wanted and Fred was standing at the back,” Mr. Byers said.</p>
<p>“Michael was always a practical joker, and when the elevator started up, he turns off the light as the doors close, and it’s pitch-black. There is this moment of silence where nobody is sure what the heck is going on.</p>
<p>“And from the back of the elevator comes Fred’s voice. But it’s not Fred, it’s Henrietta Pussycat and he says ‘Meow, meow. Scared.’</p>
<p>“And everybody cracked up.”</p>
<p>Although WQED has reduced staff over the years — in 1983 there were 46 full-time members of the engineering staff with the PBS station producing many shows and being involved in a host of national productions, while today there are four — the work is still the same. Mr. Byers and his crew adapt to meet new challenges while dealing with the old ones that never seem to go away.</p>
<p>On a Sunday night near the end of March, a power failure brought down the WQED broadcast signal. Mr. Byers drove over to the station, and — alone with a flashlight on the darkened ground floor — figured out that the transfer between Duquesne Light and the emergency generator had failed.</p>
<p>It took him a few hours to get things up and running again, just in time for PBS’s evening programming.</p>
<p>“It was some sort of season premiere, I can’t remember what show, but I think I got us up at a quarter to eight and it was just, ‘whew!’ We just avoided all kinds of nasty calls,” he said, laughing.</p>
<p>For someone who hasn’t taken a sick day since 1980 (and that was when he was hospitalized after a bike crash), Mr. Byers, 70, said he can’t say when he’ll retire. The over-the-air broadcast industry is laying the groundwork for a major transition: ATSC3, or “Next Gen TV,” and of course he wants to help usher it in.</p>
<p>After that, should the COVID-19 pandemic ease, he hopes to travel with his wife, Mary Ellen. “We love to travel, but of course that’s been interrupted.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, there is always the work.</p>
<p>“George [Hazimanolis, WQED’s director of corporate communications] told me we could have a really big celebration for my 75th anniversary. So we’ll see… Who knows? Maybe I will go for 60.”</p>
