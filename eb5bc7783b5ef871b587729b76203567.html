<h1>Wigle Whiskey opens its expanded distillery and new restaurant Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wigle Whiskey on Friday will open its doubled distillery space in the Strip District, with a new front tasting room just for guests to sit and drink as well as a Repeal Room restaurant, where they can eat food from a new open kitchen they’ll pass as they enter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restaurant’s executive chef, Dan Okren, most recently worked as sous chef at Eleven and before that, at Casbah and Superior Motors, with a year-long stint in between distilling at Wigle. He says he’s looking forward to marrying the cuisine with craft spirits.&nbsp;“It’s always going to be about the booze.”</p>
<p>Hence the pulled pork braised in cider from sister business Threadbare Cider. Also on the sandwich: Bourbon-braised kale. There’s also bourbon honey snap peas and rye and wheat berry grain salads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The restaurant menu, which will start next week and gradually grow to about 16 items, will consist of “relatable” but elevated bar fare including a classic burger and beer-battered fish and chips. He and Lauren Bellotti also will supply the tasting room with an array of bar snacks, such as almonds tossed in gin spices and Mr. Okren’s favorite, chickpeas.</p>
<p>That new space is decorated with what Wigle describes as “interactive and Instagrammable vignettes” and a timeline that tell the story of Pittsburgh whiskey going back to&nbsp;the Whiskey Rebellion, just after the country was born after the Revolutionary War.&nbsp;That museum aspect was something that Wigle had wanted to do when it opened in 2011.</p>
<p>The dining room bar is staged as Mellon Pharmacy, based on how Andrew Mellon, when he was U.S. Treasury secretary, granted a distillery he previously co-owned a license to continue selling “medicinal” whiskey during Prohibition. It’s decorated with local pharmacy antiques, including actual period whiskey prescriptions,&nbsp;as well as faux bottles with whimsical labels such as Red Eye, Rot-Gut and Revenue Juice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The hall to the dining room is decorated with a timeline of regional booze history, including McKeesport bartender Kate Hester’s 1891 coining of the phrase&nbsp;“speakeasy.” Between the dining room and the tasting room are large vignettes dedicated to whiskey rebel-creating Alexander Hamilton made with a pile of faux $10 bills and a neon-lit homage to Henry Clay Frick, who was born across the street from Mellon’s distillery in West Overton.</p>
<p>“We’ve been telling these stories for almost 10 years now,” says co-owner Meredith Meyer Grelli. She says they’ll tell them even better with the former tasting room being walled off from the production space so it can be the dedicated starting and ending points for the distillery’s popular tour program, which now will kick off with a video. And that room will be air conditioned, a plus for visitors in the warmer months, when Wigle expects to host more tourists as a stop on the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/07/08/Whiskey-Rebellion-Trail-Pittsburgh-museums-distilleries-Pennsylvania-rye-Wigle/stories/201905240001?cid=search" target="_blank">Whiskey Rebellion Trail</a> that it helped launch last summer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wigle has been working on the expansion for about a year, having decided at the start of 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/01/25/Wigle-Whiskey-distillery-Smallman-Street-Strip-District-buys-buildings-expansion/stories/201901250072" target="_blank">to remain in the location where it started and also buy the three-story building next door</a>.</p>
<p>The original distillery space had quickly became too small, especially after Wigle’s owners successfully lobbied the state to allow distilleries to sample and sell spirits directly to consumers. Tour-goers had to squeeze through production areas, which had to be closed to do special events, and sometimes battle to find a seat or buy a bottle in the old tasting room. Now that Labeling Party Room can be rented for private events, too, and there’s a retail bottle shop in the new Tasting Room. Its design touches include a tiled bar and ceiling lights shaped like the small letter g in the Wigle name, but it’s all made by the two giant arched windows dating back to when it was part of a brewery.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It definitely feels closer to its intended use,” Ms. Grelli said as she gave a tour last week, crediting numerous artists and designers who contributed along with GBBN Architects’ Amanda Markovic and Melissa Dulisse. She said that the Tasting Room and dining room each can seat about 50 to 60.</p>
<p>The bar program will be managed by Adam Santichen, who most recently worked at Johnstown’s Press Bistro, and he, too, wants to mix in a lot of local history and color in drinks such as 1794, a whiskey sour made with Pennsylvania rye, lemon juice and two other nods to state specialties: maple syrup and mushroom powder. He’ll also offer four draft beers and a range of cider from Threadbare, which, like the Wigle Barrelhouse and Whiskey Garden, is in the North Side neighborhood of Spring Garden. Wigle also has tasting room/bottle shops at the Omni William Penn Hotel, Downtown, the Ross Park Mall and a restaurant bar at Greater Pittsburgh International Airport.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s definitely our most beautiful and creative space so far,” says Ms. Grelli of the new version of where it all began. “It’s very exciting to release it to the world.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She says Wigle is thrilled to be able to stay and stretch out in the Strip, but that neighborhood has changed a lot in the past decade as more of it has been redeveloped. During the renovation, workers stashed in one wall some bottles of Wigle’s Monongahela rye with the note:&nbsp;“To the unsinkable Pittsburghers of the future; those of the past send&nbsp;greetings.</p>
<p>“P.S. if you’re tearing down these walls to turn our beloved distillery&nbsp;into condos, hopefully we’re dead.”</p>
<p>Wigle scheduled a Tuesday morning ribbon-cutting and preview for journalists and elected officials of the new digs, which were completed with $1 million from the state&nbsp;Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Friday’s grand opening is from 6 to 9 p.m. and admission is by “passports” available for $35 at&nbsp;<a href="https://wiglewhiskey.com/events" target="_blank">https://wiglewhiskey.com/events</a>. Guests pick a start time — 6 or 7:30 p.m. — and will be able to visit the new Tasting Room for a&nbsp;“Mon”hattan cocktail with bar snacks, the Repeal Room and its Mellon Pharmacy bar for a&nbsp;“Bring Me a Shrubbery” mule cocktail and some kitchen previews and the Labeling Party Room for a Wigle bourbon flight with a bourbon-infused dessert.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After that, the full menu will be available 5-10 p.m. Wednesday-Friday, 11 a.m.-10 p.m. Saturday and 11 a.m.-9 p.m. Sunday. The restaurant will be closed Monday and Tuesday, but the kitchen’s snacks will be available in the Tasting Room, the hours of which remain the same:&nbsp;11 a.m.-9 p.m. Sunday-Tuesday and 11 a.m.-11 p.m. Wednesday-Saturday.</p>
<p>Wigle is located at 2401 Smallman St., Pittsburgh, Pa. 15222. For more information, visit <a href="https://wiglewhiskey.com/" target="_blank">wiglewhiskey.com</a>.</p>
