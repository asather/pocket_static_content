<h1>Allegheny alone among many Western Pa. counties concerned about in-person voting for primary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the executive of the state’s second-most populous county warns that in-person voting on June 2 would be a&nbsp;“disaster” plagued by staffing shortages and fear, officials managing elections in many of the more sparsely inhabited counties of Western Pennsylvania say they aren’t as concerned.</p>
<p>While Allegheny County has moved to send mail-in ballot applications to all of its registered voters, Mercer County remains in a&nbsp;“relatively fortunate position” — said elections director Jeff Greenburg, adding, “knock on wood” — and as of Thursday morning, has only come across one precinct of 90 total where no poll workers are willing to work.</p>
<p>While Allegheny’s Executive Rich Fitzgerald asks the governor to use his emergency powers to institute an all-mail election, the head of Lawrence County’s election board — noting that officials haven’t had a single precinct worker call in and say they can’t work the primary — warns instead that an all-mail election would strain their resources and budget.</p>

<p>And when Allegheny’s Board of Elections was voting Thursday to pass a resolution seeking even greater authority over consolidating polling places because of staff shortages, officials in Butler County — equipped with a spreadsheet showing that about three-fourths of its poll workers have committed to working — were instead researching spray cleaners, gloves, masks and sanitizers to help keep their polling places clean when the day comes.</p>
<p>Like officials in many of the other counties where the spread of COVID-19 has been less acute than in the Pittsburgh region, Leslie Osche, who chairs Butler’s Board of Commissioners and its elections board, said she isn’t concerned about the viability of in-person voting, and is actively recruiting poll workers to replace those who don’t feel safe working. For Butler, that’s only a quarter of its Election Day workforce — and only a few polling places haven’t yet confirmed to the county that they’re committed to opening for the primary.</p>
<p>Allegheny County, which has 1,323 polling place locations, has such a problem with staff shortages and site participation that it moved Thursday to officially ask the Pennsylvania Department of State to allow it to consolidate its polling places, without court approval, beyond the amount it was previously allowed. The county elections board’s resolution proposed one polling place for each of the county’s 129 municipalities — located, when possible, at municipal buildings — and one in each of the city of Pittsburgh’s nine council districts.</p>
<p>“Due to their fear of being exposed to the virus, many members of the local election boards have stated either that they will not serve or are reluctant to serve on Primary Election Day,” the resolution read. “Accordingly, there is a strong likelihood that many local polling districts will not have local election board members sufficient to properly conduct the June 2 Primary Election.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald had previously called on the governor to allow counties to send mail-in ballots — not just applications —&nbsp;to all voters.</p>
<p>Asked about the prospect of the governor calling for an all-mail election, Ms. Osche said,&nbsp;“Please don’t change it at this point,” indicating that it would put much of their recent work to waste and put a strain on their operations.</p>
<p>“You&nbsp;don’t just flip a switch,” Ms. Osche warned, insisting that the county likely wouldn’t have enough staff.</p>
<p>Mr. Greenburg, of Mercer County’s elections board, said the county sent notices to all 90 precinct boards, and of the 64 that replied, all but one indicated they’d be able to staff a full or near-full slate of poll workers — and of the polling places who have responded to their mailers all have indicated they will open for the election.</p>
<p>In the one location that doesn’t have adequate staffing, the county is scouting new locations that are proximate so voters don’t face a huge burden, Mr. Greenburg said.</p>
<p>Mercer has already received 3,500 mail-in and absentee ballot applications, more than four times the amount it had four years ago, Mr. Greenburg said.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>No significant concerns</strong></p>
<p>In Lawrence County, officials haven’t heard from a single polling worker who won’t work the primary, said Morgan Boyd, chairman of the county commissioners.</p>
<p>Mr. Boyd said he doesn’t have any significant concerns about in-person voting on June 2, but that if anything, he worries that consolidating precincts too much will make it so polling places are more densely packed across the county.</p>
<p>Lawrence County has seen a significant surge in mail-in ballots, Mr. Boyd said, but he doesn’t support an all-mail election. If that would happen, his county would be on the dime for ordering ballots for every voter, he fears.</p>
<p>“The amount of resources that would take, as well as significant restraints on the supply chain in respect to printing — we&nbsp;would be hard pressed to be able to prepare that in time for a June 2 primary,” Mr. Boyd said.</p>
<p>Mr. Boyd said he’s also concerned that polling places they’ve used historically — churches, schools and community buildings — will remain closed to the public.</p>
<p>Ms. Osche, too, said Butler County is waiting for clarification from the governor’s office about smaller sites like churches and fire halls and if they’ll be permitted to open.</p>
<p>Consolidating polling places, she said, will be something the elections board looks at next week. Ms. Osche said she anticipates having to move or consolidate a few sites.</p>
<p>Mike Belding, chairman of the Greene County Commissioners, said the&nbsp;county has already had “several seasoned, experienced” workers tell them they will not participate in June —&nbsp;adding to a problem it already had in staffing polling places. But the county hasn’t had any discussions on mailing all registered voters applications for mail-in ballots, he said.</p>
<p>If primary voter turn-out, mail-in and absentee voting numbers are “significantly lower than traditional voting numbers in the primary,” Mr. Belding said he’d favor sending all registered voters mail-in ballots for the November general.</p>
