<h1> World briefs: U.S. will OK virus aid in North Korea </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The United States said it would approve humanitarian assistance to North Korea to help international aid agencies fight the coronavirus there, amid fears that the impoverished country may be hiding an outbreak.</p>
<p>North Korea has not reported any cases of the new coronavirus. But in the past week, some South Korean news reports, citing unnamed sources within the secretive North, said there had been deaths that were suspected to be related to the virus. The reports could not be confirmed.</p>
<p>North Korea shares a 930-mile border with China, where the coronavirus emerged. It has since spread to numerous countries; more than 1,500 deaths have been reported, almost all of them in China.</p>
<p>North Korea has taken aggressive steps to keep the virus out, including suspending all flights and trains to and from China. But the border has long been porous for smugglers, who ferry goods across the shallow river frontier that separates the two countries.</p>
<p>Relief organizations have complained that U.S.-led international sanctions against the North, imposed because of its nuclear weapons program, have prevented them from providing aid quickly. This week, the Red Cross called for a sanctions exemption that would let it transfer money to its office in North Korea.</p>
<p><strong>Macron ally quits&nbsp;race amid scandal</strong></p>
<p>A member of President Emmanuel Macron’s party withdrew Friday from the race for Paris mayor after private sexual videos he allegedly sent to an unidentified woman were published online by a Russian dissident artist who was granted political asylum in France.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of the candidate, Benjamin Griveaux, who blamed “vile attacks” against him and his family, was a sharp blow to Mr. Macron’s efforts to rally his party for coming municipal elections across the country in which he is expected to do poorly.</p>
<p>The race in Paris had been considered, initially at least, a rare potential victory for Mr. Macron’s party, La Republique en Marche, or Republic on the Move. With Mr. Griveaux’s withdrawal, the president’s plans for Paris have been thrown into disarray.</p>
<p>Mr. Griveaux, 42, announced he was dropping out after the videos began emerging publicly Wednesday evening. The newspaper Liberation reported that the videos were first circulated online by Pyotr Pavlensky, a Russian performance artist who has become notorious for his dramatic acts of protest.</p>
<p>Mr. Pavlensky told Liberation that he had published the videos to expose Mr. Griveaux as hypocritical because the candidate invoked “family values” during the campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Cold weather adds to Syria catastrophe</strong></p>
<p>A military offensive on an opposition-controlled region of northwestern Syria has created one of the worst catastrophes for civilians in the country’s long-running war, sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing, many of them sleeping in open fields and under trees in freezing temperatures.</p>
<p>The military campaign in Idlib province and the nearby Aleppo countryside has also killed hundreds of civilians, and a bitter winter has compounded the pain.</p>
<p>The weather has contributed to at least 10 deaths, including four who suffered hypothermia, a family of four that died of suffocation in their tent and two who burned to death when their tent caught fire.</p>
