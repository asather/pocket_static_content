<h1>Bob Casey, Pat Toomey ask agency to keep tabs on nursing homes during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Saying it is “imperative” that they take action, Pennsylvania Sens. Pat Toomey and Bob Casey on Monday jointly sent a letter to the head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services asking the agency to report back to them within a month about how the federal government is getting the nation’s worst nursing homes to slow the spread of COVID-19</p>
<p>“The worsening circumstances at the Life Care Center of Kirkland in Washington State, the site of the first COVID-19 outbreak, make clear that it is essential to ensure nursing facilities are prepared to prevent the virus's spread and treat emerging cases,” the senators jointly wrote in their letter to CMS Administrator Seema Verma on Monday.</p>

<p>The letter is a pandemic-related follow-up to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2019/06/04/Senate-report-reveals-list-400-troubled-nursing-homes-bob-casey-pat-toomey/stories/201906040083" target="_blank">the senators’ join report last June </a>that revealed a previously secret list of the nation’s worst nursing homes — a list that includes the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/01/With-COVID-19-cases-rising-Beaver-County-nursing-home-asks-for-help-from-everyone/stories/202004010121?fbclid=IwAR1capn9BTOtS2gmGbZTuj-lDiedKByvlFow8DefoRzA89ts7bXd3CcIFjc" target="_blank">a nursing home now dealing with a massive COVID-19 outbreak</a> with at least 42 residents infected, and five deaths. In addition, at least 10 staff members have tested positive.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, a Democrat, and Mr. Toomey, a Republican, crafted the report in June after forcing CMS to give them a list of so-called “candidate” nursing homes — typically about 400 or more homes — for CMS’ annual and public Special Focus Facilities list of the worst homes — typically about 90 homes.</p>
<p>The SFF program, as it’s known, lists nursing homes that “substantially fail” to meet CMS’ care standards. But as the senators pointed out, the 400 or so nursing homes that had typically been included on the SFF candidate list, and kept secret, perform just as poorly as the 90 or so nursing homes included on the public list each year.</p>
<p>Last year’s SFF candidate list included Brighton Rehabilitation, plus two other Pittsburgh-area homes: Corner View Nursing and Rehabilitation Center in Pittsburgh and William Penn Care Center in Jeannette.</p>
<p>In addition, The Grove at North Huntingdon, which is owned by the same group of owners — going by the name Comprehensive Healthcare — who own Brighton Rehabilitation, was included on the shorter and public, SFF list, as was an unrelated nursing home, Twin Lake Rehabilitation and Health Care Center in Greensburg.</p>
<p>“With hundreds of COVID-19 cases now reported in the Commonwealth and thousands across the U.S., it is imperative that we take action to protect those older adults and individuals with underlying health conditions who are most at risk,” the senators wrote Ms. Verma. “Given our commitment to fostering improvement among the nation's poorest performing nursing homes, we are writing to request information about your efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes affiliated with the Special Focus Facility (SFF) program,, and to urge you to take appropriate measures to ensure that these facilities are meeting the needs of their residents.”</p>
<p>They noted that CMS has already suspended routine nursing home inspections to focus inspections on infection control and complaints of immediate harm unrelated to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The senators asked Ms. Verma to provide them with a briefing about “how CMS is addressing oversight in these underperforming facilities as it carries out its response to COVID-19” before May 4.</p>
