<h1>Jacinda Ardern and New Zealand cabinet take pay cut because of coronavirus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New Zealand's Prime Minister <a href="https://cnn.com/2020/04/06/world/jacinda-ardern-easter-bunny-essential-workers-trnd/index.html" target="_blank">Jacinda Ardern</a> said she and her cabinet will take a 20% pay cut for the next six months because of the <a href="https://cnn.com/2020/04/14/health/coronavirus-antibody-tests-scientists/index.html" target="_blank">coronavirus</a> pandemic.</p>
<p>"We acknowledge New Zealanders who are reliant on wage subsidies, taking pay cuts, and losing their jobs as a result of the COVID-19 global pandemic," Ardern said Wednesday in a news conference. "Today, I can confirm that myself and government ministers and public service chief executives will take a 20% pay cut for the next six months."</p>
<p>She added that the pay cut will not affect her government's fiscal policies, but is intended to show leadership that her cabinet has taken.</p>

<p>New Zealand has been praised for its response to the outbreak. Ardern shut the country's <a href="https://cnn.com/2020/04/14/asia/women-government-leaders-coronavirus-hnk-intl/index.html" target="_blank">borders</a> to foreign visitors on March 19 and announced a four-week lockdown on March 23, requiring all non-essential workers to stay at home except for grocery shopping or exercising nearby.</p>
<p>The country has carried out widespread testing and recorded 1,386 coronavirus cases and nine deaths, according to <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">figures</a> from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
<p>But Ardern said <a href="https://cnn.com/2020/04/09/asia/new-zealand-lessons-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">last week</a> she was tightening border restrictions, meaning all New Zealanders who arrive in the country will be required to spend two weeks quarantined in an approved facility, rather than self-isolating at home.</p>
<p>New Zealand is only halfway through its lockdown, and she has said it won't end early.</p>
<p>"In the face of the greatest threat to human health we have seen in over a century, Kiwis have quietly and collectively implemented a nationwide wall of defense," Ardern said in a speech to the nation last Thursday.</p>
<p>"You made the decision that together, we could protect one other. And you have. You have saved lives."</p>
<p>"But as I've said, this is going to be a marathon."</p>
