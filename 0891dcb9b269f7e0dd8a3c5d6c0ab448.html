<html><head><title>Window now open for Penguins, Marcus Pettersson to negotiate extension</title></head><body><p>There’s just something about Pittsburgh that reminds Marcus Pettersson of his home in Skellefteå, Sweden.</p><p>Maybe it’s the way the seasons change and crisp air rolls off the rivers. Maybe it’s the way passionate sports fans breathe life into the city streets. Or maybe it’s the working-class nature of the Steel City that make him think of his own mining town, nicknamed Gold Town.</p><p>“I love Pittsburgh,” said Pettersson, the 23-year-old defenseman who came over from the Aneheim Ducks about 13 months ago.</p><p>Now, as the calendar turns to 2020, the question becomes: Will Pettersson make Pittsburgh his home long-term?</p><p>It’s no secret that Pettersson’s representatives and the Penguins had hoped to sign the big, left-handed defenseman to a multi-year deal before this season. However, because the club was pressed right up against the upper limit of the salary cap, both sides decided to find a short-term solution.</p><p>On the even of preseason training camp, Pettersson inked a one-way contract with the NHL squad that carries an average annual value of $874,125. Per NHL rules, once Pettersson signed that deal, the two sides weren’t allowed to negotiate a long-term contract until Jan. 1.&nbsp;</p><p>But now that the ball has dropped on 2019, the window is back open.</p><p>“We owe it to him to have that discussion at the earliest time we can have it,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/23/jim-rutherford-penguins-sidney-crosby-injury-update/stories/201912230107" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette</a> days before Christmas. “We both agreed to do a different contract that he ultimately took because it’s the only thing we could do with the cap situation. Now that we’ve moved [Erik] Gudbranson, we’ve got some cap space [going forward].”</p><p>Should the two sides agree to a contract, it would not hit the books or impact the salary cap until next season.&nbsp;Pettersson said he would welcome that conversation and a possible longer stay here in the Steel City.</p><p>“I love it,” Pettersson said of the organization. “Obviously, with the situation we were in, we couldn’t figure that out. That’s for something for sure that I want to do, if they still want to do it.”</p><p>During a season in which injuries have ravaged the Pittsburgh roster, Pettersson is one of just five Penguins — and the only defenseman — who has played in all 40 games. Through the first 39, he averaged 19:03 of ice time while playing a top-four role. Currently, he’s skating alongside rookie John Marino in the second defensive pairing.</p><p>“He’s a good two-way defenseman,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “He’s got an offensive upside to his game. He defends pretty well. He’s mobile for as big as he is. He has great gaps. He’s got a good stick.”</p><p>One of the intriguing aspects about Pettersson long-term is that he’s still young. He’s only 23 years old and has played in just 145 games. That means he probably still hasn’t reached his ceiling yet.</p><p>In particular, Sullivan said he sees ways that Pettersson’s offensive game can continue to evolve. So far this season, he’s found the back of the net once and assisted on 13 goals.</p><p>“We’re trying to help him continue to grow his offensive game, because we think he’s capable,” Sullivan said. “He’s still a young defenseman in this league. He’s continuing to learn and grow in some of the added responsibilities that we’re giving him. We think Marcus is a terrific defenseman and he’s good on both sides of the puck.”</p><p>Time will tell if that evolution continues here in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lafferty back in</strong></p><p>Jake Guentzel’s shoulder injury has created opportunities for several players. Alex Galchenyuk will <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/01/Alex-Galchenyuk-gets-first-crack-at-replacing-injured-Penguins-star-Jake-Guentzel/stories/202001010159" target="_blank">get a second chance</a> on Evgeni Malkin’s left wing. Jared McCann has been promoted to the top power play unit.</p><p>And for Sam Lafferty, the path has been paved for him to rejoin the lineup.</p><p>The 24-year-old rookie has played in 31 games this season, tallying four goals and six assists. However, when Patric Hornqvist rejoined the club, the Penguins shifted Lafferty over to center, even though they prefer him on the wing. But after one game in the middle, he was a healthy scratch for Monday’s game against Ottawa.</p><p>“I had a conversation with him on why we made the decision that we made,” Sullivan said. “[Assistant coach Mark Recchi] sat with him and watched his shifts to try to point out some of the areas where we feel he needs to be better and more consistent in order for him to play to his strengths and help us win games.</p><p>“Part of my responsibility as the coach is to try to define a player’s individual game and how they need to play to help us win. With young players, I think it’s even more so.”</p><p><strong>Homecoming for referee</strong></p><p>Thursday night’s game at PPG Paints Arena featured a little local flavor in an unexpected place. Referee Furman South grew up in nearby Sewickley and played hockey for Robert Morris University.</p><p><strong>Jarry’s star continues to rise</strong></p><p>Tristan Jarry helped lead the Penguins to a 10-2-0 record in December, and his contributions have not gone unnoticed. On Thursday, he was named the NHL’s Second Star for December.</p><p><em>Mike DeFabo: mdefabo@post-gazette.com&nbsp;and Twitter @MikeDeFabo.&nbsp;</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/02/Marcus-Pettersson-contract-Penguins-Sharks-Sam-Lafferty-Furman-South/stories/202001020179</original_url>
