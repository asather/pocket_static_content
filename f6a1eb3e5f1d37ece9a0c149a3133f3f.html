<h1>Deploy the fleet: Food delivery at the University of Pittsburgh goes to the robots </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new age —&nbsp;that of robotic food delivery —&nbsp;has dawned at the University of Pittsburgh, where a fleet of 30 robots resembling knee-high coolers on wheels is fully operational and taking orders.</p>
<p>Dorm munchies (and Oakland sidewalks) may never be quite the same.</p>
<p>Pitt notified students, faculty and staff on Monday that San Francisco-based Starship Technologies has moved from testing to full implementation of a service that placed the Oakland campus among a handful of universities nationally when it was proposed last fall.</p>
<p>In other words, autonomous technology is now devoted to the earnest pursuit on and near campus of bagels, coffee, sandwiches and other food and drinks ordered by students and employees on the lower campus, south of Fifth Avenue, plus some nearby streets.</p>
<p>Sorry, there are no trips up Cardiac Hill to reach the Petersen Events Center or nearby residences and fraternity houses — at least for now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these camera-equipped robots could become a routine sight as they come and go from (but do not enter) such landmarks as the Cathedral of Learning, Litchfield Towers, Hillman Library, Bouquet Gardens and the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh and nearby museums.</p>
<p>Given the urgency of young appetites —&nbsp;not to mention Oakland rush hour —&nbsp;the university on its website&nbsp;<a href="http://www.universityannouncements.pitt.edu/New-Starship-Social.pdf" target="_blank">made what sounds</a> like a bold claim:&nbsp;"We deliver in minutes."</p>
<p>The robots can cross streets, with remote guidance if needed. Officials pulled the robots from street testing last fall after a student who uses a wheelchair reported that one of the robots impeded her effort to reach a sidewalk. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2019/11/01/food-delivery-robots-university-of-Pittsburgh-Pitt-starship-pedestrian-safety-munchies/stories/201911010131" target="_blank">Pitt and Starship later returned to testing.</a></p>
<p>Officials with Starship and campus dining vendor Sodexo said anyone with a Starship app on their mobile device can order from a menu with food and drink options ranging from bagels and burritos to salads and soft drinks.</p>
<p>“'This includes multiple payment options with 30 autonomous robots delivering from four campus eateries: Common Grounds, Forbes Street Market, Taco Bell and the Sub Connection,” said Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick.</p>
<p>The service can be accessed&nbsp;“by clicking on www.starship-pitt.com or typing ‘Starship Deliveries’ into your smartphone’s app store,” read a note to campus from Pitt and Starship. “The robots accept Dining Dollars, debit or credit card payment, Panther Funds, and Lunch Money. Delivery hours vary based on each outlet’s operating hours.”</p>
<p>The robots, visible with help from an orange flag jutting upward, are able to interact by voice with customers on the campus of 29,000 students, officials have said. The robots move at a few miles an hour.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The company has secured tens of millions of dollars in financing and hopes to eventually deliver food on 100 campuses.</p>
<p>George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., debuted in January 2018 what the company said at the time was the world’s largest robotic delivery fleet on a university campus. In March, it added Northern Arizona University and last fall Purdue University.</p>
