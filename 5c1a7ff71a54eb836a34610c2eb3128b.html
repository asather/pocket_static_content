<h1>Port Authority returns to full bus service, but COVID-19 will have an impact</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Technically, Port Authority is returning to its full bus schedule this week, but riders probably won’t notice much difference as the agency continues to miss trips due to a shortage of drivers and pass riders with buses that are too full to take more passengers during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In March, the agency cut service by 25% as ridership dropped more than 80% due to stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of the virus. It returned 39 bus routes to route to full service in May and announced in June as the virus seemed to wane that it would return the other 32 bus routes to full service when members of the Amalgamated Transit Union picked their route beginning Sunday.</p>
<p>That locked in the change under union rules, but the virus spiked again. Ridership remains about 70% below a year ago through the first week of August, and the agency continues to have not enough drivers to man all of its routes. In addition, it continues to limit the number of riders on buses to meet social distancing recommendations and when that limit is reached drivers are instructed to pass riders.</p>
<p>“We’re essentially returning our schedule to full service,” spokesman Adam Brandolph said.&nbsp;“In the real world, there certainly will be trips that go unfilled” because drivers aren’t available due to the virus and regular staff shortages.</p>
<p>Even on reduced service, the agency was unable to provide drivers for about 9,000 hours of bus trips from mid March to early August.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said employees who were allowed to be off with pay from mid March to the first week of August because they are at high risk for the virus, have childcare issues or needed to carry for a family member are slowly returning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We know there will be out-of-service trips,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“It’s not going to be any different than any other time. We always have some trips we can’t make.”</p>
<p>Laura Wiens, executive director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit, said she’s frustrated that Port Authority hasn’t taken steps to adjust service to make sure the busiest routes are covered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Rather than return to full service in name only, why don’t they provide more service on more robust routes and reduce service on less busy routes so they don’t have to keep passing people?” she asked.&nbsp;“They should go where the riders are.”</p>
<p>The authority has said it feels an equity obligation to provide service to as many area as it can. Additionally, there could be union concerns if it tries to move drivers from one garage to another.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Everybody deserves service and nobody should be without any service,” Ms. Wiens said.&nbsp;“They always have to make decisions that involve trade-offs. Potentially a solution [to passing riders on busier routes] is that another route may see reduced service.”</p>
<p>Steve Palonis, president and business agent for Local 85 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, couldn’t be reached for comment. In the past, he said the problem with the agency not servicing a route is caused by the agency not hiring enough drivers and using overtime to stretch the existing staff as much as it can.</p>
