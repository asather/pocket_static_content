<h1>Technology investment allows North Allegheny to focus on online education in time of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Editor’s note: This series of interviews with local school superintendents is based on interviews over recent weeks, which have been edited for length. <br></strong></p>
<p>Robert J. Scherrer, 45, heads the North Allegheny School District, an 8,600-student behemoth that draw kids from&nbsp;Bradford Woods, Franklin Park, Marshall and McCandless. There are more than 1,000 staff members to run the district’s seven elementary schools, three middle schools, and two high schools. Although he lives in McCandless, Mr. Scherrer is a South Hills kid. He grew up in Whitehall and also lived in Pleasant Hills but moved when he got the superintendent’s job seven years ago as a way to grapple with the challenging commute. He lives with his wife and son, an eighth grader at North Allegheny, and their daughter, a 2018 graduate who recently had to come home from Duquesne University, where she is a sophomore, because of the COVID-19 virus. Mr. Scherrer’s father was an engineer, his mother ran preschools. He once was principal of Taylor Allderdice High School in Pittsburgh. In July he will take over as executive director of the Allegheny Intermediate Unit, the regional public education agency.</p>
<p><strong>How are parents, children and school staff in your district coping with the COVID-19 outbreak?</strong></p>
<p>I think everybody’s reacting in a different way. So we have some families who really are concerned because they may be losing their own jobs, so maybe the focus for them isn’t on education, and other families who want us to do everything in our power to educate their children. We’re doing the best we can to provide some continuity of education for our students.</p>
<p>The challenge that we’re all having right now is how do you educate all of your students in a remote environment? That’s incredibly difficult for students with complex learning needs. That’s what I think we’re all wrestling with. We’ve been providing educational resources for our families, things they can access independently, and we’re providing formal remote learning for all of our students, and that’s going to present some challenges, but we’re going to do everything in our power to educate our students.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of challenges?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone’s in a different place when it comes to resources. We’ve had access to technology for all of our students in the last few years. We have some students with unique learning needs, where doing things online is very challenging. You almost need a face-to-face opportunity. We also have some students with language needs.”</p>
<p><strong>Explain the access to technology.</strong></p>
<p>We have an educational program here that does a lot with technology, so we have sort of a backbone in place to pivot a little more easily than others. If you’re a district that doesn’t have that in place, this is a heavy lift. All of our students do have a device, grades 1 through 12, so right now there’s at least a connectivity challenge that we’ve been able to address. That isn’t necessarily the case for all school districts. That’s unique to us. Those are the resources that I’m referring to. Our teachers are able to provide remote instruction from their own homes.</p>
<p><strong>What was the rational for the technology initiative?</strong></p>
<p>We started down this road five years ago. We thought having technology was an important resource for how students can learn. It was very much a part of our day-to-day lives, and we felt it needed to be part of the educational experience, not because we thought we’d be faced with a pandemic.</p>
<p><strong>Your district is gigantic. How do you approach the logistics of administration, particularly during the current crisis?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>It starts with people. That’s what makes NA special. We’ve got great people who care about kids and do whatever it takes. All the work we did before the outbreak, that falls on the people who are connecting every day, supporting learning. That’s how you manage a district this large, find great people and put them in a position to do great things and see them rise to the occasion. You’ve got to rely on people stepping forward and rely on people on the leadership team. Everybody’s doing a tremendous job, getting ready for this new normal.</p>
<p><strong>What are the best stress reducers for kids?</strong></p>
<p>Just because of the current situation, our communication with families includes links for how to deal with stressful moments, what can we do to address overall wellness. Mindfulness, that’s something we rolled out over the last two years to our staff members. Kids already know those strategies. We know the importance of movement, just getting up and around. It’s really about just keeping in mind that your own health and wellness is incredibly important, and it’s also important for our staff members.”</p>
