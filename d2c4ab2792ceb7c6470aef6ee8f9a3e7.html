<h1>Here's how Pittsburgh is saying 'happy birthday' to August Wilson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This time of year we normally could gather for the annual August Wilson House Block Party, celebrating the April 27 birthday of the legendary Pittsburgh playwright right outside his childhood home.</p>
<p>These are not normal times, though, and that&nbsp;April 25th event will not go on as planned. But this also is no normal birthday. The two-time Pulitzer Prize-winner&nbsp;would have turned 75 on Monday, and three institutions dedicated to carrying on his legacy have gathered an array of the biggest Wilsonian names from to help the city celebrate.</p>
<p>•&nbsp; The<strong> August Wilson House</strong>, the writer’s Hill District childhood home that is being restored as an arts center, can’t party as they have in the past. Instead, they have invited three dozen actors, directors and artistic directors, both local and national, to record on their cellphones brief "Happy Birthday, August” greetings. The videos will be streamed throughout the day Monday, on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/augustwilsonhouse/" target="_blank">Instagram,</a> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AugustWilsonHouse" target="_blank">Facebook</a> and YouTube.</p>
<p>Greetings “have been pouring in,” according to the AWH,&nbsp;and winners of the national August Wilson Monologue Competition have been included.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>•&nbsp; Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company,</strong> which is in the process of its second run through WIlson’s American Century Cycle of 10 plays, is saying presenting “An Online August Wilson Birthday Discussion,” hosted by the theater’s founder, Mark Clayton Southers, and actor-director Monteze Freeland.</p>
<p>The lineup for the Zoom discussion includes local and national actors who have interpreted the Wilson canon, including Stephen McKinley Henderson, a Tony nominee for “Fences,” who also appeared in the movie filmed in Pittsburgh, and actors Anthony Chisolm and Eugene Lee, who has appeared from Pittsburgh to Broadway in WIlson works. Others taking part in the birthday talk are Sala Udin, Rita Gregory, Kevin Brown, Jonathan Berry, Kim El, Chuck Timbers, Candace Walker, Sam Lothard, Alan Bomar Jones, Bryant Bently, Cheryl El-Walker, Les Howard, Karla Payne, Montae Russell, Rico Parker, Ben Cain and Wali Jamal.</p>
<p>The chat begins at 7 p.m. Monday. Find the link at <a href="http://www.pghplaywrights.or" target="_blank">www.pghplaywrights.org</a>.</p>
<p>• Starting April 27, the <strong>August Wilson African American Cultural Center</strong> is launching “Last Mondays,” a monthly conversation series that will be streamed on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AugustWilsonAfricanAmericanCulturalCenter/" target="_blank">the center’s Facebook page</a>. The first installment, in sessions from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m., will feature Tony-nominated actor-director Ruben Santiago-Hudson, poet jessica Care moore, Wilson scholar Dr. Sandra Shannon and actor Nathan James.</p>
