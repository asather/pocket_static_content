<h1>State closing all Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As part of Gov. Tom Wolf’s statewide shutdown of non-essential businesses and services, Pennsylvania is closing all Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores in the state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state Liquor Control Board announced just after 4 p.m. Monday the&nbsp;“indefinite closure of all Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores and licensee service centers,” effective at 9 p.m. Tuesday, “to help slow the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The state also is closing, at 5 p.m. Monday, sales at <a href="https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/StoreCatalogDisplay?storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10051&amp;langId=-1" target="_blank">www.FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Saturday, the state PLCB announced that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/03/14/Pennsylvania-closing-some-Fine-Wine-Good-Spirits-stores-Eastern-COVID-19/stories/202003140071" target="_blank">all stores in Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties were closing Tuesday</a>, but at that time, Pennsylvania residents were still going to be able to purchase wine and spirits online.</p>
<p>And “unusually high order volume” already is delaying the processing and delivery of orders, some of which will be canceled and refunded, so the PLCB can “phase down operations” at its Montgomery County fulfillment center.</p>
<p>Board Chairman Board Chairman Tim Holden said in a release, “This was a tremendously difficult decision to make, and we understand the disruption our store closures will have on consumers and licensees across the commonwealth. But in these uncertain and unprecedented times, the public health crisis and mitigation effort must take priority over the sale of wine and spirits, as the health and safety of our employees and communities is paramount.”</p>
<p>All stores in counties other than Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery counties (closing after Monday) will remain open for normal hours Monday and will open for their normal hours Tuesday, then close at 9 p.m. until further notice.</p>
<p>The PLCB says it will re-evalute operations, guided by Gov. Tom Wolf and the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, licensees such as bars and restaurant, as well as breweries, wineries and distilleries, are struggling with questions about whether and how to operate, especially in light of Gov. Wolf’s institution on Monday of a statewide shutdown on “non-essential” businesses and services. Restaurants and bars were ordered to close to customers coming in, but were allowed to continue to sell food and drink to go.</p>
<p>The PLCB also sent licensees a letter on Monday to provide some more guidance.</p>
<p>According to the letter, “licensees are strongly encouraged to heed public health officials’ request to cease non-essential operations, limit group gatherings and practice social distancing.” However, “the PLCB will temporarily adopt lenient measures to enable licensees in those counties to continue selling beer and wine for off-premises consumption. Retail licensees – including restaurants, bars, hotels, eating places, grocery stores, convenience stores, etc. – may continue selling beer to go, even in the absence of restaurant operations, and those with wine expanded permits may also continue selling wine to go. There is no change to quantity limits or requirements regarding how sales are to be made.”</p>
<p>Further, the letter states, “producers including breweries, wineries and distilleries must indefinitely suspend all&nbsp;dine-in service, but they may continue selling their own products for off-premises consumption. Clubs and catering clubs must cease all on-premises consumption. No other special exceptions or allowances are available at this time.”</p>
<p>The letter notes that, “No special provisions for delivery or curbside service are allowed.” As of Monday afternoon, several Western Pennsylvania breweries and brewpubs already were offering “drive thru” service.</p>
<p>Licensees will continue to adapt to the rules, which themselves may be subject to change.</p>
