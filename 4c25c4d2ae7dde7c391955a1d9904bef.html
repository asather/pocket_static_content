<h1>Sanders: Buttigieg, Bloomberg part of the problem of a 'corrupt political system'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. —&nbsp;Railing against a “corrupt political system” that he said has battered the American middle class for nearly half a century, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders told a crowd here Friday that Pete Buttigieg and Michael Bloomberg, two of his primary opponents, are part of the problem.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders, blaming money in politics for contributing to the suffering of working families and the health of the planet, said Mr. Bloomberg —&nbsp;the former mayor of New York City —&nbsp;is trying to “buy an election” by spending hundreds of millions of dollars on his campaign, while Mr. Buttigieg, former mayor of South Bend, Ind., is accepting billionaire donations at a time when “billionaires control not only our economy but our political [system.]”</p>
<p>The question that voters in New Hampshire should ask the candidates before next week’s first-in-the-nation primary, he said, is: “Which side are you on?”</p>
<p>“Are you willing to take on the greed and corruption of the billionaire class and the 1 percent?” Mr. Sanders asked, “or will you continue to stand with the big money interests?”</p>
<p>Speaking at the “Politics &amp; Eggs” breakfast series at Saint Anselm College’s New Hampshire Institute of Politics, Mr. Sanders said his campaign is best suited to stand up for working families because it has been funded by small donations.</p>
<p>It will take a government and president that “unapologetically represents working people, not billionaires,” Mr. Sanders said, to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour, pass Medicare for All and make public colleges and universities tuition free.</p>
<p>His speech, in the hours before this evening’s Democratic debate here, painted a picture of America as a country where families live paycheck to paycheck and teachers make as low as $29,000 a year while pharmaceutical companies get subsidies and Amazon pays no federal income tax.</p>
<p>“How does it happen that —&nbsp;year after year after year —&nbsp;people on top do phenomenally well, and year after year after year, the working class and middle class of this country struggle and 40 million people live in poverty?” Mr. Sanders asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg, whom Mr. Sanders called a “nice guy,” narrowly beat the Vermont senator in delegates in this past Tuesday’s Iowa caucuses. But Mr. Sanders said he was the winner because he got more votes.</p>
<p>Asked by an attendee how he’d defeat Donald Trump in a general election, Mr. Sanders said it will take the largest voter turnout in U.S. history, noting that although the turnout in Iowa was “not as high” as he would have liked, there was a 30% increase in voter participation among people under age 29.</p>
