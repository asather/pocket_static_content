<p>New Year’s resolution: eat more Thai food.</p>
<p>Per a report in the December issue of the <a href="http://www.onlinejacc.org/content/74/25/3139" target="_blank">Journal of the American College of Cardiology</a>, an eight-year longitudinal study of 22,000 Italian adults found that “regular consumption of chili pepper is associated with a lower risk of total and [cardiovascular disease] death independent of CVD risk factors or adherence to a Mediterranean diet.”</p>
<p>The extrapolated results indicated a 23% reduction of CVD for people who ate chili peppers four or more times per week and a 40% reduction in heart attacks. Previous similar studies in the United States and China jibed with what the Italians found.</p>
<p>That brings us one of the greatest delivery devices of capsaicin known to man: the aforementioned Thai food.</p>
<p>That’d be hot, spicy, eyeball-watering, sinus-loosening, head-rushing, adrenaline-surging, euphoria-feeling, dragon-chasing, night sweats-inducing, hurts-so-good wonderful Thai food, chock-full of evidently circulation-cleansing chili peppers. Who knew?</p>
<p>So when the gentleman on the other end of the phone taking down my takeout order explained to me that they abide by a 1, 2, or 3 spice level at Senyai Thai Kitchen in Shadyside, I asked if a 3 was akin a blowtorch.</p>
<p>“It’s not a blowtorch, but it definitely has some bite,” he said.</p>
<p>“Three me,” I said.</p>
<p>And it delivered. Maybe not a blowtorch, but awful close. Every bite got me closer to sweating out an entire holiday season’s worth of ham and alcohol.</p>
<p>But to fixate on the spice wouldn’t do justice to the quality of the fare. The Crab Fried Rice ($20) was light and silky with jumbo-lump crab meat and crunchy fresh vegetables — onion, carrot and shredded broccoli and scallion — over Jasmine rice.</p>
<p>The stir-fried Prik King was likewise delicious with crispy green beans with carrots and kaffir lime leaves and a lemongrass sauce with quality organic chicken ($15).</p>
<p>A follow-up sit-down visit to the space was equally as tasty, sweaty and downright delightful.</p>
<p>Tu Wade opened the BYOB restaurant (corkage fee of $5 for wine, $1 for beer) at 5865 Ellsworth Ave. in the space below her spa, Miss T’s Beauty Lounge.</p>
<p>As Post-Gazette food editor Arthi Subramanian wrote shortly after Senyai’s opening in April 2017, the snug space seats only 15 people, and the layered ceiling is visually stunning.</p>
<p>Designed by Dana Cupkova, who teaches architecture at Carnegie Mellon University, and Gretchen Craig, the slats in the ceiling appear as a continuous surface, mimicking a body of water.</p>
<p>Ms. Cupkova said she was inspired by the vaulted geometry of ancient Thai architecture, akin to a bowl of big noodles in broth. The only decor items in the brightly colored restaurant are framed images of northern and southern Thailand.</p>
<p>They do the essentials here — skewered chicken satay and papaya salad, and the familiar red, green and massaman curries, pad Thai and dumplings, plus specialties.</p>
<p>A cup of the Tom Yum soup ($4) will heal your soul with its funky, spicy and bracing broth with roasted chili, lemongrass broth, galangal, mushrooms and tomatoes.</p>
<p>Coming from one who counts chicken wings as a food group, the Thai Herbs wings ($6) were very, very good: marinated organic chicken wings — juicy with a skin that snaps and is flecked with crunchy shards of fried minced garlic and served with a sweet and spicy dipping sauce.</p>
<p>The Mama Kee Mao ($18) is a clean and textured dish with shrimp and squid, Thai-style curly noodles, Napa cabbage, carrots, bell peppers, and a spicy basil sauce.</p>
<p>On to the decadence. The Crab Curry ($20) is made with jumbo-lump crab meat and kale cooked in a creamy yellow curry sauce. It’s rich and especially good as the kale isn’t limp and mealy but rather a crisp and vegetal complement.</p>
<p>A true revelation was the Hung Lay Curry ($16). A northern Thai dish, it’s not a creamy curry nor a thin broth but more like a light brown gravy with a Thai-style soy sauce base that envelops tender slow cooked pork belly. Savory perfection.</p>
<p>A visit to Senyai is an assault on the senses in all the best ways — color, smell, taste and texture —&nbsp;except perhaps sound, as the playlist was Muzak lame, but our waiter Nima more than made up for it with great service, plenty of information for this respectful novice about the dishes and a wry wit.</p>
<p>In sum: chili peppers = heart health. And while many cuisines can deliver that, Thai food is especially up to the task, and the spicy and quality dishes at Senyai is a fine place to start.</p>
