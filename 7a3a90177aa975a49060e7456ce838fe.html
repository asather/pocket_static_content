<h1>COVID-19 Update: Pa. reports more than 470 new cases, 15 more deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials on Monday reported 15 more deaths due to COVID-19 and 473 new cases,&nbsp;the 15th straight day with fewer than 1,000 cases.</p>
<p>The state Department of Health’s new cases push its total to 68,186; the new death toll is now 5,139.</p>
<p>Allegheny County on Monday reported no new deaths due to the novel coronavirus, although the state was reporting one new death in its Monday release of data. No other deaths were reported in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The county’s pandemic death toll stands at 150 deaths — 139 are confirmed and 11 are probable, according to the county Health Department.</p>
<p>The county also reported 28 new cases from the previous day. Since the county’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 14, Allegheny has had 1,805 cases —&nbsp; 1,697 confirmed and 108 probable cases. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>Of the 1,805 cases, 256 cases were health care workers infected with the virus, which reflects 14% of all COVID-19 cases in the county, the health department said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Monday, 319 people in Allegheny County have been hospitalized because of the highly infectious disease.&nbsp;Of them, 126 required a stay at the intensive care unit, and 67 required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Since March 14, Allegheny County has administered 28,839 tests. The county health department said it has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>
<p>The continuing reduction in the number of new cases spurred Gov. Tom Wolf to reduce restrictions Friday for 16 counties mostly in the northern tier of the state, moving them from the yellow category to green and planning to move all counties out of the most strict red category by June 5. Counties in the yellow category can have some businesses open on a limited basis and those in green can have restaurants open at half their normal capacity and businesses such as salons can see customers by appointment.</p>
