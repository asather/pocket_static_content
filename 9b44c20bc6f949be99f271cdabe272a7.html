<h1>Steelers-Giants chat transcript: 09.14.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can‚Äôt believe the Steelers made Ulysees Gilbert inactive. What are these guys doing? Guess they don‚Äôt want to win a Super Bowl. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK just had to get that first complaint of the year out of the way. Should be fun to ~engage~ with all you rabid fans for Steelers-Giants. Don‚Äôt be shy to jump in with questions and comments throughout the night.</p>
<p><strong>Mike P</strong>: Hey Brian, first time long time. What do you think of the Buccos‚Äô chances in Game 2 of the doubleheader tonight? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Doubleheader? This is the first I‚Äôm hearing of it. Assuming they won Game 1, though.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: The NFL is a National disgrace. It spits on the flags that drape the coffins of the men who died fighting for your freedom. It should be boycotted out of existence. <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: TV ratings for last night‚Äôs game were down 28%. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Tough to compare to last year‚Äôs Steelers-Patriots opener on SNF. I can‚Äôt imagine anyone around these parts boycotting the NFL.</p>
<p><strong>Jatt in Abbotsford</strong>: Can‚Äôt wait to see home town boy getting CHASED into the endzone. GO CLAYPOOL.GO STEELERS. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chase Claypool is ACTIVE (no surprise) and I do think he‚Äôll make an impact tonight. Hey, I‚Äôll go ahead and make the bold prediction that he scores, because why not? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Also, Jatt is a cool name.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Brian what is your score prediction tonight i like the Steelers 49-20 <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I said 21-13 on our North Shore Drive podcast last week, which you still have plenty of time to listen to <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-...</a><br> <br> I‚Äôll stick to that, because I think there‚Äôs a certain amount of rust Ben will have to knock off. If they get to 49, there might be a defensive TD or two. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: We‚Äôre 40 minutes from kick. Need some more predictions from you folks out there.</p>
<p><strong>Jatt in Abbotsford</strong>: Steelers 24 Giants 14 <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Had to be a site for sore Steelers eyes pregame just to see Ben Roethlisberger doing his usual one-by-one hug and handshake to his teammates in the stretching line. It‚Äôs the little things you miss when QB1 is out.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Looks like Marcus Allen really is a linebacker. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good call. He got a ‚Äúhat‚Äù tonight over Ulysees Gilbert. Remember that it was actually Gilbert who was active and a special teams contributor last year as a rookie until he got injured, while Allen was on practice squad. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Pretty disappointing the Giants didn‚Äôt call up Johnny Holton from the practice squad.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Vega</strong>: First Steeler to score a TD tonight will be ???????? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Love it, Vincent. Let‚Äôs do a poll.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: James Connor <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Definitely won‚Äôt be him.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Is Allen more of a pleasant surprise or Gilbert more of a disappointment? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I take it more as Allen as a surprise. Gilbert was a standout early in camp, chosen to talk to the media after practice, etc., but then we didn‚Äôt hear much about him. Steelers coaches have had a lot of praise for Allen, but then again, when do you ever hear them criticizing one of their own in that setting? Not often. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: By the way, I‚Äôm going off the radar with Jaylen Samuels reception for first TD, on a third-down play. Probably would get decent odds in Vegas.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: Uh. Conner. Sorry...üòä <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There we go, Dave. Spelling counts in this chat. By the way, I‚Äôm about to go make a pregame snack. Avocado toast, baby!</p>
<p><strong>terminator</strong>: Probably thinking of John Connor who is too busy saving humanity to score touchdowns <br> <strong>Jules Winnfield</strong>: Ok - who‚Äôs missing Booger? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Pour one out for big Boog. Neither Anthony McFarland will be part of this one. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What I‚Äôll be watching on defense: who‚Äôs the 11th player? So far it‚Äôs Vince Williams as they open in 3-4 base defense. <br> <strong>Tyler B.</strong>: Geaux Tigers, though <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: First-down Giants? No Super Bowl. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ola Adeniyi knifing in for a TFL. Kind of a forgotten man with Alex Highsmith drawing rave reviews as a rook in camp.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: This is how you lose to bad teams <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: we miss Switzer already !!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He certainly was reliable back there. A reliable fair catch, sure, but you can see why Mike Tomlin was so comfortable for so long. Granted, he said he was comfortable with Diontae Johnson too <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/09/03/steelers-kick-punt-returner-diontae-johnson-mike-tomlin-kerrith-whyte-rayray-mccloud/stories/202009030178" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/09/03/steelers-kick-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Danny Smith</strong>: Don‚Äôt blame me / It has been clear I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, I‚Äôm sure the Steelers special teams coach went out there and told his return man to let the ball doink off his mask. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Giants lead 3-0 after Graham Gano (remember him?) field goal. If I‚Äôm a Giants fan, I hate that decision. Go for 7 after getting a gift like that.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: when you put players in a position they are not capable of it is your fault as coach <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Diontae Johnson was a second-team All-Pro punt returner last year as a rookie. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK here comes the offense. I‚Äôll be looking at Zach Banner at right tackle, how much pre-snap motion they use with Matt Canada coming in, oh and I guess No. 7.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: how is he doing so far this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: 0 for 1, Chuck. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So uh, not a great start for the Steelers offense. Or new punter Dustin Colquitt. Other than that...</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Stinking it up so far <br> <strong>SteelRebel</strong>: ...other than that, not the start we were hoping for <br> <strong>Tom</strong>: What a disappointing first possession. I thought it was the Giants with a completely new coaching staff who would start slow. So far, typical Steelers against inferior teams....always making it harder than it should. <br> <strong>SteelRebel</strong>: Wow Dupree looked like Troy on that play <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Nice play Bud <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Bud was in coverage on Evan Engram on the first play of that series, too. Looking to get even MORE paid this offseason.</p>
<p><strong>Beth</strong>: Bet Ray Ray is active next week to field punts. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He‚Äôs active now. Could get back there tonight if they want him to. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ben a little gimpy after a QB hit. He‚Äôs back. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maurkice Pouncey with a low snap. That was an issue last year, and he didn‚Äôt seem to think much of it. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And wow, what a grab along the sideline by Chase Claypool. Think Ben is liking him already?</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Conner not showing much escapability <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Offensive line needs to do better <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Agree on both fronts. They‚Äôre not giving him much space to run, much like last year.</p>
<p><strong>SteelRebel</strong>: Not opening holes <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, what he said. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And it‚Äôs 3-3 after a Chris Boswell field goal. Just 49 seconds left in the first quarter and it‚Äôs flying by. My wife says ‚ÄúWe want Duck Hodges.‚Äù</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: <span style="font-style: italic;">Ben has had people in his face on every pass. </span> <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: this offensive line is horrible they are going to get big ben hurt his right knee is hurt already <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don‚Äôt even see one particular issue with the line so far, though I‚Äôm not rewinding and watching every play over again. Seems like breakdowns across the front consistently.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Only Duck we want is ala Mr Richards <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: they should have taken more offensive lineman in draft facts <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Look for next year to be a big one to beef up the line through the draft. Certainly have to think they‚Äôll be looking at a tackle high.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: matt fieler is a bum so is is Steven wiesniski mr banner is getting pushed around if I was ben I would walk out <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Supposed to be stronger in pass protection. We know run blocking will be a problem <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Doesn‚Äôt help when David DeCastro isn‚Äôt out there. He‚Äôs an excellent run-blocker.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: The run defense has been stout. <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: OL needs to protect Ben way better or he is going to get hurt. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: stick a fork in these bums no corners worthless <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Touchdown, Giants. Daniel Jones 41 yards to Darius Slayton and it‚Äôs 10-3. A bit reminiscent of what the Patriots did in the opener last year, with Joe Judge on staff...</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Uh oh <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: no pressure on qb <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: We look awful so far. Our O line is getting crushed and our blitz‚Äôs are getting picked up. <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: So far it is looking like the Giants are the more prepared team. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: I bet they loose 2 and 14 may be 4 and 12 need a new coach offense and defense and head coach sadly its been over do i say tank the season then draft Justin fields or Trevor Lawrence <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And hire Dabo Swinney to go with Trevor Lawrence. Obviously.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Conner looks slow <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Remember, Anthony McFarland isn‚Äôt even active tonight, so no threat of that big-play, home-run, change-of-pace.</p>
<p><strong>KS Steeler</strong>: team looks unprepared <br> <strong>Danny Smith</strong>: Don‚Äôt blame me for that return. You should be aware by now I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Never a great sign when your long-snapper makes the tackle.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: they should have darted jk Dobbins fact he‚Äôs twice as good as any back on this team facts <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Steelers are getting beat in every facet of the game. Look totally unprepared. <br> <strong>Mark ?</strong>: T J Watt is terrible ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: T.J. Watt - not a bum <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Benny Snell picks up 8 yards on a first-down run. It‚Äôs been nearly all Conner so far, but Snell got to the outside on that one.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Cowher</strong>: Couldn‚Äôt find a spot for McFarland <br> <strong>GSMP</strong>: They converted but it seems like someone on the sideline should have recognized the clock and called time out. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Eric Ebron looked fired up in pregame. Making his first big play for Ben there.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: they should be a full back more watt <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Now this is a Steelers chat. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: First Steelers touchdown of the season goes to ... JuJu Smith-Schuster.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Vega</strong>: Who had JuJu <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No one! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chris Boswell doinks the extra point and it‚Äôs 10-9, Giants with 9:01 to go in the first half.</p>
<p><strong>Dan 72</strong>: Missed x point ...sloppy. <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Extra point clunk <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Everyone loves a good doink! Even when it happens to you.</p>
<p><strong>KS Steeler</strong>: Danny Smith really has these specials looking like they never practiced <br> <strong>Bob</strong>: The whole team is playing sloppy <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Hopefully the TD gets this offense in gear. <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: When is Danny Smith going to retire? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don‚Äôt know.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Find some money for Dupree Mr Rooney please <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: If anyone thought last year was a fluke, he looks really good tonight. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nicely schemed up play-action misdirection, and then Saquon Barkley does Saquon Barkley things. Yowza.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: That was a nicely drawn up play. When was the last time we said that about a Steelers play? <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: we come out 2 tightens a full back and pound the ball down there throats or at least try <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Need to score again before the half <br> <strong>Jake</strong>: They are going to be fine. Like to see more Claypool and Ebron. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: this line cant block for crapfacts i <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Crapfacts</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Ebron has to do a better job of chipping the rusher. Need to slow him down. <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Play calling? <br> <strong>Mr Obvious</strong>: Special teams suck <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: they need to pick Rosie nix back up at least he can tackle on special teams flat out suck being out played and coached <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, that was a bad whiff by Justin Layne on Peppers there for that punt coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Field position working against Steelers constantly because of special teams <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Steelers run defense looks incredible, pass defense not so much. That‚Äôs kind of the way they geared themselves this offseason with their moves or lack thereof.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Get out of bounds, Washington. <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Put Snell in all second half and see if he can get in a rhythm <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Big Ben looking FAST</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: That‚Äôs better <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: James Washington showing off that farm strength for a 13-yard TD catch over the middle.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Great strength and body control by Washington. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Boswell does his job this time. Steelers lead 16-10 going into the half ... unless the Giants run back this kickoff with 7 seconds left.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: We need to stay in two minute mode whole game. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So what‚Äôs everyone gonna do during halftime?</p>
<p><strong>Dan Halen</strong>: Ben does so much better when calling his own plays. This is a poor indictment of the O.C. because the offense is out of sync otherwise. <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Rust starting to come off. All weapons being used! <br> <strong>Joe</strong>: How about some blocking on the offensive lione... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That never hurts, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: There‚Äôs Booger <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Booger!</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: he is throwing to many passes thats not good for his elbow facts <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ben was 12 for 21 in the first half.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia J</strong>: Please get me a play by play guy, I understand that players may get suspended for a DUI but now we bench Hillgrove? Yes Bill was not as sharp on down and distance but C‚Äômon Man! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm listening to the radio broadcast, tonight GJ.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What‚Äôs the score? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The Steelers are winning 16-10 last I checked. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Debating whether I need to go get some coffee now.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Thank Brian. Grab a java! <br> <strong>Dan Halen</strong>: Mark, if he can‚Äôt throw, he is no good for the team. Its not like we can impose our will in the run game. Ben HAS to throw. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You really got him.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Time to put #30 on IR or cut and roll with #24...it‚Äôs just too bad #30 can‚Äôt stay healthy. <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: Dan I understand what you are saying but they need to get a running game going somehow at least try <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: I agree Ben needs to call more plays as he reads what the defense is showing <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Let‚Äôs just be honest, Ben is basically the offensive coordinator here. You saw that on the 2-minute. We‚Äôll see if they just let him go back to that well in the second half.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia J</strong>: Worried about Connor. Maybe the 2019 problems were not all OL <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I‚Äôll agree with others that he‚Äôs not exactly showing a ton of burst or wiggle, but he‚Äôs also running into a wall every time he touches it. Giants are best up front, too.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: cd and sc absolutely they should have drafted jk Dobbins <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Conner hasn‚Äôt shown anything but then again either has Barkley. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Ben should be calling ALL his own plays, not just at the 2 minute mark. And Conner is hurt again? I think he‚Äôs done in the NFL, nice guy but can‚Äôt stay healthy. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: We haven‚Äôt gotten any sort of official injury update from the Steelers on Conner, for what it‚Äôs worth. Second half starting now</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: He‚Äôs hurt (ankle)....AGAIN!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ray-Ray nearly went all the way-way</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: thx brian. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Broadcast just showed Conner stretching as Benny Snell starts this half, and looks good doing it.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Nice block by Feiler on the pull. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I‚Äôd leave Benny in. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Fullback sighting, Mark!</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: I would have liked a few touches for McFarland <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: Why not play action pass after a few good runs? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: James Washington couldn‚Äôt make the contested catch against James Bradberry, a very solid veteran corner.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Ben always throws deep on 3rd and 5 <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: This defense now gets to pin its ears back inside the 10. Daniel Jones led the league in fumbles last year. Watch out.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: good defensive play <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: I don‚Äôt like Ben throwing deep on that 3rd and 5. Just get the first down. <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: yes - finally field position in Steelers favor. gotta take advantage <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Just remembered we have more football on after this. And Mark Barron is inactive in his first game as a Bronco. Carry on. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Was that the first time tonight Stephon Tuitt lined up as the NT or just the first time I noticed it?</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Edmunds <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: Terrell edmunds sucks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Imagine if the Giants didn‚Äôt have a 7-footer running that route</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Jones getting it done right now <br> <strong>Eman</strong>: Pathetic <br> <strong>Mike M</strong>: Vince on a receiver. We won‚Äôt win that one. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: First time I‚Äôve heard Alex Highsmith‚Äôs name tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Dan 72</strong>: Giants holding like crazy <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: yep weak at safety edmunds <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Daniel Jones is sneaky with his legs. Deceptively athletic, I think is what they call it. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, Giants pick up the first on fourth-and-1, but nice job by Joe Haden to wrap Saquon and not let it go for six.</p>
<p><strong>Dan 72</strong>: 3 holds on the 4th down play alone <br> <strong>KS Steeler</strong>: We can‚Äôt win if they don‚Äôt call any of the blatant holds <br> <strong>Eman</strong>: are we trying the old bend dont break approach again? <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Looked like some holding on that 4th down play <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: Gilbert should be playing more <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well he‚Äôs inactive, so he won‚Äôt be playing at all tonight.</p>
<p><strong>Dan 72</strong>: Steelers playing like old men vs kids <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Let‚Äôs give Jason Garrett some credit for what he‚Äôs drawing up for this G-Men offense tonight, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Daniel Jones is looks really good <br> <strong>Mark</strong>: this zone defense sucks <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: Dinkin &amp; dunkin <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Dinkin‚Äô Danny. Feels like we‚Äôre gonna hear a lot about communication issues from the defense after this one.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: This Defense is getting smoked <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Oh my word. Cam Heyward with a fat man pick!</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: thank god <br> <strong>Mike M</strong>: They just put out the fire. <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: Lol <br> <strong>Eman</strong>: bend dont break :P <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Big Heart D!!! <br> <strong>Georgia J</strong>: Defense looking a step slow. Note the subbing for the OLB‚Äôs. Great coverage by Cam. What did I just type? <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Terrell Edmunds needs to be benched or moved to linebacker. He always seems to be out of position or step slow to the ball. <br> <strong>Jake</strong>: Bud Dupree is a man possessed! <br> <strong>GSMP</strong>: Dupree is going to break the bank if he continues to play like this. <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: I‚Äôm taking my wife out to dinner, later guys. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: See ya, Ken. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Kenny come back! Benny Snell just put piggy on ground!</p>
<p><strong>Eman</strong>: cmon Benny really? <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Gotta hold onto the ball! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: JuJu recovered. Good job, JuJu.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Is Connor hurt? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Seems to be banged up on the sideline, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Eman</strong>: Good bye Kenny. <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: Of course #30 is hurt again <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: Wow couldn‚Äôt even make thru 1 half of football in the first game. So much for being in such great shape <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ben sacked for ... a lot of yards lost</p>
<p><strong>Eman 1</strong>: WTH was that Ben? <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: Come on Ben....dumb sack <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Booooooooooooo <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: End of 3: Steelers still up 16-10. We‚Äôll see if Chris Boswell can hit a FG here to make that Cam Heyward pick yield some points.</p>
<p><strong>Eman 1</strong>: Sorry I have to leave so early, test tomorrow. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Bye buddy, I‚Äôm sure the Steelers will hold on.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Later Eman. <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: This game will go down to the wire like always <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: 3 points here is big <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Everyone leaving here early I guess. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not me, Dan. Not me. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Boswell hits from 36. Steelers up 19-10 with just 14:19 left.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: I give the Steelers defense a B+, The offence a ‚ÄúC‚Äù <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Go Boz <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: While I have you here, you should subscribe to our Steelers newsletter, The Skinny Post.

<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: I live in Charleston. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My wife‚Äôs family is in Topsail right now. I‚Äôd like to be in the Carolinas myself, but, duty calls.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Snell looks good but has to hold onto the ball!! <br> <strong>Chuck Noll</strong>: Kickoff OB <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Special teams have killed us tonite <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: I am in the armed forces down here. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thank you for your service.</p>
<p><strong>Dan 72</strong>: CD, Thank you for servicing our nation. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Mike Hilton doing Mike Hilton things. Credit Stephon Tuitt for taking up two blockers there.</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Somebody hacked my ID <br> <strong>Eman</strong>: my alter ego is back. D stepping it up now <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I‚Äôm more confused than the Giants OL at this point.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Need to score a td to put the game away <br> <strong>Dan 72</strong>: Brian, Eman said he was leaving, we may have a spoofer here. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Let‚Äôs hope not. We must not besmirch Eman‚Äôs good enam. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Conner questionable to return. That‚Äôs from the broadcast, not Steelers spokesperson Burt Lauten, who usually provides the in-game injury updates. Granted, this is a new year.</p>
<p><strong>Eman</strong>: nice little play to DJ there <br> <strong>JP</strong>: Conner hurt again. <br> <strong>CD in SC</strong>: Brian, How would you rate the Steelers draft this year?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Too early to say, obviously, but I‚Äôve liked the Claypool pick from the beginning. Highsmith seems promising. Dotson looks like a steal.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: The crossing pattern is the best route in football on third and medium. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Really nice finish to that run by Benny Snell, staying in bounds and muscling forward for a few more.</p>
<p><strong>JP</strong>: The Steelers draft is a work in progress. IMO. <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Snell with a nice run. <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Snell with 100 yards for the game!!! <br> <strong>GSMP</strong>: Good night all, we have this game in hand. Thanks Brian. <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Any verification on Conner? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sounds like it‚Äôs an ankle injury for Conner.</p>
<p><strong>Mike M</strong>: Brian, did McFarland dress? Just wonder if he gets a few runs at the end if we score here. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, McFarland is inactive.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Cd thank you sir for your service may I ask what branch my son just did 10 yrs in the navy uss Nimitz nuke engineering <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Well Hello running game...nice to you again <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: Will the Gazette be hosting these Steelers chats all season?? <br> <strong>Mike M</strong>: Gene, I was about to ask the same. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: TBD, guys. We‚Äôll have to run all the algorithms to see if it‚Äôs worth it, but I know Ray Fittipaldo will be back with his usual Tuesday chat tomorrow afternoon once he‚Äôs back from Jersey, and Gerry Dulac later this week Wednesday or Thursday. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Stefen Wisniewski leaving with an injury now. Kevin Dotson time at RG?</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: TTTDDDDDDDDDDDD <br> <strong>Georgia J</strong>: Dotson earns his game check. Nice job in Wolf‚Äôs opinion <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Touchdown, Steelers. Another one for JuJu. Good night to have him on your fantasy team. I do and so does my wife.</p>
<p><strong>Vincent Vega</strong>: Thanks for the chat Brian <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You‚Äôre welcome, VV.</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: My wife and I just had our first child this week. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Congrats, Ken. Little one had a successful Steelers debut.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Dotson is a man child he is a road grader i have watched a bunch of film on him <br> <strong>Vincent Vega</strong>: Nice drive to wrap it up- that‚Äôs what good teams do <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Apparently Zach Banner got dinged on that play, too. Suddenly a rough night for injuries?</p>
<p><strong>Georgia J</strong>: This is great for us far away Brian. Please lobby to continue this great service <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: From your keyboard to the editors‚Äô ears.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: congratulations Ken I pray they both are healthy and doing well <br> <strong>Vincent Vega</strong>: Ken, a boy or girl?? <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Baby boy, Kenneth Alonzo Schuester.. <br> <strong>Mike</strong>: If Banner is out then what? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chuks Okorafor, come on down. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: By the way Steelers lead 26-10 after Boswell‚Äôs XP. Now just 5:23 left. Banner looks emotional on the bench, man.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Doesn‚Äôt look good for Banner and that‚Äôs too bad hopefully it‚Äôs not as bad as it looked <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs final takeaways as we go into the final four minutes here? Ray Fittipaldo‚Äôs report card will be posted online after the game.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Some loser hijacked my name. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Maybe there are multiple Genes here.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: on defense Terrell edmunds is the weak link <br> <strong>Gene</strong>: I voted a C+ Brian. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I went B+. Can‚Äôt crush a team for perennially playing down to opponent and then not give them credit for winning, and pulling away to do so decisively.</p>
<p><strong>Handsome Gene</strong>: I voted B- too. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There is no B-!</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: it comes down to coaching they got out coached for awhile <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Anyone staying up for Titans-Broncos?</p>
<p><strong>CD in SC</strong>: Go Titans. <br> <strong>Georgia J</strong>: Since the Broncos are next all good Steeler fans are hanging in there <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, an early look at Week 2 foe.</p>
<p><strong>Eli</strong>: That‚Äôs enough football for tonight <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I can respect that.</p>
<p><strong>Destiny</strong>: Let the Titans beat up on the broncos lol <br> <strong>Nick</strong>: Who is the back up for the offensive lineman who is injured? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Which one? Kevin Dotson came in for Stef Wisniewski at RG. Chuks Okorafor will step in for Zach Banner, as far as we know.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: we need to find a tackle now i hope not but in afraid it is bad news for Zack banner he has worked his rear end off i think he is there best tackle <br> <strong>Sergio from Mexico</strong>: B+. Lets hope its the start of a good year! <br> <strong>Ken</strong>: Edmunds having a good game. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He‚Äôs up to 7 tackles now, which leads the team, but I didn‚Äôt see him make much of an impact when it mattered. Just sayin‚Äô. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Touchdown, Giants. Slant to Slayton.</p>
<p><strong>Mel Blount</strong>: Don‚Äôt like that - too easy <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Conversion try no good, so with 1:52 left, Steelers still lead 26-16. I don‚Äôt think anyone left too early.</p>
<p><strong>Sergio from Mexico</strong>: pass D needs to pock it up for next games. <br> <strong>The doctor</strong>: DiCastro back next week? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Tough to say, but my gut is yes. He‚Äôll need to be. The depth on the OL is no bueno. Only spot on the roster where they actually kept a couple XFL products, putting them on the practice squad. Can Kevin Colbert maybe look into a trade?</p>
<p><strong>Sergio from Mexico</strong>: Thanks for the Chats BB. Hopefully they continue throughout the season. <br> vamos Steelers!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Preciate ya, Sergio.</p>
<p><strong>The doctor</strong>: Get on the wire and start looking for OL <br> <strong>Sergio from Mexico</strong>: really bad news on the OL front... <br> <strong>Dave</strong>: Last count i heard on soft tissue injuries across the league was 53...i bet that number is conservative <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Was always something to watch after the odd offseason, no preseason, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Destiny</strong>: They have some lineman they can move around <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Villanueva, Feiler, Pouncey, Dotson, Okorafor? Right now that‚Äôs the 5 up front. Not bad, but another injury away from JC Hassenauer, Feiler moving back to tackle, et.</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: Dotson was huge pulling!! <br> <strong>Dave</strong>: the big takeaway from this game...Big Ben is back! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He looked pretty good to me, just in the moment. Didn‚Äôt really have to uncork many, but the tip-toe catch along the sideline by Chase Claypool was very encouraging for both QB and rookie WR.</p>
<p><strong>Destiny</strong>: Coach T 9 in a row on MNF <br> <strong>Butch</strong>: Good solid win. Nice to have #7 back in the pocket again <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Chase Claypool with an end-around to ice it. And he flexes. Steelers 26, Giants 16 will be your final.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: thanks again for hosting Brian...good night <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well hey, thanks for stopping by everyone. Hope you enjoyed it.
