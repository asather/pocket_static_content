<h1>Zoom announces plans for research center in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Zoom Video Communications Inc., the video conference platform that has helped so many people connect virtually amid stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements, is setting up a physical presence in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The company, based in San Jose, Calif., announced Thursday it plans to open two research and development centers in Pittsburgh and Phoenix.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Between the two offices, Zoom will hire about 500 software engineers in the next few years. For the time being, Zoom’s new Pittsburgh employees will work remotely, as the offices are built and restrictions remain in place to limit in-person operations during the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The company has not announced where its Pittsburgh office will be located, though it plans to set up near Carnegie Mellon University in Oakland, according to a press release.</p>
<p>“Being selected by Zoom as one of two U.S. engineering hub expansion sites endorses the region as a top destination to recruit, attract and invest in specialized tech talent and expertise,” said Mark Anthony Thomas, president of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, the economic development affiliate of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development.</p>
<p>“A robust ecosystem of companies in cloud-based and SaaS technologies is on the rise here,” he said in a prepared statement. “With the addition of Zoom, Pittsburgh continues to grow into its reputation as being the place where companies at the edge of what’s next need to be.”</p>
<p>Founded in 2011, Zoom video conferencing software became a household name seemingly overnight as stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements forced people to turn to their computers to connect with friends, family and colleagues.</p>
<p>Today, the company has 82 million monthly app downloads, a 102% monthly download growth, according to data from Crunchbase, a portal where startups can self-report funding rounds.</p>
<p>Based on informal in-house research conducted by the Allegheny Conference on Community Development, Pittsburghers are proud when national companies invest in the region, Mr. Thomas said in an interview.</p>
<p>“They are definitely one of the most talked about companies in the world,” he said.</p>
<p>“One thing that will shift post-COVID, we are now a much more attractive destination than we were a year ago,” Mr. Thomas said. “Now people are becoming accustomed to working remote, the sense that you can only have premium talent in expensive markets will shift. That gives Pittsburgh an opportunity to really show where we’re strong.”</p>
<p>Since its initial surge in growth, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/04/03/Zoom-privacy-security-flaws-video-conferencing-bombing-concerns-CEO/stories/202004030099" target="_blank">Zoom has come under fire</a> for a host of privacy issues, causing the company’s founder and CEO Eric Yuan to apologize to the app’s millions of users in April.</p>
<p>The company announced it would stop adding new features to its product for 90 days, focusing instead on addressing privacy issues, such as the level of encryption on its platform and a feature that shared some user data with Facebook. Zoom has deactivated that feature and is about halfway through its 90-day security plan.</p>
<p>Zoom released a software update with enhanced security in April, acquired Keybase, a secure messaging and file-sharing service, in May and is working on providing end-to-end encryption.</p>
<p>“Zoom’s arrival indicates the continued strength of the Pittsburgh innovation economy even in the midst of a broader economic crisis,” Sean Luther, executive director of InnovatePGH, a public-private partnership that works to accelerate Pittsburgh’s tech economy, said in a prepared statement. “Investing in our university and innovation assets is the key to accelerating job growth in western Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>Zoom reported $622.7 million in revenue for its 2020 fiscal year, up 88% from the prior year. Net income attributable to common stakeholders for the fiscal year was $21.7 million, or 9 cents per share.</p>
<p>Zoom will release its first-quarter results for fiscal year 2021 on June 2.</p>
