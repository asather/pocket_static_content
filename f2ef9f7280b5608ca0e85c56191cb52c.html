<h1>Pittsburgh forms task force as fireworks complaints soar to nearly 400% over last year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City public safety officials have formed a task force to monitor the staggering increase in fireworks being set off illegally within city limits, the department announced Friday.</p>
<p>City law prohibits the use of any fireworks -—even legal ones —&nbsp;within 150 feet of any structure. They also are prohibited in all parks, any public space and on private property without consent of the landowner.</p>
<p>During the three-week stretch from June 1 to June 21, city police received 137 fireworks complaint calls — a 389% increase over the 28 calls received during the same time period last year, according to officials.</p>
<p>“As a Pittsburgh native myself, I understand that fireworks are an important part of the way we celebrate our Independence Day,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said in a press release. “Unfortunately, as a result of the ongoing battle against the deadly coronavirus, all fireworks and public gatherings have been cancelled this year. Please remember that fireworks are a real fire hazard and can be very dangerous. I urge everyone to exercise caution this year and not use them.”</p>
<p>Officials warned against the&nbsp;“significant” dangers to property and people, including injuries in children.</p>
<p>Those caught violating fireworks law could face a $100 fine and the possible seizure of their fireworks.</p>
<p>The task force will include police and fire investigators.</p>
