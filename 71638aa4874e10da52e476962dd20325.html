<h1>Ethan Morton, Devin Carney lift Butler past Mt. Lebanon for WPIAL Class 6A title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Butler’s Ethan Morton and Devin Carney had been a potent one-two punch in the regular season and had been terrific in the playoffs, both averaging more than 20 points a game. Morton and Carney had 20-20 vision one more time on the grand WPIAL stage Saturday night and a championship finally came into focus for Butler.</p>
<p>Butler defeated Mt. Lebanon, 70-61, in the Class 6A championship at Petersen Event Center to give the Golden Tornado only the second WPIAL title in the past 100 years. The other came in 1991. Butler won three other titles but those came in the early 1900s.</p>
<p>Butler had lost in the championship two of the past three seasons, including a year ago to Mt. Lebanon. But the Golden Tornado put down the M.C. hammer (Morton and Carney) on Mt. Lebanon this year and got over the top. Butler needed two late comebacks and overtime to win its past two playoff games, but the Golden Tornado led most of the way this time.</p>
<p>Morton, a 6-foot-6 senior guard, a Purdue recruit and one of the top WPIAL players in the past decade, scored 20 points, grabbed 11 rebounds, blocked 2 shots and got the WPIAL championship he has been talking about ever since he started as a freshman. He made 8 of 13 shots.</p>
<p>“This feels even better than I imagined. It’s crazy. I’ve been thinking of this for four years,” said Morton, who must have hugged 100 Butler fans on the court after the game.</p>
<p>Carney, a 6-foot sophomore guard, made four 3-pointers and scored 24 points. He made 7 of 15 shots.</p>
<p>But it was what Carney and Morton did in the first half that made all the difference in this contest. They were practically unstoppable, scoring 32 points between them to help Butler (20-4), the No. 1 seed, grab a 42-30 advantage at halftime.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon (18-7) changed its defense to a half-court trap in the second half and it brought the Blue Devils back. They closed to within three points, but Butler hung on and pulled away in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>“I don’t even have words to describe how Devin played,” Morton said. “It’s what he’s done all playoffs and all year. The thing is, our teammates believe in us and when it’s time to go, we know it’s time to go.”</p>
<p>It was time Saturday night as Butler shot 54% (25 of 46) while Mt. Lebanon made only 37 percent (23 of 62). Jake Hoffman, a senior guard, led Mt. Lebanon with 21 points.</p>
<p>“For a long time, I’ve been thinking about this interview,” Butler coach Matt Clement said to reporters after the game. “Unfortunately, the last two times I had to give the other interview.”</p>
<p>Clement also lost in a WPIAL championship as a Butler player in 1993.</p>
<p>“I can’t say with more sincerity how happy I am for Butler. For the people, the players, everyone,” Clement said. “I’m pretty dang blessed.”</p>
<p>“I know this meant the world to Ethan. It meant the world to all of them, but I knew Ethan put a lot of pressure on himself, saying he had to win a WPIAL title or his career wasn’t going to be good enough. Let’s be serious. He’s a pretty decorated player for a guy who said his career wouldn’t be good if he didn’t get it. But the first thing he said after the game was, ‘That’s for you, coach, and for Butler.”</p>
<p>In the first half, Carney had 21 and Morton 11 while Morton also pulled down seven rebounds. Carney and Morton scored on drives, 3-pointers and pull-up jumpers. They shot 11 of 16 between them and Carney made 3 of 5 from 3-point range and they took all but seven of Butler’s shots in the first half.</p>
<p>The 42 points Butler scored in the first half came against a Mt. Lebanon team that had allowed only 48 and 32 points in two playoff games and was giving up an average of only 50.8 points entering the game.</p>
<p>But Mt. Lebanon did not go quietly. The Blue Devils scored the first nine points of the second half when Butler was having trouble with the half-court trap. But Mattix Clement, the coach’s son, hit a 3-pointer and added another one later in the quarter. He finished with 15 points.</p>
