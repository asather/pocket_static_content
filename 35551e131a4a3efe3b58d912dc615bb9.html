<h1>Robert Morris dominates St. Francis Brooklyn, takes sole possession of first place in NEC</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>From the very beginning of the game against St. Francis Brooklyn, Robert Morris had momentum.</p>
<p>Fifth-year senior guard Josh Williams scored the first eight points of the game, which, along with some strong defense, put the Colonials on the right track from the get-go.</p>
<p>The Terriers (7-7 overall, 1-1 NEC) closed the deficit to two at one point in the first half, but Robert Morris (7-9, 3-0) had far more answers than its opponents the rest of the way, ultimately winning, 78-52. The win puts the Colonials in sole possession of first place in the Northeast Conference.</p>
<p>“I think all around, as a whole team, everyone contributed in different ways,” Williams said after the game. “Whether it was rebounding, assists, even things that don’t get tallied like setting good screens, everybody was doing just the little things that we needed to win.”</p>
<p>Thanks in part to his strong start, Williams set the pace for Robert Morris. By halftime, he had 14 points on four 3-pointers and a layup, and it wasn’t until halfway through the second half that he missed his first shot of the game.</p>
<p>He added just six points in the second half on two more 3s, but that was good enough to lead all scorers with 20 points, while also pacing his team with eight rebounds, tying his career high.</p>
<p>Williams credited his success over this game and the recent past to the work he has put in, saying he puts up 500 jumpers a day.</p>
<p>With success comes increased defensive attention from opponents, making games like the one Thursday night all the more impressive.</p>
<p>“It’s hard for him,” coach Andy Toole said.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t get a ton of great looks, so we try to find as many ways as we can to get him great looks.</p>
<p>“We want him to be aggressive. There was even a couple shots in the second half that I thought he passed up that we need him to take, we want him to take.</p>
<p>“So when he’s making those shots, it really opens up everything for a lot of other guys, and it gives our guys energy.</p>
<p>“You need guys on your team who can provide some of that confidence and energy to people.”</p>
<p>Williams’ performance, along with 16 points from junior forward AJ Bramah, which tied his career high, and 13 from senior forward Yannis Mendy, had the Colonials comfortably ahead much of the second half, maintaining a 10-to-15-point lead. St. Francis was just pesky enough to keep things in doubt, though, until the six-minute mark.</p>
<p>It was at that point that Robert Morris slammed the gas pedal and finished the game on a 19-7 run to put it well out of reach.</p>
<p>Perhaps, the Colonials’ success had something to do with this being their first game at home since Dec. 17 when they beat Central Michigan. If this was what home cooking tastes like, that’s a good sign for Robert Morris, which plays its next four games at home — including the matchup Saturday against Wagner.</p>
<p>“I don’t know,” Toole said when asked if playing at home benefited his team.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, this will be a place that we continue to play well in and continue to defend with great pride in the program, and we’ll see where it can go.”</p>
<p>The final points of the game appropriately came on an emphatic slam dunk from sophomore guard Jalen Hawkins, who drove into the lane and posterized a defender, properly punctuating a dominant outing.</p>
