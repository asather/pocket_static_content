<h1>Pennsylvania deaths from COVID-19 increase by 112, Allegheny County by 4</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health reported 112 new deaths Saturday from the COVID-19 virus, including four in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>The new numbers bring the statewide death total to&nbsp;5,096. A total of 150 of those deaths have occurred in Allegheny County, 139 confirmed by a positive test and 11 others considered probable deaths from the virus.</p>
<p>A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>

<p>IIIn Western Pennsylvania, three other counties reported new deaths Saturday, Armstrong, Beaver and Indiana. That raises the total number of deaths in Armstrong to three, Beaver to 72 and Indiana to five.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state reported 725 new cases of the deadly virus, the 13th day n a row with less than 1,000 cases. The county reported 14 new cases Saturday.</p>
<p>Overall there have been&nbsp;66,983 cases of the virus in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The continuing reduction in the number of new cases spurred Gov. Tom Wolf to reduce restrictions Friday for 16 counties mostly in the northern tier of the state, moving them from the yellow category to green and planning to move all counties out of the most strict red category by June 5. Counties in the yellow category can have some businesses open on a limited basis and those in green can have restaurants open at half their normal capacity and businesses such as salons can see customers by appointment.</p>
