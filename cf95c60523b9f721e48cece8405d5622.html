<h1>Local designers are makers and muses in Frick art exhibition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Paintings and other artwork on display in a museum usually aren’t for sale. And if they were, the price tags wouldn’t be in the budget for most patrons.</p>
<p>That’s not the case at The Frick Pittsburgh’s exhibition&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Exhibition-Maker-Muse-Women-and-Early-Twentieth-Century-Art-Jewelry" target="_blank">Maker &amp; Muse: Women and Early Twentieth Century</a>.” When the organizers discovered extra space, they decided to fill it with the work of more than a dozen designers making and selling jewelry and accessories across the Pittsburgh region. The show opened last month at the museum in Point Breeze and continues through May 10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The idea for the&nbsp;“Made in Pittsburgh” display grew out of a guest label project. Sarah Hall, the museum’s chief curator and director of collections, invited 15 local designers, educators and fashion retailers to research and write labels for some of the historical jewelry in the show. Noticing extra space in the gallery, she offered to let them share their own work.</p>
<p>The designers&nbsp;“get a little bit of a spotlight shed on them. We get a lot from the relationship, as well,” Ms. Hall says.</p>
<p>“Each of these folks has a network of friends and family and our visitors get the opportunity to learn new things and be exposed to local makers and artists.”</p>
<p>A diversity of approaches to jewelry and accessory making is represented. One showstopper is a hand-beaded choker accented with flowers and a cascade of beige and cream beads by Tereneh Idia.</p>
<p>The work comes from her <a href="https://www.idiadega.com/" target="_blank">Idia’Dega line</a>, which she creates with indigenous artisan women from Kenya and the Oneida Indian Nation of New York. In addition to detailed beading, the piece thoughtfully combines trends in style from a cross section of cultures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another eye-catching creation is a wig crafted from strands of pearls, sterling silver chains and rhinestones by Sarah Jane Sindler, the owner and designer behind <a href="http://www.kingreld.com/shop" target="_blank">KING RELD</a>. She specializes in avant-garde jewelry, particularly mouth&nbsp;“grillz,” body chains and custom designs. In 2018, her work was featured in the designer runway show at Pittsburgh Fashion Week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She explores luxury and gluttony in her work,” Ms. Hall says.</p>
<p>Melissa Frost of Frost Finery contributed to the display a blue lapis&nbsp;“swivel” ring with bronze and gold. Its name comes from the fact that, if people could touch the ring, they could turn the stone around to see the metalwork on the back. Ms. Frost is a designer and metalworker whose specialty is contemporary jewelry that blends laser cutting with traditional metalsmithing techniques. She uses mostly recycled metals and responsibly sourced stones in her work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Keith Belles, a senior designer at Wax Jewelry Design Studio in Shadyside, shared his&nbsp;“spacehorse” necklace. It’s made from a meteorite fragment, natural pure gold nuggets and sterling silver.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I collect and often incorporate unusual, natural materials such as meteorite fragments, fossils and custom-carved gemstones into my one-of-a-kind pieces,” he wrote in his artist statement. “These materials mirror my fascination with the natural elements of the Earth and the mystery of the sun and stars.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The display also includes a colorful bow tie made from repurposed vinyl by Knotzland, a Swarovski crystal creation by bridal jewelry designer Caito Amorose and a whimsical&nbsp;“golden ladder” bracelet etched with faces by Cat Luckett of Collarbone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Frick Pittsburgh held a salon event last month that included several of the designers in conversation. On March 21, the public will have another chance to meet and mingle with makers at a Maker Day: Pop-Up Show and Shop.</p>
<p>From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., stop by to watch Ms. Frost and Sara McClelland of SASHA Handmade demonstrate their craft. At 3 p.m. they’ll be part of panel discussion, along with Knotzland’s Nisha Blackwell, Tricia Brancolini-Foley of Handmade Arcade and Erin Gatz of Prototype Pittsburgh. They’ll talk about the state of contemporary handmade craft and women makers in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be chances to shop with designers that day and anytime on their websites or at their studios.</p>
<p>“We love the fact that we're bringing things to Pittsburgh from all over the world,” Ms. Hall says. “But it’s also really wonderful to say, ‘Hey, look at the artistic community in Pittsburgh.’ We don't often know the artists who live with us and among us.”</p>
<p><em>To register for the March 21 panel discussion, visit <a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Event-On-the-Make-Maker-Day-at-the-Frick" target="_blank">thefrickpittsburgh.org</a>.
