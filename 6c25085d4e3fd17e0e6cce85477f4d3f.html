<h1>Should I stop contributing to my 401(k)?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stocks have taken a dive into bear market territory and, like many saving for retirement who have watched their balances decline, you may be wondering if you should continue making contributions to your company 401(k) plan.</p>
<p>The answer is yes.</p>
<p>Most financial advisers believe a down market is the best opportunity to take advantage of dollar cost averaging.</p>
<p>Dollar cost averaging is an investment strategy in which you spread out your investment over regular time periods to reduce the volatility of the overall purchase.</p>
<p>That means the stocks you purchase at a lower price then lower the overall cost of all the stocks you own in a portfolio. The lower average cost will improve the portfolio’s overall return when the market goes back to where it was before the crash.</p>
<p>“If you are several or many years from retirement, we feel the expected recovery will erase the memory of this downturn as it did in previous similar downturns,” Robert Fragasso, chairman and CEO of Fragasso Financial Advisors, wrote in a memo to his firm’s clients last week.</p>
<p>No one knows how much longer the stock markets will keep falling, but when the COVID-19 pandemic is brought under control and businesses and individuals return to work, Mr. Fragasso said there will be a demand for goods and services that were interrupted, and perhaps an emphasis on shorter supply chains which could lead to more businesses and jobs in the U.S.</p>
<p>“Where appropriate to your objectives, risk tolerance level and financial planning, this may offer an opportunity to buy some of the best companies in the country and the world at depressed prices, either directly or via [exchange-traded funds] and mutual funds,” he said.</p>
