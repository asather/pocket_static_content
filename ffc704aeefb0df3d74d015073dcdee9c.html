<h1>Penn State tight end Pat Freiermuth isn't short on confidence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Words from Penn State tight end Pat Freiermuth are as crushing as the way he blocks opposing defenders in the run game. He is as precise with his statements as he is when running the routes that led him to 43 catches for 507 yards and seven touchdowns as a sophomore last season.</p>
<p>“I’m very confident in myself as a player,” Freiermuth said when asked Wednesday about his goals for 2020. “I am very confident that I can become the best tight end in the country.”</p>
<p>A lot of people agree with Freiermuth, including his position coach Tyler Bowen.</p>
<p>“The big thing for him is putting it all together,” Bowen said in April. “He’s been able to put together little bits and pieces in his career. Now (it’s) being able to have a bit of a toolbox to put it all together and be the best all-around tight end in the conference and the country.”</p>
<p>Belief in the 6-foot-5, 256-pounder goes well beyond the shadows of Beaver Stadium. ESPN draft analysts Mel Kiper and Todd McShay are known for their spirited on-air disagreements about prospects. Kiper and McShay respect each other, so the banter is good-natured. It’s not often they come to a consensus as they do on Freiermuth.</p>
<p>“Freiermuth is a big, talented tight end who already has an NFL frame and is a decent blocker,” Kiper said when explaining why he has the junior ranked as his top tight end and 21st overall on his latest draft board. “Freiermuth can do everything — he has the athleticism to line up in the slot or out wide.”</p>
<p>McShay also has Freiermuth as his top tight end at No. 25 overall.</p>
<p>Expectations like that can either be beautiful or crushing for a 21-year-old like Freiermuth.&nbsp;It’s similar to a musician. Any artist can catch the proverbial lightning in a bottle that allows them to create a hit record.&nbsp;The next level is the artist who has an excellent album. Sustained success.</p>
<p>“I need to focus on my time being at Penn State and trying to take full advantage of this,” Freiermuth said. “Because if I don’t have a good season this year or don’t perform, then it’s all down the drain.”</p>
<p>Freiermuth is so determined that he took a step many his age wouldn’t fathom: deleting his social media accounts from his phone.</p>
<p>“I’ve got to block out the noise and continue to do what my process has been ever since I got to Penn State, to work and do what I need to do to become better and help the team,” he said. “So I’m going to take that same mentality into this season, and hopefully, I’ll continue to progress in my career.”</p>
<p>As impressive as Freiermuth is on the field, perhaps his greatest attribute is the support he’s shown for teammates such as Lamont Wade and Aeneas Hawkins off it.</p>
<p>Freiermuth could’ve turned a blind eye when Hawkins tweeted recently about a racist incident the defensive tackle said he experienced over the Memorial Day weekend. It’d be easy for Freiermuth to “shut up and play ball,” but he shared a home with Hawkins. In turn, Freiermuth wants to world to know that what allegedly happened to his friend was wrong.</p>
<p>“It’s very disappointing that things have ... gotten to a place where someone felt the need to do that to Aeneas,” Freiermuth said. “Seeing it happen to him made it hit home.”</p>
<p>Wade, a Clairton native, has spoken out consistently about various racial injustices, including Wednesday on the heels of a police-involved killing in Minnesota. Freiermuth saw what Hawkins went through and Wade’s defiance toward oppression. He chooses to stand with off the field as well as on it.</p>
<p>“This showed me that it’s just not on social media or TV,” He said. “It made it real to me. I’m there for all my teammates. I have to stand up for them and support them.”</p>
