<h1>Five Penguins questions to set the stage for a busy week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Take a breath now, while you can, because one of the busiest weeks of the NHL offseason is about to begin.</p>
<p>The first round of the NHL draft starts at 7 p.m. Tuesday. On&nbsp;Wednesday, the puck drops at 11:30 a.m. on Rounds 2-7.</p>
<p>Also on Wednesday, teams have until 5 p.m. to extend qualifying offers to restricted free agents — a process that will come with at least one tough decision for the Penguins.</p>
<p>Free agency opens at noon Friday and will continue throughout the weekend. As if that isn’t enough, don’t forget this is also one of the busiest periods on the trading calendar with the exception of deadline day.</p>
<p>Once it starts, draft picks, trades and tough decisions will come in waves. Here are five pressing Penguins questions ahead of the hectic week:</p>
<p><strong>Is this the week Matt Murray gets moved?</strong></p>
<p>Soon after the Penguins <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/10/03/tristan-jarry-contract-penguins-matt-murray-trade-rumors/stories/202010030075" target="_blank">locked up Tristan Jarry on Saturday</a> to a three-year deal, the focus shifted to the other restricted free agent goalie on the roster: Murray.</p>
<p>The Penguins are already pressed up against the flat $81.5 million salary cap with just a little more than $2.6 million in free space. While the Penguins plan to submit a qualifying offer to Murray to retain his rights and possibly set the stage for a challenging arbitration case, a trade is very much on the table. Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford likens the situation to 2017, when he moved on from Marc-Andre Fleury due a similar salary-cap situation.</p>
<p>“We’ll qualify him next week and go through the arbitration process,” Rutherford said. “Maybe we get to a number that we can fit him back in. At this point in time, it won’t be at the number he’s looking for.”</p>
<p>If Murray is moved, the Penguins don’t have salary cap space to take on more NHL players. They’ll be looking for future assets, such as prospects or draft picks.</p>
<p>While Murray is just 26 and has two Stanley Cup rings on his resume, he’s also a restricted free agent, so any team that acquires him will have to negotiate an extension or risk losing Murray after one season. The other factor working against the Penguins is that the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/30/matt-murray-trade-rumors-possible-suitors-penguins-nhl-draft-free-agency/stories/202009300136" target="_blank">market is flooded</a> with a glut of free-agent goalies. Vancouver’s Jacob Markstrom and Washington’s Braden Holtby are the top unrestricted free agents. Some of the other netminders available include Anton Khudobin, who led the Dallas Stars to the Cup final in Ben Bishop’s absence, followed by a number of aging veterans such as Corey Crawford, Jimmy Howard, Henrik Lundqvist and Mike Smith.</p>
<p>So what does Rutherford want in exchange for Murray?</p>
<p>“It’s a matter of what the market bears,” Rutherford said. “It’s an interesting market right now as far as the goalies go. There’s a lot of goalies going to be in the market once free agency opens up. It’s a unique situation with Matt just having one year left as a restricted free agent. There’s a lot of circumstances around it that dictate what that price ends up being.”</p>
<p>The Penguins could take two approaches here: Trade Murray before free agency opens and some of the seats get filled, or wait until after the dust settles on free agency and deal him to a team that missed on the UFAs.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Penguins stand pat or try to move up into the first or second round?</strong></p>
<p>As it currently stands, the Penguins will not be submitting a pick until the third round. Toronto holds the Penguins’ first-round pick following <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/25/kasperi-kapanen-trade-penguins-maple-leafs/stories/202008250091" target="_blank">the Kasperi Kapanen trade</a>. Vegas has the Penguins’ second-round pick as a part of the compensation to entice them to take Fleury off the books.</p>
<p>Will the Penguins sit and wait for their turn at pick No. 77? Or will they move back into those first two rounds?</p>
<p>“It’s hard to tell,” Rutherford said. “I don’t think we’ll move up. If you move up, it takes another pick. The Penguins have had good fortune in later rounds, especially in the third round.”</p>
<p>The list of notable third-round picks includes Murray, Bryan Rust and Jake Guentzel. The Penguins also hold picks in the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds for a total of four picks.</p>
<p>“I have good trust in [<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/22/penguins-scouting-coronavirus-pandemic-nhl-draft-preview/stories/202009220061" target="_blank">director of amateur scouting</a>] Patrick Allvin and our staff,” Rutherford said. “Despite the fact that we don’t have many picks, we could have a good day.”</p>
<p><strong>Is another trade on the table?</strong></p>
<p>Rutherford has already been busy this offseason. He added a top-six winger in Kapanen and a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/25/mike-matheson-penguins-trade-patric-hornqvist-deal/stories/202009250137" target="_blank">young, mobile defenseman in Mike Matheson</a> while saying goodbye to playoff hero Patric Hornqvist and often-injured forward Nick Bjugstad.</p>
<p>How active will he be during a frenetic period for trades?</p>
<p>In terms of pure roster construction, moving a left-shot defenseman would appear, at least from the outside, to be an obvious option. The Penguins have a logjam on the left side of the blue line. Brian Dumoulin, Marcus Pettersson and Matheson are slated to be the top three lefties. That leaves Jack Johnson, Juuso Riikola and prospect Pierre-Olivier Joseph waiting for an injury or trying to beat out Chad Ruhwedel for the right side of the third pairing. Rutherford added Cam Lee to that list, another left-shot defenseman signed out of Western Michigan that the Penguins believe in.</p>
<p>Could one of those players get moved to clear a more direct path for the younger players?</p>
<p>“We’re talking about a few different things,” Rutherford said. “We’re going to have to make some decisions here on what that group is going to look like.”</p>
<p>Rutherford also is never hesitant to make a big move. A surprise is never out of the question for these Penguins.</p>
<p><strong>Which restricted free agents will receive a qualifying offer?</strong></p>
<p>As of now, the Penguins plan to extend qualifying offers to Murray, Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello. However, barring a change, they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/10/03/dominik-simon-penguins-contract-restricted-free-agents/stories/202010030102" target="_blank">do not plan to qualify</a> Dominik Simon ahead of Wednesday’s deadline.</p>
<p>Qualifying Lafferty and Angello, who are not arbitration eligible, will leave the Penguins with about $1.05 million in cap space, per Cap Friendly, assuming both stay in the NHL throughout the season. While Simon proved to be a nice compliment on Sidney Crosby’s line, the Penguins don’t know exactly what kind of raise an arbitrator will give Simon from the $750,000 he made this season. They already have to move some pieces if they do in fact end up going to arbitration with Murray.</p>
<p>The other name to watch is winger Pontus Aberg. He was a throw-in, so to speak, as a part of the Kapanen deal.</p>
<p>“If we qualify him, we retain his rights, but he would still play in Russia for a year,” Rutherford said. “If we don’t qualify him, we don’t retain his rights. We haven’t made a final decision on that yet.”</p>
<p><strong>How involved will the Penguins be in free agency?</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned previously, the Penguins will have to move some pieces around just to fit all their current players under the cap. Don’t expect them to get in bidding wars for the big-name free agents such as Alex Pietrangelo, Taylor Hall, Torey Krug or Tyson Barrie.</p>
<p>“I would suspect if we do anything in free agency, it wouldn’t be in the first few days,” Rutherford said. “It will be when guys start to slip through the cracks. We look at maybe a right-shot defenseman. Maybe a depth center-iceman. A third goalie. Things like that.</p>
<p>“We’ll just be looking now to add the right pieces if they come at the right price.”</p>
