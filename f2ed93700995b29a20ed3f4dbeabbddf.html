<h1>John Fetterman and Celeste Trusty: The trial penalty weighs heavily on Pennsylvanians </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Imagine facing down a charge of second-degree murder, and you have two options: a plea deal offering you as little as four years in prison in exchange for an admission of guilt, or head to trial, where if you’re found guilty you’ll die behind bars.</p>
<p>Given the choice, brothers Dennis and Lee Horton, who have maintained their innocence since being accused more than two decades ago, opted for a trial. They lost, and have now been in prison for 26 years of their life-without-parole sentences — all of that time remaining misconduct-free.</p>
<p>At the time of their arrests, the Horton brothers had zero criminal record. Nothing whatsoever — whether as children or adults. But regardless of whether they are innocent or not, they faced a nearly impossible decision when offered that plea bargain.</p>
<p>Knowing you might lose the case in court, it’s easy to see how many Pennsylvanians take the plea deals — in hopes of a shorter stint in prison, and a chance to live the rest of your life after. Stack this problem with that of mandatory minimum sentencing, where that loss in court means a guarantee of 10, 25 or even life in prison without the possibility of parole, and a four- or five-year plea deal suddenly seems like a pretty appealing offer. Even if you didn’t commit the crime, an offer like that can feel impossible to pass up.</p>
<p>To be blunt: Plea bargains are wielded like a club by many prosecutors. Take my deal, or roll the dice, if you dare. But it doesn’t have to be this way. A recently released documentary by Families Against Mandatory Minimums (FAMM) and the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, “The Vanishing Trial,” is a moving representation of the devastating toll this penalty has on people, and we encourage you to watch it.</p>
<p>The trial penalty is one of the most prevalent ways the absurdity of our notion of justice manifests — when a person’s punishment is compounded and prolonged if they choose to exercise their constitutional right to a trial, instead of accepting a lower plea offer.</p>
<p>Though your right to a jury trial is enshrined in the Constitution, the expanded use of plea deals in recent history has significantly eroded this right. If prosecutors, who are supposed to represent the interests of public safety, believe that a plea offer of a lower sentence is sufficient to administer and satisfy justice, why should choosing to go to trial result in a sentence that is remarkably more punitive?</p>
<p>Another factor in choosing to take a plea as an act of self-preservation is that mandatory minimum sentences in Pennsylvania, including those like life without parole disproportionately harm communities, families and individuals of color. In this commonwealth, Black people are sentenced to serve life without parole at a rate that is 18 times higher than their white counterparts. The rate of life without parole sentences for Latinx people in Pennsylvania is five times greater than white people.</p>
<p>Our legal system’s idea of justice is shamelessly fluid and murky, untethered to any sort of concrete, uniform or tangible principles. Too often, our legal system ignores the voices of impacted communities, taxpayers and even victims in its bloodthirsty quest for punishment as the primary response to harm.</p>
<p>How many people in Pennsylvania’s prisons are serving excessive and mandatory sentences, when “justice” could have been defined differently? We have an obligation to expand opportunities for people in prison to receive mercy, and to hold our decision-makers and lawmakers accountable for their roles in perpetuating a legal system infested with racism and cruelty. Dennis and Lee Horton, and so many other incredible people serving unjust and merciless sentences, should not die in Pennsylvania’s prisons. But without action by those in power, they most likely will. This is not justice, but a moral stain on our commonwealth.</p>
