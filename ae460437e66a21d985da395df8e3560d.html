<h1>Obituary // Richard M. Hunt, Alcoa heir and Pittsburgh philanthropist, dies at 93 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Richard M. Hunt, an heir to the Alcoa fortune who pursued a career in academia at Harvard University instead of the family aluminum business, and who maintained a lifelong connection to Pittsburgh through philanthropy, died Friday in Lincoln, Mass.</p>
<p>He was 93 and died of natural causes, according to a statement from the Roy A. Hunt Foundation, Downtown.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt was one of the founding trustees of the foundation that was named for his father, a president of Pittsburgh-based Alcoa for 30 years.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt’s grandfather, Captain Alfred Hunt, co-founded the Pittsburgh Reduction Co. in the 1880s after acquiring a patent to smelt aluminum. The firm later became the industrial giant Alcoa which is now headquartered on the city’s North Shore.</p>
<p>Richard Hunt, the youngest of Roy Hunt’s four sons, grew up in a mansion called Elmhurst on Ellsworth Avenue in Shadyside.</p>
<p>He attended Shady Side Academy’s grade school and the school’s high school before transferring to St. Paul’s School, a college prep school in Concord, N.H., from which he graduated in 1944.</p>
<p>At age 18, he tried to enlist for service in World War II but failed the U.S. Army’s vision test. So he joined the American Field Service in India, where he drove ambulances and treated soldiers wounded in the Asia-Pacific.</p>
<p>After the war, he earned a bachelor’s degree from Yale University and a master’s degree from Columbia University.</p>
<p>From 1951 to 1955, Mr. Hunt worked for Free Europe Press, an agency that supplemented the work of Radio Free Europe.</p>
<p>During that time, while living in New York City, he met and married his wife, Priscilla Stevenson Hunt.</p>
<p>After earning a doctorate in history from Harvard in 1960, Mr. Hunt joined the university’s faculty where over a four-decade career, he taught social studies and history, including courses on Nazi Germany and leadership.</p>
<p>He also served as assistant and associate dean in the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, and for 20 years was university marshal, a job in which he organized university events, awarded honorary degrees and hosted visiting dignitaries including Nelson Mandela.</p>
<p>He also served as president of the American Council on Germany, a New York-based nonprofit, for 40 years.</p>
<p>Steve Sokol, current president of the organization, said Mr. Hunt was, “passionate about strengthening ties and building trust between Germany and the U.S.”</p>
<p>Though two of his older brothers became Alcoa executives and another worked for Mellon Bank, Mr. Hunt said he was never pressured to work for the family enterprise or return to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“My father was very pleased that one son decided to do something else and he thought teaching was a wonderful profession,” he told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in 2015. “My mother … was very pleased, too.”</p>
<p>He stayed connected to Pittsburgh through holiday visits and his involvement as a trustee of the Roy A. Hunt Foundation which supports agencies involved in community development, youth violence prevention, the environment and international development.</p>
<p>The foundation’s assets totaled $75 million for the fiscal year that ended in May 2019, and it paid out $3.5 million in grants that year.</p>
<p>In 2015, Mr. Hunt and his wife made a $15-million gift to the Pittsburgh Foundation to establish the Buttonwood Fund, named after one of Mrs. Hunt’s childhood homes in Connecticut.</p>
<p>The gift is the largest one-time contribution ever made by living donors to the community foundation based Downtown.</p>
<p>“This is where a lot of the money was made through Alcoa and through investments in Pittsburgh-area businesses,” Mr. Hunt told the Post-Gazette when the couple created the fund.</p>
<p>“We want to make gifts that we think would be good for Pittsburgh, and good for the world,” he said.</p>
<p>The Hunts targeted some of their fund for the Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and some for other causes including the Southern Poverty Law Center, FamilyAid Boston, and Oberlin College, where Mrs. Hunt’s father was a president.</p>
<p>Their son, William Hunt, president and chief executive of Elmhurst Group, a Pittsburgh real estate and investment firm, told the Post-Gazette when his parents made the gift to the Pittsburgh Foundation that they were “very proactive in their philanthropy.”</p>
<p>“They want to be part of the solution, meet with organizations, understand the needs and feel more engaged in the process,” said William Hunt. “They don’t want just a passive role.”</p>
<p>Lisa Schroeder, president and chief executive of the Pittsburgh Foundation, said the&nbsp;bequest from the Hunts &nbsp;“was distinguished in terms of generosity, but equally by the active ways that the family has participated in philanthropy as donors.”</p>
<p>“Richard set an example of thoughtfully steering grants to causes and organizations he believed would make lasting contributions – leading and inspiring others to do the same,” said Ms. Schroeder.</p>
<p>Mr. Hunt was also a founding board member and vice chair of the National Center for Family Philanthropy.</p>
<p>Outside of work and charitable causes, he attended theater and opera performances, magic conventions, and played tennis until his late 80s.</p>
<p>“Our father defined ‘Renaissance Man,’ ” said his son. “He read and studied nearly every conceivable subject from ancient cultures, modern politics, and the strategy of the previous night’s Red Sox game. Most importantly, he was always interested in listening to others about their own interests and experiences. Everyone who knew him was dazzled by his unbounded intellectual curiosity.”</p>
<p>Maxwell King, retired president of the Pittsburgh Foundation, called Mr. Hunt “a great benefactor to the Hunt ancestral home of Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>“But when I think of him,” said Mr. King, “I think of the powerful but gentle grace he brought to conversation.”</p>
<p>In addition to his wife and son, survivors include two daughters, Helen Hunt Bouscaren of Cambridge, Mass., and Susan Hunt Hollingsworth of Cleveland; and eight grandchildren.</p>
<p>A memorial service will be held at a future date.</p>
<p>Contributions may be made to the American Council on Germany or the Posse Foundation.</p>
