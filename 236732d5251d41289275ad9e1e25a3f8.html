<h1>IUP, Indiana hospital team up to analyze COVID-19 test results</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Indiana Regional Medical Center is collaborating with Indiana University of Pennsylvania to provide COVID-19 testing while promising same-day results.</p>
<p>Narayanaswamy Bharathan, chair of the Department of Biology at IUP, will analyze tests using equipment from his IUP lab, which has been certified by the state Department of Health and moved to the hospital. The first tests will be run Monday.</p>
<p>During a nine-hour day, Mr. Bharathan anticipates doing 200 tests.</p>
<p>“Bringing testing in-house will be a game-changer for people we serve,” IRMC President and CEO Stephen Wolfe said in a statement. “The ability to work with IUP to combine our amazing people has never been more evident.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bharathan, who will be issued protective gear by the hospital, will also train IRMC staff in the maintenance of the lab equipment. His involvement in COVID-19 testing came from a desire to help the community during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I just felt that it was imperative that I jump into this work,” he said in a statement. “It’s the best way that I can help during this crisis.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bharathan specialized in molecular virology for his doctorate degree.</p>
<p>COVID-19 tests with a rapid turnaround time have been in short supply throughout the U.S. IRMC had been waiting up to seven days for COVID-19 test results, Mr. Wolfe said.</p>
