<h1>Ruth Ann Dailey: The future of the Columbus statue — and harmony</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What a relief that there will be an orderly process to consider — or to appear to consider — the future of the Schenley Park statue of Christopher Columbus.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto asked the Pittsburgh Art Commission on Tuesday to launch this process, and the commission voted unanimously on Wednesday to comply. Such alacrity bodes well.</p>
<p>Peaceable citizens can reasonably hope this will allay any vandalism in the intervening weeks and that through the public hearing process the will of the people, whatever it is, might at length prevail. Our history belongs to all of us; a small faction should not have the power to decide which parts are preserved, erased or rewritten.</p>
<p>To reach a just decision, it matters who speaks, who deliberates and what opinions are given the greatest weight.</p>
<p>When in 1492, as the children’s rhyme goes, “Columbus sailed the ocean blue,” his daring voyage sparked the European conquest of the Americas. That conquest eventually included warfare, mass murder, forced labor, looting and slavery.</p>
<p>The least serious charge against Columbus is spreading diseases that decimated indigenous tribes. Since well into the 19th century people still believed illness came from the body’s “humours” and opening patients’ veins was a cure, explorers couldn’t possibly know they were infecting others through travel (unlike those sharing COVID-19 in our enlightened times).</p>
<p>Moral culpability hinges on knowledge. Columbus had to know that murder and torture were immoral. In fact, word of his brutality reached King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella, who removed him as governor of the colony and launched an investigation into his crimes.</p>
<p>That is to say, Columbus’ sins were well known even in his day. So why were statues to him erected all over the Americas anyway? Probably because we like to celebrate stories of daring and bravery. Not many of us would cross an ocean in a small wooden ship seeking a new route to Asia.</p>
<p>Columbus may be one of the least-worthy men ever memorialized, unless you include most of the Roman emperors; quite a few kings, queens, czars and khans; and a sprinkling of popes. But their public images remain and are tourist attractions.</p>
<p>Some say it is important to strip away myths and “re-contextualize” these flawed figures. I agree, and reassessment cuts both ways. Those who would topple statues cannot ignore the context in which these men lived.</p>
<p>What was the world like back then? In 1480, the Ottomans were invading Italy and beheading Christians who wouldn’t convert to Islam. Not to be outdone, the Spanish launched the Inquisition.</p>
<p>In 1483, Andalusia expelled all Jews, and in England, lots of princes named Richard and Edward deposed and/​or killed one another, no matter how young. In 1484, the year Columbus began seeking a financial backer, Pope Innocent VIII expanded the Inquisition into Germany.</p>
<p>History. It’s not pretty. And no one is “innocent.” How wrong can you be about anything and still deserve to be remembered?</p>
<p>To make such a weighty decision about a statue at Schenley Park, we need to hear from representatives of each strand of our entwined history. We need someone who can speak for the native peoples of the Caribbean, as well as the Spanish and the Italians, don’t you think? They can argue for and against this man who died 514 years ago.</p>
<p>This isn’t only about competing ethnicities, though. It is a moral judgment, so a devout follower of each major religion should contribute, as well as a principled secularist. I’d enjoy watching someone defend Columbus under the banner of moral Darwinism — “To the victor go the spoils! Survival of the fittest, baby!” — but those Wall Street types are too busy to fly to Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Forgive my flippancy. This issue is both silly and serious. The Columbus conversation itself is “re-contextualization” and is sufficient to address sins of long ago.</p>
<p>We, like our predecessors, are flawed people living in harmony and conflict. If we worked maturely together through a morally complex issue that is safely in the past, maybe we could achieve more harmony and less conflict here and now.</p>
