<h1>Scammer using naked photos impersonates Allegheny County police to get money</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A scammer allegedly used a dating app to impersonate an Allegheny County police officer and extort a local resident, using alleged underage nudes as a threat, the county warned Friday.</p>
<p>The unidentified victim, whose address is unknown, was using the Hily dating app and met a person he thought was a female between the ages of 16 and 18. During a text message conversation, the supposed female sent him unsolicited naked photos, according to county police.</p>
<p>The man deleted the messages and photos but shortly thereafter received a phone call from a man who said he was an Allegheny County police officer who was investigating the man for possession of nude photos of an underage girl.</p>
<p>The impersonator told the victim that he could pay a&nbsp;“waiver fee” to the girl’s father to avoid prosecution. A man with a Georgia area code then called the victim and identifying himself as Michael Dunbar, the girl’s father, and demanded $1,250 via cash app and&nbsp;“money cards,” which Allegheny County police said are&nbsp;“untraceable.”</p>
<p>The victim contacted county police Thursday after realizing the situation was a scam.</p>
<p>“The Allegheny County Police will never, under any circumstances, request monetary payments from suspected criminals to avoid criminal prosecution or further investigation,” the agency said Friday in a news release.</p>
<p>The victim’s age and whether he actually paid the money are unclear.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police could not be reached for further comment.</p>
