<h1>Levin operations, employees not impacted by layoff notice, company says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Levin Furniture stores and its employees will not be affected by a layoff notice filed with the state Department of Labor and Industry, a company spokeswoman said Monday.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry on Monday posted a Worker Adjustment Retraining Notification (WARN) stating that Sam Levin Furniture was terminating 53 employees at its Smithton, Westmoreland County headquarters.</p>
<p>Levin spokeswoman Kimberly Tuscan explained that the layoffs come from the liquidation of seven Wolf Furniture stores in Maryland and one in Virginia. Nine Wolf locations in Pennsylvania will remain open, with stores in Johnstown, Altoona, State College, Harrisburg, Mechanicsburg, Lancaster, Hanover, York and Chambersburg.</p>
<p>Levin Furniture and Johnstown-based Wolf Furniture, which had been acquired by Midwest furniture giant Art Van, both faced liquidation last week before Robert Levin was able to reacquire Levin Furniture and save some 1,200 jobs.</p>
<p>But he was not able to buy all of the Wolf Furniture stores, Ms. Tuscan said.</p>
<p>“A WARN notice is required to be sent to any location within a company experiencing potential layoffs, restructuring, etc. that has 50 or more employees working at the same location,” she explained via email.</p>
<p>“Since our corporate office is the only location which has more than 50 employees, the WARN notice is required to be sent regardless if it affects anyone at that particular location. Which in this case, it does not affect any of us.”</p>
