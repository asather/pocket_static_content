<h1>Belle Vernon Area teachers, district plan 'last-ditch' negotiation hoping to avoid strike</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Belle Vernon Area Education Association said it will hold a negotiation session with the school district Thursday night in a&nbsp;“last-ditch” effort to avoid a strike.</p>
<p>The education association, which represents 161 teachers, nurses, counselors and education specialists in the Belle Vernon Area School District, issued a strike notice last week.</p>
<p>A work stoppage would begin Friday if the sides do not reach an agreement on a contract.</p>
<p>The association and the school district have been negotiating a contract since January 2019. Teachers have been working without a contract since June 30.</p>
<p>The sides met for nearly eight hours on Wednesday, but they could not reach an agreement.</p>
<p>“If there is no agreement and we are forced to walk, our team will have a clear conscience that we tried everything we could,”&nbsp;BVAEA President Daneen Watson said in a statement.&nbsp;“For negotiations to work, both sides have to want to settle. It appears the board’s team just wants to win.”</p>
<p>But the school board said it must balance the financial demands of the teachers with the demands on district taxpayers, who have faced tax increases over the past several years.</p>
<p>"The Belle Vernon Area School District Board and the BVAEA met for over seven hours Wednesday evening under the supervision of a state mediator in an attempt to reach a settlement and divert a strike which the teachers called for Friday. Despite much effort, no agreement was reached,” district solicitor Ira Weiss said in a statement.</p>
<p>“The board must balance the financial demands of the teachers, among the highest paid in the area with the very real financial demands on the district taxpayers who have received increases in taxes for the past several years,” he said. “The board and teachers will meet this evening to attempt to resolve this matter at the table and not through the media."</p>
