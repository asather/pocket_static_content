<p>Central Catholic High School’s football team will have its first official practice in full pads Monday afternoon. But one of the Vikings’ star players, who is also one of the best in the state, won’t be putting on the practice gear.</p>
<p>In fact, Elliot Donald has decided not to put on the pads all season.</p>

<p>Totten said he and his staff learned of Donald’s decision last week. Central Catholic started school Monday under a hybrid model, with each half of the student body attending in-person classes two days a week. Totten said Donald chose to take all classes on line.</p>
<p>“Again, this is a personal decision and that’s the last I want to say about it,” Totten said.</p>

<p>Heat acclimatization practices started for all teams in Pennsylvania Aug. 24. All teams must go through five consecutive days of heat practices. Teams put on full pads for the first time Monday. Central Catholic, projected to have one of the top Class 6A teams in the state, will start the season with a game against Canon-McMillan Sept. 11.</p>
