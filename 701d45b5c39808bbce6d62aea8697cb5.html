<h1>Jake Hoffman leads Mt. Lebanon over Bethel Park in boys basketball playoffs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jake Hoffman scored 40 points in a WPIAL quarterfinal game Saturday.</p>
<p>Afterward, he only had one thing on his mind.</p>
<p>Milkshakes.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon has a longstanding tradition of going to Sarris Candies in Canonsburg for milkshakes after certain WPIAL playoff games, something they did Saturday since they were playing at nearby Canon-McMillan High School.</p>
<p>Hoffman said he would likely order cookies and cream, appropriate considering his unforgettable performance helped defending Class 6A champion Mt. Lebanon cream Bethel Park, 70-48.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon’s third win against section rival and No. 6 seed Bethel Park (14-9) advances the No. 3 seed Blue Devils (17-6) to the semifinals for the third year in a row. They will face No. 8 Central Catholic (14-10), which upset No. 2 Fox Chapel, 42-34, earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Hoffman’s afternoon was anything but vanilla. A 6-foot-3 senior guard, Hoffman is one of the top players in the WPIAL and came in averaging 21 points per game. He had scored 30 points in four consecutive games to begin the season, which had stood as his career high until he increased it by 10 on Saturday. He outscored Bethel Park by himself in the first half, pouring in 28 points to propel Mt. Lebanon to a 40-20 halftime lead.</p>
<p>“He was unbelievable,” Bethel Park coach Josh Bears said. “Obviously we knew he could play. We’ve seen him for years now. He made us pay for every mistake early and made every opportunity that we gave him. And then he also made contested shots. I don’t even think we did that bad of a job on him at times. He was unbelievable. He was in the zone. He had 28 points in the first half. We’re sitting there down 20 and I said in the locker room, ‘I don’t even think we’re playing that bad. He’s just playing that well.’”</p>
<p>Added Mt. Lebanon coach Joe David: “He played the game and it came to him. He didn’t force very much. He started getting hot and when he gets hot, he’s a heck of a player.”</p>
<p>Hoffman finished 15 of 20 from the field and 5 of 6 from the free-throw line. He made five 3-pointers, but also scored on driving layups, jump shots and putbacks. He reached 40 points with 2:50 left in the fourth quarter and was promptly taken out of the game, getting a big applause from Mt. Lebanon supporters.</p>
<p>“I knew I was close. I just wanted to take that shot to get 40 because that’s a big milestone for me. Once I got that I was pretty excited because that’s a big step for me,” said Hoffman, who earlier in the week committed to the College of Wooster.</p>
<p>Hoffman’s stellar shooting was contagious. As a team, Mt. Lebanon shot 56% from the field (25 of 44) and connected on eight 3-pointers, the final three coming at the beginning of the third quarter during an 11-0 run that ballooned Mt. Lebanon’s lead to 51-20.</p>
<p>Blaine Gartley, who returned to the lineup after missing the previous two games with a concussion, was the other Mt. Lebanon player scoring in double figures, finishing with 13 points.</p>
<p>Gartley is Mt. Lebanon’s second-leading scorer this season, but on this day, he passed up some good looks in order to get the ball to the hot-handed Hoffman.</p>
<p>“When he knocked down his first couple, I knew it was his night. I just had to feed him,” Gartley said. “Coach said in the locker room, ‘Find the well.’ He was hitting shots and that really boosted us to give us that cushion.”</p>
<p>Tommy DiRienzo, who scored 51 in a game this season, and Dolan Waldo led Bethel Park with 10 points apiece. Leading scorer Ryan Meis (22 points per game) was held to eight. The Black Hawks, who lost to Mt. Lebanon by two and 35 points in the regular season, now need the Blue Devils to win the championship in order to secure a spot in the PIAA tournament.</p>
<p>“We played them so well at our place,” said Bears. “We had an eight-point lead on them late in the fourth quarter, but came up short. Gartley made a couple free throws to win it. So we felt like we could play with them. We really did. Jake Hoffman was just the difference maker today.”</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon now turns its attention to Central Catholic, which handed the Blue Devils a 61-56 loss Dec. 21.</p>
<p>“We played them at Montour and they got us,” David said. “It’s going to be a good opportunity for us to try to get one back, but they’re a very good team. [Brian] Urso is doing a really nice job in coaching them. It’s going to be a good game. I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
