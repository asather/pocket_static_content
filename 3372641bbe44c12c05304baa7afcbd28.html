<h1>First juror chosen for 2016 Wilkinsburg mass shooting trial</h1>

<p>The first juror has been selected for the trial of two men accused of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/05/Trial-starts-2016-Wilkinsburg-mass-slaying-shooting-pittsburgh-Cheron-Shelton-robert-thomas/stories/202001040001" target="_blank">gunning down five people and an unborn child</a> at a 2016 Wilkinsburg cookout.</p>
<p>Prosecutors and defense attorneys on Monday began the process of selecting a jury at the Allegheny County Courthouse in the case against&nbsp;Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington, and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood. They started with a panel of 20 prospective jurors.</p>
<p>After interviewing the first potential juror for about 45 minutes, they chose him. The juror is a medical equipment repairman who is Catholic and a Vietnam War veteran.</p>
<p>The man said he was not familiar with the case other than hearing about it on TV around the time that it happened on March 9, 2016.</p>
<p>Shelton and Thomas are accused of killing siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26. Three others were wounded including a man who was paralyzed.</p>
<p>The trial&nbsp;is expected to feature the testimony of several dozen witnesses and last at least three weeks in the guilt phase. If the men are found guilty of first-degree murder, the case will continue in the penalty phase as prosecutors seek capital punishment.</p>
<p>Judge Edward J. Borkowski is presiding over the trial. He gave introductory remarks to the jury pool and then left.</p>
<p>Handling the questioning for the prosecution were Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky&nbsp;and Assistant District Attorney Lisa Pellegrini. Defense attorneys Randall McKinney and Wendy Williams interviewed the jurors on behalf of their client, Shelton, while Casey White and Michael Machen did the same for Thomas.</p>
<p>Both defendants arrived in dress shirts — light blue for Shelton, black for Thomas —&nbsp;buttoned to the top and gray slacks.</p>
