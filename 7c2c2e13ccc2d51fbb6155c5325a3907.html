<h1>A 622-page climate change bill aims to transform industry. What does it mean for Pittsburgh?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — A year after Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez unveiled the Green New Deal before a cheering crowd, a group of lawmakers gathered in a staid committee room on Capitol Hill in front of signs reading&nbsp;“100% Clean Economy by 2050” and&nbsp;“Net Zero Carbon Pollution by 2050.”</p>
<p>The signs at the January press conference summed up the core goals of sweeping climate change legislation, called the Clean Future Act, introduced by Democrats on the House Energy and Commerce Committee. The bill,&nbsp;which contained eight broad governing sections ranging from the industrial sector to environmental justice,&nbsp;was the product&nbsp;15 hearings addressing climate change&nbsp;held by the committee last year.</p>
<p>The bill, if passed by the Democratically-controlled House, is all but certain to die in the Republican-controlled Senate and face opposition from President Donald Trump. House Republicans have proposed planting 3.3 billion trees over the next 30 years as a carbon-cutting measure.</p>
<p>The bill also sets up a potential <a href="/said%20Jason%20Walsh,%20it%20executive%20director." target="_blank">clash among House Democrats</a> ahead of the 2020 elections over proposals to move swiftly to lower carbon emissions without harming carbon-intensive industries. Democratic officials sometimes have split on how to address — or <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/environment/2019/11/09/peduto-fitzgerald-climate-action-summit-pittsburgh-cracker-plant-potter-beaver-county/stories/201911090049" target="_blank">whether to ban entirely</a> — the petrochemical industry, natural gas drilling and coke-making for the steel industry.</p>
<p>The Green New Deal, which was supported by 60 lawmakers and several Democratic presidential candidates at its unveiling, calls for a carbon-neutral economy by 2030. It aimed to solve two emerging calamities: a climate crisis and an economic crisis driven by income inequality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The broad framework received a lukewarm reception from some Democrats and labor groups. The AFL-CIO said it “makes promises that are not achievable or realistic,” while<strong>&nbsp;</strong>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told Politico early last year the Green New Deal was a “suggestion.”</p>
<p>“It will be one of several or maybe many suggestions that we receive,” Ms. Pelosi said. “The green dream or whatever they call it — nobody knows what it is, but they’re for it, right?”</p>
<p>Proponents of the Clean Future Act argued the legislation builds on the goals of the Green New Deal. Forged through the hard work of the legislative process, the&nbsp;<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/sites/democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/files/documents/0128%20CLEAN%20Future%20Discussion%20Draft.pdf" target="_blank">622-page bill</a>&nbsp;is grounded in reality, they said, by reforming a number of federal agencies with collaborative standards.</p>
<p>“This is based on the gold standard of what the scientific consensus is,” Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said in a recent interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle, a top member of the committee, has sponsored legislation to extend a tax credit to developers of large-scale batteries&nbsp;that can hold and distribute electricity from wind turbines and solar farms. The lack of energy storage technology has hampered the growth of those intermittent sources of power, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle also has pushed for energy efficiency in national building codes and scale up electric vehicles, he said, focusing on the construction and transportation sectors as sources of greenhouse gas emissions — and a way to broker compromise. The bill includes $4.5 billion annually to spur a transition to electric vehicle fleets.</p>
<p>“Many things in the bill could get bipartisan support right away,” Mr. Doyle said. “We’re moving to the electrification of our transportation system. I don’t think that’s controversial.”</p>
<p>The bill establishes a federal clean electricity standard, requiring&nbsp;retail electricity suppliers to provide an increasing percentage of clean electricity each year from 2022 until they reach 100% in 2050. It also allows suppliers to buy and trade credits, which would increase in price annually, according to the bill.</p>
<p>Importantly, Mr. Doyle said, states can craft their own clean energy plans under the bill, which calls out nuclear, hydropower and geothermal sources as acceptably “clean.” Nuclear is a major source of power in Pennsylvania, though several plants, including the Beaver Valley Nuclear Power Station, have come under financial pressure.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t dictate one plan for the whole country,” Mr. Doyle said.</p>
<p>In the industrial sector, the bill would promote technology that captures carbon before its release into the atmosphere and inject it into underground wells. Carbon capture and storage is a major tenet of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/08/Oil-gas-industry-fracking-shale-drilling-Pittsburgh-messaging-campaign-pennsylvania/stories/202001080044" target="_blank">American Petroleum Institute’s messaging campaign</a> on climate change this year.</p>
<p>The technology, still commercially unproven, likely would expand fossil fuel research at the National Energy Technology Laboratory in South Park.</p>
<p>Some provisions still could prove difficult to sell to carbon-focused industries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill calls for annual greenhouse gas emissions reductions from the auto sector — at least 6% annually for lighter vehicles and 4% annually for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. Aircraft engines would be required to reduce emissions 50% by 2031.</p>
<p>The bill directs the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to consider climate change when making decisions to approve oil and gas pipelines.</p>
<p>At a hearing this month, Rep. Frank Pallone, D-N.J., chair of the Energy and Commerce Committee, questioned the need for the Mountain Valley and Atlantic Coast pipelines, both of which carry natural gas from West Virginia south to the mid-Atlantic region.</p>
<p>“I am concerned FERC is simply approving duplicative pipelines, with 60-year lifespans, under the guise of ‘market need’ even when those pipelines are not really necessary,” Mr. Pallone said.</p>
<p>The bill also would shut down coal ash impoundments that were not constructed with protective liners to prevent ash from seeping into groundwater and strengthen permitting requirements. Coal ash is a major source of pollution in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Steel industry lobbyists are quietly worrying about the various proposals to eradicate carbon or make it more expensive. Unlike the power sector that can burn a non-carbon fuel, “our product is made from carbon,” noted one steel lobbyist who spoke on the condition of anonymity.</p>
<p><strong>A nod to workers</strong></p>
<p>Labor groups are still assessing the bill. Spokespeople for the AFL-CIO did not return a request for comment last week.</p>
<p>In a nod to workers, the bill directs the Energy Department to provide grants for job training in the renewable energy sector and requires all building projects funded under the plan to use American-manufactured materials like steel — unless doing do would raise project costs by more than 25%.</p>
<p>The BlueGreen Alliance — a coalition of labor unions and environmental organizations founded by the United Steelworkers and the Sierra Club — is supportive and plans to advise the committee, said Jason Walsh, its executive director.</p>
<p>Mr. Walsh pointed out the bill’s commitment to replace leaky natural gas pipelines, which would cut down on methane emissions while creating tens of thousands of jobs. A provision to require&nbsp;infrastructure projects to use materials that are manufactured in a climate-friendly manner is modeled on the group’s “Buy Clean” policy, which recently passed in California.</p>
<p>The legislation “moves us exactly in the right direction,” Mr. Walsh said.&nbsp;</p>
