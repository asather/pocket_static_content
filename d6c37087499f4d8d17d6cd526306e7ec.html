<h1>Gene Therapy: A knife, a bomb, a trash compactor -- if only there were a story</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Christine luxuriates in a bathtub filled with bubbles, surrounded by lighted white candles, consuming red wine with apparent momentum.</p>
<p>An opera is playing softly in the background, and as the tempo falls and the music darkens, the doorway behind Christine suddenly generates a flashpoint; it’s candlelight ricocheting off the blade of a long knife, and in walks . . . Eva Longoria?</p>
<p>All right what the hell is happening on “The Young and the Restless”?!</p>
<p>I picked a terrible week to try and get back into this, not that I was ever really into it, but I owned, at least, a kind of rickety understanding gleaned from almost four decades of occasionally rolling through the intersection of my wife and “The Young and the Restless,” and from overhearing my wife’s conversations with her mother about “The Young and the Restless” in which they would fill in plot points either of them had missed, lament the patent stupidity of various narratives, or chide the writers for their congenital inability to get to the point.</p>
<p>I thought I knew some basics about a few longstanding characters: Victor Newman – bad, Jack Abbot – good, Nicky Newman – drunk. Katherine Chancellor – dead. Acting chops required for any particular role, minor or major – minimal.</p>
<p>My wife said this analysis contained a high ignorance factor, but agreed to help me catch up as we both work from home and the Hunker Games have entered their 12th week.</p>
<p>Alas, it’s impossible, because Y&amp;R this week was running random, ancient episodes, all out of sequence. Brilliant. The last fresh episode was broadcast April 23 and it appears the remaining days of our lives will be spent in an eerie hallway of soapy funhouse mirrors reflecting dim memories and unsatisfied suspicions.</p>
<p>Or something.</p>
<p>Apparently Christine is in the tub sometime in 2003, when Ms. Longoria was playing Isabella. As Isabella steps out of the shadows and begins to unwind a laborious tale of deceit, jealousy, vengeance, and, I thought at one point, her love for the Florida Marlins, the dialogue crackles:</p>
<p>Isabella: “Do you want to hear the rest of the story, or do you want me to cut your throat.”</p>
<p>Christine (haltingly): “Rest of the story.”</p>
<p>Good answer.</p>
<p>But Christine is really groggy now, whether from some drug Isabella has already deployed, or from the wine, or from this story that’s going nowhere but that Isabella’s been telling for the entire episode.</p>
<p>This was when it occurred to me that when somebody named David Kimble was killed in a trash compactor the day before, Y&amp;R missed a great opportunity to rethink the entire theatrical basis of the show. When that episode ended in 1991, the producers had no compunctions whatsoever about showing poor Mr. Kimble twisted into a perfect cube with his bloody left arm sticking out as the theme music came up. Had they resolved to do straight gore from that point forward, full Freddy Krueger, the characters that would have been developed over the past 30 years might have been truly fascinating.</p>
<p>Instead, the most fascinating thing about the show remains Victor’s unworldly accent, which has no known origin. Why the hell does he talk like that?</p>
<p>Rather than give Christine a proper slashing, Isabella drowns her, but my wife says she’s not dead.</p>
<p>“How do you know?” I say.</p>
<p>“Because she’s on the show now!”</p>
<p>So that was Tuesday. On Wednesday, the show was from 1993. Someone named Colleen is trapped in a freezer. Trapped there when it starts. Trapped there when it ends. So what of Colleen?</p>
<p>Wife: “Survives this but drowned after being kidnapped by Paul Williams’ crazy sister.”</p>
<p>Our dialogue crackles too, sort of:</p>
<p>Me: “Is Phyllis Jack’s wife?”</p>
<p>Wife: “Now or then?”</p>
<p>Me: “Then.”</p>
<p>Wife: “What year is this?”</p>
<p>Me: “Now or then?”</p>
<p>Wife: “Then.”</p>
<p>Me: “It’s 1993 then.”</p>
<p>Wife: “I can’t remember.”</p>
<p>Me: “Is Sharon Nick’s wife now?”</p>
<p>Wife: “Then? I don’t know.”</p>
<p>Me: “Is that Ashley?”</p>
<p>Wife: “That’s Sharon!”</p>
<p>By Thursday, we were in 2005. Sheila, a recurring psychopath, has escaped from a mental institution and is in the process of killing Lauren by blowing up the yacht she is on. Lauren is trying to provide some context on Sheila’s insanity to Tom Fisher as he tries to duct-tape Lauren below deck. She somehow leaves out the part my wife fills in about how Sheila once had plastic surgery to make her look like Phyllis, then apparently had additional plastic surgery, your standard de-phyllisication, I believe.</p>
<p>Sheila, herself a big fan of duct tape, fastens a bomb to the gas tank of the yacht and blows it up real good. Lauren is still on the show, meaning she survived somehow, but I’ll never find out how and I didn’t go back on Friday because it would probably have been 1999 and everything would have stopped making sense again.</p>
<p>So yeah, I really, really need to see a hockey game.</p>
