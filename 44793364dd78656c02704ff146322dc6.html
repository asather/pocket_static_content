<h1>Pitt is preparing for its most crucial three-game stretch of the season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The way a team appears on paper isn’t always how it exists in the mind of a coach, from the challenges it presents to small wrinkles that can make what seems like an unimposing matchup something significantly more difficult.</p>
<p>Take Georgia Tech. The Yellow Jackets are, by many measurements, a mediocre basketball team, with an 11-12 record and a 5-7 mark in ACC play, with a loss to Ball State and a three-point home win against Bethune Cookman to their name. As he prepares to face them Saturday, Jeff Capel sees something else entirely. As he has noted with other ACC opponents this season, he believes Georgia Tech is better than what its record might indicate. In guards Michael Devoe and Jose Alvarado, he sees a pair of players that complement each other well — and that only goes so far in reflecting the praise he has for them.</p>
<p>“I would rank them up there against anyone in our league,” Capel said Friday. “I think they’re as good, maybe better than any of the backcourts in our league.”</p>
<p>True as those sentiments may be, the Yellow Jackets are — compared to much of the rest of the ACC, even in a down year for the conference — a more manageable opponent. It’s part of what makes the Panthers’ game against them on Saturday that much more important.</p>
<p>With eight regular-season games remaining, Pitt’s ACC schedule has eased up. Of its five games against the league’s ranked teams — Louisville, Duke and Florida State — it has already played four, with only a road game against the Seminoles remaining. Its toughest tests, in many ways, are behind it.</p>
<p>What remains can be measured in varying degrees of difficulty in a conference where, outside of those three top teams, the vast majority of squads are part of an indistinguishable mess. It makes prognosticating how the Panthers will fare that much trickier, but it’s the same eight-game swing that will determine where they go this season.</p>
<p>Saturday’s meeting with Georgia Tech is the first of three consecutive games that are especially crucial for Pitt. They come against teams ranked 81st (Georgia Tech), 97th (Clemson) and 93rd (Virginia Tech) by KenPom.com. The first two of those are at home and even the one on the road comes against a suddenly imploding Hokies team, which has lost four consecutive games, three of which have come against teams ranked outside of the KenPom top 80.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the Panthers’ schedule doesn’t get especially hard, with only the Feb. 18 game at Florida State standing as a matchup in which they’ll be a sizeable underdog. But it features only one team ranked outside of the top 60 on KenPom — and that one game comes on the road, where Pitt is 1-5 against ACC foes this season.</p>
<p>At 14-9 in early February, capitalizing on opportunities like the next three games is of paramount importance to Pitt, which is jockeying for a postseason berth of some kind. As it does so, it will look to avoid the fate of the school’s 2016-17 and 2018-19 teams, which had similar aspirations but faltered in February by going a combined 3-12.</p>
<p>The NCAA tournament isn’t a statistical impossibility, even for a team seemingly allergic to sustained success against quality competition. The Panthers are 83rd in the NCAA’s most recent NET rankings and have just four combined wins against Quad One and Quad Two opponents, with two losses in Quad Three or Quad Four games (Wake Forest and Nicholls State). In a season in which the ACC will do well to get four teams in the tournament, the road there is almost certainly too steep for Pitt, especially with few opportunities remaining for marquee wins.</p>
<p>The National Invitation Tournament, however, remains a viable option. With two more victories, the Panthers will guarantee themselves a winning regular season (the NIT requires teams to have a .500 record or better). Each win added on to that total will only help deliver them to a destination that, two years removed from an 8-24 season, would be an encouraging step in the program’s rebuilding efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Injury notes</strong></p>
<p>Guard Ryan Murphy will be a “game-time decision” for Pitt’s game Saturday against Georgia Tech, Capel said Friday. The junior-college transfer, who is averaging 10.1 points per game and shooting 35.5% from 3-point range, missed the Panthers’ games against Miami and Notre Dame after suffering a concussion in practice last Thursday.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the backcourt, Onyebuchi Ezeakudo will be out for an unspecified (“a little bit,” Capel said) after suffering what Capel said was a sprain in Wednesday’s loss at Notre Dame, an injury that forced him to be carried off the court, unable to put much of any weight on his right foot. The sophomore walk-on is currently on crutches.</p>
