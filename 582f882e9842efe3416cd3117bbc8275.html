<p>State College police are investigating a report of a sexual assault that allegedly occurred last week at Penn State’s Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity.</p>
<p>The unknown victim told “a third party” about the Jan. 15 alleged assault at the frat at 240 E. Prospect Ave. in State College.&nbsp;That person then reported the incident to university police Tuesday morning through an&nbsp;online submission to the university’s sexual assault reporting tool.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, Penn State sent out a Timely Warning of the incident, an action required by the Clery Act to alert the university community of a potential or ongoing threat.</p>
<p>The Alpha Epsilon Pi fraternity is located at 240 E. Prospect Ave.</p>
<p>In a statement provided by Penn State spokesperson Lisa Powers, the university said its Office of Sexual Misconduct is also investigating. Other “appropriate offices” were notified of the assault report and are assisting in contacting Alpha Epsilon Pi leadership and the fraternity’s national organization “to seek more information, as further action is contemplated.”</p>
