<h1>Parents of child who died in fall from Northview Heights window file suit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The parents of a 1-year-old boy, who fell from a third-story window at the Northview Heights Apartments and died from his injuries, are suing the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh for negligence.</p>
<p>The lawsuit, filed Tuesday in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court, also names as defendants the City of Pittsburgh, Gunton Corp., doing business as Pella Windows and Doors; and East End Plumbing and Mechanical Inc.; as well as David Nicholson, doing business as Home Preparation Services; Property Insight LLC and Spedient Inc., which, the lawsuit said, provided inspection services there.</p>
<p>Timothy McNulty, a spokesman for the city of Pittsburgh, said he could not comment on pending legal matters.</p>
<p>Messages left for the other defendants were not returned Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>Hassan Shaban Musa fell from the window in apartment No. 877 about 5:30 p.m. on June 27, 2018. His parents, Shaban Muktar and Amina Lugundi, filed the complaint.</p>
<p>According to the lawsuit, Ms. Lugundi was in the bedroom with her son when she left briefly to walk into an adjacent room. Hassan crawled from the bed onto the window and crawled to the screened in portion of the window and fell to the ground 30 feet below.</p>
<p>The lawsuit alleges that the window lacked or had inadequate locking mechanisms or fall-prevention devices, including screens or window guards, and that the defendants should have known that they posed an unreasonable risk of injury or death.</p>
<p>The complaint also lists eight other unnamed defendants â€” including those people responsible for maintaining the property, as well as those that designed, manufactured and inspected the window.</p>
<p>The lawsuit includes claims for negligence, failing to comply with federal and state statutes and regulations relative to the construction work and building code; wrongful death; negligent infliction of emotional distress</p>
<p>The suit seeks in excess of $50,000 in compensatory damages.</p>
