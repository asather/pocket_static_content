<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Florida company has agreed to acquire for a combined price of $66 million two Pittsburgh-area companies that cultivate, process and distribute cannabis.</p>
<p>Trulieve Cannabis Corp., of Tallahassee, offered McKeesport cultivation and production company PurePenn an upfront payment of $46 million, which includes $27 million in Trulieve subordinate voting shares and $19 million in cash, according to a company statement.</p>
<p>It offered dispensary operator Solevo Wellness $20 million, comprising $10 million in cash and $10 million in Trulieve shares.</p>
<p>Both deals include additional incentive shares, ranging in value between $15 million and $60 million, based on hitting certain financial milestones, according to Trulieve.</p>
<p>The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.</p>
<p>PurePenn operates a 35,000-square-foot cultivation and processing facility that is expanding to 90,000 square feet. The expanded building is expected to be operational by early 2021.</p>
<p>Soleva Wellness operates three dispensaries in the Pittsburgh area. As of the second quarter, it was among only 87 of the potential 198 dispensary locations that were permitted to operate in the state, according to Trulieve.</p>
<p>The size of the cannabis medical market in Pennsylvania was estimated at $420 million in 2019 and it was expected to grow to $575 million by the end of 2020, according to BDS Analytics. Some 330,000 patients in the state use cannabis products for an array of medical problems including arthritis, glaucoma, cancer and autism.</p>
