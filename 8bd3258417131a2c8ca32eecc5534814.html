<h1>Local manufacturers get plea from government to produce masks, ventilators to fight COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The federal government is asking Pittsburgh-area manufacturers for help producing critical medical supplies — including masks, gloves and ventilators— to aid the nation in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>After being contacted by the National Association of Manufacturers on behalf of the White House, the Allegheny Conference on Community Development distributed <a href="https://www.research.net/r/MBQSZMV" target="_blank">an online survey</a> Wednesday morning asking local manufacturers if they could donate or otherwise provide needed supplies within two weeks.</p>
<p>The conference sent the survey to its entire membership “to reach as many of those who have the potential to help as possible,” spokesman Phil Cynar wrote in an email. The membership includes about 300 companies across Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Items needed include cotton swabs on long wooden sticks; endotracheal tubes, falcon tubes, gloves, lightweight protective suits, N95 masks, over-the-shoe booties, PAPRs, rapid PCR test kits, ventilators, vital sign monitors, and viral transport media.</p>
<p>The survey also asked for any outbreak-related supplies or other provisions that companies could donate.</p>
