<h1>Voter registration remains stable in Pennsylvania through the pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With five months to go until the 2020 presidential election, COVID-19 has caused voter registration across the country to rapidly decrease despite predictions for this year’s numbers to topple the 2016 election cycle.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is seeing a steady&nbsp;rate of registrations this year, though.</p>
<p>According to TargetSmart, a Democratic political data and data services firm, Pennsylvania is one of thirteen states seeing a similar number of registered voters compared to March of 2016.</p>
<p>However, registration efforts put on pause in the early stages of the pandemic may have cost the state hundreds of new voters even if there was no clear decline in registrations.</p>
<p>Traveling to schools, malls and using door-to-door canvassing to register new voters was all part of the normal routine for the Beaver County Democratic Committee before March. During the pandemic, though, Terri Mitko, chairwoman of the committee, said the organization wasn’t able to focus on voter registration.</p>
<p>Kevin Tatulyan, executive director of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County, said it’s been&nbsp;“tough” for the committee to operate as usual, because information on those who aren’t registered to vote isn’t readily available for virtual use. Instead, the responsibility to register new voters has relied on people spreading the word in their neighborhoods and social groups. Mr. Tatulyan said he’s unsure of how many potential voters they may have lost.</p>
<p>“It could be thousands, it could be tens of thousands. In the pandemic, people really weren’t thinking about registering to vote,” Mr. Tatulyan said. “It’s still a very important part of our democracy to make sure people who can vote are registered to vote.”</p>
<p>Christian Resch, the president of the University of Pittsburgh College Democrats, said the group registered “hundreds” of people with tabling events throughout campus before the university closed. However, COVID-19 caused them to transition to a virtual setting where they focused on spreading voting location information during the primary.</p>
<p>“[The pandemic] was a devastation to an organization who focuses their goal on canvassing and campaigning in person,” Mr. Resch said. “It stopped a lot of our operations, and we had to learn to overcome and adapt to the times.”</p>
<p>Though canvassing and tabling have been put on hold since March, the virus doesn’t appear to have had a big effect on registrations over the past few months.</p>
<p>“We always see an increase [in voter registration] when there’s an election,” said Melanie Ostrander, director of elections in Washington County, noting a rise in registrations before the primary on June 2. She believes growth will continue towards November. Ms. Ostrander said the county’s registration growth over the past few years is due to a rise in housing developments.</p>
<p>However, COVID-19 may be changing how people register to vote for some time.</p>
<p>Several voter registration offices have noted that more people are registering to vote online or by mail.Tina Kiger, director of elections in Greene County, said it’s been a growing pattern for several years, because it’s “easier” for many than registering in person.</p>
<p>The current political tension could be enough to keep voter registration growing, too. Catherine Lalonde, the chair of the Butler County Democratic Committee said the nature of the election may have been a key factor in keeping voter registrations growing in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot of people are pretty fired up, whether they’re Republican or Democrat,” Ms. Lalonde said.&nbsp;“I think it could go both ways.”</p>
<p>Alec Skomo, president of Duquesne University College Republicans, said policies created during the pandemic that closed businesses and schools are encouraging more Republicans to make it out to the polls.</p>
<p>“It has sort of energized them for the upcoming election to vote those [policymakers] out of office,” Mr. Skomo said.</p>
<p>With the move to the green phase on June 5 for most counties in the region, many organizations are making plans to register voters, which could make up for any loss incurred over the past three months.</p>
<p>Mr. Tatulyan said the Allegheny Republican Committee is looking at an “all of the above approach” to include in person and virtual events throughout the summer and fall. Meanwhile, Ms. Mitko said the Beaver Democratic Committee has set up tables at Black Lives Matter protests where she believes people will be energized to register to vote.</p>
<p>For the Pitt College Democrats, Mr. Resch said the organization looks to utilize&nbsp;“basic grassroots organizing tools” they picked up over the past three months while working to increase engagement in the group virtually.</p>
<p>However, a potential second wave of COVID-19 is keeping others cautious of what the future could hold for voter registration and turnout in November.</p>
<p>“So much could change between now and then depending on the virus. I wish I had a crystal ball,” Ms. Lalonde joked.</p>
