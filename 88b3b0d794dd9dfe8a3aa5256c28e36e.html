<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration on Monday called for state agencies to step up infection-control inspections at nursing home facilities and hike penalties after tallying&nbsp;more than 60,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases and nearly 26,000 deaths linked to the virus.</p>
<p>According to the statistics released Monday, Pennsylvania nursing homes reported 4,776 cases and 2,193 deaths.&nbsp;Yet the national database, which will be available for the public to search on Thursday, does not show the full picture at nursing homes — about 20% of the country’s facilities failed to submit the required reports by the deadline and could face fines.</p>
<p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which regulates the country’s nursing homes, has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/24/Nursing-COVID-19-deaths-rise-challenges-Washington-oversight-of-nursing-COVID-19-response-in-nursing-homes/stories/202005240028?cid=search" target="_blank">come under pressure in recent weeks</a> to address COVID-19 outbreaks affecting some of the most vulnerable populations.</p>

<p>The new guidelines come after CMS officials <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/29/alex-azar-hhs-federal-investigators-covid-19-brighton-nursing-home-beaver-county-coronavirus/stories/202005290109?cid=search" target="_blank">spent three days last month at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center</a> in Beaver County, where the state’s worst nursing home outbreak led to calls for federal authorities to step in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, CMS directed state survey agencies, which are tasked with carrying out nursing home inspections, to hike fines for nursing homes that repeatedly fail to meet standards. Nursing homes with widespread infection control deficiencies and repeat violations could be fined up to $20,000 per instance, according to the agency’s guidance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the agency also criticized states for failing to carry out infection control inspections at every nursing home, as CMS required in March. CMS&nbsp;found that states, on average, had completed&nbsp;infection control inspections at roughly half of its nursing homes.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, just 113 of the state’s 695 nursing homes have been completed as of May 29. That’s a 16% completion rate, and fifth-lowest among all states, according to CMS data released Monday.</p>
<p>The agency has required states complete the surveys by July 31 or risk losing part of their funding allocated by Congress for inspections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re saying, yeah, you need to be doing more inspections,” CMS Administrator Seema Verma told reporters during a call Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There is no substitute for boots on the ground,” Ms. Verma said. “In many of the surveys we have done, we have found that hand-washing continues to be a challenge, and many facilities are not prepared to adequately isolate and cohort patients that have COVID or are suspected of having it.”</p>
<p>At the Brighton facility, Pennsylvania health inspectors documented violations including hand-washing and the improper sharing of equipment between residents who had tested positive and those who had not, Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/05/07/Nursing-home-COVID-19-Brighton-Rehabilitation-Wellness-Center-Conor-Lamb-pittsburgh/stories/202005170005?cid=search" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette last month</a>. The violations had prompted Mr. Lamb, whose district includes Brighton, to ask CMS to send officials to the facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Federal authorities would release their findings soon, said Alex Azar, secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, during an event in Pittsburgh last week.</p>
<p>“If merited, we will certainly demand accountability,” Mr. Azar said.&nbsp;</p>
