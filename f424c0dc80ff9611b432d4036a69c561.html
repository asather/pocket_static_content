<h1>For National Guard troops, a lengthy COVID-19 mission brings job benefits into spotlight</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — On March 6, as the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic was becoming more apparent by the day, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf turned to the camouflage-clad reserve troops known for quick deployments amid&nbsp;myriad natural disasters and public emergencies.</p>
<p>For the Pennsylvania National Guard, the pandemic turned out to be unlike anything it had faced before — far different from snowstorms, floods, hurricanes and even deployments to Middle East war zones. The pandemic was an invisible, unpredictable threat that sickened tens of thousands of people statewide and had thrown millions into unemployment.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is not, for multiple reasons, anywhere near standard call-up,” said Lt. Col. Keith Hickox, a state public affairs officer. “All those other scenarios that we’re called up [to respond to] never stretch the length of time of the COVID-19 operation.”</p>
<p>With the Guard’s COVID-19 mission reaching three months on Saturday, some in Washington have called into question the benefits available to troops who are on the front lines of a health war.&nbsp;The debate highlighted bureaucratic entanglements of the Guard’s state and federal activation orders at a time troops are responding to both the pandemic and, more recently, civil unrest over police brutality.</p>
<p>Last month, Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, joined a bipartisan group of House lawmakers in demanding the Trump administration clarify if it would keep National Guard troops on federally funded deployments rather than state orders.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb signed a pair of letters to the U.S. Department of Defense and introduced&nbsp;the&nbsp;National Guard COVID-19 Earned Benefits Guarantee Act to ensure troops receive full benefits including education, retirement, health care and paid leave. The bill is&nbsp;endorsed by The Reserve Officers Association and the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the United States.</p>

<p>The move followed a Politico report that some Guard troops may see their federal deployment orders end after 89 days — one day short of the 90 days required to receive some benefits, like the GI Bill, Mr. Lamb said in a statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has since announced he intends to extend the orders through mid-August. The U.S. Department of Defense did not return requests for comment.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania National Guard includes about 15,000 reservists of the U.S. Army and U.S. Air Force, troops who usually are activated by governors and are directed by state officials. Guard troops have civilian jobs and often deploy for quick bursts, like a few days or a couple weeks, Lt. Col. Hickox said.</p>
<p>In the early days of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic, Guard members deployed in phases under state active duty orders managed by the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, Lt. Col. Hickox said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With any state emergency, we usually do a quick initial draw to start getting ready, and then, as the emergency plays out, we bring people in,” he said.</p>
<p>The Guard deployment, which peaked at about 1,300 troops, has distributed food, produced cloth masks, transported three dozen quarantined cruise ship passengers and helped to clean and train staff at long-term care facilities. In May, 40 troops deployed to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/18/Pennsylvania-National-Guard-Brighton-Rehab-nursing-home-Beaver-County-will-leave/stories/202005180122?cid=search" target="_blank">assist employees at the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center</a> in Beaver County, one of the country’s largest nursing home outbreaks of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In late March, Mr. Trump began allowing some states’ National Guard troops to operate under federal orders.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Under that federal designation, National Guard troops remain under state control but the federal government pays the cost, which can run as much as $9 million per month per 1,000 troops mobilized, according to the National Guard Bureau.</p>
<p>New York, California and Washington State were the first three states granted federal status on March 22. Pennsylvania was authorized for federalized troops&nbsp;effective April 13. That federal order, which lasted an initial 30 days, was extended twice before Mr. Trump extended it through mid-August.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s office did not return a request for comment for this story.</p>
<p><strong>Federal vs. state benefits</strong></p>
<p>Federalized troops receive all the federal benefits that come with active duty military — including access to Tricare health insurance, higher housing payments, points toward retirement and accrual of GI Bill education benefits.</p>
<p>Guard troops on state active duty orders are “basically working minimum wage with zero benefits,” said Steve Beynon, a sergeant in the Maryland Army National Guard and veteran of the war in Afghanistan, in an interview.</p>
<p>Mr. Beynon, who also writes for the military publication Stars and Stripes, <a href="https://www.militarytimes.com/opinion/commentary/2020/05/22/state-orders-are-a-con-federalizing-the-national-guard-should-be-the-go-to-for-most-missions-moving-forward/" target="_blank">penned a story last month</a> that argued the Trump administration “totally bungled” the National Guard deployment by not federalizing the Guard immediately.</p>
<p>In Maryland, Mr. Beynon’s state stipend was about $700 for the month, a third of the federal active-duty stipend, Mr. Beynon said. If state-activated troops are injured or fall ill, they would have to apply for state workers’ compensation instead of seeking care at a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs hospital.</p>
<p>“Troops went weeks without proper pay and critical benefits,”&nbsp;Mr. Beynon wrote. “It is a confusing, bureaucratic mess of different types of activations, meaning different things for pay and benefits few seem to understand or care about.”</p>
<p>Capt. David Boyles, a spokesman for the Guard's mission at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, said he thinks state benefits in Pennsylvania stack up well with the federal ones. But the COVID-19 deployment&nbsp;“is all new to all us, as it continues to change and unfold.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is new territory,” Capt. Boyles said.&nbsp;“A lot of assumptions are we are the same as active duty and we’re not.”</p>
<p>The COVID-19 deployment has eased slightly from its peak and now stands at just under 1,000 troops statewide, Lt. Col. Hickox said. (Another 2,000 troops have been deployed to George Floyd protests, he said.)</p>
<p>But the Guard’s COVID-19 mission likely will continue for the foreseeable future.&nbsp;On May 29, the Guard announced a new statewide COVID-19 testing task force to assist nursing homes and long-term care facilities in&nbsp;testing residents and staff.</p>
