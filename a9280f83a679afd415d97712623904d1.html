<h1>One of the leaders of ReOpen NC says she tested positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the leaders of a group opposing North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper's stay-at-home measures aimed at slowing the coronavirus spread has identified herself as having tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Audrey Whitlock, who is an administrator on the ReOpen NC Facebook page, posted a message to the group saying she tested positive and that her quarantine period ended on Sunday.</p>
<p>The information was included in a long post where she spoke out against the restrictions Cooper's executive orders have on the state through May 8.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>"As an asymptomatic COVID19 positive patient (quarantine ends 4/26)," Whitlock posted on Sunday, "another concern I have is the treatment of COVID patients as it relates to other communicable diseases. I have been forced to quarantine in my home for 2 weeks."</p>
<p>Attempts to reach Whitlock for comment Sunday and Monday were unsuccessful. The News &amp; Observer's news partner, ABC-11, reported that Whitlock confirmed she tested positive but refused comment when asked whether she attended ReOpen NC's protests in downtown Raleigh the last two Tuesdays.</p>
<p>In the information Whitlock posted on ReOpen NC's private Facebook page, she complained that the quarantine violated her civil rights.</p>
<p>"I have been told not to participate in public or private accommodations as requested by the government, and therefore denied my 1st amendment right of freedom of religion," Whitlock wrote. "If I were an essential employee, I would be denied access to my job by my employer and the government, though compensated, those with other communicable diseases are afforded the right to work. It has been insinuated by others that if I go out, I could be arrested for denying a quarantine order. However, the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination by employers, places of public accommodation, and state and local government entities. . Where do we draw the line?"</p>
<p>Her response drew an emotional reaction from Jodi Wind of Waxhaw, who said her sister had recently died in New Jersey after colon cancer and a positive COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>"I am rather upset/offended by her viewpoint that she feels HER civil rights were violated," Wind wrote in an email to The News &amp; Observer. "Well, what about MY right to live? Has she thought about that at all? Or is she that selfish? Why should she have the ability to go about her business while infecting who knows how many other individuals? My cousin should have turned 64 yesterday, however we had to attend a virtual funeral on Sunday instead."</p>
<p>According to the Centers for Disease Control, breaking a state or federal quarantine is a criminal offense.</p>
<p>ReOpen NC had its third rally Tuesday at the Legislative Building in Raleigh.</p>
<p>Four of the hundreds of protesters, including another ReOpenNC leader — Ashley Smith — were arrested when they stepped onto the sidewalk outside the governor's mansion on Blount Street, violating police instructions.</p>
<p>Protesters gathered around the Capitol Police car and banged on the window as Smith was taken away.</p>
<p>"This is how Nazi Germany started," said her husband, Adam Smith, who was handed bail money by other protesters. Using a bullhorn, he called each officer outside the governor's mansion a "little piggie."</p>
<p>The group, smaller than the number of protesters last Tuesday, honked horns and waved signs that they hope will influence a short session of the state General Assembly that started Tuesday.</p>
<p>State Rep. Michael Speciale, a Republican from Craven County, joined them in a colonial suit with a tri-cornered hat. He said many legislators "bit our tongues through Cooper's order," which he called unconstitutional.</p>
<p>"This is the governor's show now," he said. "He's got to fix it. We can't just come in and override it. We don't have the votes for that."</p>
<p>During a Tuesday news conference, Cooper said he understands that it is "frustrating to be at home so much" and that he feels empathy for "people with families that are hanging by a thread."</p>
<p>At the same time, he said, the time to relax the restrictions has not arrived yet.</p>
<p>"The thing we have to put first and foremost is the public health and safety of North Carolinians," Cooper said. "We have to make sure that things are safe. I'm very eager to move into our phases of reopening. We have a way to look at the indicators to tell us how fast we are going to get there. I hope we move through these as quickly as possible."</p>
<p>For her part, in a subsequent post, Whitlock said she and her husband traveled separately to the west coast earlier this year. A couple of weeks later in February, she said, three in her household became ill.</p>
<p>"We all had severe coughs and I was having trouble breathing at night," Whitlock said, "waking gasping for air."</p>
<p>She said one of her children saw a doctor and was told it was a weak case of the flu. No coronavirus test was performed at that time, she said.</p>
<p>"When they started doing antibody testing (select labs) I went and had one done just out of curiosity to see if what I had in Feb was COVID," Whitlock said. "The test came back positive for COVID and negative for the antibodies, so I had a CDC test performed."</p>
<p>Whitlock said Mecklenburg County's health department never contacted her about the positive test or to check who she had been in contact with.</p>
<p>"So this testing and tracing that Cooper is talking about, I have first hand experience that it did not exist in my case," Whitlock said. "After an abundance of caution I notified my primary care physician who advised me on what to do, and I have been in my house ever since!"</p>
