<p>When Pittsburgh’s movers and shakers need something one-of-a-kind to wear to a fancy gala or wedding, they give designer Diana Misetic a call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the phone is ringing less these days with custom clothing requests now that many events have been canceled because of COVID-19.&nbsp;Rather than putting away her sewing machine, she’s switched to making masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This spring, Ms. Misetic purchased a 6,000-square-foot warehouse in McKees Rocks to be the home for East Eight Co., her new business venture devoted to handmade face masks and other personal protective equipment. The name is a nod to its East Coast location and the building’s number.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The public can browse and buy the masks and filters online at <a href="https://www.easteightco.com/" target="_blank">easteightco.com</a>. Masks are priced at $15 each and a six-pack of filters is $5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I wanted to do something different, something we need in this moment,” Ms. Misetic says.&nbsp;“It’s refreshing.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s also safer than working in a small studio space taking measurements and holding fittings with her custom clothing clients, a process that doesn’t allow for social distancing. She’s keeping her Little Black Dress studio space on Ivy Street in Shadyside, she says, but halting custom work. In the meantime, she’s working on a ready-to-wear line of simple dresses and sporty looks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All masks will be made in the warehouse, where space is plentiful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can keep workers and myself safe from each other,” she says, noting that there’s about 8 feet between each sewing machine. “We all wear masks and are very careful about cleaning.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her couture work has a lot in common with making fabric face masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want something to fit. That’s good technique in couture that I applied to this mask.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Through ample online research and fittings, Ms. Misetic figured out the average distance between people’s ears and from the top to the tip of the nose. As a result, she came up with a couple different sizes for men and women that can be adjusted by how tightly the mask’s strings are tied around the head.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This gives the mask a really good seal so there are no gaps,” she explains,&nbsp;“and when you put your sunglasses or glasses on it’s not going to fog.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comfort and style are important, too. Ms. Misetic sourced a polyester-cotton mix fabric from New York City and incorporated pleats into the masks to allow for more breathing room. There’s also a pocket to insert a filter and a wire piece around the bridge of the nose that can be removed for washing.</p>
<p>The masks come in everyday neutrals to complement people’s clothes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Maybe later on I’ll make some other fashionable masks, but at this moment ... I’m trying as much as I can to make the safest mask possible.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another goal for East Eight Co. is to create job opportunities for the community. So far, it employs two part-time sewers, with the plan to hire more. Her son, Dino, also is involved with marketing the new business.</p>
<p>“Diana’s very good at what she does,” says Sofiya Mozley, one of Ms. Misetic’s former fashion design students at the now-defunct Art Institute of Pittsburgh. She took the part-time position so she can work at East Eight Co. by day and design her own fashion line the rest of the time. Currently, she’s preparing to present two collections at a fashion week in Atlanta in the fall.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a good benefit for me because I can continue to learn” from her, Ms. Mozley says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Misetic also plans to take advantage of the warehouse’s spaciousness by carving out room for photo shoots, a lounge and hopefully events someday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I want to work with the local community,” she says.</p>
