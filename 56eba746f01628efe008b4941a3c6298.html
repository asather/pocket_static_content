<h1>Better baserunning a continued point of emphasis for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before this season started, Pirates manager Derek Shelton talked plenty about wanting to be more aggressive on the bases. It’s one of the reasons they signed veteran outfielder Jarrod Dyson, who five times has stolen 30 or more bases, and why they’ve pushed a few of their current players to take more chances.</p>
<p>More than a third of the way through the season, the Pirates have taken a step backward when it comes to how they’re trying to move forward on the bases.</p>
<p>They had been caught stealing seven times on 14 attempts entering Sunday’s game, which was tied with the Nationals for the second-most in baseball behind the Royals (10). Percentage-wise, the Pirates (.500) were also the second-worst running team behind Washington (6-for-13, .462).</p>
<p>For context, the Pirates from 2015-19 had a success rate of .680 (409 steals on 602 attempts).</p>
<p>“We are addressing it,” Shelton said. “It’s something we’re talking about daily. A couple times they’ve been bad jumps. We’ve had two missed hit-and-runs. But it is something we are addressing and talking about.”</p>
<p>Erik Gonzalez has been the biggest offender, as he’s been caught all three times he’s tried to steal. Adam Frazier ranks second with two, including one Friday night — although Frazier made up for it in the eighth inning on a heads-up play on a ball in the dirt.</p>
<p>Dyson has struggled to get on base and was picked off in a key spot this past Tuesday, but he has had success when stealing; he’s been successful on all three attempts.</p>
<p>“It’s something, quite honestly, we have to continue to get better at,” Shelton said. “It’s something we’ve put a focus on, and we have to make sure we pick the right times and the right situations to go. It’s something that we are focusing on.”</p>
<p>How the Pirates have gone about improving this part of the game isn’t as simple as telling players to not get caught, although that is sound advice.</p>
<p>It can start with the type of read a player gets — how quickly he’s picking up the pitcher’s move toward home plate. There’s also nuance to the length of leads, types of leads, angles and crossover steps to avoid wasted movement, as well as strategy involved with sliding.</p>
<p>It doesn’t show up in stolen bases, but there’s also running smart. One example of that came Friday when Josh Bell went first to third on a single to left because he presumably recognized the left fielder, Christian Yelich, would’ve had to make an awkward throw with a ball in the gap.</p>
<p>Whether it’s with Shelton, bench coach Don Kelly or first-base coach Tarrik Brock — who oversees the running game — these conversations happen after every game, where decisions and actions are reviewed and dissected.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We’ll sit down and have almost a video review with the guy and explain the situation of what we saw, what they think they saw, maybe what the key is of what we saw to run, what the situation is in terms of if we should or should not have run,” Shelton said.</span></p>
<p>“There are a lot of factors, but those are major points of teaching that we’re doing. I think as we continue organizationally moving forward, the baserunning portion of it is going to be an extremely important aspect that we continue to teach.”</p>
<p><strong>Tropeano activated</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates before Sunday’s game recalled right-handed pitcher Nick Tropeano from their satellite camp in Altoona and optioned Nick Mears, who struggled with his control while pitching the ninth inning of Saturday’s game.</p>
<p>“The fact that we had used Mears two of the last three days and the number of pitches he threw [Saturday] night, just getting an active arm, a healthy arm,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Tropeano started the season with the Yankees but was designated for assignment on Aug. 8. The Pirates claimed him three days later.</p>
<p>Tropeano, who did not appear in a game with the Yankees this season, also spent parts of four seasons with the Angels. The 29-year-old will wear No. 72.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">In 42 career big league games (39 starts), Tropeano is 12-14 with a 4.51 ERA.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I think his ability to throw strikes,” Shelton said of what the Pirates like about Tropeano. “That’s the most important thing. And the fact that we think that — I don’t know how quickly — but we think he can give us some length once get we get him stretched out a little bit.</span></p>
<p>“As we’ve talked about, length is extremely important. Those are the things that have stood out.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>Shelton said that Joe Musgrove will throw a side session on Monday at PNC Park. Musgrove has been on the 10-day injured list since Aug. 11 (retroactive to Aug. 9) because of right triceps inflammation.</p>
<p>Also on Monday, Kyle Crick (right lat muscle strain) will throw live batting practice for the third time.</p>
<p>Shelton said that Mitch Keller, who has been on the 10-day IL since Aug. 2 with a left oblique, is still just playing catch.</p>
