<h1>National Guard will help Beaver County nursing home battling COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania National Guard will be offering “staff support” this week at a troubled Beaver County nursing home dealing with the state’s worst COVID-19 nursing home outbreak, the state said Sunday, increasing the state’s efforts to help the facility, which has already had at least 71 residents die from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The guard did an “on-site assessment” at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center on Sunday, said state Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle, and will provide staff support from Monday to May 18.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The facility has contract to bring in additional nursing support from Texas beginning May 18,” Mr. Wardle wrote in an emailed statement. “At that point the guard will exit the facility. There will be a one-day hand off between the national guard and the additional nurse staffing.”</p>
<p>Brighton Rehabilitation’s owners said in a statement, in part: “While we continue to make&nbsp;positive strides in our efforts to control and prevent the further spread of COVID-19, support&nbsp;from the National Guard will allow our facility to get much-needed relief by permitting our nurses and aides to redirect their time and attention to the increasing health needs of our residents. Moving forward, we will continue to take every precaution necessary to keep our residents and our staff as safe as possible and reduce the spread of this unprecedented virus.”</p>
<p>Brighton Rehabilitation, which had about 460 residents when the outbreak there began at the end of March, has had 319 residents test positive for COVID-19, in addition to 22 staff members, according to an analysis of the state’s data posted Sunday.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardle said the state is still working on hiring a temporary manager for the facility, something state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine announced Friday —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/08/State-will-impose-a-temporary-manager-at-troubled-Beaver-County-nursing-home-again/stories/202005080110" target="_blank">the second time the state has said it hired a temporary manage</a>r for Brighton Rehabilitation.</p>
<p>It announced a week earlier that it had appointed a temporary manager there in agreement with the nursing home’s owners, but the owners said that that company — The Long Hill Company —&nbsp;was just a “consultant” and not a manager.</p>
