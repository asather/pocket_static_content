<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Will pro leagues that don't decide to play face any fan backlash?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong>&nbsp;If certain sports leagues don’t start up because some athletes refuse to play, do you think fan backlash will be high, a la MLB after the 1994 strike?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It all depends on the why. If the reason a league doesn’t start up is because they can’t agree on the money, well, yes, it will be devastating long term. And that doesn’t just mean baseball; it means every sport. Now if a league doesn’t start up because of safety concerns or because it is just not possible given all the legal hurdles they have to try and jump through, that will be different. People will understand if health or safety is the issue, but they won’t if it is just about the money.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> What odds do you give Major League Baseball of striking a deal with the players?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I will be utterly shocked if there isn’t baseball this year. There is a whole lot of posturing going on, but at the end of the day, players want to play (and get paid) and owners want to have a season. When both sides are motivated, they can say all the stuff they want publicly, but when they get behind closed doors, I think they will hammer out a deal. I’d say there’s a 90% or more chance of happening.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bobbi:</strong> If baseball plays only 82 games and there are four or six more teams in the playoffs, does that help the Pirates’ chances of making it to the postseason?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think it absolutely helps the Pirates. Fewer games means it is more of a crap shoot. The 162-game grind doesn’t lie, ever. The best teams and deepest teams are always going to have an advantage. A shorter season means that if the Pirates have one of those hot streaks, it may be enough to put them in contention.</p>
<p><strong>Matt:</strong> You make good points about the Steelers, for sure, but do you really think some of the teams you say are better than the Steelers actually are? The Browns, Texans and Titans specifically don’t seem to be better.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The Titans were in the AFC championship last season and finished the season extremely strong. They will be good. The Texans have a dynamic quarterback and a lot of weapons. The Browns addressed their biggest weakness by making a coaching change. I also think Baker Mayfield was humbled last season and will be more mature and more consistent this year.</p>
<p><strong>Jeremy:</strong>&nbsp;If Ben Roethlisberger is 100% healthy headed into the start of the season, do you think the Steelers will still keep three QBs on the active roster?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I do not. I don’t think they will waste a roster spot on a third quarterback now that they didn’t draft one. Paxton Lynch and Devlin Hodges will likely be available to the Steelers if they cut them and then need them a few weeks later. That’s what they did with Hodges last season. And if they aren’t available, they will be able to find the equivalent of those two if they need them.</p>
<p><strong>Andy:</strong> The Steelers at 8-8? Are you stupid or are you just trolling fans and trying to stir the pot? You say and write a lot of dumb things, but your Steelers prediction is the dumbest thing ever.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Thanks for the kind words, and thank you for reading the Post-Gazette and for being a fan of my work. Don’t you think I would write “the Steelers are the greatest” if I wanted to generate clicks? You don’t generate clicks by predicting the home team will be average. Time will tell, as is always the case in the prediction business. I will accept your apology at the end of the season when the Steelers are 8-8.</p>
<p><strong>Frankston:</strong> Who was better relative to their sport: Michael Jordan, Tiger Woods, Muhammad Ali, Wayne Gretzky, Serena Williams, Roger Federer, Jerry Rice or Babe Ruth?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, that is tough. I will go backwards I guess. Ali is considered the greatest for what he was outside of the ring, his social justice stances, his overall persona, his legacy. I think in the ring, he is considered one of the greatest boxers of all time but is not considered universally <em>the</em> greatest boxer. Is Federer even greater than Rafal Nadal, who is one of his contemporaries. Is Jerry Rice greater than Jim Brown? I think this comes down to Gretzky, Jordan, Woods and Ruth. I’d personally go with Woods, and here is why: His 12-year run during his prime was the most dominant stretch by any athlete of all time. The other three just have to settle for being the greatest at their own sport.</p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> How come when you talk about all-time great athletes, you never mention Tony Hawk? He not only is the greatest ever at his sport, but he made his sport what it is today.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;Tony Hawk? Really? My son Elijah, who grew up to be a football player at Pitt, was way into the skateboard thing when he was young. I used to take him down to the skate park by Mckinley Park. Hawk was my sons favorite athlete for a long time growing up. I am also a child of the ’80s and remember when he made skateboarding a mainstream activity. With that being said, I don’t know that&nbsp;“making a sport cool” qualifies as being the greatest of all time.&nbsp;</p>
