<h1>Bethel Park Council OKs $100,000 grant for green space purchase </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bethel Park Council this week approved a $100,000 grant toward the purchase and development of a 40.5-acre green space in the municipality. The money will come from Bethel Park’s general fund budget.</p>
<p>The parcel of land, called Bethel Green, is located at the intersection of Route 88 and Connor Road on the northwest border of Castle Shannon and formerly was used by Mollenaur Mine No. 3 for its discarded dirt and rock from mining operations. </p>
<p>“This is a rare slice of green space in a densely populated area,” Bethel Park Council President Timothy Moury said after Monday’s unanimous vote. “This was a great project — a community effort.” </p>
<p>The money from Bethel Park’s general fund will go to the Allegheny Land Trust, a nonprofit land conservation organization, in a deal to be finalized before the end of March.</p>
<p>The Allegheny Land Trust had been working with the municipality and other local officials on securing the land for nearly a year. The organization has been under contract for the purchase of the property since last summer from owner Pittsburgh Terminal Corp. for a sales price of $750,000.</p>
<p>Allegheny Land Trust has worked over the past year to secure funding through community donations, grants from the Redevelopment Authority of Allegheny County, the state Department of Community and Economic Development, and the state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources as well as the municipality’s donation.</p>
<p>“We’re proud to conserve one of the largest remaining green spaces in Bethel Park for the health, well-being and enjoyment of current residents and future generations,” Tom Dougherty, vice president of external affairs for the Allegheny Land Trust, said in a release.</p>
<p>“It took a real team effort, and ALT is extremely grateful for the support of local residents, Bethel Municipal Council, [state] Sen. Pam Iovino and [state] Rep. Natalie Mihalek.”</p>
<p>Allegheny Land Trust will hold a public event to celebrate the acquisition of the property and discuss plans at a meeting from 6 to 8 p.m. March 11 at Cool Springs Sports Complex, Bethel Park.</p>
