<h1>Pittsburgh reports two more COVID-19 infections; sickened firefighter returns to work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two additional Pittsburgh police personnel have tested positive for COVID-19, bringing the total number of infected officers and recruits to six.</p>
<p>One of the officers who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/06/pittsburgh-police-officer-covid-19-positive-coronavirus-academy-recruits/stories/202004060106?cid=search" target="_blank">tested positive earlier</a> remains hospitalized, but the city said he is improving and hopes to be released soon, according to a news release Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Despite the gravity of that officer’s condition, officials noted that Pittsburgh’s force has been relatively unscathed while other cities’ departments have been hit hard by the novel coronavirus,</p>
<p>“Other departments have seen 10, 15, even 20 percent of their personnel become ill, but we have so far avoided anything like that,” Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said in the news release. “This virus is volatile and dangerous, but we have implemented numerous measures that we hope will continue to keep our numbers as low as possible.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month the New York Times reported that one in six of New York City’s 36,000 police officers was out sick or in quarantine.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich and police Chief Scott Schubert have refused to divulge how many officers and recruits have been in self-isolation as a result of possible exposure. They have also refused to answer numerous questions posed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about how the Bureau of Police has handled the COVID-19 situation.</p>
<p>Three of the four police officers who were initially infected <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/09/pittsburgh-police-covid-19-coronavirus-more-officers-test-positive/stories/202004090137?cid=search" target="_blank">were firearms instructors at the academy’s firing range</a> in Highland Park. A recruit also tested positive. The city decided to continue firing range instruction for a class of 28 recruits before suspending the class last week.</p>
<p>The city did not divulge the duty locations of the two newest infected officers, one of whom was identified as a recruit.</p>
<p>Officials said Friday that the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/01/COVID-19-Pittsburgh-firefighter-tests-positive-for-coronavirus/stories/202004010142" target="_blank">one city firefighter who had tested positive</a> for the highly contagious virus has gone back to work without requiring hospitalization.</p>
<p>Seven other firefighters who were identified as having come into contact with their infected colleague on March 26 — the day before the firefighter experienced flu-like symptoms and went home to self-isolate — have also returned to work after quarantining themselves.</p>
<p>No one from the city’s&nbsp;EMS, Animal Care &amp; Control or Emergency Management departments has tested positive for the virus, the city said.</p>
<p>Public safety personnel have been given masks to wear in public. They are screened before entering facilities. Anyone with a fever or other possible COVID-19 symptoms is sent home.</p>
<p>An&nbsp;Environmental Services worker <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/15/First-pittsburgh-environmental-services-worker-dies-of-COVID-19/stories/202004150093" target="_blank">died this week from COVID-19</a>. The city said a second worker who tested positive was still off work.</p>
