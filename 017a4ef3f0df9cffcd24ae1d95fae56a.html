<h1>Bryan Rust’s hat trick helps Penguins snap 6-game skid against Senators</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two hours before puck drop at PPG Paints Arena — in those uncertain moments when time slows to a crawl and the range of possible outcomes feels endless — Penguins coach Mike Sullivan was asked what his team’s six-game losing streak had done to his club.</p>
<p>Sure, the impact was obvious in the standings. The Penguins had tumbled from the top of the Metropolitan Division to third, just two points ahead of the last wild card spot. But the question was, had there been any similar decline in confidence?</p>
<p>“For players, confidence is fleeting,” Sullivan said. “You can get it back as quick as you lose it.”</p>
<p>That quote was almost prophetic, when rookie defenseman John Marino scored just 48 seconds into the game to jump-start a 7-3 rout over the lowly Ottawa Senators.</p>
<p>From the first minute of the game, Penguins looked very much like a team that had its swagger back. Bryan Rust recorded his third career hat trick to bring his team-leading goal total to 27. Evgeni Malkin tallied four assists on a four-point night. Sidney Crosby and Jason Zucker each posted three-point nights. And Conor Sheary scored in his first game back at PPG Paints Arena in a Penguins uniform since the 2018 postseason.</p>
<p>“Given our situation and other teams in the division – they keep winning too –we definitely needed to win one here,” Rust said.</p>
<p>But to tell the story of this game, it’s probably best to start like the game did, with Marino’s goal. Because in many ways, the stage for the slumpbuster was set by the blue line.</p>
<p>Marino made his return to the lineup for the first time since a Steven Stamkos slap shot broke three bones in his face. Fellow blue liner Brian Dumoulin likewise returned for the first time since lacerating tendons in his ankle on Nov. 30.</p>
<p>With those two out and during the six-game losing streak, the Penguins’ defense has been a common topic of discussion — and dissection.</p>
<p>Forced into less than optimal pairings, the blue liners were overtaxed and at times thrust into roles where they frankly didn’t belong. Now, with two of the team’s four best defensemen back, the production returned too.</p>
<p>The difference was almost instantly obvious. Marino scored on his first shot. Then Brian Dumoulin recorded the primary assist on Sheary’s goal less than a minute later to give the Penguins a 2-0 lead less than 100 seconds into the game.</p>
<p>“That’s the start we wanted,” Marino said. “That’s the start everyone preached before in the room, too. It was good to see everyone responded.”</p>
<p>While the added boost of offense from the blue line was needed for a team that found the back of the net just eight times during the six-game skid, the impact Marino and Dumoulin had on the game went well beyond just the scoresheet. Sullivan rattled off about five or six different areas in particular, including puck poise on breakouts, balance in the defensive pairs, penalty killing and more.</p>
<p>And with a much stronger defensive effort in front of him, Matt Murray stopped 23 of 26 shots to earn his 18th win of the season during his turn in this goaltender rotation.</p>
<p>“There are so many of aspects of the game where they help us,” Sullivan said. “It just makes us a better team when they’re in the lineup.”</p>
<p>Of course, the defense wasn’t the only issue during the six-game skid. The Penguins exorcised many of those demons on Tuesday night, as well, including on the power play and with production from their captain.</p>
<p>The power play was impotent during the losing streak, going just 1-for-18. With less than a minute left in the first period, Rust snapped that slump too when he collected a Malkin pass in the slot and fired it through a Patrick Hornqvist screen.</p>
<p>Crosby has also been critical of his own performance during the slump, as he tallied just a single point and minus-8 rating over the six-game span. He lit the lamp less than three minutes into the second period to extend the lead to 4-1.</p>
<p>Later, Crosby earned his 800th career assist just 36 seconds into the third. The new-look top line, forechecking hard, turned the Senators over just as they were exiting the zone to create a three-on-two. Crosby ripped a pass to Sheary, who found Zucker driving to the net to make it 5-1.</p>
<p>The fans who left at that moment missed two Senators goals that briefly made the third period mildly dramatic. But at least they left with their hats, as Rust tacked on two more late to finalize it and send the caps tumbling from the rafters.</p>
<p>Even after the victory, the Penguins (38-21-6) remain in third in the Metropolitan standings with 82 points. The Capitals (86 points) and Flyers (83) play each other on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Penguins will have their next chance to gain ground on Thursday when they travel to Buffalo, perhaps bringing a renewed sense of confidence with them.</p>
<p>“They’ve got something to show for their efforts,” Sullivan said. “They’ve been playing hard. I have to believe when you score seven goals it has to give our guys a boost of confidence, and it gives us something to build on.”</p>
