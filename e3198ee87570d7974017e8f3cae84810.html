<h1>Penguins pull out late victory over Coyotes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GLENDALE, ARIZ. — Down a goal Sunday, the never-say-die Penguins for the first time in a while weren’t showing much life with a game on the line.</p>
<p>The Arizona Coyotes, one of the NHL’s most suffocating teams, had sucked the air out of their attack. They sat back, kept the Penguins on the perimeter and let just five pucks get through to their goalie in the first 16 minutes of the third period.</p>
<p>Leave it to Brandon Tanev and his obnoxious third line to be the defibrillator.</p>
<p>The winger emerged with the puck from a goal-mouth scrum and with 3:02 remaining in regulation hammered the tying goal between the legs of goalie Adin Hill. The Penguins would win, 4-3, in a shootout at Gila River Arena when Tanev’s linemate, Teddy Blueger, whipped a shot past Hill in the eighth round.</p>
<p>“Last three games, they’ve been huge for us. They’ve bring energy for us. They play north-south, play in the offensive zone a lot,” Evgeni Malkin said. “It’s huge when you have a line like this. … They bring us two points tonight.”</p>
<p>The line of Tanev, Blueger and Zach Aston-Reese has been one coach Mike Sullivan has kept together amid all the team’s injuries, and with good reason. They are a pain to play against, hogging the puck down low and making more talented opponents chase them around. And now they’re scoring big goals.</p>
<p>Tanev had the game-winners in recent wins in Montreal and Las Vegas. His goal in the third period Sunday helped the Penguins complete a perfect road trip, going 3-0 against three of the West’s top teams in Vegas, Colorado and Arizona.</p>
<p>With 8:32 left in the third period, the Penguins couldn’t clear the puck out of their zone then lost track of Derek Stepan. Niklas Hjalmarsson threw the puck to him in front and he swatted it past Tristan Jarry to put the Coyotes up, 3-2.</p>
<p>Before Tanev scored, the Penguins’ closest shot on goal in the third period came from 21 feet out. But those three created havoc then a chance for Tanev.</p>
<p>“We just had a good O-zone shift,” Blueger said. “We were in on the forecheck. [The Coyotes] tried to get it out and we kept it in. We had a couple of guys in front. … The puck came out to Tans and he swatted it right in there.”</p>
<p>It was end-to-end action in the 3-on-3 overtime, forcing Jarry to make six of his 25 saves. He was even better during the shootout, stopping seven of eight shooters. One of them was Phil Kessel, who smirked when Jarry stuffed him.</p>
<p>After the third Penguins shooter, Bryan Rust, scored, Taylor Hall slipped one inside the left post to keep the Coyotes alive. Jarry and Hill went save-for-save the next four rounds, forcing the coaches to dig deeper down their lineups.</p>
<p>“When you get down to that part of the bench, there’s not a huge body of work to lean on [to select shooters]. … It comes down to a coach’s feel,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, Teddy, the goal he scored was a great goal, a great shot. It’s probably appropriate, too, because he’s played extremely well on this road trip.”</p>
<p>Before taking his shootout try, Blueger leaned over to ask Malkin for advice.</p>
<p>“He said to shoot high blocker,” he said. “So that’s what I did and it went in.”</p>
<p>The Penguins got their first two goals on the power play, a welcome surprise.</p>
<p>Entering Sunday, the Coyotes had one of the NHL’s top penalty-kill units. They had been especially stingy at Gila River Arena, having previously allowed just six power-play goals there. Overall, coach Rick Tocchet’s team had killed 18 penalties in a row over the seven games before the Penguins came to town.</p>
<p>The Penguins capitalized on a 5-on-3 power play to take an early lead. Rust threaded a pass to Jared McCann, who buried it from the doorstep.</p>
<p>With that assist, Rust now has at least one point in 13 of his past 15 games. He has 38 points on the season, already tying his single-season career high.</p>
<p>Patric Hornqvist got another power-play goal in the second period to make it 2-1. Malkin, set up in the right corner, made a short pass to Hornqvist, who somehow from a few feet off the goal line sneaked a shot through Hill’s five-hole.</p>
<p>Sullivan was pleased with the simple approach on the power play Sunday.</p>
<p>“We’ve been preaching that all year long,” he said. “I just think it was about making good decisions and execution. The 5-on-3 was really good. That’s something we’ve worked on a fair amount. They were sharp, they made good decisions with the puck and they executed. The 5-on-4 goal was the same thing.”</p>
<p>Hall and Stepan scored to put the Coyotes up. But the Penguins had another comeback in them. They have won five consecutive road games and eight of nine.</p>
<p>“We knew it was going to be a real tough trip, playing against some real good teams,” Sullivan said. “The fact that we were able to take six points out of it is a credit to the team. They’re playing hard. Guys are competing out there. We’re finding different ways to win. Different guys are stepping up at key times.”</p>
<p>They are 18-6-4 without Sidney Crosby, who despite being cleared to practice Saturday without contact restrictions was not ready to make his return.</p>
<p>The Penguins will host the Minnesota Wild on Tuesday at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
