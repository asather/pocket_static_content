<h1>Robinson man pleads guilty in 'darknet' child porn investigation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Robinson man waived indictment by grand jury on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to child pornography charges in connection with a large-scale investigation into a darknet website called "Welcomd 2 Video" that offered child sex videos for sale using bitcoin.</p>
<p>Anthony Bellisario, 57, was identified as a user of the site and downloaded 1,673 child porn files and uploaded six files to the site, according to his plea. In return he received credits for additional videos.</p>
<p>A search of his house on March 27, 2018, turned up two laptops on which law officers found thousands of other images and videos.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellisario admitted that he used a Virtualized Private Network to mask his identity because he knew what he was doing was illegal, according to the plea.</p>
<p>In an affidavit, law officers said he admitted to viewing child porn when he is under the influence of cocaine. Police and agents said they found a small bag of powdery substance that field-tested positive for cocaine as well as marijuana. Agents said he also had a shotgun that he isn't allowed to have because of an outstanding warrant dating to 1988 from the sheriff's office in Norwalk, Calif.</p>
<p>Mr. Bellisario was charged in March with the child porn counts but the U.S. attorney's office did not charge him with gun or drug offenses.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Robert Colville will sentence Mr. Bellisario on Jan. 5. He faces at least five years in prison and up to 20.</p>
