<h1>Concerts are starting again, but in strange ways</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An actual live concert is scheduled to take place in Arkansas on May 15.</p>
<p>Travis McCready, frontman for the Southern rock band Bishop Gunn, will perform at TempleLive in Fort Smith, to a crowd of fans sitting in assigned “fan pods” at least six feet apart from other groups. The 1,100-seat venue is reducing capacity by 80 percent, down to 229 people.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/touring/9371669/travis-mccready-first-socially-distanced-concerts-arkansas" target="_blank">According to Billboard</a>, it is likely “one of the first live concert events since mass gatherings were banned across the U.S. in mid-March due to the spread of the coronavirus.”</p>
<p>The ticket map shows pods of two to 12 people who have been socially distancing together separated in different rows.</p>
<p>Fans will have their temperatures taken upon entry and will be required to wear face masks.</p>
<p>Among the other regulations are one-way walkways, a 10-person limit in the bathroom, no-touch soap and paper towel dispensers and all beverages will be prepackaged or having lids.</p>
<p>The concert is scheduled to happen three days prior to May 18, when Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson has declared that indoor venues can resume live shows with fewer than 50 people in attendance and social distancing in the audience.</p>
<p>TempleLive has decided to test those regulations with this show.</p>
<p>Last week, in Aarhus, Denmark, singer Mads Langer played a “drive-in” concert to 500 fans who listened from their cars via a designated FM station like people do at a drive-in movie.</p>
<p>Electronic artist Marc Rebillet has announced a drive-in tour for June and July in Charlotte, Kansas City, Tulsa, Fort Worth and Houston.</p>
<p>Under Pennsylvania’s restrictions, these events would only be allowed in the “green” phase. The “yellow” phase, which applies to 24 counties across the state, prohibits gatherings of more than 25 people. Allegheny County is still in the “red” phase, which prohibits large gatherings.</p>
<p>There was a concert last week, though, Allegheny County. Local singer-songwriter Jessica Rosario, joined by Jay Hill, set up a small PA and performed to a handful of fans and friends at Point State Park. It could be heard by others walking by or hanging out on the grass.</p>
<p>A park ranger observed the scene and made them close a guitar case set out for donations before driving away.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh promoters have told the Post-Gazette that they are hopeful of an August return for some concerts. Meanwhile, the May 30 Heinz Field show with Kenny Chesney has yet to be postponed.</p>
