<h1>Cancer treatment: Bill lets patients, doctors decide on drugs, therapies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cancer patients at the most serious stage of the disease shouldn’t have to rely on treatment drugs dictated by their health insurance rather than those preferred by their doctors.</p>
<p>State lawmakers agree and — in a rare show of nearly unanimous bipartisan support — have approved the Fair Access to Cancer Treatment Act, a bill that is expected to be signed into law soon by Gov. Tom Wolf. It’s a much-needed piece of legislation that puts cancer patients and doctors in control of treatment options.</p>
<p>The bill would abolish the often-criticized “fail first” approach to treatment for those with stage 4 cancer, the most serious stage of the disease. Insurance companies often force such patients to first show no improvement with cheaper drugs before moving on to other — usually more expensive — approaches.</p>
<p>Instead, health insurers would now be required to cover drugs prescribed by doctors for stage 4 cancer patients as long as they have been approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration and are consistent with best practices.</p>
<p>The “fail first” approach to treatment, also known as step therapy, has been roundly criticized by advocates for cancer patients as a shortsighted approach that delays other treatments and therapies for those most at risk. Patients diagnosed at stage 4 are those whose cancer has spread to other parts of the body or organs.</p>
<p>The bill’s prime sponsor, Rep. Kerry Benninghoff, R-Centre, said it was ridiculous to have insurers determine medical decisions. “At stage 4, the cancer is aggressive,” he said. “We want to give the patient the best chance — not make them go through weeks of medications that don’t address that person’s concerns at the time.”</p>
<p>Mr. Benninghoff has firsthand knowledge of the ravages of cancer. In 2008, doctors discovered his 4-year-old daughter had a brain tumor. She died two years later after numerous surgeries and radiation.</p>
<p>That was part of his motivation to put doctors in control of treatment, noting that they “don’t go (to medical school) to deal with legislative policies or insurance companies.”</p>
<p>At stage 4, cancer patients are literally fighting for their lives. They shouldn’t be bound by a treatment program or drug regimen based on a health insurer’s decision. State lawmakers made the right move to give treatment decisions to patients and their doctors.</p>
