<h1>Virus outbreak has impact on congressional fundraising in Western Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Canceled fundraisers and a hesitancy to ask Western Pennsylvanians for money in the midst of a global pandemic impacted congressional fundraising in the first months of 2020, recently-filed campaign finance reports revealed.</p>
<p>In the 17th Congressional district, where U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb is gearing up for a general election match-up with Republican Sean Parnell, the candidates raised thousands of dollars less than they raised in the final quarter of 2019 — given that about a third of the latest period, covering Jan. 1 to March 31, was happening just as stay-at-home orders and social distancing started to restrict social gatherings and traditional campaigning.</p>

<p>Mr. Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, raised about $233,000 less this quarter than he did at the end of last year, tallying a total of around $342,000 in contributions. Mr. Parnell, running unopposed for the Republican nomination in the district, raised $198,000, or $70,000 less than last quarter.</p>
<p>Both campaigns pointed to the last two weeks of March — which would have normally been packed with last-minute fundraising events and social media blitzes if not for the spread of the virus — as a culprit for the deficits.</p>
<p>The candidates, too, described moral considerations as being at the center of their first quarter difficulties, unsure if it’s right to ask for money at a time when so many in the district are struggling financially.</p>
<p>“I’m not doing things like call time, or things that I’d normally be doing on the campaign side,” Mr. Lamb said. “It doesn’t seem right, with 22 million people out of work and people trying to eat, and record long lines at food banks.”</p>
<p>“My&nbsp;sole focus has been on stopping the bleeding,” Mr. Lamb added.</p>

<p>Andrew Brey, a spokesman for Mr. Parnell’s campaign, said the campaign was expecting to carry momentum from last year into the first quarter, but has had to be more sensitive when linking politics to fundraising.</p>
<p>The times when the campaign has gone political, Mr. Brey noted, have been focused on the legislative process, and not tied to direct fundraising pleas. People are losing their jobs and businesses are closing, he said.</p>
<p>“In fundraising, there are the small-dollar folks — your average voter who is giving $5, $10, $25 — then you’ve got business leaders who are cutting bigger checks,” Mr. Brey said. “When the businesses have to close their doors, that affects the higher end donors and the small dollar donors.”</p>
<p>Mr. Brey added that the campaign has shifted to “actually trying to help folks,” and using Mr. Parnell’s connections to help people access services.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who said his campaign is not directly soliciting money from constituents right now, ended the quarter with about $1.6 million on hand, three times as much as Mr. Parnell. The district includes Beaver County, part of Butler County and much of Allegheny County outside the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Similar effects have been felt in the 18th district — where U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, is running in a contested primary against University of Pittsburgh law professor Jerry Dickinson — but the quarter-to-quarter differences aren’t as stark.</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson raised about $4,900 more this quarter than at the end of 2019, but Mr. Doyle raised more than twice as much ($111,000 to $50,000), spent more than twice as much ($216,000 to $95,000) and has nearly nine times the amount of cash on hand ($391,000 to $44,000).</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle’s campaign, which raised about $6,300 less this quarter, has had to get “a little more creative,” spokesman Mike Mikus said, since the Congressman’s time is “much better spent with him just worrying about being the Congressman and serving the people of the district.”</p>
<p>“Campaigns in general are feeling their way through,” Mr. Mikus said. “Is it appropriate to call individual donors or not when you have someone on the end of the phone and you don’t know what circumstances they’re facing, whether they have a small business or how are they holding up?”</p>
<p>Mr. Dickinson’s finance director said that even though political contributions aren’t feasible for most people right now, the campaign has “been&nbsp;fortunate to have a steady flow of contributions” — all of which came from individuals, not committees.</p>
<p>“While we expect there to be a bit of a decrease in fundraising moving forward, we launched this campaign last April, and since then, Jerry has knocked on doors and spoken to voters in every single municipality in the district,” finance director Will Taylor said.</p>
<p>Luke Negron, running unopposed for the Republican nomination in the 18th, raised about $3,000 this quarter and has $1,300 on hand.</p>
