<h1>Penguins mailbag: Who gets scratched if the season resumes?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.</em></p>
<p><em>This week, the NHL extended the self-quarantine guidelines for players through the end of April. It was a formality, really. At this point, there’s still so much uncertainty. No one really knows if, when or how the NHL season will resume.</em></p>
<p><em>With that in mind, I picked questions this week that had a mix of flavors. Some hypotheticals that address what might happen if the season resumes. Some looking ahead to the offseason. Some looking back at past championships. Hope you enjoy.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rich S.:</strong> What do you think the lineup will be if the season resumes?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Assuming the NHL does somehow restart, it’s not unreasonable to assume all the Penguins who were injured at the time of the pause will be healthy, including Jake Guentzel, Zach Aston-Reese, Nick Bjugstad, Dominik Simon and Anthony Angello. That would give the Penguins 17 forwards to fill 12 spots.</p>
<p>Here would be my guess of how they’d line up:</p>
<p>Guentzel – Crosby – Sheary</p>
<p>Zucker – Malkin – Rust</p>
<p>Marleau – McCann – Hornqvist</p>
<p>Aston-Reese – Blueger – Tanev</p>
<p><em>Top line:</em> Even though Guentzel had success with Evgeni Malkin earlier this year, reuniting the 25-year-old All-Star with Sidney Crosby feels like the most likely move. Since he came over from Buffalo, Conor Sheary has been given every opportunity to recapture old chemistry next to Crosby. I think that will continue.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Second:</em> No reason to break up Malkin and Bryan Rust. Malkin is enjoying a bounce-back season and Rust is having a career year next to him. With Guentzel on the top line, sliding Jason Zucker down to the other star center’s wing seems like a logical way to keep him in the top-six.</p>
<p><em>Third:</em> Here’s where there are questions. Maybe Nick Bjugstad gets a shot at center? Maybe Patrick Hornqvist gets some time next to Crosby? Maybe Patrick Marleau occasionally plays in the top-six?&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fourth:</em> This line has stuck together more than any Penguins trio this season. While they’re technically a “fourth” line, I think Mike Sullivan would be reluctant to break up a group that has chemistry and a clear identity.</p>
<p><strong>Ben P.:</strong> Who gets scratched if everyone is healthy?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> This question kind of piggybacks off the last one. In the hypothetical I laid out above, Evan Rodrigues, Dominik Simon, Bjugstad, Sam Lafferty and Angello would be scratched. Let’s talk about those first three.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Simon is an interesting case. Crosby and Sullivan both seem to believe his puck-possession skills and ability to navigate in tight spaces make him a good complement on the top line, even if his finishing ability leaves much to be desired. But if Simon is not next to Crosby, is he in the press box?</p>
<p>Matchups might play some factor when it comes to Rodrigues. The Penguins scratched Rodrigues against the Washington Capitals just before the pause. In the postseason, maybe they do the same when they face a team with similar heavy lineup. I do think Rodrigues has some interesting elements to his game. He responded after being scratched by becoming, arguably, the most noticeable forward on the ice the next two games. Maybe he can find a spot, possibly in place of Zach Aston-Reese?</p>
<p>Bjugstad was the third-line center when he came back from his nearly four-month injury absence. And then he got injured again three game later. I could see him competing for the third-line center spot. But then what do you do with McCann? And can you count on Bjugstad to stay healthy?</p>
<p><strong>Chris J.:</strong> Assuming the season resumes, how do you think the layoff will impact the goalie decision?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Ah, a goalie question. Before the year was paused, neither one of the Penguins goalies had taken clear control of the competition to prove he should be the starter. However, Murray did appear to be gaining an edge. He had started in three of the last four games, including the final game in New Jersey before the pause.</p>
<p>Already, I would consider Murray the known commodity and Jarry to be the wild card. Now, with this new uncertainty, at least to me, that adds one more reason to go with the experience.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> It’s fun watching the Stanley Cup replays on TV. With the benefit of hindsight, should the Pens have re-signed Nick Bonino (seems still not settled at third-line center) and Chris Kunitz (miss his grit and leadership)?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Right now, you can look at the price tags and see that Bonino and Bjugstad both carry an average annual value of $4.1 million. Sure, I think most would agree they’d rather have Bonino at third-line center.</p>
<p>But it doesn’t work like that. In a salary-cap league, teams have to make tough decisions when contracts expire.&nbsp;At the time, letting Bonino walk was the right move — and maybe the only move. He reportedly had serious interest from at least 10 teams going into the 2017 free agency cycle.&nbsp;If the Penguins had signed Bonino, it would have meant losing someone else, maybe Rust or Brian Dumoulin.</p>
<p>The Kunitz situation is similar. He helped hoist the Cup and make a lot of memories in Pittsburgh. But when he left Pittsburgh after the 2017 season, he was 38 years old. It felt like the right time to let an aging player walk.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:&nbsp;</strong>Will Patrick Marleau be back with the Penguins next season?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>If the NHL doesn’t return for the postseason, one of the most disappointing things will be that we won’t get to see the 40-year-old Marleau grow out his graying beard.&nbsp;Reading the tea leaves, the most likely scenario would be for Marleau to play next year in San Jose. Soon after he was traded, he told reporters that “I think maybe the door is open for me to come back [to San Jose].”</p>
<p>That said, I think the Penguins should at least consider bringing him back. Obviously, general manager Jim Rutherford saw enough in the veteran to give up a conditional third-round pick for a rental. If Marleau agrees to another contract around what he’s making now ($700,000), I don’t think the Penguins will be able to find many players better for that price tag. And Marleau might not find a better chance to finally win the Cup that’s eluded him.</p>
<p><strong>Joe B.:</strong> The article in the P-G about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/02/sidney-crosby-2005-nhl-draft-lottery-penguins-15-years-later/stories/202004050011" target="_blank">the Sidney Crosby draft sweepstakes </a>had me thinking about the high draft picks we've had. The Pens have had the No. 1 overall three times. I think two first-ballot Hall of Famers and a bubble HOFer with a bunch of franchise records would make us 3-for-3 in drafting first overall. Can you think of another franchise that's had such success with the first overall pick?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>The Penguins wouldn’t even be in Pittsburgh had they not drafted Mario Lemieux No. 1 overall in 1984. That alone makes the Penguins the most-successful franchise with the No. 1 pick. Crosby has been, arguably, the best player in the world for the better part of the last decade and a half. And then throw in Marc-Andre Fleury.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You’re right. That’s about as good as it gets with the No. 1 pick.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That said, the now-defunct Quebec Nordiques would be the team I’d put in second, especially if you are flexible with your definition of a franchise. They had the first overall pick three straight years in 1989, 1990 and 1991. Two of them — Eric Lindros and Mats Sundin — became Hall of Famers, and Owen Nolan would be in the Hall of Very Good. Then, after becoming the Colorado Avalanche, they took Nathan MacKinnon, one of the game’s best forwards. That might be three Hall of Famers out of four picks by the time MacKinnon retires.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, I’d say the Buffalo Sabres. They drafted Gilbert Perreault in 1970, a Calder Cup winner, Hall of Famer and possibly the best Buffalo Sabre of all-time. Then, in 1987, Pierre Turgeon, currently the most productive player not in the Hall of Fame with 1,327 points. In 2018, they took Rasmus Dahlin, who became a Calder Cup finalist and just turned 20 in April. They could be two-for-three on Hall of Famers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The New York Islanders get honorable mention. They had the first-overall pick four times. The 1973 pick, Denis Potvin, is a Hall of Famer and one of the best defensemen of all time. Billy Harris (1972), Rick DiPietro (2000), John Tavares (2009) are three more very good picks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If anyone out there has an opinion on the subject, I’d love to hear it.</p>
