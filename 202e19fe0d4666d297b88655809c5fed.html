<h1>Pirates expect to add to outfield mix before spring training</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates did not get a major league player back in the Starling Marte trade. But they do hope to acquire a replacement for Marte — or a supplement to their current group of outfielders — before the first full-squad workout Feb. 17 in Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p>“We’re still looking,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Wednesday. “We would still hope to add somebody to that mix between now and the first full workout.</p>
<p>“We have some hooks out there to try and do that. Until we land something, we’ll just have to keep working at it.”</p>
<p>Who will play center field with Marte gone suddenly became one of the most integral questions involving the Pirates, especially since they don’t seem terribly keen on moving Bryan Reynolds there.</p>
<p>While Reynolds made several highlight-reel catches in 2019 and has previously talked about getting a truer read in center field — the position he’s played for much of his life — Cherington said the Pirates might keep Reynolds in left field.</p>
<p>“We want to learn more about the guys that we have here,” Cherington said. “[Guillermo] Heredia is capable of playing center field. Reynolds can, although he did such a good job in left field, and had such a good year, that there’s some interest in trying to keep him in left. But he’s certainly comfortable with it.”</p>
<p>The new GM also listed Jason Martin and Jared Oliva as future options.</p>
<p>First, though, Martin must prove he’s healthy after October surgery to repair a labral tear in his left shoulder. Oliva, who shined in the Arizona Fall League, has to show he can hit Class AAA pitching before he gets a shot with the big club.</p>
<p>If the Pirates sign a stopgap in center, Billy Hamilton, Cameron Maybin, Kevin Pillar and Michael A. Taylor are players to whom they’ve been linked.</p>
<p>Pillar has history with Cherington and manager Derek Shelton dating back to their time in Toronto. Pillar is also coming off a season where he had 21 home runs, 88 RBIs and 14 stolen bases.</p>
<p>Maybin can play anywhere in the outfield and slashed .285/.364/.494 for the Yankees in 2019, a bounce-back offensive year for him. Taylor was squeezed out of a spot in Washington but could absolutely help the Pirates.</p>
<p>Hamilton has tortured the Pirates for years with his speed. Free agents Jarrod&nbsp;Dyson and Juan Lagares are solid defenders but don’t offer much with the bat.</p>
