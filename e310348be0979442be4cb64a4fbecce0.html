<h1>There's a big crop of garden info online. Don't trust all of it. </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As garden classes and seminars are on hold, online education has come to the fore.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus pandemic, gardeners can find information on blogs, websites, podcasts, webinars and videos. Many turn to social media. On Facebook, gardeners can connect with others who share their enthusiasm and interest on every conceivable topic. On Instagram and Pinterest, you can find garden influencers ranging from hobbyists to industry professionals and horticultural leaders. The vast amount of information available can be overwhelming, and the first order of business is sifting through and finding information that is accurate and relevant.</p>
<p>First, does the information pertain to our 6B USDA hardiness zone? Garden inspiration can come from anywhere, but if you need to tackle a cultural problem or a planting conundrum, stick with growing conditions similar to ours.</p>
<p>Next, is the author qualified to provide information? Science should guide gardener’s practices. While “over the garden gate” advice can be interesting and informative, it should always be based on horticultural best practices. Slick images on Instagram might reel you in, but if the author is creating pretty vignettes without a lick of practical knowledge, you’d be better off looking for answers from someone who has the bona fides to back up their opinions. Check out the author’s biography. Formal education isn’t essential; gardeners who’ve honed their skills over decades offer valuable information, too.</p>
<p>Here are a few choices to get you started on your foray into the world of online gardening:</p>
<p>Penn State Extension provides a multitude of options, from print articles to webinars for the home gardener, at <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/trees-lawns-and-landscaping/home-gardening" target="_blank">https://extension.psu.edu</a>.&nbsp;Here you will find topics for ornamental and vegetable gardening, from preparing soil and identifying diseases to preserving the harvest. If you provide your email address and ZIP code, Penn State Extension will keep you updated on the latest webinars and other educational materials. Most webinars are free and can be accessed at your convenience, but you must register to view them.</p>
<p>For bugs, a go-to site is the Insect Diagnostic Laboratory at Cornell University: <a href="http://idl.entomology.cornell.edu/factsheets/." target="_blank">http://idl.entomology.cornell.edu. </a></p>
<p>Coping with deer? Head to Rutgers University’s New Jersey Agricultural Experiment Stations resource Landscape Plants Rated for Deer Resistance at&nbsp;<a href="https://njaes.rutgers.edu/deer-resistant-plants/." target="_blank">https://njaes.rutgers.edu/deer-resistant-plants/.</a>&nbsp;Plants are rated by how often they are damaged by deer, with the caveat that no list can offer absolute certainty. However, heading to the nursery knowing which plants deer adore can save a gardener heartache and money.</p>
<p>Once you arrive home with an impulse buy from a nursery, or if you’re more disciplined and doing your homework before heading out to buy plants, check the Missouri Botanical Garden’s Plant Finder at <a href="https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/plantfinder/plantfindersearch.aspx." target="_blank">www.missouribotanicalgarden.org.</a>&nbsp;You can find great detail on many plants and cultivars, including culture, noteworthy characteristics, problems and garden uses.</p>
<p>Facebook has a group called The Garden Professors where you can interact with academic professionals passionate about gardening at <a href="http://gardenprofessors.com/" target="_blank">http://gardenprofessors.com</a>. The content is broad and includes areas outside of our region, but much of it is relevant to local gardeners and you can trust their recommendations.</p>
<p>Public gardens have many online articles and videos to inspire and inform. Many will be reopening in coming months, but an armchair visit can be fun now. Locally, check out Phipps Conservatory and Botanic Gardens at <a href="https://www.phipps.conservatory.org/" target="_blank">www.phipps.conservatory.org</a>. Going a little farther, try Longwood Gardens (<a href="https://longwoodgardens.org/" target="_blank">longwoodgardens.org</a>), Chanticleer (<a href="https://www.chanticleergarden.org/" target="_blank">www.chanticleergarden.org</a>),&nbsp;Mount Cuba Center (<a href="https://mtcubacenter.org/" target="_blank">mtcubacenter.org</a>), Highline (<a href="https://www.thehighline.org/" target="_blank">www.thehighline.org</a>) and Lurie Garden (<a href="http://www.luriegarden.org" target="_blank">www.luriegarden.org</a>). You can travel the world to see gardens even if the thought of getting on a plane right now holds little appeal.</p>
<p><a href="/Youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube.com</a>&nbsp;is a good place to find how-to videos and virtual visits to public gardens. Vet sources and be sure the “expert” really is just that. For public gardens, head straight to the organization’s website for the best quality viewing. Once you find trusted sources, subscribe to their YouTube channels to get updated content.</p>
