<h1>Pirates being proactive in handling potential sudden roster changes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The nature of the 2020 Major League Baseball season is such that the Pirates have their opening day roster set, but it will likely change in the near future.</p>
<p>Right fielder Gregory Polanco and closer Keone Kela are still on the shelf after testing positive for COVID-19. When either or both of them return, they will surely fit in to the roster as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Whom exactly that affects on the current Pirates roster remains to be seen. What’s important, though, is that Polanco and Kela, whenever they are ready, would be able to help the team immediately.</p>
<p>That means the Pirates have to plan for their sudden availability at all times. If they are on the road, for instance, and one of them gets their second negative test result, deeming them eligible to return, the Pirates need a contingency plan if they want them to join the team for the first or second possible game.</p>
<p>“Probably depends a little bit on circumstance and how far away we are,” general manager Ben Cherington told reporters Thursday. “There's also a mechanism [where] we can we can use the taxi squad in certain situations with players who are cleared, but maybe just needs some time on the field first before they're ready for for game activity. So, if we know a player's getting close to that and is cleared and we're about to go on a road trip, we might use the taxi squad for that purpose. By and large, because the road trips are relatively short, I would expect that we would have pretty good information before we leave on a road trip about any player who conceivably could be available during the road trip.”</p>
<p>Logistically, Cherington said they will try to use that information to avoid having to send players on a commercial flight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reverse side is a scenario where a player tests positive while on the road. Cherington said there is a process to perform contact tracing and take the appropriate steps away from home, which includes the possibility of having to get a COVID-positive player back to Pittsburgh to quarantine.</p>
<p>These mechanisms are necessary to have in place ahead of time, since positive or negative tests can realistically come whenever. Kela’s situation is a perfect example of this. He told the Post-Gazette on Wednesday that his tests have all come back as inconclusive or positive, despite the fact that he has been asymptomatic and quarantining for over three weeks.</p>
<p>To that end, the Pirates are trying to figure out exactly what is going on with Kela to get an idea of when he could be back.</p>
<p>“The truth is there’s just a lot we don’t know still,” Cherington said. “There’s a lot the medical community still doesn’t know about the virus and why someone might be affected differently than another, why someone might keep testing positive, etc. What we do know is we have a really high degree of confidence in the protocol itself. I think the testing program is working. The testing program, it’s identifying the guys that it’s intended to identify, to keep them safe, to keep others safe. In some cases, that ends up being frustrating because guys can’t get on the field, but that’s part of it. So in a case like Keone, he obviously wants to be back on the field, and we remain hopeful that’ll happen sooner rather than later, but we’ve got to put safety and health first.”</p>
<p>The aspect of safety has come under an even larger spotlight since the Toronto Blue Jays were reportedly supposed to play their home games at PNC Park before the Pennsylvania Department of Health put a stop to it.</p>
<p>The reason given was simply that the risk added from another team and all their opponents traveling to Pittsburgh to play was too great to take on.</p>
<p>That specific announcement didn’t change much for the Pirates, who seemed ready and willing to take the Blue Jays in. It is, however, emblematic of the amount of attention teams are having to pay to the health and safety of their players and staff.</p>
<p>The Pirates, specifically, have set the tone of this as a sort of competition, knowing that the healthier they are, the better chance there is for them to continue to play and, in their eyes, win games.</p>
<p>“We spend a lot of time talking to players individually and as a group about really competing against the virus, using the tests as a form of feedback, essentially,” Cherington said. “The more consistently we’re negative on tests, the more consistently we’re out on the field getting better and giving our team a chance to win games. Making that kind of a competition point and not just about following protocol. ...</p>
<p>“But, by and large, I think we have confidence in the protocol that’s in place. We also know that we need to continue to stay disciplined.”</p>
