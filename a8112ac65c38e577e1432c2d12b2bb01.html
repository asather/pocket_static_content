<h1>Paul Zeise: Pitt fans should rejoice that Pat Narduzzi is committed to Panthers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pitt administration got a bit of a scare this week when Michigan State football coach <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/02/04/michigan-state-coaching-search-mark-dantonio-retirement-spartans/stories/202002040114" target="_blank">Mark Dantonio abruptly retired</a>. That meant there’s an opening in the one position that Pitt football coach Pat Narduzzi would definitely be a strong candidate and might consider taking.</p>
<p>It didn’t take Narduzzi long to squash any ideas that he was going to be a candidate. He said so at a Wednesday news conference set up for him to talk about Pitt’s newest recruits. He did so again later that night at the signing day celebration for donors and alumni.</p>
<p>And then he took to Twitter to remove all doubt with a brilliant twist on the scene from&nbsp;“The Wolf of Wall Street” in which Jordan Belfort assures his employees emphatically that&nbsp;“I’m not leaving!”</p>
<p>Most Pitt fans understand this is a good, if not great, development for Pitt.&nbsp;Narduzzi leaving at this juncture would be devastating. I would set the program back and ensure several more years of mediocrity or worse.</p>
<p>Dave Wannstedt won 27 games in three years and a segment of Pitt fans and a certain former athletic director didn’t think it was good enough. He was fired, and all hell broke loose in the program for the better part of a decade. Wannstedt won nine games in 2008 and 10 in 2009, and Pitt hasn’t won that many in a season since.</p>
<p>It has taken that long to recover from a bad decision to fire a good coach who was doing a good job all things considered.</p>
<p>And before that was Walt Harris, who was fired/pushed out/asked to go find a job/not renewed (however you want to say it) despite taking the Panthers to the Fiesta Bowl in his final year. Pitt promptly had three non-winning seasons in a row after he was let go. They haven’t been back to a New Year’s Six Bowl since.</p>
<p>The Pitt era from 1975 to 1982 was the exception, not the rule, for Pitt. Take a look at Pitt’s history from 1940 until now and tell me if you think what happened from 1975 to 1982 is what Pitt really is as a program.&nbsp;Dan Marino, Tony Dorsett and Hugh Green ain’t walking through that door any time soon.</p>
<p>With Narduzzi, Pitt has the potential to be a strong program that competes for the ACC Coastal and Top 25 every single season. Pitt has a chance to recruit top players and put them in the NFL. Pitt has the potential to be a program where eight wins is the floor as opposed to the ceiling.</p>
<p>If you understand the landscape of college athletics, you understand Pitt is not going to ever be Clemson, LSU, Alabama or Oklahoma or one of those elite schools that every year has a shot to win the national championship.&nbsp;That doesn’t mean Pitt couldn’t win a national championship if everything came together right, but it would take an exceptional season that included a little bit of luck.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Narduzzi has Pitt on the verge of breaking through and becoming that Top 25 program that it can be. There is depth, the classes are balanced, the defense is loaded with speed and athleticism — it’s all there for Pitt to have a breakthrough season in 2020.</p>
<p>And if Narduzzi has recruited well, there’s no reason the program shouldn’t start to take off and become a fixture in the Top 25. Pitt’s best chance of that happening is with Narduzzi in place.</p>
<p>He certainly isn’t a perfect coach. He has some flaws and has lost a few games he should have won, but I like his chances of figuring it out. He seems to be the perfect coach for Pitt. More importantly, Narduzzi is a good coach, and if Pitt has learned anything, it’s that losing good coaches is really bad business.</p>
