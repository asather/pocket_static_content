<h1>Pa. Supreme Court rules in favor of mail-in ballot extension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ballots that are postmarked by 8 p.m. on Election Day and received by counties in the three days following the election will be counted, the state Supreme Court ruled Thursday.</p>
<p>In a 63-page majority opinion <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/page-1305/file-10077.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.pacourts.us/assets/files/page-1305/file-10077.pdf</a>, Justice Max Baer wrote that mail-in and absentee ballots mailed by voters using the United States Postal Service —&nbsp;so long as they are “valid and received by the county boards of election on or before 5 p.m. on Nov. 6, 2020” —&nbsp;shall be counted.</p>
<p>The court also ruled that counties are allowed to collect hand-delivered ballots at locations “other than their office addresses, including drop-boxes,” Justice Baer wrote.</p>
<p>Before this ruling, the hard deadline for counties to receive ballots was 8 p.m. —&nbsp;the time traditional polls close —&nbsp;on Election Day.</p>
<p>Drop boxes for ballots, intended to give voters more options to return their ballots, were the subject of a months-long legal battle, in which the Trump campaign —&nbsp;among other entities —&nbsp;sought to limit their use because of allegations they’re susceptible to fraud and abuse.</p>
