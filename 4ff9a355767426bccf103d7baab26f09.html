<h1>Mt. Lebanon sewing shop making thousands of reusable masks for first responders </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Gov. Tom Wolf ordered that all non-essential businesses shut their doors at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, Gloria Horn thought that would be the end for her Mt. Lebanon sewing shop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gloria Horn Sewing Studio has been in business for 37 years and withstood past national tragedies and recessions. The shutdown was worrying, but an inspiring visit changed that.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Almost a month later, Ms. Horn is selling face mask kits that include fabric cut-to-size and elastic string to help people make reusable masks from home to protect themselves from coronavirus exposure. She also has donated nearly 7,000 masks to hospitals, first responders, home health aides and police departments.</p>
<p>“I lasted through 9/11. I lasted through that terrible recession, and because of face masks, I’m going to last through the virus,” Ms. Horn said Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As she began to contemplate the future of her business, the seamstress got a visit from Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the Central Outreach Wellness Center, a state-funded health clinic on the North Shore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Lane had a bag of N95 masks that had broken elastic bands, and asked if Ms. Horn could fix them. Within the bag was a homemade mask sewn together from fabric, and Dr. Lane suggested an idea that is now keeping Gloria Horn Sewing Studio afloat: Ms. Horn needed to start making and selling her own customized masks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Ms. Horn didn’t want to profit from the virus. After the Mt. Lebanon native received a request from Allegheny Health Care Network to provide masks for home health aides, she knew the calling was greater than financial gain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Horn asked her staff and customer base through email if they would be willing to buy face masks kits to help with money for supplies so that she could donate masks to health care workers. To her surprise, people began making masks and giving them back to the shop to help meet the demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I just knew they were going to help,” Ms. Horn said. “So I sent out an email and I just got response after response of people saying, ‘I’ll help, I’ll help.’ ... I knew from the thank yous that we got from people that there was a demand for it.”</p>
<p>Ms. Horn began calling around to different nursing homes offering to provide masks until she received a letter from South Park police Chief Dennis McDonough, who said his department was in need of them.</p>
<p>She again solicited her group of nearly 100 volunteers, most of whom are seniors, to help the police. Ms. Horn received dozens of responses, handed out 40 kits filled with materials for 12 masks each and provided&nbsp; 400 masks to both the South Park and Mt. Lebanon police departments within three days.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I know there are places out there that are very organized and keeping track of the numbers. But we’re not worried about that. We’re cutting, cutting, cutting fabric. We’re getting them in the sewers hands as fast as we can and pleading with them to make them as quickly as possible,” Ms. Horn said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The officers’ masks are uniform appropriate, with blue or black on the outside. Volunteers are sewing fabric with Pittsburgh sports team logos or patriotic symbols on the inside of the masks so the officers can wear them with a sense of pride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“My daughter sent me an article that said one in six New York City police officers is sick and looting has started throughout the city... I sent out an email to my volunteers and said, ‘We can’t let this happen in Pittsburgh.’ We all go into the city, no matter where we live. We need to help these officers,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gloria Horn Sewing Studio has now turned its focus to Pittsburgh police. This week they’ve already provided nearly 400 masks to the department. Ms. Horn said she’s&nbsp;“very confident” that they’ll donate 500 more by the end of the week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Horn’s daughter, Kathy Franklin, who lives in Baltimore, has been helping her mother find suppliers and found a California bathing suit company to sell them elastic at a discounted rate. Ms. Franklin also set up a GoFundMe <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/protectourprotectors?sharetype=teams&amp;member=4179398&amp;utm_medium=copy_link&amp;utm_source=customer&amp;utm_campaign=p_na+share-sheet&amp;rcid=7d1cfc29d6bf4584a74e638cf80d9e6b" target="_blank">fundraiser</a>&nbsp;to pay for more fabric and elastic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We want to take care of our first responders who are on the front lines and most of the departments are requiring them to wear masks,” Ms. Franklin said.&nbsp;“A lot of these officers are being given one disposable mask to use indefinitely. The fact that we can provide them with ones they can wash with durable fabric frees up the medical masks for hospital workers who need them.”</p>
<p>Ms. Horn said her next goal is to start making masks for local firefighters.</p>
<p>She gives all the credit to her volunteers, who have been using their quarantine time to make a difference, and Dr. Lane, who inspired the idea.</p>
<p>“It’s making them feel really good. One lady early on said to me,&nbsp;‘I was getting depressed. I was watching TV. I wasn’t visiting anybody. And you came up with this and I ran down there and got a kit. I sat at my sewing machine and it uplifted me. I showed everybody what I was making,’ ” Ms. Horn said. “It just lifted her spirits and made her feel involved.”</p>

<p>Once the masks are made, Ms. Horn leaves them out on the porch for pickup without contact. She is still selling face masks kits to the general public and has started an online store.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I honestly in the beginning thought, ‘This is it. It’s over,’ ” she said.&nbsp;“Now, I’m not scared. I feel like we’re going to make it. Now I feel like because we are doing this, we’re going to be OK. I’ll be doing this for another 37 years.”&nbsp;</p>
