<h1>As the state begins to reopen, should you get tested for COVID-19?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As people in Southwestern Pennsylvania return to work and businesses reopen, health experts say your risk of infection with the new coronavirus could increase.&nbsp;What should you do if you think you’ve been exposed?</p>
<p>“The symptoms are so vague at this point I recommend calling your health care provider if you’re feeling any combination of them,” said&nbsp;Dr. Amy Crawford-Faucher, a family medicine physician at Allegheny Health Network’s Forbes Hospital.&nbsp;“Don’t wait.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Common COVID-19 symptoms include coughing, shortness of breath and fever, but the list has expanded to include upset stomach and loss of taste or smell. In some rare cases, infected children are exhibiting discoloration or <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/06/COVID-toe-children-condition-mystery-coronavirus-association-health-COVID-19/stories/202005060087" target="_blank">swelling in the toes</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Crawford-Faucher said that most of the symptoms come on gradually, allowing time to self-isolate and call a doctor or go to a hospital before symptoms are severe enough to require an emergency room visit.</p>
<p>Dr. Joe Suyama, chief of emergency services at UPMC Magee-Womens Hospital, said that only people experiencing “severe oxygenic changes” or a fever that spikes out of control will need hospital care.</p>
<p>“If you develop shortness of breath, confusion or a discoloration of your skin, have those assessed in an emergency department,” he said. “Most of those symptoms are related to getting oxygen.”</p>
<p><strong>Testing capacity</strong></p>
<p>The number of available tests remains a key point in national debates regarding reopening the country. Since few communities have enough, testing is still reserved primarily for individuals exhibiting symptoms. This is unlikely to change in the immediate future.</p>
<p>“What’s the goal with testing? That’s a very important question,” said Dr. Crawford-Faucher. “If you’ve got someone at high risk of COVID-19 complications, then it affects how we care for them to know whether they have it. Testing can also help us identify hot spots in the community and alert people when they need to be more cautious.”</p>
<p>Spokespeople said neither AHN nor UPMC are turning away people who need tests at this time.</p>
<p>In April, Congress passed legislation mandating that insurance companies cover the costs of coronavirus testing. It has also passed legislation to provide free testing to uninsured individuals, according to the <a href="https://www.ahn.org/coronavirus/faqs/testing.html" target="_blank">AHN website</a>.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Allegheny Health Network began free <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/11/Allegheny-Health-Network-COVID-19-testing-homewood-mobile-appointment-symptoms/stories/202005110082" target="_blank">mobile testing in some communities</a> and is continuing to provide walkup testing sites for uninsured individuals. Find a site at&nbsp;<a href="/ahn.org/coronavirus/faqs/testing" target="_blank">ahn.org/coronavirus/faqs/testing</a>&nbsp;or call the nurse’s line at 412-687-7348.&nbsp;UPMC is holding virtual diagnostic appointments to discuss COVID-19 at <a href="https://myupmc.upmc.com/anywhere-care/" target="_blank">myupmc.upmc.com/anywhere-care</a>.</p>
<p>If you or a family member does not have a primary care physician, some MedExpress clinics (<a href="https://www.medexpress.com/covid19.html" target="_blank">www.medexpress.com</a>) are offering COVID-19 testing for individuals who meet certain criteria in the Pittsburgh area. You don’t need a doctor’s note, but you will need to be evaluated by a MedExpress employee. CVS’ Minute Clinic in McCandless is also offering testing in Pennsylvania on an extremely limited basis.</p>
<p>Anyone can call the Pennsylvania Department of Health at 1-877-724-3258 to inquire about testing options.</p>
<p><strong>After COVID-19</strong></p>
<p>If you test positive for COVID-19, you should self-isolate for 10 days. If your symptoms go away, then it’s OK to leave isolation, Dr. Suyama said.&nbsp;If your symptoms are severe, go to a hospital, where you will receive care until you’re cleared to go home, usually in a few days.</p>
<p>Some people infected with COVID-19 develop thrombotic or vascular complications that require additional care after the virus has cleared. Seniors are at highest risk for such complications, and some nursing homes are refusing to admit or readmit seniors with COVID-19. Hospitals will work with families to identify the right place for continued care, but this can make for an expensive, extended stay in a hospital.&nbsp;Leaders in geriatrics at AHN, UPMC and other health systems as well as the state Department of Health have recently formed a long-term clinical care council to explore such issues. It’s in the early stages.</p>
<p>Some workplaces require successive negative tests before an employee can return to work, according to Dr. Crawford-Faucher. This can also be problematic, she said, as a small portion of the population will continue to test positive even after the virus has left their system. A doctor’s note might circumvent this issue.</p>
<p>Researchers are not clear yet whether people are at risk of catching COVID-19 a second time. Dr. Suyama said that once enough time has passed, people could be at risk again, but there is likely little immediate danger.</p>
<p><strong>Different tests</strong></p>
<p>There are several types of tests currently in use. Both Dr. Suyama and Dr. Crawford-Faucher said that a nasopharyngeal swab — a deep swab through the nose — is the most effective.&nbsp;Dr. Crawford-Faucher said that this likely can’t be done by someone at home due to how uncomfortable it is.</p>
<p>Other tests of shallower nasal tissue or even an oral swab can also detect COVID-19, but are likely not as sensitive.</p>
<p>“Not all tests are created equal,” Dr. Suyama said, explaining that the amount of virus in a person’s body will affect the veracity of test results. Someone with fewer symptoms and less viral load is not as likely to test positive using an oral swab, but they could still be carrying the virus.</p>
<p>The Infectious Diseases Society of America recently released recommendations on testing that state: “At the current time, there is little evidence to support use of oropharyngeal swabs or saliva alone. However, future studies of saliva as a specimen type are anticipated.”</p>
<p>The FDA has issued emergency authorization to at least one home <a href="https://www.pixel.labcorp.com/at-home-test-kits/covid-19-test" target="_blank">COVID-19 testing kit</a>, which requires a nasal swab. When possible, physicians recommend speaking with a doctor and being tested by a healthcare professional, as collecting a usable tissue sample can be difficult. False negatives and positives do occur even with the&nbsp;nasopharyngeal swab tests.</p>
<p>Both doctors stated that the health systems are not being overrun at this time and have capacity to continue testing at the current levels.</p>
<p>“Assuming there is a bump with the reopening and not an overwhelming surge, we even have capacity to flex up if need arises,” Dr. Crawford-Faucher said.&nbsp;“We’ve done a good job of keeping the spread under control here, largely thanks to following directions. It will be interesting to see what happens as things open up.”</p>
