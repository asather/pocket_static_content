<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said on his Twitter account on Thursday he is in self-isolation after two colleagues at a Washington, D.C., press conference tested positive for the novel coronavirus, COVID-19.</p>
<p>The mayor says he is not symptomatic but is acting out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>“I have absolutely no symptoms,” Mr. Peduto said in a video. “I feel great. Not great enough to clean my basement, but great.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said he would continue to work remotely from home while completing his quarantine.</p>
<p>“I was on the phone yesterday with the White House and with Vice President Pence, and it was made abundantly clear that over the next 72 hours we will see a rise in the number of cases throughout the country” due to more test kits being available and the continued spread of the virus, Mr. Peduto said in the video.</p>
<p>The mayor continued:&nbsp;“Pittsburgh, we’re going to get through this. And the reason we’re going to get through it is because we’re going to work together.”</p>
<p>Other members of Mr. Peduto’s staff are&nbsp;“fine and teleworking as necessary,” mayoral spokesman Tim McNulty said.</p>
