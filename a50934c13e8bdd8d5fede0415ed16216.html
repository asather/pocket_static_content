<h1>State leaders hold hearing on restaurants, bars hit hard by the pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Members of a group representing restaurants and bars across Pennsylvania that have been struggling due to the pandemic will testify at a hearing Tuesday morning in Harrisburg, calling on state lawmakers for financial help and discussing coronavirus mitigation efforts that they say are&nbsp;“negatively impacting” small businesses.</p>
<p>The advocacy group — the Pennsylvania Licensed Beverage and Tavern Association -— is pushing for a comprehensive state package to assist with survival and then recovery for licensees who have suffered losses since March 6, the group said.&nbsp;Various leaders of the PLBTA are expected to speak before House Republicans, who are conducting the hearing. Speakers will include Jim DeLisio, owner of Racehorse Tavern in Thomasville, York County and a member of the PLBTA board of directors, a statement from the group said. PLBTA executive director Chuck Moran will join Mr. DeLisio.</p>
<p>Current COVID-19 orders from the state restrict business to 25 percent indoor occupancy, prohibits bar service, and limits the sale of alcoholic beverages, according to PLBTA leaders. Sixty-three percent of PLBTA members’ business is the sale of beer, wine and mixed drinks, Mr. Moran said. The average establishment employs about 16 workers.</p>
<p>“Simply put, the state’s current COVID-19 order threatens both businesses and jobs,” Mr. Moran said. “Our industry is at a tipping point, and without assistance you can expect even more of these valued community gathering spots to disappear.”</p>
<p>Numerous bar and tavern shutdowns over the last few months, combined with recent orders, is like a&nbsp;“torpedo hitting an already damaged ship,” Mr. Moran said.</p>
<p>He argued that the state should be part of the solution in helping keep businesses afloat and helping them recover in the aftermath of the pandemic.</p>
<p>House Democrats have proposed a comprehensive relief package that includes grants for local restaurants, bars and clubs “instead of national chains to ensure those dollars are invested back into the region.” The package also includes&nbsp;a reduction and in some cases the elimination of specific licensing fees, extension of discounts&nbsp;to licensees and insurance protections for future emergencies.</p>
<p>Democrats have crafted nine bills in all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“These efforts will provide direct relief to an industry of Pennsylvania businesses the virus has hit hard,” House Democratic leaders said in a statement Tuesday.&nbsp;“...Restaurants have served as the backdrop of many life occasions and special moments and they need support more now than ever.”</p>
<p>“Fast, decisive action has been required to reduce the spread of the virus, and these real-world solutions would help to mitigate the collateral economic damage that many Pennsylvania businesses have suffered as a result.”</p>
<p>The Democratic package also includes:</p>
<p>▪ Expanding access to outdoor dining for restaurants and diners, including removing limitations concerning public thoroughfares, fees and delays in approval.&nbsp;</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;Waiving the liquor license renewal fee for any bar, restaurant or club that suffered more than a 25% downturn in business due to the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>▪ Eliminating the $500 off-premise catering permit fee to allow more restaurants to safely cook food in kitchens and deliver it to safe outdoor locations, as well as remove the March deadline to submit an application to do off-premise catering, and end the 52-event-per-year cap.</p>
<p>▪ Eliminating sales tax late payment penalties on restaurants and bars purchasing alcohol from wholesalers and allowing for a repayment grace period when the industry has recovered.</p>
<p>▪ Allowing license holders with licenses in safekeeping relief from paying the license renewal or validation fee for a period of one year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Members of Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration are expected to testify at the hearing as are members of the Pennsylvania Federation of Fraternal and Social Organizations and the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, the PLBTA said.&nbsp;</p>
