<p>Due to the threat of rain, the Pirates have changed the time of Wednesday's exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The game will now start at 5:05 p.m., and it will not air on AT&amp;T SportsNet as originally anticipated.&nbsp;It will be broadcast on 93.7 The Fan and the Pirates Radio Network.</p>
<p>Wednesday marks the last of three exhibition contests against Cleveland. The Pirates have lost the first two. They open their season Friday in St. Louis.</p>
