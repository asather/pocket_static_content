<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Why are people so hung up on the Steelers' ground game?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe:&nbsp;</strong>Why are some so hung up on the running game for the Steelers? They won their last Super Bowl with Carey Davis and Gary Russell in the RB rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Well, that team also had Willie Parker, who is better than anyone the Steelers have right now. The issue people have is that James Conner has not proven to be durable. That may or may not be fair, but it’s true. And if he gets hurt again this year, they have some real issues. Benny Snell Jr. is a one-trick pony, and I am not really sure what Jaylen Samuels brings to the table other than an occasional splash play. We will see what Anthony McFarland Jr. has to offer. If Conner stays healthy, it will obviously be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie:</strong> Who would you rather have as your head coach — Mike Tomlin or Andy Reid?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow. I think Andy Reid has proven more over time. He has won with a lot of different quarterbacks, lineups and with two different organizations. Tomlin’s success and entire career has been with a Hall of Fame-level quarterback. Last season he didn’t have Ben Roethlisberger and they were 8-8. For all the crap Reid takes about not winning in the playoffs, he is 15-14 in playoff games, has gotten to six conference title games and two Super Bowls. In short, Reid’s overall body of work is better and more impressive than Tomlin’s, but I would take either. They are both among the top five coaches in the NFL right now.</p>
<p><strong>Jackson:</strong> Assuming baseball returns, what will be the Pirates lineup for opening day?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I am going to say the starting pitcher will be Trevor Williams, so it will be something like this: Jarrod Dyson (CF), Kevin Newman (SS), Bryan Reynolds (LF), Josh Bell (1B), Gregory Polanco (RF), Colin Moran (3B), Adam Frazier (2B), Jacob Stallings (C), Trevor Williams (P). Does that sound about right? I don’t think that is terrible, either. I really think if they get reasonably consistent pitching, they will have enough offense to win their share of games.</p>
<p><strong>Marty C:</strong> What do you think of Derek Shelton so far?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He seems genuine and seems like he will be a manager that players like and respect. We haven’t seen much of him obviously, but from the little bit we have seen, he does seem like the right man for the job. I like the fact that he will answer questions directly and honestly. I like that he understands the importance of baseball and sports in general in our society.</p>
<p><strong>Gary T:</strong> How good do you think Jeff Capel is as a coach? His recruiting has been very good so far, but that’s only half of the equation. Has he proven enough to you that he can actually coach? He is only 50-68 in Power Five conference games at Oklahoma and Pitt.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It’s a good question. He is still growing and learning as a coach. It was a little disappointing that he wasn’t able to right the ship so to speak when things went south this year, but he had a team that was extremely flawed. Capel has done the most important thing, which is bring in players who can compete in the ACC. Without players, it doesn’t matter how good of a coach he is.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Greg:</strong> Everyone is on the Michael Jordan bandwagon now because of&nbsp; “The Last Dance” documentary, but I always thought he was overrated. I have Wilt Chamberlain, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Bill Russell, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird all ahead of him, and maybe four or five more. What do you think? Are you one of these “Jordan is the greatest” people, too?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of my lifetime. And I suspect he is the best of all time.I think the only two who are in the conversation with him are Wilt Chamberlain and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. And Jordan did what he did at 6-foot-6. Chamberlain’s numbers are absurd, though, and Abdul-Jabbar was special for a lot of years. The fact that you don’t have Jordan in your top 10 tells me you should never watch basketball again.</p>
<p><strong>Patrick:</strong> The Bulls documentary got me to thinking — who is the most dominant athlete in sports history? I say Wayne Gretzky. I know that is probably sacrilegious in this town but just look at his numbers.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;We should separate team sports and individual sports because they are different. The most dominant team sport athlete has to be Wilt Chamberlain. What he did was nothing less than incredible, and his statistics don’t even look like they can be real. I could give you a bunch of numbers on Chamberlain that blow your mind, but the season he averaged 50.2 points per game puts him on another level. The individual sport athlete who is the most dominant, at least in my lifetime, is Tiger Woods. For the 12 years when he ruled the PGA Tour, that stretch will never be duplicated.</p>
