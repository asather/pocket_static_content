<h1>Riders discuss accessibility, bus stop elimination at Port Authority meeting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>People raised concerns about bus stop elimination and accessibility at a Port Authority public meeting Wednesday in Larimer.</p>
<p>A part of a series of meetings called “Public Transit: A Community Discussion,” the meeting involved discussion from Port Authority personnel about expanding the transit service, the Bus Rapid Transit project and new fare concepts.</p>
<p>Many questions during a Q&amp;A session focused on accessibility at bus stops and on buses. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2019/12/04/Port-Authority-plans-eliminate-bus-stops-two-routes-48-88-wants-public-feedback/stories/201912040155" target="_blank">Bus stops being eliminated</a> on the 88 Penn route, which services East Liberty, were a particular point of concern, especially with the rider feedback deadline approaching Friday.</p>
<p>Some people are confused about what the criteria for eliminating bus stops are, particularly in the Penn Avenue corridor, as Jonah McAllister-Erickson pointed out during the meeting.</p>
<p>“There are a decent number of statistics provided on the website, but it’s unclear how those statistics are used in evaluating stops,” said Mr. McAllister-Erickson, the Coordinating Committee Chair for Pittsburghers for Public Transit.</p>
<p>“One of the things with these stop consolidations is you’re doing everything online and through the internet,” Colin Kowalski said at the meeting. Ms. Kowalski said that creates a barrier for people who are elderly or who don’t have access to internet.</p>
<p>Ms. Kowalski also noted she had issues with bus drivers who she felt harassed her when she tried to bring her service dog on the bus.</p>
<p>“I need to be able — as someone with severe anxiety, with PTSD, who has trouble getting on the bus in the first place — to be able to get on the bus with my service dog and not feel harassed,” Ms. Kowalski said, noting multiple bus drivers have refused to drive until she explained the service her dog provides.</p>
<p>“We know we have a big gap in what we would like to see in our training slides,” Port Authority CEO&nbsp;Katharine Eagan Kelleman told Ms. Kowalski. Ms. Kelleman said that the training has shifted in the past two years to focusing on the customer experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Multiple people brought up issues with accessibility, and there were fears that consolidation and elimination of bus stops could create more issues for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“We’ve been collecting feedback and it’s sort of an ongoing process,” said Adam Brandolph, Port Authority spokesman.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There also were complaints about sidewalks and shelters at bus stops that are in disrepair, although both of those are maintained by local municipalities.</p>
<p>“We work with municipalities the best we can and we do want to create and maintain an accessible system for as many of our county residents as possible,” Mr. Brandolph said, adding Port Authority has made greater efforts to increase communication with local municipalities to ensure those areas are as conducive to transit as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Port Authority is continuing its series of public meetings at the Millvale Community Center&nbsp;Feb. 12 at 5 p.m. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/01/14/Port-Authority-nine-meetings-long-range-plan-fare-policy-cell-phone-payment/stories/202001130131" target="_blank">Upcoming meetings</a> in other parts of the county include Monroeville, McKeesport and Oakdale.&nbsp;</p>
