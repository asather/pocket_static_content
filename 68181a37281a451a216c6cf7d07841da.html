<h1>Pirates announce ticket refund procedures for spring training</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The Pirates announced plans to compensate ticket buyers in the wake of Thursday’s news that MLB would basically cancel spring training and delay the regular season at least two weeks in the wake of the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The plans involve spring training games only. The Pirates have not yet released information on games at PNC Park.</p>
<p>Season-ticket holder have the option of getting their money back or credit toward 2021, while single-game tickets will net a refund to the original purchaser. Tickets bought on the secondary market cannot be refunded.</p>
<p>Although the Pirates have begun reaching out to season ticket holders, anyone with questions should contact their representative.</p>
<p>Group tickets will be refunded in the name of the purchases; the Pirates say they’ve already started reaching out to those folks, as well. It’s the same for single-game tickets, as refunds in most cases will be processed automatically.</p>
<p>If you bought tickets with cash at LECOM Park, you need to mail them back by May 1, including your actual tickets, name, address and a daytime phone number.</p>
<p>That address info should look like this:</p>
<p>LECOM Park Ticket Office</p>
<p>Attn: Spring Training</p>
<p>1611 9th Street West</p>
<p>Bradenton, Fla. 34205</p>
