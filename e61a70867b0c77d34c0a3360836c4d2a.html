<h1>Conor Sheary on PPG Paints Arena crowd: 'It makes you feel appreciated'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Conor Sheary had a memorable night at PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday, his first game back in the Burgh after he was reacquired by the Penguins.</p>
<p>In a 7-3 win over the Ottawa Senators, the speedy winger got his first two points since returning to the Penguins before the Feb. 24 trade deadline.</p>
<p>The ovation Sheary received at PPG Paints Arena when he was announced as a starter was almost as loud as the one he got after his first-period goal.</p>
<p>“It was awesome. I got a warm welcome. I was so grateful for that. It makes you feel appreciated and that was a good thing,” he said after Wednesday’s practice. “And obviously with the performance we put on, it was a fun night overall.”</p>
<p>Each member of the team’s top line scored a goal and put up multiple points in the blowout win. Sidney Crosby finished with three points and a plus-3 rating. Jason Zucker got his sixth goal in 11 games with the Penguins. Sheary buried his first in black and gold since the final week of the 2017-18 regular season.</p>
<p>“We were a little snake-bitten on the California trip,” Sheary said. “I think we were actually playing pretty well but just couldn’t finish on any of our chances. [Tuesday], we were scoring in bunches. I think we’ve just been creating chemistry since we’ve been together and hopefully that will grow moving forward.”</p>
<p>Now, Sheary is gearing up for another reunion, this one with his former team in Buffalo. The Penguins on Thursday will visit the Sabres, who dealt him back here after he scored just 23 goals and 53 points in a season and a half in Buffalo.</p>
<p>Sheary said he thinks it’s a good thing he will get it out of the way so soon.</p>
<p>“Obviously, it will be a little different, seeing a lot of friends over there and a lot of guys I grew pretty close to,” Sheary said. “It should be a fun game.”</p>
<p><strong>Tanev, Johnson to travel</strong></p>
<p>Brandon Tanev, who missed Tuesday’s win due to an illness, was still not feeling well enough Wednesday to practice with the team. But coach Mike Sullivan said that there is a chance the pesky winger could be ready to play the Sabres.</p>
<p>“Tans is feeling much better,” Sullivan said. “He hasn’t had a lot of food in him so we chose to keep him off the ice [Wednesday]. But he will travel with us.”</p>
<p>Tanev, who leads all Penguins players in hits and is tops among their forwards in blocked shots, had been one of a few Penguins to appear in every game. After Tuesday, the ones still standing are Teddy Blueger and Marcus Pettersson.</p>
<p>Jack Johnson will travel to Buffalo, too. The defenseman left PPG Paints Arena after the second period Tuesday because his wife was in labor. Johnson was excused from practice Wednesday after the birth of his third child, a boy.</p>
<p><strong>Angello week-to-week</strong></p>
<p>With Tanev sick and unable to play against the Senators, the Penguins on Tuesday recalled rookie forward Anthony Angello from the American Hockey League on an emergency basis. Angello ended up getting injured during the third period of the win. Sullivan said Angello is week-to-week with an upper-body injury.</p>
<p>In other injury news, Nick Bjugstad, who hasn’t played since having core muscle surgery in November, could return to the lineup against the Sabres.</p>
<p>Zach Aston-Reese, meanwhile, is nearing a return to action, too. Sullivan said the winger skated on an individual basis before Wednesday’s practice in Cranberry. Aston-Reese has been sidelined since Feb. 16 due to a lower-body injury.</p>
<p><strong>Sid gives up his spot</strong></p>
<p>Crosby, who you may have heard is a tad bit suspicious, raised eyebrows before Tuesday’s game when Patrick Marleau followed him out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>Since Evgeni Malkin arrived in Pittsburgh in 2006, Crosby has typically been the penultimate Penguin on the ice, with Malkin the last one out. But Crosby gave his spot in line to Marleau, the 40-year-old winger acquired last week.</p>
<p>“He’s played 1,700-plus games. I just asked him where he usually went and he usually went somewhere back there. So I tried that spot,” Crosby said.</p>
<p>He added with a sly grin: “We got the win, so we may see that for now.”</p>
