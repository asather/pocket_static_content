<h1>Pirates prospect Ke'Bryan Hayes sent to Altoona after long layoff for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Pirates released their summer camp roster a few weeks ago, one of the more exciting names on it was third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes.</p>
<p>As one of the top prospects in the Pirates’ system, here was a chance for the young player to show what he is capable of, soak up as much as he could from coaches and teammates and, perhaps, make the opening day roster at the end of camp.</p>
<p>Hayes never quite made it to regular training, though, as a positive COVID-19 test held him out of all intrasquad scrimmages and exhibition games. Now, manager Derek Shelton told Post-Gazette columnists Joe Starkey and Ron Cook on 93.7 The Fan, Hayes has been sent to Altoona to join the alternate training squad there.</p>
<p>“We moved him to the Altoona group, just because of the amount of time we lost with him and him being ready for opening day,” Shelton said.&nbsp;“So I think he worked out there yesterday. He’ll work out there again today. We just need to get him back in baseball shape.”</p>
<p>The good news for the Pirates — though they are surely eager to see what Hayes can do on the major league level — is that they still have some options at third base. Colin Moran remains the likely candidate to play third base most games, and he has strung together a nice summer camp, highlighted by a home run in an exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians on Monday.</p>
<p>Behind Moran, utility man Phillip Evans has also impressed offensively and seems a likely candidate to fill in wherever needed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how the season goes, Hayes could still get called up at some point during the year. That would likely be contingent on roster needs elsewhere and if the Pirates are in contention deep into the season, but if they are antsy to get him up to take some reps in the majors, they could still do so.</p>
