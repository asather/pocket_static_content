<h1>Joe Starkey: Brandin Knight’s right — Vince Carter's the best dunker ever</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two days into this horrendous year, I contacted former Pitt basketball star Brandin Knight for a story about a dunk.</p>
<p>It was the 20-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/01/04/Send-it-in-Julius-Not-quite-Jerome-Lane-but-legendary-Page-dunk-lives-on/stories/202001030154" target="_blank">Julius Page’s legendary leap-and-smash</a> over Georgetown’s Ruben Boumtje-Boumtje (aka “Boom-Boom”). My text exchange with Knight took a turn when I asked if Page going boom-boom on Boom-Boom was the best dunk he ever saw in person.</p>
<p>Knight: “2nd best. Maybe 1-B.”</p>
<p>Me: “You can’t leave me hangin' on 1A!!”</p>
<p>Knight: “I played with Vince Carter in a summer league. [Ex-NBA player] Tim Thomas had an event called Playaz Ball. On one back-door play I threw Vince a chest pass, and he'd already jumped. While in midair, he caught it between his legs and dunked it backwards. It looked like I threw him a bad alley oop pass. He is the best in-game dunker ever.”</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, a few hours after Carter announced his retirement at age 43, thus ending the longest career in NBA history (22 years), I reached out to Knight to make sure I had interpreted him correctly.</p>
<p>He meant Carter was the best dunker of all time, without qualification, correct?</p>
<p>“Yes, absolutely,” Knight said. “He was doing contest dunks in games, in traffic, with defenders in his way.”</p>
<p>You know what? Knight’s right: Carter is the best dunker of all time, for that very reason — his best dunks were regular basketball plays that suddenly morphed into mind-blowing, legend-growing, poster-showing flush jobs that the people on hand will remember for the rest of their lives.</p>

<p>One could ask Frederic Weis about that. He was France’s 7-2 center in the 2000 Sydney Olympics, and he'd be known as just another first-round Knicks draft bust if not for what Carter did to him.</p>
<p>The guy they called “Half Man, Half Amazing” intercepted a pass, raced toward Weis and literally jumped over his head for one of the most iconic dunks ever.</p>

<p>On the 15-year anniversary of Frederic’s Folly, Weis spoke with ESPN, which said the French refer to the play as “le dunk de la morte” (the dunk of death).</p>
<p>“[Carter] deserves to make history,” Weis said. “Sadly for me, I was on the video, too. I learned people can fly.”</p>
<p>Ex-Blackhawk basketball star Dante Calabria learned that lesson the easy way — as Carter’s teammate. The two played a season together at North Carolina. Calabria laughed Thursday when he recalled Carter turning a bad alley-oop pass, kind of like Knight’s, into a SportsCenter Top 10 play.</p>
<p>“We were playing Clemson in the ACC Tournament in 1996, and we have this in-bounds play where we throw a lob,” Calabria recalled. “As soon as I let it go, I was like, ‘Oh man, that’s horrible.’ Well, out of the blue came this hawk, and his arm went wide, and he grabbed it and threw it down. I said to myself, ‘What a great pass!’</p>
<p>“He could do things like that, and not just once in a while.”</p>
<p>A few years earlier, Calabria was working the Five-Star summer camp at Robert Morris when he spotted Carter, a skinny, 6-6 jumping bean, for the first time.</p>
<p>“I remember immediately calling the [North Carolina] coaches over and saying, ‘Hey, you got to look at this kid,’”&nbsp; Calabria said. “Coach Ford [assistant Phil Ford] said, ‘Yeah, we’re already on him.’”</p>
<p>Calabria is quick to point out something else: Carter wasn’t just a dunker. He was, in fact, one of five players in NBA history with at least 25,000 points, 5,000 rebounds, 4,000 assists and 500 3-pointers. The other four, as Tommy Breer of Forbes pointed out, were Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, Paul Pierce and LeBron James.</p>
<p>“And the biggest thing about Vince, basketball aside, is he’s one of the nicest guys I’ve ever met,” Calabria said. “Always has a smile, always says hello, always approachable.”</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you were in his way.</p>
