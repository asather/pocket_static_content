<h1>Local restaurant supplier Clean Care shuts down hospitality unit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lawrenceville-based Clean Care — a linen and textile laundry service for restaurants, hotels and hospitals — shut down its hospitality division Friday and laid off some 100 workers.</p>
<p>Business dried up due to the mandatory statewide shutdown of restaurants and bars during the COVID-19 crisis, chief operating officer Linda Burgman said.</p>
<p>The company, which has been in business since 1933, continues to operate its healthcare division, she said. That unit also employs about 100 people.</p>
