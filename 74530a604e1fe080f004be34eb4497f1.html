<h1>Pirates-Brewers preview: Milwaukee visits for first home series of 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After dropping two of three in St. Louis to the defending National League Central champs, the Pirates will welcome the 2019 runners-up, the Milwaukee Brewers, to PNC Park for a three-game series starting Monday.</p>
<p>While the Brewers are still expected to contend despite myriad changes this offseason, they did not get off to a strong start, losing two of three to the Cubs at Wrigley Field over the weekend.</p>
<p>Milwaukee hit just .175 as a team and struck out 28 times. If you thought the Pirates offense started slow, consider that Pittsburgh and the Brewers have the same slugging percentage — .289.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely either will stick, of course, and the Brewers have a much higher ceiling for offensive success.</p>
<p>They also have recent precedent on their side, having taken 15 of 19 from the Pirates in 2019, including consecutive sweeps after the All-Star break while outscoring Pittsburgh by nearly two runs per game (6.2-4.3).</p>
<p>What can we expect this week? Let’s take a look:</p>
<p><strong>Players to watch</strong></p>
<p><strong>LF Bryan Reynolds</strong> — Hitless in 10 at-bats against the Cardinals, Reynolds crushed the Brewers last year. He had 27 hits against them in 2019, more than twice as many as he did against anyone else (14, Reds and Cardinals). Ten of those went for extra bases, while Reynolds also walked six times, contributing to an on-base percentage of .473.</p>
<p><strong>P Joe Musgrove</strong> — On the flip side, Musgrove has not fared terribly well against Milwaukee. In four career starts, the right-hander’s ERA is 6.46, and he’s allowed eight home runs.</p>
<p><strong>OF Christian Yelich</strong> — Although he went just 1-for-13 with a home run and five strikeouts against the Cubs, nobody expects the 2018 MVP to stay quiet for long, as he returns from a fractured kneecap that cut short his 2019 season. Yelich has 80 home runs the past two seasons, including 44 in 130 games in 2019. Yelich has 14 career homers against the Pirates (tied for his most against any club) and an OPS of 1.106 at PNC Park.</p>
<p><strong>Scouting the Brewers</strong></p>
<p>In addition to Yelich, leadoff man Eric Sogard went 1-for-10 in Chicago, while No. 3 hitter Keston Hiura was 1-for-12. Oh, and longtime nemesis Ryan Braun hasn’t played the past two games, although manager Craig Counsell insisted Braun has been available.</p>
<p>Cubs pitcher Kyle Hendricks delivered a performance for the ages this past Friday, delivering MLB’s first opening day complete game since 2013 when he allowed just three hits and no runs.</p>
<p>After the Brewers beat Yu Darvish on Saturday, Tyler Chatwood allowed just three hits over six innings on Sunday, striking out eight.</p>
<p>Chicago exploded in the fourth inning, knocking Brewers starter Freddy Peralta out of the game and sending 10 batters to the plate during a four-run fourth inning.</p>
<p>The Brewers are figuring out how to replace key position players from last year’s club such as Mike Moustakas, Yasmani Grandal, Eric Thames and Trent Grisham.</p>
<p><strong>The matchups</strong></p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> LHP Steven Brault (0-0, 0.00) vs. RHP Adrian Houser (0-0, 0.00) — Houser moved from the bullpen to the starting rotation last season. Over his final 12 starts, he pitched to a 3.28 ERA with 63 strikeouts and 16 walks in 57 2/3 innings.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> LHP Derek Holland (0-0, 0.00) vs. RHP Josh Lindblom (0-0, 0.00) — Lindblom is a former Pirate who spent the past two seasons in the Korea Baseball Organization, going 35-7 with a 2.68 ERA with 346 strikeouts in 363⅓&nbsp;innings for the Doosan Bears. The Brewers signed Lindblom to a three-year deal this offseason. Holland, of course, will be making his Pirates debut.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> RHP Joe Musgrove (0-1, 4.76) vs. RHP Brandon Woodruff (0-1, 3.60) — The Pirates have actually fared decently well against Woodruff, who has a 5.02 ERA against them in five career starts.</p>
