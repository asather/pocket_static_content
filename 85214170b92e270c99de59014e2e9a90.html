<p>DECATUR, Ga. — As midnight approached, hundreds gathered in an Atlanta suburb’s town square and watched a crane swoop in and take down a 112-year-old Confederate monument.</p>
<p>The stone obelisk was removed from its perch in Decatur, Ga., on the eve of Juneteenth amid jeers and chants of “Just drop it!”</p>
<p>The monument was among those around the country that became flashpoints for protests over police brutality and racial injustice in recent weeks, following the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. The monument to the Lost Cause that was erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy was often vandalized and marked by graffiti.</p>
<p>The city of Decatur had asked a Georgia judge last week to order the removal of the monument, saying it had become a threat to public safety.</p>
<p>The DeKalb County judge ordered the 30-foot (9-meter) obelisk to be removed by June 26 and placed in storage indefinitely. His order was handed down just hours before 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed by an Atlanta police officer, renewing protests in the Georgia capital region.</p>
