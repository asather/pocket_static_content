<h1>Paul Zeise: Here's what my Final Four would have looked like</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The final gut punch from all of these COVID-19-related cancellations came over the weekend from NCAA senior vice president of Basketball Dan Gavitt. He decided the NCAA would not release any brackets as if the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-men/article/2020-03-15/ncaas-gavitt-basketball-championship-brackets-will-not-be" target="_blank">men’s and women’s tournaments</a> were going to be played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Anything less than a credible process is inconsistent with the tradition of the NCAA basketball championships. Brackets based on hypotheticals can’t substitute for a complete selection, seeding and bracketing process,” Gavitt said in a statement. He added that the pandemic is a global crisis and basketball should be kept in perspective.</p>
<p>A bracket could have easily been done using the regular season champs as the automatic qualifier from conferences that didn’t have their tournament championship, but what’s done is done. The at-large bids by Thursday of the week before Selection Sunday weren’t likely to change significantly.</p>
<p>Well, guess what Mr. Gavitt, you don’t have to put out a bracket because I’ve found one, and I will fill it out myself. This one came from ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi, and it’s as good as anything the NCAA would have put out anyway.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Here’s my Sweet 16 based on this bracket:</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Region 1 (East):</strong></p>
<p>• No. 1 Kansas vs. No. 5 Auburn. This game would be played under the watchful eye of the entire NCAA enforcement staff. Then we’d have No. 3 Duke vs. No. 2 Kentucky in what would no doubt would be cast a good versus evil.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Region 2 (Midwest):</strong></p>
<p>• No. 1 Dayton vs. No. 4 Maryland and No. 6 Penn State vs. No. 2 Florida State, in a rematch of the 2006 Orange Bowl. Hopefully both teams brought better kickers this time around. One other note from this region; unfortunately the dream died in Dayton for Robert Morris as it lost to Boston University, aka <a href="https://twitter.com/CraigMeyerPG" target="_blank">Craig Meyer University</a>, in the play-in game. Also, West Virginia fought valiantly but lost by 10 to Florida State in the second round.</p>
<p><strong>Region 3 (West): </strong></p>
<p>• No. 8 LSU vs. No. 12 Yale. I know how to <a href="https://twitter.com/TyBatiste" target="_blank">suck up to the boss</a>. We’d also have No. 3 Seton Hall vs. No. 10 Texas Tech. Both Miller brothers were in this region, and neither would’ve made it past the first round.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Region 4 (Southeast):</strong></p>
<p>• No. 1 Baylor vs. No. 4 Louisville. It’s chalky, but these are the two best teams in the region. No. 3 Michigan State would survive against Virginia in the second round to advance and play No. 7 Illinois. Also, Rutgers chopped enough wood to get to the second round but would get blasted by Baylor.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Elite Eight</strong></span></p>
<p>We would have had a dandy, I’m sure of it. It would be No.1 Kansas vs. No. 2 Kentucky, No. 1 Dayton vs. No. 2 Florida State, No. 8 LSU vs. No. 10 Texas Tech and No. 4 Louisville vs. No. 3 Michigan State. Think about all of the excitement this would bring: Dayton on the verge of the Final Four, three Hall of Fame coaches, Leonard Hamilton with a shot at the Final Four. It would be an action packed, exciting round and it would lead us to...</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Final Four</strong></span></p>
<p>John Calipari would be back in it as his team fouls late and beats Kansas by two when his team rebounds the purposely missed free throw. Dayton was a great story, but it would’ve died on the doorstep as Florida State continued its march. Kentucky vs. Florida State in one game, Texas Tech vs. Michigan State in the other game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Seminoles and Wildcats would go at it, and there’d be so much athleticism on display. But in the end, Calipari and Co. would find a way to outlast the Seminoles to advance to the championship. There they would find Michigan State, which won an ugly, physical, defensive-oriented slugfest with Texas Tech.</p>
<p>That title game would go to Kentucky in a blowout, giving Calipari his second national title and earning an extension on his lifetime contract. Izzo, meanwhile, gives talk shows across the country fodder for discussions about coaches who yell and scream.</p>
<p>Ah well, dare to dream, right?</p>
<p>On the women’s side, I had Stony Brook over Oregon in the national championship, but that’s a different story for a different day.</p>
