<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hot temperatures and high humidity on Thursday are going to create miserable and dangerous conditions.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service said the heat index will make temperatures in Western Pennsylvania feel like 102 degrees. It has issued a heat advisory from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m. Thursday and warned that the conditions can cause heat illnesses.</p>
<p>With that, the state&nbsp;Department of Environmental Protection and the Southwestern Pennsylvania Air Quality Partnership issued a Code Orange air quality alert for much of southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Code Orange alert means ground-level ozone and/or fine particulates are expected to exceed national health-based standards. The conditions can cause breathing problems for sensitive groups â€” elderly, children, pregnant women and people with asthma, heart disease and respiratory disease.</p>
