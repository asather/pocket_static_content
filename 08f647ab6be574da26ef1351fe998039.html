<h1>Steelers-Eagles: Brian Batko's Week 5 scouting report</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>When Eagles have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> QB Carson Wentz, RB Miles Sanders, TE Zach Ertz, WR DeSean Jackson, WR Greg Ward, WR John Hightower, C Jason Kelce, RT Lane Johnson</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> The Eagles picked up their first win of the season last week despite not doing a whole lot right on offense, other than playing mostly mistake-free football and picking up a couple crucial fourth-down conversions. There was also one big play when Wentz hit no-name wideout Travis Fulgham for a 42-yard touchdown, but other than that, they’re still struggling to move the ball. The 25 points were a season high, but that also included a defensive touchdown. Wentz has thrown a league-leading seven interceptions.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> When your leading receiver is posting 57 yards on just two receptions, you know something’s amiss among the pass-catchers. Such is the case in Philadelphia, where Jackson is working his way back from a hamstring injury, fellow veteran wideout Alshon Jeffery won’t play with an illness and rookie first-round pick Jalen Reagor is on injured reserve. Enter the likes of Ward, Hightower and Fulgham, a rag-tag crew of receivers who don't exactly strike fear into secondaries.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> This offense still revolves around its franchise quarterback in Wentz, and the Eagles are throwing more often (61.9%) than all but seven teams. To compensate for a banged-up receiving corps, Wentz will continue trying to get Sanders involved out of the backfield and peppering Ertz with targets over the middle. Only two tight ends have more targets than Ertz through four weeks, although he’s averaging just 4.8 yards per target. Also expect dual-threat rookie QB Jalen Hurts to come in occasionally for designed runs and gadget plays.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Both bookends of the line are in flux. At left tackle, Jordan Mailata is coming off his first NFL start and drawing comparisons to Alejandro Villanueva, who also began his career in Philadelphia. Mailata, a seventh-round draft pick two years ago, is a converted rugby star who’s 6-feet-8, 346 pounds. On the right side, Johnson is a three-time Pro Bowler but will have to play through an ankle injury, lest he be replaced by rookie fourth-rounder Jack Driscoll again.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>When Steelers have the ball</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Key performers:</strong> DT Fletcher Cox, DT Javon Hargrave, DE Brandon Graham, DE Derek Barnett, LB Nathan Gerry, LB Duke Riley, CB Darius Slay, DB Jalen Mills, S Rodney McLeod</p>
<p><strong>What’s been working:</strong> Pass rush, pass rush, pass rush. All your sacks belong to the state of Pennsylvania, as the only team with more so far than the Steelers is the Eagles (in one extra game). Thirteen players have at least a half-sack, with perennial standout Graham and fellow defensive end Josh Sweat leading the way with three apiece. They also rank in the top 10 in total yards (352.3) and rushing yards (108.8) allowed per game.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s hot (or not):</strong> Also dealing with plenty of health issues, the cornerbacks are coming off their best game of the season, allowing just eight catches for 86 yards to wide receivers last week. That’s what it was supposed to look like when they traded for Slay, a three-time Pro Bowler, this offseason. Opposite him was Mills, a corner who was supposed to transition to safety but had to go back to his old position due to injuries and played well against the 49ers.</p>
<p><strong>Game plan:</strong> Unlike the Steelers, the Eagles are hunting quarterbacks mostly with four-man pressure. While the Steelers lead the league in blitz percentage, the Eagles rank in the bottom half of the league in that category. Granted, you have to be able to generate pressure when your linebackers struggle in pass defense the way theirs have, and it would seem that covering the opposing tight end is not at all part of the game plan. George Kittle posted 15 grabs for 183 yards and became the third tight end in four weeks to score against the Eagles.</p>
<p><strong>Keep an eye on:</strong> Hargrave has faced off against this Steelers offensive line a time or two, and his ability to get off the ball and occupy double teams is a major reason why he went from one side of the state to the other in free agency. He’s off to a slow start in his new city with just a half-sack and one tackle, but he missed the season opener because of a chest injury and is seeing his snap count increase by the week.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Special teams</strong></span></p>
<p>In 18 career kick returns, backup running back Boston Scott has yet to break one longer than 35 yards. … Ward hasn't been much of a threat on punt returns, either, a job that was supposed to go to Reagor until he muffed one in the opener, then got hurt. … K Jake Elliott is 7 of 8 on field goals and has hit all seven extra points, with his lone miss coming from 53 yards. … P Cameron Johnston has a booming leg, ranking third in the league with 51.6 yards per punt, but he also has put 10 of 17 attempts inside the 20 and ranks third in net yards per punt (45.9).</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Keys to victory</strong></span></p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Eagles must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Get back to your roots.</strong> Putting the ball in Wentz’s hands and letting him either air it out or make plays with his feet is the surest way to revive a reeling offensive attack.</p>
<p><strong>Stake out the run.</strong> That said, getting Sanders going to provide Wentz with a reliable ground game will help keep an aggressive defense from pinning its ears back and rushing the QB.</p>
<p><strong>Fly into the pocket.</strong> Putting pressure on Ben Roethlisberger will be paramount to stopping an offense that has been good enough but far from great through three games.</p>
<p><em><strong>To win, the Steelers must…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Fix the cracks.</strong> A leaky defense in the first half against Houston has to sustain the momentum against Wentz, Ertz and a shaky supporting cast.</p>
<p><strong>All about the Benjamin</strong>. Not Franklin, but the one who will need his offensive line to protect him against a fearsome front that must make life easier for a suspect back seven.</p>
<p><strong>Sidestep a rocky start.</strong> Shaking the rust off after an unexpected off week is a must for a team that was rolling until COVID-19 messed with the schedule.</p>
