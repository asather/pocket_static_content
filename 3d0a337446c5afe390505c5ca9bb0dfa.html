<h1>CSI Pittsburgh? This date is a true crime</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prompted by the popularity of true crime podcasts, documentaries and maybe “CSI,” the Carnegie Science Center is offering an adults-only “Science After Hours: True Crime” night on Friday.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we’re exploring forensic science or any type of true crime,” said Megan McKenzie, events marketing manager for the science center. “We try to find themes that are really like what pop culture is talking about.”</p>
<p>The event will include a mock crime scene, with a detective wall where people can try to solve the crime. It won’t be “extremely bloody,” said Ms. McKenzie, but will include sensitive topics. It will also allow attendees to&nbsp;try a mini-escape room, draw a composite police sketch and identify footprints, fingerprints and dental impressions,.</p>
<p>Lawyers attending the event can get continuing legal education credit by attending a panel discussion organized by the Young Lawyers Division of the Allegheny County Bar Association.</p>
<p>Criminal law expert Bruce Antkowiak will speak on “Brady violations, bad science and wrongful convictions” and lawyer Doug Sughrue will discuss scientific evidence from the Netflix documentary “Evil Genius” about the Erie pizza bomber case.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will also be a presentation on Pittsburgh true crime history from the KDKA Pittsburgh Oddcast.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/programs/science-after-hours/" target="_blank">Tickets</a> are $15 in advance and $20 at the door, and Carnegie Museum members get a 10 percent discount. The event runs from 6 to 10 p.m. and food and alcohol will be available for purchase.</p>
<p>Every month, the Science Center holds one themed adult-only event on a Friday night. A true crime night was a popular request that attendees of other adult-only events have made on post-event surveys.</p>
<p>“We’re already halfway sold with tickets,” said Ms. McKenzie. “Normally we don’t see that this early.”</p>
