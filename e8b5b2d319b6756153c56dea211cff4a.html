<h1>Back in San Jose, Patrick Marleau discusses trade to Penguins and his NHL future</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SAN JOSE, Calif. — It would have been understandable had muscle memory kicked in before a game late Saturday night against the San Jose Sharks, but Patrick Marleau, by all accounts, did not initially stroll into the home locker room at SAP Center.</p>
<p>Marleau, back in the city he has called home for two decades, is with the Penguins now. And while he is disappointed his second go-round with the Sharks did not go as he had planned this season, he’s excited for a second chance in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I have another 10 years to go,” he said before playing the team that took him second overall in the draft in 1997. “I have a great opportunity for myself to come [to Pittsburgh] and get in the playoffs and have another shot at winning.”</p>
<p>This time a year ago, the forward was chasing that elusive Stanley Cup with the Toronto Maple Leafs. They came up short again and shipped him to Carolina in the summer. The Hurricanes bought out his contract. So he returned home.</p>
<p>The Sharks, who had made the postseason in 14 of the past 15 seasons, got off to a slow start, rebounded in November then sunk like a stone in the standings. San Jose had one of the NHL’s worst records Monday at the trade deadline.</p>
<p>“It was just a really rocky time at the start there, coming back. Up and down and then we ran into some injury trouble and a coaching change,” he said. “So there were a lot of variables that went into play. We just didn’t hit our stride.”</p>
<p>Running out of chances to win a Cup, Marleau welcomed a trade to a contender. The Penguins acquired him Monday for a conditional 2021 third-round pick.</p>
<p>“Look at the roster. It’s kind of a no-brainer,” he said when asked about joining the Penguins. “You see the names they have on it and obviously the past success they’ve had as well. So they know how to win and it’s good to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>Marleau said he first needed the blessing of his wife, Christina, and their kids.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult, especially when family and kids are involved,” the Saskatchewan native said. “You have to weigh those options as well. My family’s very supportive and they mean the world to me. But they wanted me to have a shot.”</p>
<p>Marleau, who did not record a point in his first two games with the Penguins, is all-in on the playoff push in Pittsburgh. But he indicated that he doesn’t plan for this to be his last hurrah and is open to rejoining the Sharks this offseason.</p>
<p>Marleau, with 1,718 games under his belt after suiting up Saturday in San Jose, is 49 games behind Gordie Howe for the NHL’s all-time games played record.</p>
<p>“I would definitely like to play another season,” said the 40-year-old, who got bumped up Saturday onto Evgeni Malkin’s line against his former team.</p>
<p><strong>Not back yet</strong></p>
<p>Injured defensemen Brian Dumoulin and John Marino and forward Nick Bjugstad did not return to the lineup against the Sharks. But coach Mike Sullivan said it was a productive trip for the three players, who all skated Saturday morning.</p>
<p>“They got an opportunity to be around the team, to sit in meetings, to join team practices, which I think helps with their timing, getting into the battles, making reads, decisions, all of those things,” he said. “And then when the team [wasn’t practicing], they got a lot of good, quality work with our assistant coaches.”</p>
<p>Zach Trotman and Sam Lafferty were the healthy scratches against the Sharks. Juuso Riikola replaced Trotman on the blue line.</p>
<p><strong>Jarry’s next step?</strong></p>
<p>After Matt Murray was in goal Friday for a 3-2 loss in Anaheim, Tristan Jarry got the start against San Jose. Jarry, a first-time All-Star, entered the game with a 20-10-1 record and a .927 save percentage that still ranks among the league’s best.</p>
<p>Sullivan was asked before the game what the next step is for the 24-year-old.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s his continued consistency of play,” he said. “He really has played well for us. He deserves a lot of credit. … He’s worked extremely hard to put himself in the position [he is in]. He’s been a big part of some of the wins we’ve had this year and certainly we’re going to rely on him down the stretch.”</p>
<p><strong>Important faceoffs</strong></p>
<p>Entering Saturday, the Penguins had won just 37.5% of their faceoffs while short-handed, which ranked last in the league. Sullivan said they must be better in that area and that newcomer Evan Rodrigues could help there.</p>
<p>“It’s important. Especially if you can win that first faceoff, get a 200-foot clear, a lot of times it takes power plays 20 to 30 seconds to gain entrance into your zone again. And they’ve got to expend energy doing it,” Sullivan, a former NHL center, said. “So it’s an important faceoff. It’s an important part of penalty killing.”</p>
