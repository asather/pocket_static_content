<h1>Pa. suspends inmate visits at state prisons amid COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state’s department of corrections on Thursday canceled inmate visits at all state prisons for two weeks beginning Friday in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The department will also begin “enhanced screening of all staff, vendors and contracted providers, including contracted chaplains” at all state correctional institutions, according to a press release.</p>
<p>"Our goal, in addition to delaying the impact of this virus on our system, is to continue normal operation of our system,” department of corrections secretary John Wetzel&nbsp;wrote in the release. “To focus on that goal, we need to limit who enters our facilities and focus on critical functions."</p>
<p>The press release says officials are working to increase inmates’ phone time and commissary order limits as a result of the cancellations.</p>
<p>"We are all in this together," Mr. Wetzel wrote. "So, together we are going to work to mitigate the virus' impact on our state prison system."</p>
