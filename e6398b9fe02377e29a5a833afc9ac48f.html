<h1>Justin Schultz hoping to prove he's still one of Penguins' top defensemen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — The play Justin Schultz made during the second period of Tuesday’s win was exactly what the Penguins want from the veteran blue-liner, who by most measures is having his worst season in black and gold.</p>
<p>No, we’re not talking about the goal he scored, though that shot was sweet.</p>
<p>Take a look at what Schultz did in his defensive zone just seconds before that.</p>
<p>When New Jersey Devils forward Nico Hischier crossed over the blue line, Schultz decisively stepped up on him, using his wheels and a quick poke check to instantly take away Hischier’s space. Schultz threw in a shove for good measure.</p>
<p>Schultz kept standing his ground and swatted away Hischier’s attempt at a through-the-legs pass to Kyle Palmieri. And just like that, the Penguins were off.</p>
<p>“He jumps up into the offense and has a chance at the other end,” Mike Sullivan said Wednesday. “For me, that’s a great example of just creating offense off of our defense. And that’s what we’ve been preaching to the whole group.”</p>
<p>Seeing the Penguins had all three forwards on the counterattack, Schultz actually slowed up as Bryan Rust carried the puck into the zone. Once Schultz saw an opportunity to join the play as an uncovered trailer, he picked his stride back up. Evgeni Malkin spotted him and Schultz sniped Mackenzie Blackwood.</p>
<p>That goal, his first since returning to the lineup on Jan. 31, was a shot in the arm for the struggling Schultz. But his coach was perhaps as pleased with what Schultz did in his own end as he was with what he did to that poor Devils goalie.</p>
<p>“Justin uses his skill set to win pucks — his mobility, his stick, his smarts. He’s a real smart player. … He can get to pucks quickly. He can take good angles on guys. He can separate people from the puck,” Sullivan said. “All of those things that allow him to be good offensively can [also] help him be good defensively.”</p>
<p>He added: “That might have been Justin Schultz’s best game [this season].”</p>
<p>The 29-year-old has struggled this season, particularly in his defensive end. He has just 12 points in 46 games and his minus-13 rating is his worst for a single season since the Penguins took him on as a reclamation project in 2015-16.</p>
<p>His advanced statistics are not pretty either. Opponents have generated 50.4% of the high-danger scoring chances when Schultz is on the ice at 5-on-5, per Natural Stat Trick. Only Jack Johnson has fared worse among Penguins blue-liners.</p>
<p>In numbers that Natural Stat Trick tracks to try to paint a picture of a team’s puck possession and scoring chances when a particular player is on the ice, Schultz’s stats are closer to those of Chad Ruhwedel than they are to Kris Letang’s.</p>
<p>That, coupled with Schultz’s team-worst plus-minus rating, has led to rumblings that Ruhwedel could claim Schultz’s spot in the lineup. For now, the Penguins are hoping Schultz can rediscover his past form on their third defensive pair.</p>
<p>Three seasons ago, the righty received votes for the Norris Trophy and helped the Penguins, sans Letang, win their second straight Stanley Cup. Schultz had another strong campaign in 2017-18. Last season, he suffered a gruesome ankle injury in the fourth game of the season and hasn’t been the same player since.</p>
<p>The dip in production is one thing. But his play on defense has been troublesome. Too often this season Schultz has been spotted out of position while a red flight flickers on his goalie. Opponents have actually scored more goals per 60 minutes with Schultz on the ice at 5-on-5 compared to Johnson, per Natural Stat Trick.</p>
<p>Schultz acknowledged he hasn’t played up to the standard he set from 2016 to 2018. He said he must put himself in better position defensively, be “tougher on guys in front” and do a better job of communicating with teammates.</p>
<p>“That’s when I’m at my best, when I play strong defensively,” Schultz said.</p>
<p>When Schultz is at his stingiest, he typically makes plays like he did prior to his goal in New Jersey, smothering puck-carriers when they skate across his blue line. That way, the other team can’t set up the cycle and muscle him around.</p>
<p>“Number 1, it starts with his gap,” Sullivan said. “He’s a mobile guy. His gaps can be tight because he has the ability to recover if someone gets a step on him.”</p>
<p>Of course, it takes some swagger to aggressively defend opponents on the rush like that. And Schultz indicated that has been lacking at times this season.</p>
<p>Maybe one play, one nasty wrist shot, can help him turn his season around.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what it is, but when you put it in, you just get a little bit of confidence from that. Obviously, I was struggling to find it,” said Schultz, who had not scored since Nov. 12. “But just for me, I think playing strong defensively will lead to opportunities for me and obviously help the team win.”</p>
<p>One can’t help but wonder if an uncertain future has weighed on Schultz.</p>
<p>After turning his NHL career around in Pittsburgh, he earned a contract extension that will expire this summer. With limited salary cap space, it seemed unlikely the Penguins could pay him big bucks this summer. Now, given another down season and the emergence of rookie John Marino, they might not want to.</p>
<p>Asked about his future, Schultz said he will worry about that this summer. His current concern is helping the Penguins have a special spring. Schultz playing like the guy we saw three years ago will certainly aid them in that quest.</p>
<p>“I’m just focusing on trying to win another Stanley Cup,” he said. “We’ve got a great group of guys here and a good team. And I just want to bring it every night and try to help this team win and play as long as we can this year.”</p>
