<h1>Mars school board narrowly approves refinancing district’s ’14 bond issue </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A split Mars Area School Board voted March 10 to refinance the district’s 2014 bond issue if the district saves at least $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Alisha Reesh Henry, of PNC Capital Markets, said the stock and bond markets are so “volatile” that the information she printed for board members earlier that day was already wrong.</p>
<p>“We’re at all-time lows,” she said.</p>
<p>The issue was an “advance refunding.” The district could save more if it waited until after March 1, 2022, Ms. Henry said.</p>
<p>The board voted 5-4 to refinance $16.6 million in bonds with the “floor” savings of $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Board members Rita Dorsch, J. Dayle Ferguson, Kevin Hagen, Gordon Marburger and President John Kennedy voted to refinance the debt.</p>
<p>Members Anthony DePretis, Megan Lenz, Christine Valenta and Sallie Wick opposed the refinance. Mrs. Valenta wanted a higher number for the “floor,” while Mrs. Lenz and Mrs. Wick wanted to wait until 2022, when the district could save at least $2 million.</p>
<p>In other business, the board approved the 2020-21 budget for the Butler County Area Vocational Technical School and had a lengthy discussion with Kurt Speicher, executive director of the school, about how they could generate more interest in vo-tech from students.</p>
<p>The district will pay $243,854 to the vo-tech next year, a decrease of $16,000 because fewer Mars Area students are attending.</p>
<p>Mr. Speicher noted that Mars Area is the only district in Butler County where students have to “opt in” to tour the vo-tech. Other districts have all eighth graders visit the vo-tech unless parents specifically say no.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to make a decision on something that you never see,” he said.</p>
<p>Resident Virgil Knox, president of Hampton Concrete Products in Middlesex, told board members that district teachers and guidance counselors are “abusing” students by pushing college because many will not graduate from college but will be saddled with debt.</p>
<p>“When you take your 98% of kids that are going to college, 70% will never graduate. You make 70% of the kids in Mars Area a failure. Of the 30% you have left, 50% were led astray and never use their degree.”</p>
<p>Superintendent Wes Shipley said teachers and counselors do work with kids on considering vo-tech.</p>
<p>“It’s having the parents to have the mindset that their kids can go to vo-tech,” Mrs. Lenz said.</p>
