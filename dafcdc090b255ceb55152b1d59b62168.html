<h1>Downtown Pittsburgh hotel will close for two months</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Omni William Penn Hotel announced Friday that it will temporarily shut down its operations for two months starting Monday.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s “Grand Dame” will join several other major hotels that have made the decision to suspend operations and lay off workers until the spread of the COVID-19 virus is under control and travel business picks up again.</p>
<p>A statement from Peter Strebel, president of Omni Hotels &amp; Resorts, said the 650-room hotel would suspend operations from Monday until June 1.</p>
<p>“Our intent is to reopen the hotel as quickly as possible, although we will reassess each week,” he said.</p>
<p>Hotels across the country are feeling the sting from a severe drop in travel brought on by government leaders across the nation and around the world announcing shutdown orders for all nonessential business activity. All of Nevada’s hotels and casinos have been ordered shut down.</p>
<p>The drop in business for the hotel industry has taken a toll on workers, many of whom are being laid off because of the closures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Strebel did not say if Omni employees would continue to be paid while the hotel is not doing business.</p>
<p>“Our associates are at the heart of our business and we’re working diligently to minimize the impact for them,” he said in the statement.</p>
