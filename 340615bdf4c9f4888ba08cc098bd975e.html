<h1>Pa. to train more local police officers as experts in spotting DUI drivers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania is among seven states receiving $210,000 in grants to train more police officers as experts in identifying drivers under the influence of alcohol and other drugs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state’s $35,000 portion of the grant will be distributed to the Pennsylvania DUI Association, which will train 20 officers as “drug recognition experts” across eight city police agencies. The state has not yet finalized which city agencies will receive the funding.</p>
<p>The grants were awarded through the Governors Highway Safety Association and the Foundation for Advancing Alcohol Responsibility.</p>
<p>"Vehicle miles traveled fell drastically during the pandemic, but that decline didn't result in improved safety on our nation's roadways," GHSA executive director Jonathan Adkins said in a statement. "Alcohol and drug impaired driving persisted, with prevention experts warning the problem may worsen as people continue to worry about contracting the virus, recover from the economic fall-out and adhere to social distancing requirements."</p>
<p>Jennifer Kuntch, deputy communications director of the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, said officers are specially trained to "detect individuals driving under the influence of drugs, and to identify the type of drug causing the impairment."</p>
<p>The officers will also learn how to recognize whether drivers are suffering from a medical condition instead of a drug impairment.</p>
<p>Training is expected to begin in December.</p>
<p>There are already nearly 225 trained drug recognition experts across Pennsylvania, according to PennDOT.</p>
<p>The GHSA predicts impaired driving risks to be "particularly high" this summer as bars, restaurants and other hospitality establishments reopen after several months with their doors closed.</p>
<p>The grant is also meant to aid states in implementing "key recommendations" in a report on high-risk impaired drivers conducted by the GHSA.</p>
<p>Other states receiving the grants include Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Washington and Wyoming.</p>
