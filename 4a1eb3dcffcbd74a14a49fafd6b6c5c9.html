<h1>Pitt is still learning how to handle success — mainly, holding on to late leads</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For much of the season, from its outset to where his Pitt team finds itself now in late January, Jeff Capel has spoken frequently of success.</p>
<p>That discussion can often revolve around the desire for the Panthers to be successful, to be the program Capel believes it can be. At times, though, it has delved into the perils and pitfalls of success. Nobody on this team, Capel has often said, is accustomed to success. The players who were on the team when he took over in March 2018 were coming off an 8-24 season that was defined by a 0-19 mark in ACC games. Xavier Johnson, his standout sophomore point guard, was an overlooked three-star recruit. Even those ranked higher than Johnson coming out of high school — like Trey McGowens, Au’Diese Toney and Gerald Drumgoole — weren’t among the top 75 prospects in their respective classes.</p>
<p>Rescuing a program from the depths of misery is hard. Lifting it to the next level is harder.</p>
<p>On a macro level, that’s a predicament in which the Panthers find themselves and have since they finished last season, Capel’s first with the program, at a relatively surprising 14-19. Beyond that program-building process, they still maneuver the challenges that come with the task, even within the games they play.</p>
<p>It has been evident over the past several matchups, as Pitt has struggled to hold on to leads. Against Boston College on Wednesday, the Panthers led by 10 with 3:57 remaining only to need a Ryan Murphy pull-up in the final five seconds to save them in a 74-72 victory. Last Saturday, they led North Carolina by as many as 20 in the second half, only to see that advantage trimmed to 10, though it mattered little in a 66-52 win. The costliest of the late stumbles came last Tuesday against Louisville, when they surrendered a seven-point lead in the final 2:21 of what ended as a 73-68 overtime loss, depriving them of a marquee win against a team now ranked in the top 10 of both national polls.</p>
<p>They’re all things that Capel sees as being connected.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to build winning habits,” he said Wednesday after the win. “It’s something collectively as a group that we don’t have. I don’t know if it’s youth, inexperience, inexperience with success, but the bottom line is we don’t have it. You get a lead and human nature tells you ‘OK, I can relax now. I can take this possession off.’ In our game, momentum can change very quickly.”</p>
<p>Playing with a lead, while obviously preferable to the alternative, can be a tricky proposition sometimes for a team, especially one that features three sophomores and a freshman among its top five scorers.</p>
<p>For all its improvement last season, Pitt didn’t have extensive experience playing with a lead late in games. In the final 10 minutes and overtime periods of its 18 ACC regular season games, a total of 190 minutes, it led for 41:05. Nearly three-quarters of that time — 29:34, to be exact — came from its three wins, meaning that in their 15 other games, the Panthers led in the final 10 minutes for 11:31 of a possible 155 minutes.</p>
<p>This season, through its first eight ACC games, Pitt has already surpassed that total, leading for a collective 44:32 in the final 10 minutes of regulation and overtime (of a possible 85 minutes). As the last few games have indicated, they’re still getting used to such situations.</p>
<p>“We lose our mind,” Toney said Wednesday after the Boston College game. “When things are going wrong, we’re not clicking on all cylinders. We just had to slow down and get back together.”</p>
<p>There is, to Toney, a silver lining, one that was found in the Boston College win. After losing the lead, the Panthers were able to respond and secure a victory, the type of resilience Toney doesn’t believe they would have been able to conjure last season when the players weren’t as familiar, experienced or comfortable with one another.</p>
<p>Freshman Justin Champagnie embodied that ability to quickly recover, having turned the ball over on a bad pass that led to Boston College’s tying basket only to come back, literally seconds later, and take the ball up the court to set up Murphy for the winning shot.</p>
<p>“I’ve always been like that,” Champagnie said Friday. “If I make a mistake, I want to get it back, somehow, some way, and make up for the mistake.”</p>
<p>Handy as some of those traits may be, Capel still sees areas of improvement.</p>
<p>He sees a tendency to relax among his players when they have a lead, something that causes them to lose sight of how it is they got to that point in the first place. In those moments, they cease to defend at a high level, sometimes losing track of their man and becoming overly focused on the ball instead of what’s developing around the rest of the court. They don’t rebound quite as well, which can lead to coveted second-chance looks for their opponent.</p>
<p>It’s at a time of the season — 19 games in, with only a couple of days between games from this point on — when Capel and his staff try to protect players, especially on a team on which many of those players are logging heavy minutes and dealing with the weathering effect that playing time can have over the course of weeks and months. As he sees Pitt continue to struggle in some of the game’s biggest, most crucial stretches, though, he realizes something needs to change.</p>
<p>“As a staff, we need to do a better job of helping our guys in those situations,” Capel said. “We worked on game situations a lot early in the season, but we haven’t done it in a little bit. Showing it on tape, watching it on tape, which we do after every game, that’s not working. We need to get in the gym and do some more of those situations.”</p>
