<h1>New Pirates reliever Robbie Erlin trying to keep things simple </h1>

<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Robbie Erlin extended his left arm and pointed his fingers across the Pirates clubhouse. The gesture was symbolic, in a few different ways, because it’s literally and figuratively where things got away from the 29-year-old former third-round pick in 2019, as his ERA ballooned to a career-worst 5.37 while with the San Diego Padres.</p>
<p>Too often last season, Erlin lacked anything resembling a desirable feel of the baseball. Instead of relying on one or two things to think about — “mental keys,” he called them — Erlin fixated on his mechanics, stressing over his stride or his push-off or any number of things.</p>
<p>“It took some reflection and honest self-evaluation at the end of last year,” Erlin said. “You kind of sift through what you physically did on the mound, mechanics-wise, releasing the ball, then you kind of go into your mentality, and you break it all down. ... I feel like I got a little bit away from having a fine focus last year.</p>
<p>“I think I focused on mechanics a little too much. It kind of got me off my game.”</p>
<p>The Pirates signed Erlin to a minor-league contract late last month, conceivably because they think he can get that fine focus back. And if he does, Erlin could offer the Pirates something they surely need: a reliable southpaw out of the bullpen.</p>
<p>Right now, he would seem to have the inside track on that job based on what he did in 2018, when he pitched to a 2.05 ERA out of the bullpen with San Diego while striking out 44 and walking just four in 52 2/3 innings.</p>
<p>Erlin’s struggle with feel did not manifest itself when it came to his best pitch — the curveball. Opposing hitters slugged just .278 against it in 2019 and .239 the year before that, the result of its elite vertical movement.</p>
<p>That pitch averaged seven inches of break above the league average, according to Statcast, which comes in part because of its elite spin rate (2,598 rpm).</p>
<p>The biggest difference involved Erlin’s four-seam fastball, against which opposing hitters hit .346 and slugged .500. Both numbers are indicative of someone who had trouble establishing a baseline pitch and basing everything else off that.</p>
<p>“There are simple things you have to do in order to pitch effectively,” Erlin said. “No. 1 is locating a fastball, then pitching off that.</p>
<p>“No matter who you are, if you attack a zone, you’re aggressive and you locate a fastball, you can get anybody out.”</p>
<p>And if you don’t, well, things turn out like they did for Erlin, who will earn $1.5 million in 2020 if he makes the big-league roster, plus an additional $500,000 in incentives.</p>
<p>“I think I got kind of off-base at times last year,” Erlin said. “That led to sporadic pitches or ups and downs instead of an even, steady pitching style.”</p>
<p>Creating an elite spin rate has always come relatively easy for Erlin, even though when he was growing up, it wasn’t always quantified as such. To him, it was simply extending his left hand toward a target; that naturally created life on his pitches, specifically with his curveball.</p>
<p>Erlin always focused on his extension — what he was demonstrating in the clubhouse — and never really worried too much about what the rest of his body was doing.</p>
<p>“I’ve just thought about release and getting out front,” Erlin said. “I never thought about trying to hit a number.”</p>
<p>Spring training will show whether 2018 was an aberration or whether that’s really who Erlin is after he had Tommy John surgery in 2016. He made just five major league starts in 2015 and 2016 before shifting full-time into a bullpen role.</p>
<p>Earning a job with the Pirates won’t be easy, as they might have a surprisingly crowded bullpen with the returns of Nick Burdi and Edgar Santana. However, as a lefty with an elite spin pitch and an above-average changeup, the Pirates are certainly willing to give Erlin a chance to see if he’s able to rediscover that 2018 form.</p>
<p>“It’s not something I want to put energy into,” Erlin said of competing for a regular job. “Right now, it’s trying to be the best I can be and preparing myself to play an entire season. On top of that, how can I talk to other guys in the clubhouse and learn, share ideas and grow?</p>
<p>“I haven’t given it a ton of thought. I’d rather just keep it simple and throw the ball.”</p>
