<h1>Pittsburgh to begin landslide remediation projects next month in Squirrel Hill, Duquesne Heights</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh will move ahead next month with construction of retaining walls to address major landslides in Squirrel Hill and Duquesne Heights.</p>
<p>The cityâ€™s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure announced Wednesday it will install walls along Commercial Street in Squirrel Hill and on Greenleaf Street in Duquesne Heights. Both projects will close the streets for about four months beginning Feb. 3.</p>
<p>On Commercial Street, Allison Park Contractors have a $750,000 contract to build a steel beam wall on the hillside below the road near the Walnut Towers apartments and the Summerset at Frick housing complex. The project will begin with utility relocation work.</p>
<p>That portion of Commercial Street has been a problem for several years. First, the hillside above the connection between Swisshelm Park and Squirrel Hill slid onto the road, limiting traffic several times. Then last year, the hillside below the street began to slide away, causing it to be limited to one lane of traffic alternating in each direction since last January.</p>
<p>In Duquesne Heights, Greenleaf Street also has had a landslide problem since 2018.&nbsp; It will be closed between Horner and Bradley streets while Independent Enterprises installs a modular block wall to support the street at a cost of $350,000.</p>
