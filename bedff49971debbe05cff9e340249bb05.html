<h1>U.N. warns world hunger could double as pandemic cripples global economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic is likely to double the number of people facing acute hunger this year, according to <a href="https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/WFP-0000114546/download/?_ga=2.267372749.210065150.1587380654-754817525.1586777487" rel="nofollow">a new report</a> from the World Food Program that details how the virus — and the resulting lockdowns — will exacerbate conditions in some of the world’s poorest nations.</p>
<p>About 265 million people in low- and middle-income nations could face starvation by the end of 2020, a doubling of the 135 million who already faced acute food insecurity in 2019, according to the program, which is part of the United Nations. Most of the countries with the worst food crises are in Africa, with conflict, climate change and economic crises listed as the main factors threatening access to food.</p>
<p>The coronavirus pandemic has infected more than 2.4 million people and killed over 165,000 in at least 177 nations since it began, upending almost all aspects of life, and introducing dramatic changes to how we interact, learn, and work. Across the world, lockdowns and social distancing measures aimed at curbing the spread of the virus have also affected agricultural production, food security and levels of nutrition.</p>

<p>Unless much-needed food and humanitarian aid is delivered to those in need, the virus and the response “could prove catastrophic for millions already hanging by a thread,” Arif Husain, the chief economist with the World Food Program, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage,” Mr. Husain said, adding, “It only takes one more shock — like Covid-19 — to push them over the edge.”</p>
<p>The United Nations said on Monday that global donors had only pledged a quarter of the $2 billion it needs to respond to the challenges brought by the pandemic.</p>
