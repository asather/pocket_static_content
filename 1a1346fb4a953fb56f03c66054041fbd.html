<h1>Nubyjas Wilborn's Pirates chat transcript: 01.29.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: If the Pirates are transparent with their future plans with the fans, can they salvage the fan base? <br> <strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: What are the chances of Bell being traded before the season? If his first half of the season is anything like his second half last year his trade value goes into the dumpster. But if he has a great first half, his value at the deadline will skyrocket. What do the Bucs wager on? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Good Afternoon, Pirates fans. Hello and welcome to the chat. Let's start with Rick Sunner in Orlando <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Only thing that will salvage fans is winning. They have to build a winner. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I don't think the Pirates will trade Bell to before the start of the season. Nothing is impossible but I believe he'll be at first base when the season opens in Tampa.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: Why don't the Pirates just trade Bell for prospects now and open the season with Craig at 1B, then Newman, Tucker and Hayes for INF. Might as well see if these guys can play. They'll never pay Bell. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Because who's to say they'll never pay Bell? They paid Cutch &amp; Marte. The Pirates also have 3 arb seasons of Bell there is no reason to rush.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Powhatan</strong>: What's your perceived pitching rotation for this season, and, can the Pirates find another catcher before April? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Archer, Trevor Williams, Musgrove, Keller, Brault. And sure they can. Will they? Stay tuned.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: is there a market for Adam Frazier? and if he’s not moved, where does Cole Tucker start The season? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Yes there is a market for him. A good hitter and improving defender. They could get a nice deal for him. If he's not moved then Tucker could make the team as back up shortstop. The 26th man could benefit Tucker staying in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Chief Powhatan</strong>: You have the toughest job in P-G sports coverage Nubyjas. How can you survive six months of reporting on a surefire 110-loss season? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: It isn't that hard. I get to write about baseball and I love writing baseball. It's a blessing. Watching a losing team isn't always fun but there's always stories to tell.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Why did Shelton and Herrington take on their jobs if there are no payroll increases promised in the near future? The fans will not put up with 3 100 loss seasons in a row. It seems like a bad movie rerun on stripping this team down unless there were some assurances down the road that there will be an opportunity to sign some bigger names in 2-3 years down the road like the Brewers have recently done.I, like many loyal Bucco fans, have no faith or trust that Nutting will do the right thing. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Who's to say they did? Both men had other options. I'd like to believe they wouldn't have come to Pittsburgh unless they thought they could win. But what you said about faith of the fandom is understandable. All the org can do is make legit steps to change the narrative. It won't be easy.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Bucs Fan</strong>: Nubyjas. From Beaver Valley but in Georgia since 89 for work. Haven't made it to see a game in PNC Park but catch the Bucs when they are in Atlanta. Do you think the Nut will open the vault over the next couple of years and make us a contender again ? Thank you. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I hope to see you at Truist this season, Ga Bucs. And I'd like to think so, but I get why fans don't have faith in it.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: I wanted to buy my nephew a jersey for our spring training visit. Which Pirate is the safest jersey to get right now? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Mitch Keller. Seriously, he's early in his deal and has potential to be good for a while.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: From what I've heard and read, the Marte trade was a good trade where we received 2 of Arizona's top 10 prospects. It appears we're in rebuild mode. Would it be wise to get some top prospects for Bell? We should be able to get a good return. Or is it best to keep him? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I think it is best to keep him.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Hi Nubyjas. Do you think that the sickening salary dump that occurred this week will catch the attention of the player's union? They can't be pleased. On a side note, I guarantee not one Diamondback's fan bemoaned the loss of two prized prospects. Thanks. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I don't think it was a salary dump. I understand why fans do, but I think it was a good baseball move. They got two legit prospects.</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: What do you feel are realistic expectations this season for Polanco and Bell ? They look to be the only bats in the Pirates lineup with a chance of putting up 25 homeruns <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Bell should be around 30 home runs. Polanco is tougher to answer. Right now you gotta hope he's able to play at least 140 games.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I would move O'Neill Cruz to LF and have him play there exclusively. He would seem to me to be the long term option to replace Marte once he's ready for the majors. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Let's see Cruz continue to work at the plate before we start moving him around the diamond. But I see your point on trying him at other spots. The time will eventually come.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Nubyjas...The brass said one of the reasons for not adding was that they didn't know how good their current players were, and they needed time to evaluate. Guess that doesn't apply to shipping guys out, huh? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: That's fair. But in Marte's case he's 31 and likely as good as he'll ever be.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: If Cherrington admits the Pirates ae rebuilding, does that hurt trade leverage? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I think stuff like that is overplayed. These GM's are too smart these days. They know what every team needs or doesn't.</p>
<p><strong>Done</strong>: I’ve been a stainch Pira supporter for years. I give up. This team is horr and payr is absurd. Why shou any want to watch this travesty? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I heard that they're bringing back the spelling bee challenge. You'd be great. J/K. But seriously, it's still baseball and baseball is fun.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: What does Hayes have to do to win the 3rd base job out of spring? Is it Moran’s job despite spring outcomes? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Good question. I wonder if Kris Bryant winning his arb suit against the Cubs will have an impact on teams playing the arb game with players going forward. All things even, Hayes is a better fielder than Moran. It's not close. If Hayes shows that he can hit there's no reason to hold him back when the team comes north at the end of camp.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Who wins more games this year ? The Pirates or Penguins ? I believe this team has a legit chance to break the 1962 Mets or the 1899 Cleveland Spiders season loss record. This franchise is utterly devoid of talent anywhere. Agree ? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I don't agree. Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman are solid young players. I think Musgrove, Williams, and Archer will be better than last season. There's decent talent in the bullpen and of course Josh Bell. They need more, but it isn't devoid of talent.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: Did you have many interactions with Starling? Was he enjoyable to cover? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: yeah, pretty much spoke to him daily during the season. He was cool.</p>
<p><strong>Spin Williams</strong>: An overlooked part of this roster is the bullpen, after Vazquez's arrest, who do you see as the closer? and who will be the set up man/men? Lot of holes there just like with the majority of this bubble gum roster they have assembled. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: We wrote about this duing PiratesFest. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/24/keone-kela-pirates-closer-2020-derek-shelton/stories/202001240160" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/24/keone-kela-pira...</a> <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: But there will be a mix of Keone Kela, Kyle Crick, and Richard Rodriguez. Nick Burdi will also get chances in high leverage situations.</p>
<p><strong>Mike </strong>: Where do you think Chad Kuhl will start the year at (bullpen or rotation)? he seems to be a better fit in the bullpen and if healthy, could eventually be a closer <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I think he ends up in the bullpen.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: any Chance we add a guy like taijuan walker? Also, could we get a teams top 30 for Frazier <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: He won't cost much so sure. And I think if you find the right trade it'll be possible with Frazier.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: If the pirates go into camp with just Stallings and Maile, who‘s the likely starter when they come north? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Stallings</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>: Any update of Burdi's health? Could assume 8th or 9th inning role if healthy. <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: He said he's ready to go for spring. We spoke to him at PiratesFest. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/26/nick-burdi-injury-update-pirates-bullpen-2020/stories/202001260146" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/26/nick-burdi-inju...</a></p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Do you think the State of PA or State Attorney General should investigate Bob Nutting's finances ? He is getting tax payer money after all. Think there may be financial misdeeds occurring that he could face criminal charges for ? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: His personal finances wouldn't have much to do with the Pirates. Also there are regulatory organizations who check on these things. Start with the Pittsburgh Sports &amp; Exhibition Authority.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Obviously, the scouting report on the punch less Pirates will be don't let Bell beat you. I feel bad for Josh, he's not going to get anything good to hit. What say you? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: depends on where you place him in the lineup. It also depends on Bryan Reynolds, Kevin Newman, Gregory Polanco and others exceeding expectations.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: Would u be interested in a russell martin reunion? Seems like the type of vet catcher who could help a young pitching staff get back on track for a year <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Perhaps. I wouldn't be closed to it but I do think they could get some one a little younger and healthier.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Could we trade for a lewis brinson or ian happ <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: sure.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Who appoints or is elected to the Sports and Exhibition Authority ? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: They have a lovely website with all of that information. I'll save you the trouble of using the google machine. <a href="http://www.pgh-sea.com/history.htm" target="_blank">http://www.pgh-sea.com/history.htm</a> <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: We have 20 minutes left and there are several people in here. Let's get some more questions going.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: I don't believe that the SEA gives a darn what Nutting pays his players. As long as he makes his lease payment on the first of the month, they're happy. Am I wrong? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: They can't directly tell him what to pay or not. But my point was there regulatory boards in place that would be able to create checks and balances.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>: Early prediction on the NL Central. Reds do enough to displace Milwaukee, St Louis and or Chicago? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I want to see how the Reds come together. They spent money this offseason which encouraging. But the Cards are still the class of the division. IMHO.</p>
<p><strong>Guillermo</strong>: The Braves had a “rebuild” a few years ago and chose to do it around Freddie Freeman. I know Bell is no Freddie, but do u think thats a good template to use? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I was just having a similar conversation with my editor earlier today. Yes, the Braves decided to keep Freddie Freeman &amp; Julio Teheran while trading basically ever other big league player. It worked they got back guys like Mike Soroka, Sean Newcombe, Dansby Swanson, Ender Inciarte. They also hit in the international market with names like Ronald Acuna and Ozzie Albies. But Freddie is the foundation. The Pirates could decide to do the same with Josh Bell, especially if the universal DH comes in the next year or two.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: It seemed Huntington got less in trades in order to get major league ready talent. This was only one trade but does it signal a change of getting the best possible return or the realization the Pirates are a few years away from contending? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I'll say this: It was a riskier trade than Neal likely would've made. If it works you'll have two stars but you won't see them in Pittsburgh for at least 3 years. If it doesn't then you lost Marte for a pittance. But these are the types of risks you have to take in today's game.</p>
<p><strong>Derek</strong>: Do you think the Pirates can pull a NBA-like trade. Take on a bad contract as long as a top prospect is attached while giving up little. Obviously with the current payroll they have the ability to do so and it can also show than fan base a little good will in spending some cash they don't need to so they can possibly get better in the future? Thanks. <br> <strong>Bob</strong>: Any word on advanced/season ticket sales? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: Not yet, But we'll be checking.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Whats ironic is that if the owners would just come out and say they are rebuilding, I would likely go to more games...enjoy the park with low expectations. instead they feed us this line of bull like they are trying to win. I normally go to 2-3 games a year, went to zero last year. Maybe their strategy isn't working <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: I hear you, Jeff. I think there's a segment of fans that agree with you. However, I think it doesn't matter if they say it's a rebuild or not. What matters is how they do it. If they make good choices that lead to a winner then fans will come. Nothing else matters.</p>
<p><strong>Hawaiian Pirate</strong>: What is your best guess as the Pirates reguler season starting lineup? <br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>:</p>
<p><br> <strong>nubyjas wilborn</strong>: On that note, I'll say goodbye. We're less than 2 weeks away from pitchers and catchers reporting to Bradenton. Stay tuned.</p>
