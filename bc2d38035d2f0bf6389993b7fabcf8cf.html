<h1>Survey says Pittsburgh still the top city for football fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh isn’t just <em>a</em> football town. In WalletHub’s eyes, it’s <em>the</em> football town.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The personal finance website<a href="https://wallethub.com/edu/best-worst-cities-for-football-fans/9691/#methodology" target="_blank"> released its annual ranking</a> of the best cities for fans of the game Monday, and Pittsburgh topped the list for a second year in a row.</p>
<p>The ranking considered 21 metrics, awarding points for things including past championships, ticket prices and social media engagement. Pittsburgh, buoyed by the Steelers’ decades of championship-level performance,&nbsp;finished with the top score (63.11 points) rather easily, beating out Boston (56.15), Dallas (53.44), Green Bay, Wisc. (53.22) and New York (48.38.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Super Bowl cities San Francisco (45.64) and Kansas City, Mo. (39.56) were eighth and 21st, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While WalletHub did not release performance for each category considered, it did highlight some, and the city fared well in them too, coming in at No. 14 for college football fans, No. 4 for stadium access and No. 1 for NFL fan engagement.</p>
<p>Penn State’s home, State College, Pa., came in at No. 1 for most engaged college football fans and No. 35 for football fans overall.</p>
