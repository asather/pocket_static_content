<p><em><strong>THIS STORY WILL BE UPDATED:</strong></em></p>
<p>After sitting idle during the first round of the NHL draft, the Penguins wasted little time getting to work on Day 2.</p>
<p>General manager Jim Rutherford <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/10/07/matt-murray-trade-penguins-senators-jonathan-gruden/stories/202010070121" target="_blank">traded two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie Matt Murray to the Ottawa Senators just as the second round began.</a> In exchange, the Penguins receive forward prospect Jonathan Gruden and a 2020 second-round draft pick.</p>
<p>After trading Murray, the Penguins are now scheduled to make five picks on Day 2. They have selections in the second round (No. 52), third round (No. 77), fourth round (No. 108), fifth round (No. 139), sixth round (No. 170).</p>
<p>Check back for live updates from Day 2.</p>
<p><strong>Round 2, (No. 52 from Ottawa):&nbsp;</strong>Joel Blomqvist</p>
<p><strong>The basics:</strong></p>
<p>Position: Goalie</p>
<p>Height, weight: 6-1,&nbsp;183</p>
<p>Catches: Left</p>

<p>Born: Jan, 10, 2002 (18 years old)</p>
<p><strong>What they’re saying about him:</strong></p>
<p>“Blomqvist plays a quiet, composed game that looks smart and confident. He recovers from his rebounds well, doesn't overshoot his destinations often, and seems to have a solid grasp on how to read and anticipate plays. His tracking looks smooth like he's following along with the play rather than trying to catch up to it.” — EliteProspects 2020 NHL Draft Guide</p>
<p>“Well-trained goalie that’s sound and reliable. Technically sound and mobile with quick reflexes.” – Goran Stubb, NHL Central Scouting Bureau</p>
<p><strong>Instant analysis:&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins used the pick they acquired in the Murray trade to&nbsp;draft another goalie. Blomqvist was ranked by NHL Central Scouting as the third-best European goalie in this year’s draft class.&nbsp;He spent the majority of the 2019-20 season with Karpat's junior club, where he led the league with .931 save percentage. The previous year, 2018-19, he led Karpat’s junior club to a league championship and was awarded the Jorma Valtonen Award as the best goaltender.</p>
<p>So far this season, he's made two appearances with the main club, posting a .914 save percentage and 1.50 goals-against average.&nbsp;This is just the second goalie GMJR has selected since taking over in 2014. The other is&nbsp;Filip Gustavsson, a second-round pick in 2016.&nbsp;</p>
