<h1>Kraft plans $2 billion in cost cuts; sells cheese businesses for $3.2 billion</h1>

<p>Kraft Heinz Co. is returning to its tried-and-true cost-cutting strategy as the packaged-food giant looks to beef up its long-term financial position.</p>
<p>The company will target $2 billion in savings over the next five years by focusing on procurement, manufacturing and logistics, according to a presentation released ahead of its investor day Tuesday.</p>
<p>Also, on Tuesday, the company announced a $3.2 billion deal to sell its cheese businesses to a U.S. affiliate of Groupe Lactalis. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2021, subject to regulatory approval.</p>
<p>As part of what it’s calling a “strategic transformation plan,” Kraft is now targeting growth of 1% to 2% for organic net sales, which excludes items like acquisitions and currency effects. The ketchup-maker is also expecting long-term adjusted EPS expansion of 4% to 6%.</p>
<p>“We are committed to returning Kraft Heinz to consistent growth on both the top and bottom lines,” Chief Financial Officer Paulo Basilio said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company updated its third quarter outlook, with organic net sales growth expected in the mid-single digits due to stronger-than-expected business momentum. Kraft aims to reduce net leverage by the end of 2020.</p>
<p>Last quarter, Kraft’s net sales beat the highest analyst estimates as the company held onto customers who flocked to packaged-food staples during Covid-19 lockdowns. Three-quarters of new customers made repeat purchases.</p>
<p>A renewed focus on cost-cutting reads like a return to normal operating procedure for Kraft Heinz, which was created in a 2015 merger orchestrated by Warren Buffett and 3G Capital. Traditionally, 3G’s managers were known more for reducing expenses than nurturing brands, and after merging Pittsburgh-based H.J. Heinz and Illinois-based Kraft Foods, the then-CEO slashed nearly $2 billion in costs at the combined company.</p>
<p>When the cutting slowed, the spotlight turned to the company’s struggle to grow sales with a portfolio of food brands that was largely considered out-of-step with modern tastes. However, the pandemic reignited consumer interest in comfort staples like Oscar Mayer lunch meats and Kraft macaroni and cheese, giving it a boost during lockdowns.</p>
<p>In the deal with Groupe Lactalis, the company said the sale includes Kraft Heinz’s natural, grated, cultured and specialty cheese businesses in the U.S., grated cheese business in Canada, and its international cheese business outside these two countries, including Breakstone’s, Knudsen, Polly-O, Athenos, Hoffman’s, Cracker Barrel brands in the U.S. only.</p>
<p>It will keep its Philadelphia Cream Cheese, Kraft Singles, Velveeta Processed Cheese and Cheez Whiz businesses in the U.S. and Canada, and the Kraft, Velveeta and Cracker Barrel Mac &amp; Cheese businesses worldwide.</p>
