<h1>Nursing homes deserved better </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State health officials have failed nursing home residents since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic, and the recent call — finally — for mandatory testing in such facilities only further highlights the ineffectiveness of the plan to protect the most vulnerable.</p>
<p>Mandatory testing of residents and staff is something that should have been put in place weeks ago when it became clear that nursing homes were the most obvious hot spots for outbreaks in the state. Of the reported 6,113 deaths in Pennsylvania attributed to the coronavirus, more than 4,000 of them were in long-term care facilities.</p>
<p>Instead, state officials waited until May to unveil a testing plan they termed “robust” in that the goal was to test all residents and staff on a weekly basis. But that failed to address the critical situation because the testing was considered optional rather than mandatory.</p>
<p>A review by Spotlight PA, an independent newsroom of which the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette is a partner, found that only 75 facilities — about 4% of all long-term care homes in the state — had done the testing.</p>
<p>The mandatory plan now in place requires all 693 nursing homes in the state to conduct testing, but the deadline is July 24 — meaning that infections could continue for several weeks as asymptomatic individuals go undetected in the facilities. And those who don’t meet the deadline will be fined only a nominal amount, $300.</p>
<p>Most baffling is a decision by state officials not to implement an earlier plan to protect nursing homes that would have used strike teams of medical professionals dispatched to facilities at the first sign of an outbreak to help control the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Mandatory testing is only now being done in Pennsylvania while neighboring states such as Maryland and New York began weeks ago. West Virginia completed baseline testing in early May, and New Jersey’s deadline was May 26.</p>
<p>Testing will be required in nursing homes, but the mandate does not apply to the nearly 1,200 personal care and assisted-living facilities in the state, which are also most susceptible to outbreaks.</p>
<p>Testing and contact tracing at the earliest signs of an outbreak could have greatly reduced or limited the spread of COVID-19 in nursing homes and other long-term facilities. With only baseline testing required now, there is still the potential for the spread of the virus at a later date.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars in federal coronavirus stimulus money is earmarked for state nursing homes, which should be used for immediate and ongoing testing as well as an aggressive plan for contact tracing, especially among staff members.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf signed a bill that creates collaborations between long-term care facilities and academic health systems to deal with testing, contact tracing, infection control and other issues. Those collaboratives are still in the early stages and must be fast-tracked to provide the assistance so desperately needed.</p>
<p>Nursing homes and long-term care facilities house those most vulnerable to COVID-19. The residents deserve better protection than what has thus far been provided.</p>
