<h1>Jeff Capel saw disappointment, growth from Pitt in the 2019-20 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For Jeff Capel, the story of his Pitt team’s 2019-20 season was one of dualities and contradictions.</p>
<p>The Panthers were up and down. They were good until they weren’t. They took steps forward while, in other areas, taking some back. Capel was simultaneously pleased and disappointed with how everything transpired over a 33-game run stretching from November through March.</p>
<p>Over the past several weeks, Capel, like millions across the country, has been largely confined to his home. He has been busy, of course — he is still an ACC basketball coach, after all, and he has gotten time with his family that such a job title sometimes makes scarce — but he has also had time to think, both about what is ahead for his program, as well as what it left behind. The former is hopeful while the latter is complicated.</p>
<p>“We had an opportunity to accomplish some of the things we talked about at the beginning of the season that we wanted to do,” Capel said in a phone interview Wednesday with the Post-Gazette. “I’m disappointed that we didn’t finish it. But I think there’s growth from that. I think we have the opportunity to grow from that. I think some of the best lessons can be learned in failure, but also when you have a little bit of success. You have to learn how to handle success. We did not do that. We had a very small glimpse of that last year.”</p>
<p>The turning point, the one that created the complicated web of emotions, was a sharp one, coming right after Pitt’s Feb. 8 win against Georgia Tech. After that victory, it stood at 15-9 overall and 6-7 in the ACC. While an NCAA tournament appearance seemed far-fetched, a postseason berth of some sort, if things kept going as they had, was likely. Two years after winning only eight games, the arbitrary-but-important benchmark of 20 victories was within reach. What happened from there has been well-documented and, for those who experienced it, deeply internalized. The Panthers went just 1-8 the rest of the way to finish with a losing record for the fourth-consecutive season.</p>
<p>Capel had said previously that, in those losses, he didn’t feel his team was together. A group that was strengthened by its cohesion ceased to be carried by it. Sometimes, Capel believes, people can be around each other too much, something people around the country are perhaps experiencing right now in the age of a pandemic and self-isolation. An escape in those moments is needed, but with no byes between games until their regular season ended, the Panthers didn’t get it. It had an effect.</p>
<p>“February is always a grind, always,” Capel said. “Even when you’re winning, it’s a grind. When you don’t have relief, when you don’t have a break from each other to get away from the game, just to get away from everything, that can make things a little bit more difficult. When you’re tired, sometimes you can be easily agitated. Things can get on your nerves a little bit more. Things can linger a little bit more. I thought it was all of those things.”</p>
<p>As the losses piled up, Capel could see the confidence of his players waning, depriving a Pitt team still not overflowing with talent of perhaps its greatest asset.</p>
<p>“When that happens, sometimes, the fight disappears,” he said. “That was the thing that probably disappointed me the most during that stretch. There were some times where the fight had disappeared. That’s what we had been pretty good at all the time, having that fight. There were a couple of games in that stretch where I just didn’t think we had that. That was the part, to me, that was most disappointing.”</p>
<p>As the program looks to move past that season and take larger, more substantive strides on its road back to relevance, not every player who was part of last season’s collapse or who was there for much of Capel’s two-year tenure will be back.</p>
<p>Days after the season ended, guard Ryan Murphy entered the transfer portal, eventually landing at Tulane, but the bigger, more notable departure came when Trey McGowens did the same two days later. McGowens was an important contributor from both a substantive and symbolic standpoint. He was Capel’s first recruit, committing to the program when it was at its lowest point in decades. And he contributed once he got to campus, averaging 11.6 points per game in two seasons and starting in 64 of a possible 66 games. McGowens, who committed to Nebraska last weekend, and his father both said a primary impetus for the transfer was a desire to play and develop as a point guard, something that didn’t appear likely at Pitt with Xavier Johnson entrenched as the team’s main ball-handler.</p>
<p>Capel said McGowens did a good job of remaining concentrated on the team’s season throughout it and that he’s “very, very happy for him.” He knows that transfers and the roster-shuffling they create are simply a part of the game.</p>
<p>“I may not be the coach for you,” Capel said. “I understand that. I never take it personal. Never. It’s just the nature of what we do now, trying to figure out rosters. I think that’s going to continue to get even more difficult as we move forward.”</p>
<p>Despite those departures, several of Pitt’s most important pieces are staying. Leading scorer and rebounder Justin Champagnie had a stellar freshman season. Days after the season ended, Johnson reiterated his commitment to the program on social media. About two weeks later, forward Au’Diese Toney did the same.</p>
<p>Toney’s announcement came shortly after a conversation with Capel, who said he never believed the sophomore, who was fourth on the team in scoring and second in rebounding last season, was planning on leaving.</p>
<p>“I remember a few days after we finished, his mom texted me and she’s asking, ‘Coach, where is this coming from? All this stuff that Diese is leaving? I don’t know where any of this is coming from. We’re not going anywhere,’” Capel said. “I was like ‘I have no idea.’ I don’t read the stuff, so I don’t know. She started sending me things. ‘Is this affiliated with the program?’ No, it’s not affiliated with the program. Even if it has ‘Pitt men’s basketball,’ it’s not an official thing with the program. It just became all this stuff where people are putting out this stuff that he’s not happy and he’s transferring and all these stories. Diese’s mom and Diese are hitting me like, ‘Coach, I don’t know where this is coming from. I’m not going anywhere.’”</p>
<p>With those pieces firmly back in place, there’s a better, clearer idea of what Pitt will be next season. For Capel, that provides a healthy dose of optimism.</p>
<p>With the signing of two incoming freshmen — John Hugley and Max Amadasun — the Panthers will have two more players who are 6-foot-9 or taller, providing some depth for a frontcourt that has been without it for years. In Noah Collier, the class’ third and final signee, there’s a long, versatile athlete with “really good upside.”</p>
<p>Though he prefaced it by saying nothing surprises him, Capel said he doesn’t anticipate any more player departures. Given that, Pitt will bring back three of its top four scorers. Even those outside of that group, like freshmen Abdoul Karim Coulibaly and Gerald Drumgoogle, were spoken about glowingly by Capel. Those young players, even those as accomplished as Champagnie, will have older players like Johnson and Toney who have multiple seasons with Capel and who can therefore help provide leadership from within.</p>
<p>With that structure set, as Capel believes it can be, the results he and others desire from the program will hopefully follow.</p>
<p>“This is a big offseason for [Champagnie] for development, and then he has two guys in Au’Diese and Xavier who can help him navigate that like, ‘OK, we had pretty good freshman years also. This is what’s in store for next year, these are some of the things you have to do this summer,’” Capel said. “We haven’t had that since I’ve been here.”</p>
