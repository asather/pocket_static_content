<h1>Old Froggy's nightspot once again targeted for demolition, as debate over buildings' condition wages on</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Froggy’s may once again be down to its last pour.</p>
<p>The famous Pittsburgh watering hole and several other buildings on Market Street and First Avenue Downtown are facing demolition to clear the way for a massive 30-story development that would feature 200,000 square feet of office space and 151 residences.</p>
<p>Taking up where it left off last year, Troiani Properties expects to brief the Pittsburgh Planning Commission on Tuesday on its intent to raze the buildings at 104 and 106 Market Street and 209 First Avenue —&nbsp;a move that once again is triggering protests from local preservationists.</p>
<p>Representatives for the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, Preservation Pittsburgh, and the Young Preservationists Association of Pittsburgh said Wednesday they would oppose the demolitions.</p>
<p>The Young Preservationists named Froggy’s, a popular nightspot that hosted the likes of Mario Lemieux and actor Jack Nicholson before closing in 2003, as its top restoration opportunity in a list released in December.</p>
<p>Arthur Ziegler, PHLF president, and Matthew Craig, executive director of the Young Preservationists, questioned the need for the proposed tower in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Both reiterated calls for the old buildings to be saved and incorporated into the new development if it is to be done.</p>
<p>They feared that if the buildings were demolished without commitments on financing or tenants for the new tower, the site could sit empty.</p>
<p>“It’s very easy to turn a historic building into an empty lot. It’s very difficult to turn an empty lot into a high-rise,” Mr. Craig said.</p>
<p>Michael Troiani, president of Troiani Group, said the developer is moving to raze Froggy’s and the other structures because of “life safety concerns,” claiming in part that ‘masonry is crumbling into the street.”</p>
<p>“The Froggy’s building, there’s just nothing to it,” he said. “There are structural cracks all over the place. It’s just not safe at this point.”</p>
<p>His biggest concern is the long vacant six-story building at 209 First. Mr. Troiani maintained the structure is in danger of collapsing.</p>
<p>He said he applied for an emergency permit through the city’s Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections “based on bricks falling into the streets” but was denied. He has filed an appeal.</p>
<p>“The buildings need to be demolished,” he said. “There is still such a thing as private property rights and I believe the planning commission will plainly see the vision for the site and be excited about it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Troiani called the concerns about potential financing and tenants “irresponsible.” He said there is a lot of interest in users and potential development partners for the project.</p>
<p>“I’m not making an investment into an empty site to keep it empty. Our intent is to develop here,” he said.</p>
<p>However, he could be facing a battle with the planning commission as well as preservationists. Last summer, several members urged Troiani to reconsider the proposal to take down the buildings.</p>
<p>Member Sabina Deitrick said at the time that the demolitions would gut the section of Market Street that is part of the Firstside Historic District listed on the National Register of Historic Places.</p>
<p>“It destroys the feel of it and what the history is,” she said.</p>
<p>But Mr. Troiani maintained that the buildings “are not contributors to any special designation of the area,” saying all of the facades have been recreated over the years and are not original.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation has been trying to work with Troiani to save the structures. Arthur Ziegler, the foundation president, said it redeveloped decaying buildings in Market Square that were in worse shape than those on Market.</p>
<p>He said the foundation has seen nothing in the buildings that suggests they are in imminent danger of collapse.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“To lose those buildings at a time when we don’t know what the market is, we think is a great risk,” added Michael Sriprasert, PHLF vice president.</p>
<p>While Mr. Troiani said he still hoped to work with Mr. Ziegler and other preservationists on the project, he insisted that the structures needed to go.&nbsp;“They’re all falling down now,” he said.</p>
<p>Troiani wants to remove the buildings to assemble land for a new development that would border the Boulevard of the Allies, Market and First. The developer last year razed the former Tramps and Papa J’s Centro properties at 212 and 214 Boulevard of the Allies as part of that endeavor.</p>
<p>Also involved are the Froggy’s site at 100-102 Market, two others at 104 and 106-108 Market and 209 First.</p>
<p>In their place, Troiani is proposing a tiered tower that rises 30 stories and features a mix of office and residential as well as street-level retail.&nbsp;Residential amenities are slated to include a roof deck with swimming pool and upper floor patios. The office section offers a “sky lobby” with indoor and outdoor space and a conference area. At the old Froggy’s site, Troiani is pitching “a signature corner retail/restaurant to promote the highest and best use along First Avenue.”</p>
<p>Mr. Troiani said the design would improve the area and honor “the spirit of the prior history of the space.” He said none of the existing buildings have been used for over a decade and in the case of 209 First, more than half a century.</p>
<p>The new building would feature “elements that reflect and blend with the look, feel, and scale of surrounding Downtown buildings, including a mixed palette of original and new brick and stone masonry, historical plaques, and integrated reuse of existing building materials.”</p>
<p>Troiani has been assembling the land for the new development for some 30 years.</p>
<p>“The city of Pittsburgh needs 200,000 square feet of trophy class office space, not another place to buy a six-pack,” he said.</p>
<p>At First and Wood Street a block from Froggy’s, Troiani is proposing a smaller companion project that would feature 90 residential units, street-level retail and atrium access to the Fort Pitt Building.</p>
