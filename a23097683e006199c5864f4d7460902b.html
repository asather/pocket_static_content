<h1>COVID-19 outbreak at Kane Centers-Scott reaches 105 residents</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A total of 105 residents of the Kane Community Living center in Scott Township —&nbsp;one-third its capacity —&nbsp;have tested positive for COVID-19 and 10 people there have died from the highly contagious disease since the pandemic reached Western Pennsylvania in March.</p>
<p>The results, which included 78 current infections among residents, were identified through routine required screening of all staff and residents that began Sept. 18, chief medical officer Mario Fatigati said during a briefing Friday.</p>
<p>Many of the staff and residents who tested positive did not have symptoms.</p>
<p>“These are older buildings,” Dr. Fatigati said. “When a virus gets inside, it’s tough to manage.”</p>
<p>The Scott facility has 311 beds, mostly two beds to a room — an outmoded design that has shifted to private rooms at newer facilities in recent years to match resident preferences. All together, the county-owned Kane nursing home complexes have 1,100-plus beds.</p>
<p>There are no plans to ask for help from the National Guard during the new coronavirus outbreak as has been done in outbreaks at other senior living facilities, but doctors and nurses from Allegheny Health Network and UPMC have been advising the facility staff through the Regional Response Health Collaborative Program and supplying protective supplies and helping with staffing needs.</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, as of Oct. 1, the positive rate for COVID-19 testing increased to 3.8% from 2.9% a week earlier while the average daily number of hospitalized patients and patients on ventilators has also risen, according to the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>Westmoreland Manor, a county-owned facility in Hempfield Township, Westmoreland County, is also battling a COVID-19 outbreak, with 114 infections among staff and residents. The National Guard is assisting there.</p>
