<html><head><title>Growing appetite — Ramen Bar owner plans Oakland apartment, restaurant development</title></head><body><p>A Squirrel Hill restaurateur is stirring the pot in Oakland with plans for more dining — and a lot more.</p><p>Mike Wu, owner of the Ramen Bar on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, is proposing to construct a six-story building at the corner of South Craig and Winthrop streets in Oakland that would feature two floors of restaurants and four floors of apartments — 23 in all.</p><p>In a bid to advance the development, Mr. Wu will go before the Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment Jan. 16 to seek a special exception to build to 62 feet high and variances to reduce the number of required off-street parking and off-street loading spaces.</p><p>In the Oakland Public Realm district in which the building is planned, developers are permitted to construct buildings from 60 feet to 85 feet in height with a special exception.</p><p>Mr. Wu purchased the site for the proposed development in 2014. At the time, he planned to do more restaurants at the location. But the more he thought about it, the bigger his plans grew.</p><p>“We found that we were able to build much larger with other components so we decided to do this project,” he said. “We just felt like since we were going to rebuild we might as well try to make the best use of the site.”</p><p>As part of the development, which is expected to cost in the $7 million range, Mr. Wu intends to demolish the two houses that now occupy the site, including one that hosts Kbox Karaoke House. That business has “agreed to leave once we start the project,” Mr. Wu said.</p><p>The developer is planning a mix of studio, one-, two-, and three-bedroom apartments. He hopes to market the units to families and young professionals rather than students from Pitt or Carnegie Mellon. The site is located between the two universities.</p><p>“I’m kind of aiming more toward families. Everyone is focused on students but there’s so much more in that area,” he said.</p><p>On the retail side, Mr. Wu hopes to cook up two restaurants to occupy the first and second floors. Whether he will be operating any of them remains to be seen.</p><p>“I’m keeping my options open at this point,” he said. “We have a lot of interest. I haven’t figured that out yet.”</p><p>Assuming all goes well before the zoning board, Mr. Wu intends to break ground on the development before the end of the summer and have it completed within a year.</p><p>The site sits a couple of blocks from Fifth Avenue in a stretch that offers a mix of retail, office, and housing.</p><p>Mr. Wu has presented his plans at a community meeting sponsored by Oakland Planning and Development Corp. While there were some concerns about parking, overall, “we haven’t received a lot of negative feedback” about the development, said Wanda Wilson, OPDC executive director.</p><p>She said OPDC would not oppose the special exception or the variances, one of which seeks permission for 11 parking spaces rather than 30, the minimum required in the district. The other seeks to have the zoning board waive the requirement for a minimum of two off-street loading spaces.</p><p>“It seems like something that is consistent with South Craig Street and it seems like it can be a nice addition to the street,” Ms. Wilson said of the project.</p><p>While Mr. Wu owns a restaurant in Squirrel Hill, the Oakland development would be his first of the mixed use variety. But it may not be his last.</p><p>“This will be a start,” he said. “I’m trying to get this done so I can move on to my next project.”</p><p><em>Mark Belko: mbelko@post-gazette.com or 412-263-1262.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/01/02/Oakland-Ramen-Bar-South-Craig-Street-zoning-board-of-adjustment-apartments-restaurants/stories/202001030070</original_url>
