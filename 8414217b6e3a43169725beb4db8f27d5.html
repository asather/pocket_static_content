<h1>Pittsburgh diocese announces job cuts, move of administrative office</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh will eliminate 11 jobs, reduce the hours for two others and relocate its administrative offices as it tries to reduce costs while responding to the "ongoing challenges presented by the global COVID-19 pandemic," the diocese announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The reorganization plan will move diocesan headquarters from it current spot on the Boulevard of the Allies in Downtown to the St. Paul Seminary campus in East Carnegie.</p>
<p>The plan was announced to staff and clergy Tuesday during two online conferences.</p>
<p>In the release, the diocese did not specify which jobs were eliminated.</p>
<p>The diocese said a long-term decline in mass attendance and donations "has been exacerbated by the ripple effect of COVID-19. Decreased donations to parishes directly impacts Parish Share giving which is the primary source of funding for the diocesan budget.</p>
<p>The diocese said that with the reduced staffing, the seminary campus is the only diocesan property able to accommodate its employees and allow operations to continue in one place.</p>
<p>The move will be done "as a gradual transfer" of all departments during the next six months. The diocese said it intends to complete the process by Dec. 31.</p>
<p>"Bishops across the United States are dealing with these same issues, but that doesn't make this any easier, " Bishop David Zubik said. "Nobody is exempt from the fallout of this virus. All of our lives have been dramatically changed."</p>
<p>The cost-saving measures already taken include:</p>
<p>Reviewing government programs to determine ways to obtain emergency aid and obtaining a Paycheck Protection Program loan to provide "temporary funding to keep people employed</p>
<p>Establishing an emergency fund -- the Bishop's Coronavirus Emergency Fund -- to provide "an extra layer of financial support to employees of parishes (sic) Catholic schools, and staffing by ensuring the continuing of health care coverages and other benefits.</p>
<p>The diocese said "other measures" may be needed to continue "to reduce and manage costs, and build financial stability moving forward."</p>
