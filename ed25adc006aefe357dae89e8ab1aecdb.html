<h1>Rob Manfred: ‘We’re going to play baseball in 2020’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball does not yet have an agreement in place to return to ballparks across the country after/amid the COVID-19 pandemic. However, its commissioner, Rob Manfred, made a promise to fans during an MLB Network appearance before the draft on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“We’re going to play baseball in 2020, 100%,” Manfred said. “If it has to be under the March 26 agreement, if we get to that point in the calendar, so be it. But one way or the other, we’re playing Major League Baseball.”</p>
<p>Yeah, so about that agreement and the subsequent negotiations. You may have heard: They’ve haven’t gone terribly well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/09/AP-MLB-players-baseball-MLBPA-proposal-89-game-regular-season-prorated-money/stories/202006090140" target="_blank">latest rejected proposal</a>, this lobbed from the MLB Players Association, called for an 89-game season. Manfred called that “just not realistic” and said the league and its owners would soon be submitting a counter-proposal that “moves in the players’ direction in terms of the salary issue.”</p>
<p>The players have maintained, pursuant to the March 26 agreement, that they have already taken their pay cut and they should be paid 100% of their salaries for games played, and they would like to have as many of those as possible.</p>
<p>“We’ll make a counter-proposal shortly,” Manfred said. “It will be a proposal that moves in the players’ direction in terms of the salary issue. We’re hoping it’s a proposal that will elicit reciprocal movement from the players’ side, that they’ll get off the 100% salary demand and recognize that 89 games at this point in the calendar, in a pandemic, is just not realistic.”</p>
<p>The second part of baseball coming back — it should be the first part, really — involves the health and safety of all affected. Manfred said that’s actually fairly promising right now.</p>
<p>“We’re very, very close on the medical protocols,” Manfred said. “We provided the MLBPA with our last proposal a comprehensive response to all of the comments that they gave us on the health protocols. We agreed or made a responsive suggestion to each and every issue they raised. I believe we really are close on those issues.”</p>
<p>One part of the players’ latest proposal included playing games into November. Manfred would like to avoid that, for a couple reasons. In addition to the league’s broadcast partners counting on postseason games, Manfred said he wants nothing to do with a possible resurgence of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We have commitments to our broadcast partners to provide content at particular points in the calendar,” Manfred said. “Just up and deciding we’re going to provide it two weeks later is problematic.</p>
<p>“I also don’t want to be responsible for the additional health risks associated with going later in the fall, the risk to not completing the season and the disaster that would be. I think the most prudent course for everyone is to follow the advice of the experts on this one.”</p>
<p>The guarantee from Manfred comes in because he alone has the authority to implement a 50-game season — or whatever the owners decide would work. The problem is that the players would not have to cooperate on the playoffs, and that would result in a bunch of lost money for everyone.</p>
<p>Most reasonable is likely a negotiated agreement somewhere between 50 and 89 games, though the issue remains prorated pay and how much below 100% — if any — players are willing to accept.</p>
<p>Another part of the interview, conducted by Tom Verducci, touched on Major League Baseball’s response to the death of George Floyd and the other social/racial issues that have dominated the national conversation.</p>
<p>MLB did not move particularly fast and was criticized for its statement coming out later than most. Manfred took personal responsibility for that, as he said he wanted to listen and take additional time.</p>
<p>“I was responsible for the timing,” Manfred said. “And it was because I was listening. We have a large and diverse organization. I wanted to make sure when I put a statement out that it was consonant with what people in the organizations really believed, that it was consonant with their ideas about what we needed to do.</p>
<p>“A principle tenant of that statement was the need for action, not just words. And we have tried to make short-term actions, Phase 1 if you will, to demonstrate our commitment on this issue. We’re working with our diverse business partners program to provide financing to minority-owned businesses that were damaged during the demonstrations in recent weeks. We’ve organized an educational program for our employees and given them materials to review.</p>
<p>'We’re going to have an open forum on these issues to get additional input, to understand exactly where our employees are and hopefully promote understanding among that group. We are also forming relationships, making charitable contributions to groups that we have not historically worked with. The NAACP Legal Defense Fund is one that we’re going to be announcing [Wednesday].”</p>
