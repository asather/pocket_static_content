<h1> Trump pushes states to lift coronavirus restrictions </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump urged supporters to “LIBERATE” three states led by Democratic governors Friday, apparently encouraging protests against stay-at-home restrictions. Some states under Republican leadership edged toward easing up the mandates aimed at stopping COVID-19.</p>
<p>A day after laying out a road map to gradually reopen the crippled economy, Mr. Trump tweeted the kind of rhetoric some of his supporters have used to demand the lifting of the orders that have thrown millions of Americans out of work.</p>
<p>“LIBERATE MINNESOTA!” “LIBERATE MICHIGAN!” “LIBERATE VIRGINIA,” he said in a tweet-storm in which he also lashed out at New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for criticizing the federal response. Mr. Cuomo “should spend more time ‘doing’ and less time ‘complaining,’ ” the president said.</p>
<p>Responding to pleas from governors for help from Washington in ramping up testing for the virus, Mr. Trump put the burden back on them: “The States have to step up their TESTING!”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump claimed Friday that “very partisan voices” had spread “false and misleading information” about the nation’s testing capacity. But he said “we’ll help New York and all of the other states get even better on their testing.”</p>
<p>At the same time, at least two states took their first steps toward easing the restrictions.</p>
<p>In Florida, GOP Gov. Ron DeSantis said municipalities could reopen beaches and parks if they could do so safely. In Texas, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott said stores could begin selling curbside, nonessential surgery could resume and state parks could reopen.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to see businesses reopen quickly and claimed earlier this week that he had total authority over the matter, even though the lockdowns and other social-distancing measures have been imposed by state and local leaders, not Washington.</p>
<p>“We may be opening but we’re putting safety first,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he outlined a three-step set of guidelines for easing restrictions over a span of several weeks in places that have robust testing and are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases, assuring the nation’s governors: “You’re going to call your own shots.”</p>
<p>But governors of both parties suggested Friday that they would be cautious in returning to normal, with some warning that they can’t do it without help from Washington to expand testing.</p>
<p>“The federal government cannot wipe its hands of this and say, ‘Oh, the states are responsible for testing,’ ” said Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat. “We cannot do it without federal help.”</p>
<p>West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Republican ally of Mr. Trump’s, said he would listen to medical experts in deciding how to move forward.</p>
<p>“I am not going to do something that I feel in my heart is the wrong thing that’s going to endanger our people,” he said.</p>
<p>Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, a Democrat, said Mr. Trump’s tweets about “liberating” states put millions of Americans at risk of contracting COVID-19.</p>
<p>“His unhinged rantings and calls for people to ‘liberate’ states could also lead to violence,” Mr. Inslee said. “We’ve seen it before. The president is fomenting domestic rebellion and spreading lies even while his own administration says the virus is real and is deadly.”</p>
<p>Democratic Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he and his staff are focused not on the president’s tweets but on fighting a “biological war.”</p>
<p>“I do not have time to involve myself in Twitter wars,” said Mr. Northam, who is a medical doctor. “I will continue to make sure that I do everything that I can to keep Virginians safe and to save lives.”</p>
<p>The clash between Mr. Trump and Mr. Cuomo was personal, with the president complaining the governor hasn’t said thanks for the help he has received from Washington. Mr. Cuomo countered by saying: “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do, send a bouquet of flowers? ‘Thank you to the federal government for participating in a federal emergency.’ ”</p>
