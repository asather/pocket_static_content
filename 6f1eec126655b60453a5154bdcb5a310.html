<h1>Funeral held for man who went missing and was found slain in Fox Chapel</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Christian Moore-Rouse was only 3 years old, he proclaimed that when he grew up he wanted to change his name to Jesus. When asked why, he said it was because he loved God, Mr. Moore-Rouse’s sister, Dontesha Rouse, said in his obituary, distributed at his funeral on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Nearly 100 people gathered to mourn Mr. Moore-Rouse at Mulberry Community Church in Wilkinsburg. Although glad to have finally found his remains March 3 in Fox Chapel after he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/01/20/Police-Christian-Moore-Rouse-missing-Penn-Hills-Verona/stories/202001200069" target="_blank">disappeared</a> in late December 2019, many of his family and friends are still left <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/03/03/Human-remains-woods-Fox-Chapel-Adam-Rosenberg-Jeremy-Dentel-charged-homicide-Baldwin/stories/202003030121" target="_blank">with lingering questions</a> regarding the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>Some were answered shortly after the service when the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s office announced Mr. Moore-Rouse, 22, died from a gunshot wound to the head and pronounced it a homicide. But no one has been charged in the death.</p>
<p>“The occasion may be solemn, but I want today to be a celebration of life,” Pastor Lawrence Smith said at the beginning of the service.</p>
<p>Following opening prayers by Pastor Smith and Bishop Lee C. Carter of King of Kings Baptist Ministry, as well as condolences from local dignitaries who knew Mr. Moore-Rouse or his family, like Pittsburgh Municipal Court Judge Kevin Cooper Jr., loved ones of Mr. Moore-Rouse offered reflections of his life and his effect on them.</p>
<p>They spoke of him as an intelligent, kind and charismatic young man, who volunteered for The Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank, Jubilee Soup Kitchen and Mulberry Church.</p>
<p>Andrew Coleman III, a minister at St. James AME Church in East Liberty, said he met Mr. Moore-Rouse while they were both students at the Pittsburgh Science &amp; Technology Academy.</p>
<p>“Christian would just absolutely light up the room when he walked in,” Mr. Coleman said.&nbsp;“He was one of the most trusting people I ever met. But maybe it was his sheer level of trust in others that led to his downfall.”</p>
<p>After a eulogy by Pastor Smith, those in attendance were led outside to release dozens of white balloons, to symbolize Mr. Moore-Rouse’s passing.&nbsp;</p>
