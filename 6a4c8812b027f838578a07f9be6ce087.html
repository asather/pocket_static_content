<h1>Paul Zeise: NFL draft could be a logistical nightmare — and very entertaining</h1>

<p>The NFL draft is usually a big blowout event complete with bells and whistles, but that won’t be the case this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>But the drat will still go on. It&nbsp;won’t be in Las Vegas, and there won’t be anyone who actually attends it. There also won’t be anybody who spends the day at the facilities of the 32 teams, as every&nbsp;participant — Kevin Colbert, Mike Tomlin, Steelers assistant coaches —&nbsp;will be at home.</p>
<p>Good luck with that mess. I don’t know how they will make it all work, but it will surely be fun to watch. And it will surely be fun watching it all fall apart a few times too.</p>
<p>Am I the only one who thinks this plan is absolutely absurd? There are still people going into offices and working all over the country, so there’s no reason the facilities couldn’t be open. You could at least have the coaches in their offices and maybe one main conference room —complete with the ability to do video and teleconferences — with a maximum capacity of, say, four people.&nbsp;That wouldn’t compromise the idea of social distancing.&nbsp;It would also create a central hub for each team and would cut down the number of phone lines and things of the such.</p>
<p>That last point may seem silly, but there have been some concerns raised by the always overly paranoid coaches and front office personnel in the NFL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>John Harbaugh of the Ravens whined about potential hacking and cybersecurity. He apparently has watched too many movies about cybercrime and identity theft for his own good. He said he has read about the Zoom app getting hacked and that has made him think twice about it.</p>
<p>“Hopefully we’ll be OK,” Harbaugh told ESPN. “I really wouldn’t want the opposing coaches to have our playbook or our draft meetings. That would be preferable, if we can stay away from that.”</p>
<p>Harbaugh’s boss, Ravens general manager Eric DeCosta, apparently does not share his coach’s concern.</p>
<p>“I have more confidence in Zoom than I do in Ozzie [Newsome, executive vice president], John, Steve [Bisciotti, owner] and Dick [Cass, team president], with a copy of our draft board that they just leave in the car on their front seat or something like that,” DeCosta said.</p>
<p>Some other coaches and executives have expressed concerns about having IT people, who might unknowingly be carrying the coronavirus, come into their house. There are concerns about the communication flow between members of the coaching staff as well.</p>
<p>The NFL is usually a well-oiled machine, so the draft will likely have fewer hitches than expected. That doesn’t mean there aren’t going to be a few, and depending on what they are, they could provide more entertainment than the actually selections. Who knows what might be caught on Zoom or avvideo conference from someone’s house that ends up on TV? What if there’s a miscommunication and a team drafts the wrong guy?</p>
<p>I understand why precautions need to be taken, but I also think there needs to be a little common sense mixed in as well. The NFL could have made the draft a whole lot simpler. Instead, viewers should get out a bag of popcorn and enjoy the circus that could unfold.</p>
