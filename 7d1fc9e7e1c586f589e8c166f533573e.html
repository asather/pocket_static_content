<h1>Ohio Gov. DeWine: Hall of Fame game with fans 'highly unlikely'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine is not optimistic that fans will be in the stands for the Steelers’ scheduled appearance in the Hall of Fame against the Dallas Cowboys on Aug. 6 in Canton.</p>
<p>An NFL official expressed confidence that the event could be held as normal last week, <a href="https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/nfl-coronavirus-hall-of-fame-game-enshrinement-still-set-for-august-well-show-folks-how-it-can-be/" target="_blank">telling CBS</a> that the league wanted to use the it as a “test case” for the league’s safety protocols with an eye toward staging even bigger events amid the coronavirus pandemic come the fall.</p>
<p>But DeWine was far more cautious when speaking on the topic during a news conference Tuesday. Via Ben Axelrod of Cleveland’s <a href="https://www.wkyc.com/article/news/local/stark-county/fans-at-hall-of-fame-game-highly-unlikely-gov-mike-dewine-says/95-1898ac51-679c-4c72-97c9-3f26b7e21252" target="_blank">WKYC-TV</a>:</p>
<p><em>“As much as I hate to say this, because we've all been looking forward to that and I know how much it means to the Canton area and the Stark County area and really across the country, it's a great great event that we've been looking forward to, [but ] having a crowd that size is highly unlikely. Certainly, it could not occur today. It would be very dangerous to do it today.</em></p>
<p><em>"Again, we have to see where we are at that point, but that's a large crowd, a lot of people together. These are the things that we've talked about all the way through this as we open Ohio up and we get back to work and we get back to doing the things that we like, probably the last things that are going to be able to be open are the big crowds, particularly when you have big crowds that are close together. So we have to continue to look at it and make decisions as we move forward, but if the question was, 'could that even occur today?' the answer would be, 'no.' ”</em></p>
<p>Any event with spectators would likely include a strong contingent of Steelers fans making the short trip northwest, not only because the team itself is playing in the game, but because two prominent alums -- Bill Cowher and Troy Polamalu — are slated for enshrinement as part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s 2020 class two days later.</p>
<p><a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/06/16/ohio-governor-says-hall-of-fame-game-ceremony-unlikely/" target="_blank">Pro Football Talk</a> reported Tuesday that 20,000 tickets for the event sold out in less than a half hour, and 10,000 more were sold for the enshrinement ceremony, which also could be up in the air.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The site also reported that a final decision could be made as soon as July 1, and possible contingencies include pushing the game back into August and/or moving the enshrinement ceremony to 2021.</p>
<p>"We're in regular conversation with the Pro Football Hall of Fame on hearing alternative plans and engaging that dialogue," Lt. Gov. Jon Husted said, according to WKYC. "So I just want to make sure that you know we're having ongoing conversations with them about what success could look like."</p>
