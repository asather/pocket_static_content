<h1>Taking stock of the Pirates' roster on the first off day of spring</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Tuesday was an essential day of rest for the Pirates, their first off day from spring action after playing games 10 consecutive days. It also presents a good time to take stock of what we know and don’t know about the club and roster thus far.</p>
<p><strong>Bullpen</strong></p>
<p>This is the most competitive spot on the Pirates roster. <strong>Keone Kela</strong>, of course, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/12/pittsburgh-pirates-closer-keone-kela-spring-training/stories/202002120128" target="_blank">is the closer</a>. If <strong>Kyle Crick</strong> is healthy, he’ll be the eighth-inning set-up man. <strong>Michael Feliz, Richard Rodriguez</strong> and <strong>Chris Stratton</strong> will have roles. Stratton has shown he can throw multiple innings, and Feliz and Rodriguez have proven to be good in high-leverage situations.</p>
<p>Assuming all those guys make the bullpen, that leaves three spots for an eight-man reliever group. Nick Burdi is putting together an excellent spring training. He’s coming off an injury that sidelined him for most of 2019 but is already touching 100 mph with his fastball.&nbsp;<strong>Edgar Santana</strong> is returning from Tommy John surgery and has thrown three scoreless innings. Both of those players should grab spots if they stay on their current course.</p>
<p><strong>Robbie Erlin, Sam Howard, Dovydas Neverauskas, Nik Turley and Miguel Del Pozo</strong> are among those who will fight for the last spot. Here’s where it gets interesting.</p>
<p>Neverauskas is out of options, and Erlin, whom <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/29/robbie-erlin-pirates-bullpen-addition/stories/202001290175" target="_blank">the Pirates signed in January</a>, has an opt-out clause in his contract if he doesn’t make the big league roster. Erlin is also a left-hander, which the bullpen needs. The Pirates could have a tough decision on their hands here.</p>
<p>Oddly enough, Clay Holmes’ injury — Derek Shelton said Saturday that Holmes would be in a walking boot for 4-6 weeks —&nbsp;may have helped him. Holmes is out of options and may not have made the roster. The Pirates would’ve had to potentially designate him for assignment. Now he’ll get more time to be evaluated, and the team won’t have to worry about keeping him on the roster until he’s been activated from the injured list.</p>
<p><strong>Starting rotation</strong></p>
<p><strong>Steven Brault</strong>’s shoulder injury opens a path for <strong>Derek Holland</strong> to begin the season in the rotation. Holland is having a good spring thus far and might’ve won the spot even if Brault was healthy. <strong>Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams, Chris Archer</strong> and <strong>Mitch Keller</strong> should round out the starting staff.</p>
<p><strong> JT Brubaker, James Marvel</strong> and <strong>Chad Kuhl</strong> could be call-ups at various points during the season. Kuhl is slowly working his way back from Tommy John surgery, and the Pirates might keep him stretched out in Class AAA to get ready for an eventual place in the rotation.</p>
<p><strong>Catcher</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jacob Stallings</strong> is the leading candidate to start at the backstop. <strong>Luke Maile</strong> is on the 40-man roster, so that gives him an advantage over <strong>John Ryan Murphy</strong> and <strong>Andrew Susac</strong> to be the backup. Murphy has had a good spring and could force the Pirates to look at carrying a third catcher. Or Murphy could work himself into a platoon with Stallings.</p>
<p><strong>The rest</strong></p>
<p>Players such as <strong>Josh Bell, Kevin Newman, Bryan Reynolds</strong> and <strong>Adam Fraizer</strong> have secure roles in the lineup and likely took advantage of a mental respite Tuesday as much as the physical.&nbsp;Several others in camp aren’t nearly as sure about their status going into the regular season opener.</p>
<p>Newman, Frazier, Bell and <strong>Colin Moran</strong> should be the starting infield when the Pirates open the season March 26 at the Tampa Bay Rays. Who will back them up?</p>
<p>For one, <strong>JT Riddle</strong> has made a positive impression so far. He’s a solid defender and versatile enough defensively that he could also move to the outfield if needed.</p>
<p>“I take pride in my defense and being able to play multiple positions,” Riddle told the Post-Gazette recently. “If I can play shortstop, I feel like I can play anywhere. I’m going to work as hard as I can to get better at that position and do my best there.”</p>
<p><strong>Erik Gonzalez</strong> would also be a candidate here. But he’s yet to play in a spring game while recovering from the fractured left foot suffered in winter baseball, and he might not be ready in time opening day.</p>
<p>If Gonzalez isn’t able to go, the Pirates could start the year with <strong>Cole Tucker</strong> on the big league roster. There’s a school of thought that if Tucker is the future at shortstop, then you want him playing every day. There isn’t much room for him with Newman at short and Frazier at second. The Pirates, however, may not have a choice but to bring Tucker up if there’s any doubt about Gonzalez being healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Osuna</strong> is a reliable option to play at either corner infield position. <strong>Will Craig</strong> and <strong>Kevin Kramer</strong> could work their way into the conversation as reserves. And you can expect <strong>Ke’Bryan Hayes</strong> will work his way onto the big league roster at some point this season.</p>
<p>In the outfield, Reynolds, <strong>Jarrod Dyson</strong>&nbsp;and (hopefully) <strong>Gregory Polanco</strong> are slated to start. <strong>Guillermo Heredia</strong> is a good platoon option since he’s a right-handed hitter while Dyson and Polanco hit lefty. If the Pirates carry a fifth outfielder, then <strong>Jason Martin</strong> could make the squad. But they could also go with versatile Riddle in that spot.</p>
