<h1>Push to bring back health care supply chains forges unlikely alliance of freshman lawmakers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The congressmen first met on Capitol Hill at freshman orientation in January 2019.&nbsp;They were political newcomers — one founded a wine and spirits business, the other practiced medicine for 25 years. One lived in the affluent Washington suburbs and assumed the reins of a solidly Democratic seat, while the other resided in Blair County and represented a deeply conservative district.</p>
<p>And yet Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair, and Rep. David Trone, D-Md., hit it off from the start. decided to work together on a range of issues that affected their&nbsp;neighboring districts, which together make up an area roughly the size of New Jersey.</p>
<p>After forging ties to build roads and battle the opioid epidemic, the two lawmakers have turned their focus to another confounding issue: How to build production of critical health care supplies, protective equipment and pharmaceuticals in the United States.</p>
<p>Their working relationship is a reflection of the largely bipartisan view on Capitol Hill — especially amid the COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;—&nbsp;that the country leans too heavily on other countries for health care supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last month, Dr. Joyce and Mr. Trone introduced a bill that would require the U.S. Department of Homeland Security to provide an annual report to Congress on the security and resilience of the medical supply chain.</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce, who ran a dermatology practice with his wife in Altoona before joining Congress, has seen his profile rise this year after being one of 15 House Republicans named to the China Task Force. The legislation is an early look at the&nbsp;panel’s work, which examines China’s influence on the United States and also includes Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters.</p>
<p>“Because of the coronavirus, we’ve recognized that we should never be beholden to the Chinese Communist Party for medicines or supplies, like PPE or ventilators,” Dr. Joyce said in an interview. “We’re also working to incentivize companies to return these supply chains to the United States.”</p>
<p><strong>Long-sought goal</strong></p>
<p>The return of American manufacturing has been a long-sought goal of politicians who campaign in Rust Belt states and hollowed-out factory towns.</p>
<p>In 2016, Donald Trump pledged to “bring back” steel mills and coal mines during speeches near Pittsburgh on his way to winning Pennsylvania and the White House. In a June 2016 speech in Monessen, Mr. Trump unveiled his trade strategy to impose import tariffs on national security grounds as a way to encourage American steel production. Those steel tariffs were imposed in March 2018.</p>
<p>Yet the U.S. and Chinese economies are entangled — even more so after Mr. Trump signed a partial U.S.-China trade deal signed in January. Policy-makers have struggled to realign incentives, such as cheap foreign labor, that led&nbsp;to a&nbsp;wave of American companies to move jobs offshore to begin with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a Labor Day press conference last week, Mr Trump said he wants to “decouple” the U.S. and Chinese economies, in part by withholding federal contracts from companies that outsource to China. On Thursday, Mr. Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, announced a “Made in America” tax policy that will penalize corporations that move jobs overseas.</p>
<p>The debate over health care manufacturing is likely to lean on similar arguments involving national security and economic growth. Unlike the steel tariffs, there is broad agreement on the issue as the country confronts a pandemic with shortages of personal protective equipment like masks, gowns and face shields.</p>
<p>“If it costs $2 more, it costs $2 more — that’s not the issue,” Mr. Trone said in an interview.</p>
<p>“Why do we have all the N-95 masks being made in China? That’s crazy,” he said. “If we make our products in Pittsburgh, in North Caorlina, in Texas, and we spread it out to different locations in our country, our people will be better protected from some calamity across the world and we’ll be in charge of our own destiny.”</p>
<p>Even before the pandemic, lawmakers and federal officials recognized the country had become too dependent on imported drugs. About 80% of the active ingredients in medications taken in the U.S. come from overseas, mainly from India and China.</p>
<p>In December, a panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, led by Democrats, convened a hearing that highlighted the dangers of importing drugs and questioned the Food and Drug Administration inspection program.</p>
<p>The Government Accountability Office last year found FDA inspections of overseas production facility had dropped and still struggled to fully staff in foreign offices, despite an increase in resources approved by Congress.</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce, a member of the House Homeland Security Committee, said he held a long view on his work with the China Task Force.</p>
<p>“This isn’t going to be: Just turn off the switch and make that transition quickly,” Dr. Joyce said.&nbsp;“This has to be a thoughtful public-private partnership with the necessary incentives to get industries on board with this.”</p>
<p><strong>Roadblocks</strong></p>
<p>The Trump administration’s efforts to expand domestic production have hit some roadblocks. A $765 million government loan approved for Eastman Kodak to produce pharmaceuticals was put on hold last month amid allegations of insider trading and concerns the company could meet its obligations.</p>
<p>On Aug. 31, a $646 million contract with Philips Respironics of Westmoreland County to produce 42,900 ventilators was cancelled by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services pending an “internal HHS investigation and legal review,” according to an agency spokesperson.</p>
<p>The cancellation came after a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/09/02/Philips-Respironics-Congressional-subcommittee-inspector-general-ventilator-prove-frans-van-houten/stories/202009010130?cid=search" target="_blank">congressional panel reported</a>&nbsp;the agency had agreed to pay Philips more than four times the amount of the previous contract with the company for a functionally identical product, resulting in a loss to taxpayers as high as $504 million.</p>
<p>Asked about those problems, Dr. Joyce acknowledged “setbacks” but said Congress has a responsibility to press forward.</p>
<p>The two lawmakers credit one another for finding common ground at a polarized time in Washington.</p>
<p>They are united by outsider attitudes. Both members spent heavily in largely self-funded House campaigns. Dr. Joyce spent nearly $1.5 million, including $906,000 of his own money, to win&nbsp;a heated eight-person Republican primary in 2018 to replace retiring Rep. Bill Shuster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2016, Mr. Trone spent a record $12 million of his own money in an unsuccessful House bid in Maryland. In 2018, he won&nbsp;in another Maryland district, which spans west from the Washington region over the entire Maryland panhandle to the West Virginia border.</p>
<p>Mr. Trone — who lived in Murrysville for 14 years in the 1980s and 1990s while running his retail business that became Total Wine and More —&nbsp;is one of a handful of Democrats that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce is expected to endorse, breaking with the business organization’s history of supporting mostly Republicans.</p>
<p>The two lawmakers worked together to push for funding to complete a section of the North/South Appalachian Highway that would weave through both districts. They co-sponsored bipartisan bills as part of a House Freshmen Working Group on Addiction, which Mr. Trone launched last year with 63 members from 31 states.</p>
