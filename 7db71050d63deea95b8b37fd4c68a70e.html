<p>WASHINGTON — As the federal stockpile dwindles, emergency room physicians are rationing personal protective equipment and the broader region remains ill-prepared to maintain the fight against the coronavirus in the coming months, Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, said Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who spoke with the Federal Emergency Management Agency last week, said there was bipartisan frustration at the Trump administration’s lack of specific plans for replenishing the national stockpile.</p>
<p>The demand for personal protective equipment will rise, Mr. Lamb said, with the need for widespread COVID-19 testing and contact tracing as states move to lift stay-at-home orders and allow business to resume.</p>

<p>He pointed to a recent estimate — made by Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — that the country would need 300,000 contact tracers in order to safely reopen the economy.</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s so disturbing that, today, the message is: ‘You’re on your own,’” Mr. Lamb said in an interview.</p>
<p>“The message should be, if the national stockpile is running low: ‘We’re taking the lead to replenish it. Here are our target numbers. Here’s how we’re planning for the manufacturing and purchasing to meet those numbers, and we’ll stop at nothing to get there.’”</p>
<p>A White House spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>On Monday, the White House shared a lengthy update on all federal aid distributed to Pennsylvania across agencies, including agriculture, education, housing and justice spending.</p>
<p>In the first two weeks of April, according to the White House figures, Pennsylvania received the following from the national stockpile: 628,900 N95 masks; 3,255,500 surgical and procedural masks; 58,100 face shields; 2,224,000 isolation and surgical gowns; and 78,445,800 surgical and exam gloves.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, who spoke with Pennsylvania emergency room physicians on Tuesday, said many ER staff are still coming up short on supplies.</p>
<p>“They still feel like they are rationing PPE in a way that is not safe for best practices,” Mr. Lamb said. “If we’re already cut off from this crucial PPE, and you have the fifth-highest number of cases, what position does that put us in one month from now or two months from now?”</p>
<p>While many hospitals report having plenty of supplies, others are asking for more, said Shawn Quinn, president of the Pennsylvania Chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, a medical society that represents about 1,900 Pennsylvania ER physicians.</p>
<p>The organization — which held its annual Washington lobbying day through virtual meetings with congressional members — is calling for President Donald Trump to fully invoke the Defense Production Act to require U.S. manufacturing of equipment that will be needed in greater supply for months to come.</p>
<p>“We really need to make sure there’s a coordination between federal, state and local officials to make sure everyone has the appropriate amount and appropriate type of PPE,” Dr. Quinn said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said such federal government bargaining would guard against the kind of price gouging for equipment that many governors have experienced. The Trump administration has pledged to get “as many as we can,” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>“That’s not good enough,” he said. “Without targets, and if you’re just leaving 50 different governors to compete on the global market, you’re putting us in a weaker position.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health confirmed state officials were informed the federal stockpile could not supply all the state’s needs.</p>
<p>“With the stockpile depleted, we are now working to procure any items we need, primarily gowns at this point, on our own,” said Nate Wardle, the department’s press secretary. “If we are having trouble, we can reach out to the federal government, but as stated, their stockpile is also gone.”</p>
<p>“It is only natural that, with every state needing supplies, there is going to be some competition for those,” Mr. Wardle added. “We are looking to work with states as much as possible to assist them if they can assist us, but at some times everyone needs the same things.”</p>
