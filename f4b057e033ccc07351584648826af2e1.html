<h1>Explain the waivers: Gov. Wolf, officials need to provide details of their decisions </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf may have had the best interests of Pennsylvanians in mind when he ordered the shutdown of businesses that were not “life-sustaining” as a way to slow the spread of COVID-19. But the secrecy and inconsistency in determining which businesses could stay open has fueled ongoing suspicion and criticism.</p>
<p>The governor and his administration should stop trying to hide the details of why some businesses were granted waivers to remain in operation while others were denied. The list of approvals and denials, along with the reasons behind them, should be made public immediately.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf issued the shutdown order on March 19, but allowed businesses that were not already exempt to apply for a waiver to remain open. By the time the waiver application deadline arrived on April 3, more than 42,300 applications had been received by the Department of Community and Economic Development. Of those, nearly 8,000 were approved, about 17,000 were denied and, oddly, more than 14,000 were for activities that did not require a waiver.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, DCED officials have refused to provide a list of what businesses received waivers and which were denied. Numerous news organizations have requested copies of the waiver applications and decisions related to them, only to be told such information would be released at a later date. As of yet, there is no timeline for making the information public.</p>
<p>Many business owners have complained about the process, saying they were forced to close while competitors could remain open. Worse, they were provided with no explanation for why their waiver request was denied.</p>
<p>Political opponents of the Democratic governor have also raised the issue of fairness and are threatening legal action if the Wolf administration does not produce records related to the process of granting waivers. Two Republican state senators — Tom Killion, R-Delaware, and Mike Regan, R-York — sent a letter to Mr. Wolf asking for emails, letters and other documents related to the waiver process, as well as a list of those granted and denied.</p>
<p>The two say they are “prepared to take any appropriate additional steps to compel the delivery of these records,” which could include issuing a subpoena.</p>
<p>Administration officials have said they are reviewing the request but offered no indication as to whether they would comply.</p>
<p>The lack of transparency in the waiver process has been appalling from the start, and there is no substantive reason for withholding information on how decisions were made. The governor and his administration should avoid a prolonged legal battle and be forthcoming immediately with all the details related to the waiver process.</p>
