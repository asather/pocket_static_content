Some stat-chasers last season might have started to force the issue, allowing the other team to quickly skate in the other direction.</p><p>“I really like the discipline our team has right now,” Sullivan said. “Discipline in all of its forms is what makes a team hard to play against. And that’s something that we’ve challenged these guys [to do] from Day One of training camp.”</p><p>That discipline rarely waned in December, when the Penguins posted a 10-2-0 record and a plus-16 goal differential that both ranked first in the NHL. But lapses in the first period and in overtime cost them in their first game in 2020.</p><p>Let’s start with the last one, which put the Sharks, just 2-9-2 in their previous 13 games before arriving at PPG Paints Arena, in position to win in overtime.</p><p>The trio of Evgeni Malkin, Bryan Rust and Kris Letang hogged the puck during the first shift in the 3-on-3 OT. But the Sharks finally regained possession and went on the counterattack. Malkin was gassed and in no mood to scurry back. Letang tried to chase down Logan Couture but ended up pulling down the center.</p><p>With Letang in the box and three bodies in front of Tristan Jarry, Brent Burns blasted a shot past Jarry’s glove to capitalize on the 4-on-3 power play.</p><p>“For the most part, our [penalty killers] did a really good job,” Sullivan said. “They made a good play by a bunch of good players. It’s a heck of a shot. They had a good screen. We’re all in the right places. We’re trying to block the shot. … It’s just a tough situation when you have to kill two minutes of a 4-on-3.”</p><p>In the first period, while falling into a 2-1 hole that allowed the Sharks to sit back, the Penguins on three occasions put their goalie in a tough situation.</p><p>The Penguins, after giving up oodles of odd-man rushes last season, have been so much stingier in that area this season. But in the first period Thursday, they gave up three 2-on-1 rushes. The third time, the Sharks finally cashed in.</p><p>The Penguins coughed the puck up near center ice and John Marino got caught flat-footed in the neutral zone. With only Marcus Pettersson back, Couture took a pass from Patric Marleau and beat a lunging Jarry over his left shoulder.</p><p>“Sometimes there are mistakes of enthusiasm, but that’s hockey,” Sullivan said. “We’ll learn from those. But that’s not something we’ve done a whole lot of. I don’t think we’ve given up three 2-on-1s in the last 10 games. And that’s the type of game we have to play. We have to make sure we’re hard to play against.”</p><p>They did do that for most of the night. But with Jake Guentzel out of the lineup, Sullivan trying out new lineup combinations and the Sharks trying to make it a boring night for the home fans, the Penguins only mustered two goals.</p><p>Both came from Patric Hornqvist, in his third game back from injured reserve.</p><p>The Penguins fell behind 2:48 into the first period when Tomas Hertl tipped a pass from Burns between Jarry’s legs. Hornqvist tied it up later in the period, picking off an errant Sharks pass then cruising in to snap a shot past Aaron Dell.</p><p>Both teams tightened up during a sleepy second period. Finally, there was action a few minutes before the intermission. Soon after Malkin was called for his eighth penalty in four games, the Sharks took one, too, making it 4-on-4.</p><p>The Penguins lost track of Marleau and he patiently shuffled in on Jarry. Jarry ignored his subtle fakes until Marleau ran out of room and ducked behind the net. The goalie, who had won six straight starts entering Thursday, scrambled back into position in time to turn aside an Erik Karlsson one-timer.</p><p>Moments later, after play returned to 5-on-5, Rust swerved out of the corner and spotted Hornqvist, who poked his pass by Dell to make it 2-2. It was Hornqvist’s second goal of the night and third since returning from injury Saturday.</p><p>“The second one, right in the crease. … That’s where he does his best work at,” Jack Johnson said. “I hope he catches fire just like everyone else.”</p><p>Rust, meanwhile, now has at least a point in nine of his past 10 games. He already is five points away from tying his single-season career high of 38 points.</p><p>But despite getting a few good looks on a third-period power play and controlling play for much of that period, the Penguins couldn’t break through again.</p><p>“There wasn’t too much ice. They were trying to get their forecheck going. They were playing a simple game. We were trying to play a simple game. There wasn’t a whole lot going on out there [all game],” Rust said. “I think we did a pretty good job tonight. It just sucks that they got a power play in overtime.”</p><p>The Penguins, despite the loss, have earned at least a point in 15 of their last 16 games at PPG Paints Arena, posting a 12-2-2 record over that span.</p><p>The Penguins travel to Montreal on Saturday then host Florida a day later.</p><p><em>Matt Vensel: mvensel@post-gazette.com and Twitter @mattvensel.</em></p></body></html>
