<h1>Stacey Abrams is ‘willing to serve’ as Biden’s VP</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stacey Abrams says she’d be the best running mate for former Vice President Joe Biden -- and she’s not afraid to keep saying so.</p>
<p>The Georgia Democrat said Sunday that growing up as a black girl in Mississippi taught her the importance of being her own strongest advocate.</p>
<p>“I learned that if I didn’t speak up for myself, no one else would," Abrams told NBC News’ Chuck Todd."(So) my mission is to say out loud if I’m asked the question: ‘Yes, I would be willing to serve.’”</p>
<p>Abrams, who is thought to be one of several veepstakes candidates, has raised some eyebrows with her string of blunt statements that the presumptive Democratic nominee should name her as his running mate.</p>
<p>“It is about making sure that my qualifications aren’t in question, because they’re not just speaking to me," Abrams said on CNN. "They’re speaking to young black women ... who wonder if they too can be seen.”</p>
<p>Also on Sunday, asked if Biden needs to add a woman of color to his ticket, Abrams told CNN's Jake Tapper that the former vice president "knows what he needs to do to win, and he knows what he needs to do to serve, and to lead, and help our country recover from four years of incompetence and chaos."</p>
<p>The former Georgia State legislator warned that, "for communities of color, because of this pandemic, there is a great deal of distrust," in government, adding: "I want to make one thing very clear -- Joe Biden enjoys the trust of communities of color, and he will take no one for granted. And I believe that he will make the right choice based on what he understands and what his team believes and recommends that he do."</p>

<p>On her own chances of making it onto the ticket in November, Abrams on Sunday told CNN, "My responsibility is to follow the process, if I'm included, and I trust that Joe Biden and his team are going to put together a process that will pick the best running mate for him, because fundamentally, it's his choice."</p>
<p>Abrams did not offer any inside information on the search process, which Biden has said is just getting underway.</p>
<p>She is often listed alongside Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar as top candidates to be Biden’s running mate.</p>
<p>Abrams, who runs a voting rights group, is a soaring orator who could light a fire under young and black voters who might otherwise stay home.</p>
<p>But Biden, who would be the oldest president ever if elected, has said he wants someone who will be ready to be president on Day 1. That suggested to some that he was leaning away from Abrams, whose highest office was being Democratic leader in the Georgia state house.</p>
<p>In an interview with Elle Magazine earlier this month, Abrams told the publication she'd make an "excellent" running mate, and has continued to tout her credentials in a series of media interviews in the subsequent weeks.</p>
<p>In an open letter to the Biden campaign Friday, 200 black women urged the former vice president to pick a black woman as his running mate, calling for "a ticket that reflects the diversity of America."</p>
<p>South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the third highest-ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives who endorsed Biden before his decisive win in the state, has also said he favors the former vice president picking a black woman.</p>
