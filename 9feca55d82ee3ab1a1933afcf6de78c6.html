<h1>Penguins on pause: Marcus Pettersson gets more money, more minutes in 2019-20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>The Penguins put a lot more money in Marcus Pettersson’s pocket this season.</p>
<p>They also put an extra helping of responsibility on the young blue-liner’s plate.</p>
<p>Last summer, general manager Jim Rutherford wanted to reward Pettersson with a new contract. He had been so steady after Rutherford acquired him from the Anaheim Ducks in the Daniel Sprong trade in December 2018. And Pettersson was poised to play top-four minutes for coach Mike Sullivan in 2019-20.</p>
<p>But the Penguins couldn’t squeeze his deal under the salary cap ceiling. So Pettersson had to wait until this January to sign a five-year extension that will pay him an average annual salary of $4,025,175 through the 2024-25 season.</p>
<p>On the ice, the 23-year-old skated more than ever. He averaged 19 minutes, 24 seconds of ice time — about a minute and a half more than in 2018-19. Only Kris Letang played more total minutes on the banged-up Pittsburgh blue line.</p>
<p>He predominantly played on the second pair with Justin Schultz or rookie John Marino, who was acquired last summer in another steal of a deal by Rutherford. Pettersson was often deployed on the second power play. And his shorthanded ice time nearly tripled, though all those injuries necessitated that.</p>
<p>From a performance standpoint, Pettersson was a bit up and down in his second season in Pittsburgh. He, like many of his teammates, had several rough nights in the final 20 games before the NHL suspended play March 12.</p>
<p>But in total, he was a plus performer with two goals, 22 points and a plus-9 rating, showing he is worth the money and his place in their long-term plans.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> In the Feb. 23 loss in D.C., he crashed into the post while hustling back to try to prevent a Jakub Vrana goal. Pettersson went to the locker room. He returned — of course — to play 18-plus minutes and notch an assist. The durable defender was one of two Penguins to play all 69 games.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> While the Penguins can surrender high shot rates while Pettersson is on the ice at 5-on-5, opponents had more high-danger chances than them in those minutes in just 25 of 69 games, per Natural Stat Trick. That suggests he makes an impact that doesn’t show up in the box score.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Pettersson will skate on the second pair with either Schultz or Marino. When the season halted, his partner was Marino. He needs to play tougher in front of his net in the playoffs and stay on the same page with his partner to allow the Evgeni Malkin line to play in the other end.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> It’s fair to wonder if Pettersson can be a top-pair guy. But he is smart, steady and the kind of competitor a coach will find minutes for. Pettersson, even with Rutherford’s propensity to trade anything that isn’t nailed to the floor, figures to be a fixture on the blue line the next few years.</p>
