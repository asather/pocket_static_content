<h1>Priest contemplates his life, ministry after COVID-19 ordeal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It just seemed like a cold, a case of sniffles and a persistent headache. He called his doctor, who he said assured him these were not COVID-19 symptoms.</p>
<p>Then on March 20, the Rev. Adam Potter was contacted by a friend he had seen several days earlier and who reported testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Those mild symptoms emerged as not something to take lightly,” Father Potter recalled. “So my experience was very quickly one of my world being turned upside down.”</p>
<p>Father Potter is the only Roman Catholic priest of the Diocese of Pittsburgh to have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>He’ll be spending Easter as he has for more than two weeks now, self-quarantined, staying in the country at a home lent by a friend. Even though he's been free for several days now of the relatively mild but persistent symptoms, he’s waiting to get a test confirming he’s now clear of the infection before returning to his parishes in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“I'm in a place to offer a word of encouragement at this point, being at the other side of the coronavirus, that is hopeful compared with most stories in the news,” he said.</p>
<p>Father Potter, 31, is a parochial vicar on staff at a grouping of parishes that include St. Paul Cathedral and St. Regis in Oakland, St. Stephen in Hazelwood and St. Rosalia in Greenfield.</p>
<p>He says he has much to be grateful for. Grateful for a time of “entering the silence” in enforced solitude. Grateful that he had interacted with relatively few people before learning he had the virus and that, as far as he knows, none of them contracted the illness.</p>
<p>Grateful that his symptoms were relatively mild, yet substantial enough to help him empathize with those&nbsp;“suffering intensely from the virus,” he said.</p>
<p>As soon as Father Potter received word of his friend’s diagnosis, he went to a drive-in testing site.</p>
<p>“It’s almost ominous,” he said. He recalled “You go through a queue, where people who are all dressed up in their suits greet you with masks. You get tested and you don’t even get out of your car.”</p>
<p>Even before he received the result, the impact was far-reaching. Because the exposure of him and another priest who ended up testing negative, Bishop David Zubik directed that all churches in the diocese be locked, an extra step after already canceling Masses. There were just too many vectors to catch the virus from persons and surfaces.</p>
<p>Father Potter, meanwhile, was dealing with his own test result, received on Sunday, March 22. “I had to leave the rectory where I was currently residing, just out of caution for the other priests there.” The friend offered a home to stay in, and others left groceries for him outside the door.</p>
<p>“Talk about a feeling of being stripped very quickly,” he said. “It was not easy, but I’m grateful I had friends come to my need.”</p>
<p>At first, after the diocese reported his case publicly, he was “overwhelmed with messages of love and support” from parishioners and others. “And then those trickled down, and then it was, ‘Oh wait, it’s just me. Me and the Lord.’”</p>
<p>As he always does, he celebrated Mass each day and a cycle of daily prayers, but without a busy ministry schedule in between.</p>

<p>He has maintained some ministry, though, offering spiritual direction by phone and leading a rosary prayer session via videoconferencing each evening.</p>
<p>The ordeal is just the latest unexpected upheaval in his brief priesthood.</p>
<p>Father Potter grew up in Mt. Lebanon, his family first attending an evangelical church and then, as his mother began to rediscover her childhood Catholicism, Adam joined the rest of the family in converting when he was about 14.</p>
<p>Though for a time after college he hoped to teach high school math and coach basketball, he soon embraced a calling to become a priest.</p>
<p>Ordained in 2016, he had no idea about what was about to hit him and his colleagues.</p>
<p>First the 2018 grand jury report, detailing a decades-long history of sexual abuse by priests and cover-up by their superiors, undercutting parishioners’ confidence in their leaders.</p>
<p>Then came the launch of diocese-wide mergers of parishes, something the diocese says is a necessary downsizing but one that is alienating parishioners who question the sweeping changes and looming church closures.</p>
<p>Then came the pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s been so clear to me that the priesthood that I'm entering is nothing like I've experienced growing up and will be nothing I can predict,” he said.</p>
<p>But in that “uncomfortable uncertainty,” he said, “I have found freedom in it. I'm not afraid to allow there to be a real purification, to come down to what’s most essential about the faith.”</p>
<p>Before long, parish life will resume. Catholics will regain access to sacraments such as the Eucharist and confession. But he believes this ordeal will have a longer impact.</p>
<p>“Here’s the new frontier,” he said. “It’s how to minister right now when the decision of the bishop and so many of the bishops is to suppress the sacraments and yet not to suppress ministry —&nbsp;to be present to people, to lead them, reach out to them. In a sense it resumes, but I also realize it’s not going back to normal. It’s something completely new.”</p>
<p>It’s not certain if those who’ve had COVID-19 become immune to future infections. But Father Potter hopes that’s the case.</p>
<p>“I have a great desire to be free to go into hospitals and nursing homes and allow people who are dying to have a priest there to give them last rites,” he said. Lacking a priest in such situations “is most heart-breaking to both faithful and priests.”</p>
