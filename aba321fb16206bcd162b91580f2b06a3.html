<h1>Students sue Pitt for refunds over 'sub-par' online instruction due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two students have sued the University of Pittsburgh for a refund of tuition, fees and housing costs for the spring semester, claiming that the school's online instruction is “sub-par.”</p>
<p>The suit, filed in U.S. District Court by undergraduates Claire Hickey and Akira Kirkpatrick, is seeking class-action status on behalf of other Pitt students affected by the March 16 campus closure due to coronavirus.</p>
<p>Lawyers for the plaintiffs said in the complaint that Pitt is not providing the education that the students paid for, nor the use of the campus facilities, housing or meal plans for which they also paid, and they want their money back.</p>
<p>The on-line teaching that Pitt has been offering is a "materially deficient and insufficient alternative," the suit says.</p>
<p>Kevin Zwick, a Pitt spokesman, said Saturday that the school was unaware of the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Similar suits have been filed around the country against colleges forced to close because of the pandemic.</p>

<p>The suit says the school should not be allowed to keep the money students pay if it is not holding up its end of the deal to provide a "first-rate" college education and on-campus experience.</p>
<p>"The university has retained the full benefit of the tuition and mandatory fee payments by plaintiffs and the members of the class for the spring 2020 semester, yet has failed to provide the quality of education and services and facilities for which tuition and the mandatory fees were paid," wrote attorneys Gary Lynch and Jeffrey Klafter.</p>
<p>The suit says the school should return the prorated portion for tuition and fees dating from March 16, when Pitt shut down, and for unused dining and housing costs for students who were not able to leave campus by April 3.</p>
<p>Pitt only provided prorated refunds to students for housing and meals who left campus housing before April 3. Those who couldn't leave by then should also get the refund, the suit says.</p>
<p>The suit makes claims of breach of contract and unjust enrichment against Pitt and asks a federal judge to certify the suit as a class-action.</p>
<p>It also asks for compensatory damages, attorneys' fees and other costs.</p>
