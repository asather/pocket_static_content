<h1>Six quick questions before the Pirates head to Bradenton</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Over the past few months, we’ve seen the Pirates move on from the leadership group of Clint Hurdle (manager), Neal Huntington (GM) and Frank Coonelly (president). In their places are&nbsp;Derek Shelton, Ben Cherington and Travis Williams.</p>
<p>With the trade of Starling Marte on Jan. 27, it appears the team is in rebuild mode, though Cherington and the Pirates have denied calling it such.</p>
<p>A lot of questions are facing Shelton, Cherington and Williams as the Pirates look toward 2020. Let’s explore a few of the inquires fans and observers have with spring training on the horizon:</p>
<p><strong>Who is the fifth starter?</strong></p>
<p>Barring injuries, the Pirates will start the season with Joe Musgrove, Chris Archer, Trevor Williams and Mitch Keller in their pitching rotation. The fifth slot will likely come down to a battle between Steven Brault, Chad Kuhl and the recently signed Derek Holland.</p>
<p>Brault is the Pirates version of Celie from “The Color Purple.” Every season he’s had to fight for his spot on the roster and rotation, and this year will be no different for Brault.</p>
<p>The left-hander showed promise in several starts in 2019, but there were hiccups toward the end of the year. Overall, he made 19 starts, posting a 4-6 record. A consistent spring could net him that No. 5 starter job.</p>
<p>Kuhl, who had a sub-5.00 ERA from 2016-18, is returning after missing 2019 due to Tommy John surgery and will have to show that he’s able to withstand the rigors of a full season.</p>
<p>Holland was a good starting pitcher in 2018, but his 2019 was horrendous as he split time between starting and bullpen. He posted a 6.08 ERA and minus-1.2 WAR in 84⅓ innings with the Giants and Cubs last season.</p>
<p>Another factor that could play into the Pirates’ decision is that Brault and Kuhl both have a minor league option left, meaning they could start the year in Class AAA if there isn’t room for them on the 26-man roster. Holland also has an opt-out if he doesn’t make the team.</p>
<p><strong>Can Gregory Polanco stay healthy?</strong></p>
<p>Polanco hasn’t been the same since an errant slide ended his 2018 season. He couldn’t get right in 2019 and only played 42 games with a paltry .242 batting average.</p>
<p>Without Marte in the lineup, the Pirates need Polanco more than ever, especially at the plate. The Pirates were one of the worst home run hitting teams in baseball last year, and that’s an area where Polanco, who hit 23 home runs in 2018, can definitely help. If he’s able to play, of course.</p>
<p><strong>How will you replace Starling Marte?</strong></p>
<p>Perhaps the biggest move of the Pirates’ offseason was trading Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks for two prospects and international pool money. Marte, a two-time Gold Glove winner, was dynamic at times in center field, and that ability will be hard to replace. If the Pirates look outside of the organization to fill Marte’s shoes, they could go after players such as Cameron Maybin and Kevin Pillar. None of those men will bring what Marte did, but each has had big league success and could help the Pirates.</p>
<p>If they stay internal, they can use Guillermo Heredia (signed in January) or Jason Martin (who played 20 big-league games last season) in center field. Bryan Reynolds has played center and has expressed confidence in his ability to play the position if needed, though Cherington told the Post-Gazette this week that the Pirates might keep Reynolds in left.</p>
<p>“We want to learn more about the guys that we have here,” Cherington said. “[Guillermo] Heredia is capable of playing center field. Reynolds can, although he did such a good job in left field, and had such a good year, that there’s some interest in trying to keep him in left. But he’s certainly comfortable with it.”</p>
<p>The Pirates should look for an external option. Besides, it’s not as if they don’t have the room in their payroll.</p>
<p><strong>Who will be the closer?</strong></p>
<p>Replacing Felipe Vazquez won’t be an easy task, and Shelton has stated a preference for having a competition for the position.</p>
<p>“There’s multiple people who can be in that mix, who are going to be pitching at the back end of the game in big innings for us,” Shelton said. “I’ve expressed that to those guys and told them that, and then as we get to spring training and work further, we’ll be able to make that decision.”</p>
<p>Keone Kela is the presumed favorite considering that he has the most experience as a closer. Kyle Crick and Richard Rodriguez will also be in the mix. How many games the Pirates will hold late leads, however, is another story.</p>
<p><strong>When will we see Ke’Bryan Hayes?</strong></p>
<p>Colin Moran is most likely going to begin the season handling third base. Moran produced substantial offensive numbers in 2019 (13 home runs, 80 RBIs, a .277 batting average), but his defense left much to be desired.</p>
<p>Hayes struggled at times at the plate in Class AAA, but in the field he won a third consecutive Rawlings Minor League Baseball Gold Glove last season. For Hayes, it’s likely not a question of if he’ll play in Pittsburgh, but when.</p>
<p><strong>Who’s next to get traded?</strong></p>
<p>Josh Bell, an All-Star in 2019, would net the best return from other teams, but the Pirates aren’t in a rush to move him.</p>
<p>If the Pirates are out of the chase at the trade deadline, Chris Archer, Polanco, Adam Frazier and Kela would almost certainly be among the players on the block if the winning isn’t there.</p>
