<h1>Major round of parish mergers taking effect</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Rev. Frank Almade took on the daunting task in 2018 of shepherding three Roman Catholic parishes in eastern Allegheny County toward an eventual merger.</p>
<p>Soon enough, he and other parish leaders realized that wasn’t going to work&nbsp;— not because it was too big a task to merge three parishes, but because it wasn’t big enough. They partnered up with four more parishes — a total of seven parishes with eight church sanctuaries in a territory ranging from Swissvale to Wilmerding.</p>
<p>Officially on July 1, the entire group will form the single St. Joseph the Worker Parish.</p>
<p>“We’re looking forward to having a new name and a new identity,” said Father Almade, the incoming pastor of St. Joseph and currently the administrator of&nbsp;the self-nicknamed “Eight Great Churches of the East.”</p>
<p>“Those with financial resources were joined with those with younger parishioners, so it made for a good mix,” he said.</p>
<p>This is just one of 15 mergers scheduled to go into effect July 1, combining 61 parishes in all.</p>
<p>This is the biggest milestone yet in On Mission for the Church Alive, a sweeping reorganization of the six-county Diocese of Pittsburgh, begun in 2018. Smaller groups of parishes already have merged. By the time of its completion in 2022, virtually all of the diocese’s parishes are slated to have merged, along with many of its schools.</p>
<p>The aim is to create fewer but leaner parishes and schools that would be better equipped to offer lively worship and seek to grow through evangelistic outreaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still to be decided at many parishes: How many sanctuaries they can afford to keep open, something pastors acknowledge will be among the most difficult parts of the process.</p>
<p>It hasn’t helped that the diocese has undergone the changes even while navigating the devastating 2018 grand jury report into sexual abuse by priests, and more recently by the pandemic.</p>
<p>But the reorganization is in response to long-term trends: a striking drop in church participation. Between 2000 and 2018, Mass attendance, church weddings, infant baptisms, first communions, confirmations and K-8 enrollment were all down from 40 to 50% in the diocese, according to its own numbers.</p>
<p>“The dream of On Mission is vibrant parishes with effective ministries. That has been what we are praying for and what we are working toward,” said&nbsp;the Rev. David Bonnar, administrator of St. Bernard Parish in Mount Lebanon and Our Lady of Grace in Scott Township, which are merging to form St. Michael the Archangel Parish.</p>
<p>Still, many parishioners have found the changes wrenching.</p>
<p>“These past two years have been the most challenging of my 32 as a priest,” said Father Bonnar.</p>
<p>“It’s been a couple of long years with a lot of emotions,” agreed Erin King, a longtime member of Our Lady of Grace Parish.</p>
<p>“When we first started hearing about the Church Alive campaign, I went to a lot of the different talks the bishop was offering,” she said.&nbsp;“You kind of understood the&nbsp;writing was on the wall when you look around the church and see not a lot of people sitting in the pews.” But even understanding the need for the reorganization, parishioners were surprised to learn they’d be paired with St. Bernard, rather than previously discussed partnerships with parishes in Bridgeville or Carnegie.</p>
<p>That, plus the merger of Our Lady of Grace’s school with three other South Hills parish schools, using two other locations, she said.</p>
<p>“Nothing against St. Bernard, but we felt we were being swallowed up at the beginning,” Ms. King said, and some people left for other parishes. But she&nbsp;said Father Bonnar “tried hard to make it work for everybody,” taking an active part in the parish festivals and fish fries at Our Lady. The two parishes combined choirs and charitable outreaches, and an annual sacramental procession held by St. Bernard was moved to Our Lady.</p>
<p>“We were able to be heard,” Ms. King said. She understands why some people left in disappointment, but she’s staying:&nbsp;“I always try to stay positive with it.”</p>
<p>Kim Harris, a longtime member of St. Bernard’s, &nbsp;said the transition was “was rocky at the start but it turned out well.”</p>
<p>“We had a lot of pushback from people,” she said. “They just wanted their own church, their own pastor.&nbsp;A lot of the churches were like that.”</p>
<p>But she said many remained and kept a “focus on moving forward.” She said Father Bonnar&nbsp;“kept calling Bower Hill Road the bridge” between the two parishes, and the message has taken hold. “I think we’ve ended up in a good place finally.”</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik acknowledged some have struggled with the changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"But a lot of people who might have been opposed to it early on are beginning to think it’s working,” he said.&nbsp;“My hope is that people are coming closer to Jesus, and that was the main purpose of it at a time when the secularization of society is so prominent.”</p>
<p><strong>‘One umbrella’</strong></p>
<p>The Rev. Kris Stubna, pastor at St. Paul Cathedral — which is merging with St. Regis in Oakland, St. Rosalia in Greenfield and St. Stephen in Hazelwood&nbsp;— said the four parishes have already combined their charitable organizations, religious education programs and other services.&nbsp;“A&nbsp;lot of the things we’re doing are stronger now because we’ve pulled them under one umbrella,” he said.</p>
<p>Plans for big merger celebrations are postponed because the pandemic has limited gatherings, but it’s not delaying the mergers.</p>
<p>“Obviously, COVID hasn’t helped,” Father Stubna said. “That’s the hardest thing,” not being able to get everyone together physically.</p>
<p>St. Paul Cathedral’s name will remain with the merged parishes, but the other 14 parishes will take on new names, chosen in consultation with the members.</p>
<p>Father Bonnar said the combined St. Bernard/Our Lady of Grace parish’s namesake, St. Michael the Archangel, is someone whom Catholics ask for protection from evil.</p>
<p>“We live in a time where there’s been a lot of evil, and we’ve certainly seen evil in the world, in the church,” he said. “It’s a very appropriate patron in our time.”</p>
<p>Beginning July 1, Father Bonnar will become pastor of St. Aidan’s Parish, a merger of St. Alphonsus and St. Alexis (and named for the patron saint of a cathedral in County Wexford, Ireland, namesake of the North Hills area of the parishes). The Rev. Brian Welding is St. Michael’s incoming pastor.</p>
<p>Father Almade, who will be remaining at St. Joseph the Worker, said he thrilled that parishioners and the diocese rallied behind the parish name. He did his graduate thesis on the Catholic support for a just wage for workers, dedicating the paper to his parents and St. Joseph, and it also resonates with the industrial heritage of the parish’s region. So even if they can’t have a big parish celebration of merger right away, he hopes they might be able to on an appropriate holiday: Labor Day.</p>
<p>“I am looking forward to this merger,” said Susan Buchholz, a longtime member of St. Colman Parish in Turtle Creek, one of the parishes merging into St. Joseph the Worker. “It will enhance our outreach opportunities as one parish, which is very important.”</p>
