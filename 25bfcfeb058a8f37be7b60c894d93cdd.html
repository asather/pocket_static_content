<h1>Behind strong pitching performances, Pirates sweep doubleheader with Cardinals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With two outs in the seventh inning, Nik Turley got St. Louis Cardinals outfielder Dexter Fowler to pop up down the right field line.</p>
<p>When right fielder Jose Osuna squeezed it, the Pirates popped out of their dugout to celebrate two wins in the last six hours. They had played 15 innings in a day, winning both games of their doubleheader with the Cardinals, 4-3 and 2-0, respectively.</p>
<p>The sweep comes after perhaps their toughest series of the season on Tuesday and Wednesday, when the Pirates were no-hit and blown out in consecutive games by the Chicago White Sox, and while they only moved their record to 9-19 for the season, the wins brought a bit of relief.</p>
<p>“The most important thing is to stay aggressive,” manager Derek Shelton said. “We got put on our heels a little bit by two really good pitchers in Chicago, and it’s a reminder. The one thing we’ve talked about with this group is, we have to get better every day. We have to have teaching points. Chicago was a teaching point. We got away from something we thought we did well, and we stepped back on it.”</p>
<p>Really, the wins came in fairly similar ways.</p>
<p>In both games, the Pirates’ starting pitchers — Chad Kuhl in game one and Cody Ponce in game two — performed admirably, shutting down the Cardinals through much of their starts, while the offense provided just enough to edge out two wins.</p>
<p>Ponce’s outing was a bit surprising. The righty was making his first major-league start after being sent to the Pirates’ alternate training site in Altoona earlier this month.</p>
<p>He responded with 5.2 scoreless innings, allowing five hits and two walks along the way.</p>
<p>“The only thing that really wasn’t working today was my changeup,” Ponce said. “My cutter was there. My curveball was there. Heater was playing. I would have to say [it was] the cutter that saved me on a couple and kinda got me back into counts. Really just try to focus on hitting my spots and attacking. [Catcher John Ryan Murphy] kinda told me after the third inning — I asked him, ‘What are we gonna do here?’ He said, ‘We’re gonna go right after them.’ That kinda put me in a different state of mind.”</p>
<p>The offense gave him some support in the third, when shortstop Erik Gonzalez singled to score infielder JT Riddle, and second baseman Adam Frazier followed suit, scoring catcher John Ryan Murphy on a single of his own.</p>
<p>Those were the only runs of the game. When Ponce was finished, right-hander Geoff Hartlieb and lefty Turley shut down the last 1.1 innings to finish off the doubleheader sweep. In addition to Ponce’s first career win, Turley earned his first career save.</p>
<p>“Really good. The fact that we had two firsts tonight — first major-league save and first major-league win — so I know what a beer shower feels like in St. Louis, and I think those guys got one,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>In game one, seven innings weren’t enough.</p>
<p>Each offense struggled to get anything going in the early stages of the game. The Pirates scratched a run across in the fourth, with a single from catcher Jacob Stallings driving outfielder Cole Tucker home. The Cardinals answered right back in the fifth, on a solo home run from catcher Yadier Molina, tying the game 1-1. That was it.</p>
<p>So, it took extras for the teams to find some traction. The Pirates went first. With the extra-inning courtesy runner on second, Tucker stepped up and blooped a single into center field to score outfielder Jarrod Dyson. Tucker moved over on a Josh Bell walk two hitters later, and left fielder Bryan Reynolds hit another soft line drive into center to score him. Stallings tacked on one more when a hard ground ball to third scooted under the glove of Cardinals infielder Brad Miller and Bell crossed home.</p>
<p>That was just barely enough for right-hander Richard Rodriguez, who closed out the game in the eighth inning. He allowed a single and a sacrifice fly to score one run, then two more singles and another run, putting baserunners on first and third with one out in a one-run game. Rodriguez stepped up to strike out the final two hitters, though, securing the narrow win for the Pirates.</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was great,” Stallings said. “Especially now, with how extra innings are, Bryan’s hit was just huge to extend the lead to two. It was great. We haven’t gotten many breaks, it doesn’t feel like, lately. We hit about, I don’t know, 20 balls to the warning track, so maybe we deserved to find some holes.”</p>
<p>Kuhl began Game 1 and was good once again.</p>
<p>Through four innings, the right-hander allowed just four baserunners on two hits and two walks. None of them scored and he needed just 42 pitches to get it done.</p>
<p>He blinked in the fifth, allowing a 413-foot homer to Molina, but settled down and finished the sixth without more damage. Really, it was more of the norm for Kuhl. In each of his four starts, he has gone at least four innings and allowed no more than three runs. His 2.52 ERA is now the lowest of any Pirates starter.</p>
<p>“In these doubleheaders you want to you want to help out as much as you can and take the stress off the bullpen and try to be efficient,” Kuhl said. “It felt really good to do that.”</p>
