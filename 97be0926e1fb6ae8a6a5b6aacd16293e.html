<h1>Mayor continues assertion that Saturday's violence was fueled by anarchists</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City officials speaking at a press conference Monday afternoon continued to assert that the Saturday demonstration was hijacked by people from local areas and outside of the state. The 44 people who police arrested Saturday were all from Western Pennsylvania, but officials said they intend to make more arrests.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police Chief Scott Schubert did not place blame on any single organization, but he said they are looking into whether the rioters were anarchists or associated with antifa.</p>
<p>Wendell Hissrich, the city’s public safety director, said investigators had strong intelligence from federal agencies that pointed to the groups responsible for starting riots, but they have not reached any conclusions.</p>
<p>“I don't think we have yet a firm knowledge as to whether or not the individuals here are associated to the groups,” he said. “We're making that assumption, but we're too early into the investigation to determine that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich said police were looking at video to examine the way the rioters were dressed, how they operated and the type of weapons they used. He said he hopes <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/01/pittsburgh-riots-protests-Brian-bartels-police-car-SUV-fire-george-floyd/stories/202006010073" target="_blank">Brian J. Bartels</a> — &nbsp;a 20-year-old Shaler man who police allege was the catalyst in a protest that turned violent outside PPG Paints Arena —&nbsp;will be able to provide some insight to investigators.</p>
<p>The city has set up a tip line for business owners or other people who may have information, photos or video that could help lead to arrests. The number is 412-323-7800.</p>
<p>Although authorities made as many quick arrests as they could, Mr. Hissrich said, a full investigation into the violence and damage from Saturday could take months or even years.</p>
<p>The actions from those who rioted in Pittsburgh were similar to what authorities saw from those who caused violence and destruction in other cities, according to officials.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto said he has talked to mayors in cities across the country who have all seen a parallel pattern of behavior throughout the recent protests.</p>
<p>“When I talk to mayors across this country, the same thing is happening in city after city,” Mr. Peduto said. “This group are anarchists, and their mission is destruction. It is part of their mission: chaos and destruction. To just throw the table over for the sake of throwing the table over.”</p>
<p>The mayor and Chief Schubert defended the police response to the Saturday protest against critics who claimed the city was unprepared for what happened or that officers went too far when attempting to quell the unrest.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said police had reason to believe that after the police vehicle was burned on Centre Avenue, some of the rioters were heading to the Zone 2 police station a few blocks away to burn down the building.</p>
<p>“As we were sitting there, and watching that patrol car burn, they were already marching up Centre Avenue to burn Zone 2 – to burn a police station to the ground,” Mr. Peduto said. “And they were stopped by Pittsburgh police taking proactive measures to turn them back.”</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said business owners who felt like officers should have done more to protect their shops should recognize the fact that police stopped rioters from burning down buildings like in many other cities. He also added that there were no complaints of police brutality and no one was seriously injured.</p>
<p>Asked about information the city had regarding the destruction the rioters intended to cause, Mr. Hissrich declined to provide specifics.</p>
<p>“The investigation is revealing some concerning information,” he said. “As we go through some of the locations, we're finding evidence that is concerning, and I'll leave it at that.”</p>
<p>Officers did not put on riot gear until the crowd became unruly, according to officials.</p>
<p>Chief Schubert said mounted units ended up going through the crowd because they had to flee the area when they were attacked by people throwing objects and hitting them with a stop sign.</p>
<p>Responding to the rumor that authorities intentionally left the police vehicle that was burned in front of PPG Paints Arena, the chief said “Are you kidding me? We're going to put cars so you can torch them and cause more issues? Absolutely not.”</p>
<p>Chief Schubert said police used tear gas and rubber bullets only after people in the crowd threw rocks, bricks, cans and other objects at officers.</p>
<p>“Not just throwing [objects],” he said. “Going and throwing it, retreating, and coming back and doing it again. Those officers were doing whatever they could to protect themselves.”</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/01/joey-porter-sheraden-bud-dupree-t-j-watt-steelers/stories/202006010081" target="_blank">a separate event in Sheraden on Monday</a>, Mr. Peduto said white Pittsburghers need to join the chorus speaking out against racial injustice.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of hate right now," he said. "Some of it is rightful. Some of it is being directed toward where injustice exists. It’s not enough that the voices that are speaking up are only coming from our black neighbors. Our white neighbors have to stand up as well. We have to recognize our neighbors are hurt and rightfully so – about betrayals, about abuse, about brutality, about the justice in the street and the justice in the court room, about the application to a university and an application to a job."</p>
