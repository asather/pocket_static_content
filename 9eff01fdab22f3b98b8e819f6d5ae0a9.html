<h1>Takeout cocktails approved for Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To paraphrase the wit and words of Benjamin Franklin, in wine there is wisdom, in beer there is freedom, and — beginning today across Poor Richard’s historically stodgy commonwealth — in plastic vessels there are mixed drinks to go.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf signed into law Thursday afternoon Pennsylvania House Bill 327, an overwhelmingly approved bipartisan bill allowing bars and restaurants to sell cocktails to-go on a temporary basis, for the first time in the history of the state with notoriously strict liquor laws.</p>

<p>Over the course of the past two months, bar owner Spencer Warren has spearheaded the preparation and distribution of over 8,000 meals for unemployed service industry workers, hospital staff, 412 Food Rescue and veterans. What he had not done, until Thursday, was make and sell a single cocktail.</p>
<p>Mr. Warren, who is co-owner of The Warren Bar &amp; Burrow in the Cultural District, Downtown, was ready before the ink from the Governor’s pen had dried, a sentiment shared by numerous purveyors.</p>
<p>“The minute he signs it we will be ready for it,” he said, noting that he’s spoken with a bar owner friend in Ohio that said to-go cocktails in that state have been so popular during in the post-pandemic world, that he was able to hire back some staff.</p>
<p>Mr. Warren started purchasing packaging, mixers and experimenting with how it would work.</p>
<p>The law stipulates that “Only hotel and restaurant license holders who have lost at least 25% of their average monthly sales because of the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 emergency declaration and who are offering meals to go may sell prepared beverages and mixed drinks to go.”</p>
<p>Consumers do not need to purchase a meal, however. The drinks must be served in sealed containers and cannot be consumed on the premises. They can be no smaller than 4 oz. and no larger than 64 oz., but there is no limit on the number of cocktails an individual can purchase. Sales are prohibited after 11 p.m.</p>
