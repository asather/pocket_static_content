<h1>Steelers limiting ticket sales due to potential social distancing guidelines </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the Steelers put individual game tickets up for sale Friday, they limited the number available due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Steelers spokesman Burt Lauten said the team held back 50% of the tickets that were made available in an effort to plan for potential social distancing guidelines that could be in place for NFL games later in the year.</p>
<p>If there is not a need for social distancing, the Steelers will put the tickets that were held back on sale at a later date. The team previously said it would refund fans who purchased tickets through the team if games are canceled or played without spectators.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The NFL has operated as if the 2020 season will go off as normal, but the league sent a memo to teams earlier this month asking them not to speculate on contingency plans that could arise due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the schedule was built in such a way that games could be postponed or canceled and the playoffs pushed back. News of teams such as the Steelers limiting ticket sales for potential social distancing guidelines is another sign there are plans for games to be played at less than full capacity.</p>
<p>The deadline for renewing season tickets is June 1. The team's original deadline for renewals was May 1, but that was pushed back due to the pandemic. The Steelers are asking those with ticket renewal questions to email atSTH@steelers.com or call 412-785-7773.</p>
<p>The Steelers are scheduled to play their first home preseason game Aug. 14 against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers at Heinz Field. They open their regular-season home schedule Sept. 20 against the Denver Broncos.</p>
