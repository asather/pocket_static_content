<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council approved a measure that moves forward a Shadyside development and deferred other bills as the body met remotely&nbsp;Tuesday and Wednesday in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Members unanimously approved a new zoning designation that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/11/Council-gives-nod-of-approval-to-Shakespeare-Giant-Eagle-development/stories/202003110135" target="_blank">allows residential development to occur at the Shakespeare Giant Eagle site in Shadyside</a>, where 250 residential units, a parking garage and a downsized version of the grocery store are planned.</p>
<p>The body worked through background noise and inadvertently talking over each other as eight of the members joined by conference call Tuesday. Only the meeting chair — Council President Theresa Kail-Smith on Tuesday, and Finance and Law Committee Chair Daniel Lavelle on Wednesday -— joined City Clerk Brenda Pree, her assistant and a police officer in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/16/City-Council-Chambers-closed-public-urged-to-issue-comment-via-email-mail-or-drop-box/stories/202003160079" target="_blank">closed Council Chambers</a>.</p>
<p>Members of the public have been instructed to send public comment to&nbsp;cityclerksoffice@pittsburghpa.gov&nbsp;or by U.S. mail.</p>
<p>Council held <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/10/Burgess-Lavelle-propose-creation-of-city-Commission-on-Racial-Equity/stories/202003100089" target="_blank">a resolution to adopt&nbsp;“10 commitments to racial equity”</a> for three weeks and a reptile regulation bill for four weeks. The bills are respectively sponsored by Councilmen Lavelle and Rickey Burgess, and Councilman Bruce Kraus. The reptile bill has potential implications for the Pittsburgh Zoo &amp; PPG Aquarium, which has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/04/Kraus-Pittsburgh-Zoo-reptile-crocodilian-gharial-red-eared-slider-turtles-regulations-ordinance-darlane-harris/stories/202003040129" target="_blank">asked council for an exemption from the proposal</a>.</p>
<p>Members also sent a Peduto administration proposal to eliminate an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/09/Pittsburgh-Peduto-zoning-eliminating-off-street-parking-requirements-single-family-rowhouse/stories/202003090107" target="_blank">off-street parking requirement on new single-family rowhouse development</a> to the Planning Commission.</p>
<p>No city directors or other staff were called for questioning during Wednesday’s standing committee.</p>
<p>Council’s regular meeting will be held at 10 a.m. on March 24 under the same conditions, with the standing committee meeting immediately to follow.</p>
