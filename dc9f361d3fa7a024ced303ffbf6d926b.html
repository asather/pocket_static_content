<h1>Penn State's Shane Simmons eager to add to his 'story' in fifth year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State defensive end Shane Simmons wasn’t alive when singers Faith Evans and Mary J. Blige joined late rapper Notorious B.I.G. on one of the most famous tracks from his debut album.</p>
<p>Even though he wasn’t born when the song was released in 1994, the 23-year-old from Hyattsville, Md., can relate to the chorus because he also wants “One More Chance.”</p>
<p>The injury bug bit Simmons after a promising redshirt freshman year. But the fifth-year athlete is hoping to cash in his own last opportunity to play at Beaver Stadium.</p>
<p>“It’s a really important year for me,” Simmons said Wednesday. “I just graduated. I have the degree out of the way now. I can mainly focus on football.”</p>
<p>Simmons came to Penn State as a lauded recruit (four stars according to Rivals) in 2016. That same year, ESPN tabbed Simmons as the top prospect in Maryland.</p>
<p>It appeared Simmons would quickly live up to the acclaim. The Nittany Lions went 11-2 in 2017, with Simmons playing in all 13 games, including the Fiesta Bowl win against Washington.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had 15 total tackles and a sack that season.&nbsp;Since then, Simmons has amassed just 28 tackles — and no sacks.</p>
<p>“I started off as a huge recruit and stuff, high expectations,” the 6-3, 244-pounder said. “I had a pretty good redshirt freshman year, and then all that other stuff popped up. I’ve been working and battling through all that.”</p>
<p>After that season came a foot injury that set back Simmons significantly. He missed the first five games of 2018. Last season, he played in all 13 games but saw minimal playing time, getting lost in a group that included Yetur Gross-Matos, Shareef Miller and classmate Shaka Toney.</p>
<p>“I’ve been working and battling through all of the adversity,” Simmons said. “It’s not what I planned, but the story isn’t finished yet. I still believe that I can leave my mark at Penn State.”</p>
<p>Gross-Matos and Miller are in the NFL, but the path isn’t quite open for Simmons to automatically start. Adisa Isaac and Jayson Oweh are younger guys who are looking to move up the depth chart. Simmons is looking forward to the competition.</p>
<p>“Both of them are NFL-caliber players,” he said. “They’re really fast. They’re probably the fastest defensive ends that I’ve seen up close and played with. They’re strong and smart, both of them.”</p>
<p>Like many, Simmons is back home waiting for details about the 2020 season. When the games begin, he has hopes of being “a good leader” for the Nittany Lions and ending his Penn State career on a high note.</p>
<p>“I think I can help out a lot in the run game, too,” Simmons said. “Working on my pass rush and trusting myself again, I think anything is possible for me and ... you will see great things from me in the fall.”</p>
