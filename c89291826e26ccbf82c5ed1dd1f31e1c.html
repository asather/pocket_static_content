<h1>'Rejuvenated' Mike McCarthy goes from Greenfield to Green Bay to the Cowboys</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>INDIANAPOLIS — It felt a little bit like a circus when Mike McCarthy stepped to the podium Wednesday at the NFL combine, his first as the Dallas Cowboys head coach, only there were no trapeze artists or jugglers or tightrope walkers. Just writers from Green Bay to Texas peppering McCarthy with questions about his year away from professional football, his expectations in his new job and what’s next for the team Jerry Jones and company will assemble for him.</p>
<p>Seemingly every answer was followed by a cacophony of voices trying to get the next one. At one point, a reporter’s phone rang, then started playing a video that was loud enough for McCarthy to hear “this is Dallas Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy” interrupting him from the audience.</p>
<p>“We can just go one at a time,” he told a few people talking over each other as he chuckled. “I’m not in a hurry.”</p>
<p>From Greenfield to Green Bay, and now from “yinz” to “y’all,” the kid who grew up a Steelers fan is the next hope for his hometown team’s old rival. The Cowboys hired McCarthy in January, a little more than a year removed from the Packers firing him after 13 seasons and one Super Bowl victory against the Steelers.</p>
<p>As he settled in behind the microphone, McCarthy made it clear that it’s good to be back.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d never say this, but it’s good to see everybody here,” he joked. “I always looked at this day as Groundhog’s Day, but now I no longer do.”</p>
<p>McCarthy has plenty of work ahead of him, doing his best to get the most out of a Cowboys roster that’s stocked with high-end talent but finished 8-8 and out of the postseason last year. That was the end of coach Jason Garrett in Dallas but represents a fresh beginning for McCarthy, who spent 2019 in something of a no-man’s land.</p>
<p>A media member from Green Bay asked if it was a particularly difficult time for McCarthy, who’d been in the NFL for 26 consecutive seasons since his time as an assistant coach at Pitt ended in 1992. Until last year.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think it was difficult at all. … It’s part of it,” McCarthy said of still living in town and driving past Lambeau Field every day. “That’s where my kids were born, that’s their hometown, so really, the year off was very beneficial for us as a family.</p>
<p>“I have great memories and positive thoughts about my time there. I’m thankful for not only the opportunity to coach there but the relationships that I will always have. I have a lot of close friends who still work for the Packers, and the community we live in there will always be a part of our family.”</p>
<p>Now, it’s full speed ahead with the likes of quarterback Dak Prescott, running back Ezekiel Elliott and a fan base that craves success as much as any in the NFL. That is, if Prescott avoids free agency and returns to Dallas, along with wide receiver Amari Cooper and a slew of others who were top topics for McCarthy’s news conference.</p>
<p>McCarthy is one of three new head coaches in the NFC East, a division where Washington hired Ron Rivera and the New York Giants are turning to longtime New England special teams assistant Joe Judge. Fresh off his first Super Bowl championship, Kansas City coach Andy Reid called McCarthy “good for the National Football League.”</p>
<p>“I have a ton of respect for Mike,” Reid said Tuesday. “When he was out of football, he kind of recharged by going back and looking at all the things he could do or do better and analyzing himself and the game and where he wanted to go to once he became the Cowboys coach or whoever was going to hire him.”</p>
<p>It’s fitting that Reid would put it that way, because McCarthy himself, 56, poked fun at the idea of being full of energy again as he transitions from one storied franchise to another.</p>
<p>“I’m trying to say that I’m rejuvenated, and give you some energy there,” McCarthy grinned. “That’s what my media coaches told me, that I don’t have. I’ve had a year off. I think like anything in life, if you have a chance to step back, reflect … that’s all been part of the process that I went through leading up to getting the job in Dallas.”</p>
<p>He just hasn’t had any time to stop and reflect since he’s been there. Too many questions to answer.</p>
