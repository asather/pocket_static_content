<h1>White House lawyers to begin arguments in Trump impeachment trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Lawyers for President Donald Trump plan to discuss former Vice President Joe Biden and his son’s involvement in Ukraine in their arguments before the U.S. Senate, which are scheduled to begin on Saturday.</p>
<p>Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, told reporters on Friday the White House defense strategy will also include a discussion of Democratic efforts to dig up dirt on Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign.</p>
<p>Mr. Sekulow suggested the defense will have much to say about Mr. Biden’s son, Hunter Biden, who sat on the board of a Ukrainian energy company, Burisma, while his father called for the resignation of an anti-corruption official that had targeted the company.</p>
<p>Mr. Sekulow said House Democrats — by saying for days that Mr. Trump was motivated by debunked conspiracy theories — “not only opened the door, but kicked down the door” for the White House to make Hunter Biden and Burisma part of their arguments.</p>
<p>"Here's what the evidence says: There was foreign involvement, but let's not forget where it originated," said Jay Sekulow, counsel to the president, told reporters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven't put our case out, obviously,” Mr. Sekulow said. “But you should be able to get a sense, from what I'm saying right now.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s defense opens a day after House Democrats concluded nearly 24 hours of arguments on the Senate floor.</p>
<p>Democrats have argued that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid and withholding a coveted White House meeting in an attempt to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on Mr. Biden, an opponent in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>The White House is expected to have shorter presentations than the Democrats. Saturday’s session is scheduled to last just three hours, from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>“I did an oral argument in the Supreme Court once where my argument was eight minutes — worked out pretty well,” Mr. Sekulow said Friday. “Sometimes, less is more.”</p>
