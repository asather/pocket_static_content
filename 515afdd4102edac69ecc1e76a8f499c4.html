<h1>Police seek suspect accused of vandalizing East Liberty bank during June 1 protests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A task force investigating protests that turned violent on May 31 and June 1 is asking for the public’s help in identifying a male it says vandalized a Dollar Bank on Penn Avenue in Pittsburgh’s East Liberty neighborhood.</p>
<p>Police said the suspect was wearing a black zip up jacket with the hood up, a bandana around his mouth and nose, jeans, a Puma cross-body bag, and what appear to be Timberland boots.</p>
<p>He is also carrying a wrench and wearing two different gloves. On his right hand, a glove with the Penn State Nittany Lion logo, while on his left, a gardening glove.</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact the task force at DAAT@Pittsburghpa.gov, or call 412-323-7800. Contributors will remain anonymous.</p>
<p>The city’s public safety department said the Damage Assessment and Accountability Task Force, which is made up of local, state and federal agencies, continues to analyze video and photos to identify individuals “who committed criminal acts during the primarily peaceful demonstrations.”</p>
