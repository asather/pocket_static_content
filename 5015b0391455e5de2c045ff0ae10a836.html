<h1>Phyllis Lyon, famed LGBTQ activist, dies at 95</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Activist Phyllis Lyon, who spent more than 50 years fighting for LGBTQ rights, died of natural causes early Thursday. She was 95.</p>
<p>California Gov. Gavin Newsom shared the news of Lyon's death in a post on Twitter on Thursday, calling her a "dear friend."</p>
<p>When Newsom served as mayor of San Francisco, he officiated the wedding between Lyon and her late partner, Del Martin, in 2008.</p>
<p>In 2004, San Francisco officials allowed gay couples in the city to wed, prompting a flood of applicants to the City Hall clerk's office. The officials chose Lyon, then 80, and Martin, then 83, to take the first vows.</p>
<p>Those unions were voided by California's Supreme Court until 2008, when it struck down the state's ban on same-sex marriage. The ruling paved the way for same-sex couples to marry in the state -- and Lyon and Martin chose to get remarried.</p>
<p>"Phyllis—it was the honor of a lifetime to marry you &amp; Del," Newsom wrote in the tweet, which was accompanied by a video of the two of them. "Your courage changed the course of history."</p>
<p>Lyon and Martin, who passed away in 2008, first met back in 1950. Together, they were pioneers in fighting for same-sex marriage in California.</p>
<p>The couple founded the Daughters of Bilitis -- the first lesbian rights organization in the US -- in 1955.</p>
<p>Both are considered champions of the LGBTQ rights movement.</p>
<p>“Their example of fortitude and perseverance is one that should inspire us now as we face a different kind of battle for our lives,” said Eric Marcus, the creator and host of the popular “Making Gay History” podcast who interviewed the couple in 1989.</p>
<p>Lyon died of natural causes, California state Sen. Scott Weiner, who is chairman of the LGBTQ caucus, confirmed in a tweet.</p>
<p>"We lost a giant today," Weiner wrote. "Phyllis Lyon fought for #LGBT equality when it was neither safe nor popular to do so. Phyllis &amp; her wife Del played a crucial role winning the rights &amp; dignity our community now enjoys. We owe Phyllis intense gratitude &amp; love for her work."</p>
<p>Dianne Feinstein, the longtime Democratic senator from California, released a statement celebrating the life and legacy of the iconic LGBTQ activist, “a real power, not only for San Francisco but for the country.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sad at the passing of Phyllis Lyon, a trailblazer, a fearless activist and a good friend. She left an indelible mark on San Francisco,” wrote the senator, who served as the city’s first female mayor.</p>
<p>Kate Kendall, former executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said she will miss Lyon.</p>
<p>"She and Del are dancing again," she wrote on Twitter. "I will miss her so much."</p>
