<h1>Polamalu joins Steelers greats in Pro Football Hall of Fame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Troy Polamalu, whose flowing hair and freelancing style turned him into a two-time Super Bowl-winning safety who made spectacular highlight-film plays, was elected into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on his first attempt on Saturday —&nbsp;becoming the ninth former member of the Steelers to be a first-ballot selection.</p>
<p>However, Polamalu’s former teammate, guard Alan Faneca, was not one of the five players selected for induction. It was Faneca’s fifth time as one of 15 finalists for the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>“Honestly this is surreal,” Polamalu said in an interview with Steelers.com. “I really feel surreal. But for all my teammates, it’s truly a tribute to them. I feel honored and unworthy to be honest.”</p>
<p>“To see him cry and actually see him happy about it, it did something to me,” said former teammate and safety partner Ryan Clark, who was with Polamalu in Miami for the announcement. “The first time I ever heard him say Hall of Fame was when he called and asked me if I would be there. To see him accept it that way, it was truly a great feeling. I think we all knew he’d get in. It’s another thing to see it happen.”</p>
<p>Polamalu will join his former coach, Bill Cowher, for induction on Aug. 8 in Canton, Ohio, creating what is expected to be a heavy Steelers presence for the three days of festivities. Cowher was selected as one of two former coaches as part of the Centennial Class of 2020.</p>
<p>In addition, Steelers president Art Rooney II has said he expects the league to schedule the Steelers for the Hall of Fame game on Aug. 6.</p>
<p>“It’s really an honor,” Polamalu said. “It might be the first time a coach and player he drafted have gone in together.”</p>
<p>Polamalu becomes the 27th member of the Steelers to be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Former Steelers safety Donnie Shell, who started on two Super Bowl teams in the 1970s and finished his 11-year career with 51 interceptions, is also part of the Centennial Class of 2020. However, Shell’s induction ceremony will not take place in Canton until Sept. 16-19 when the Centennial Celebration is held.</p>
<p>Polamalu, the 2010 NFL defensive player of the year who was named to the league’s 2000s All-Decade team, joins Joe Greene, Jack Ham, Mel Blount, Terry Bradshaw, Franco Harris, Jack Lambert, Chuck Noll and Rod Woodson as former Steelers who were selected for induction on their first attempt.</p>
<p>In addition to helping the Steelers win Super Bowls in 2005 and 2008, Polamalu was also a four-time All-Pro and eight-time Pro Bowl selection. While he had only 32 career interceptions in 12 seasons —&nbsp;170 players in NFL history had more —&nbsp;it was his disruptive, instinctive style that showcased his special talent and turned him into a defensive phenomenon.</p>
<p>“He would just say he was one of 11 guys on the field,” said former Steelers secondary coach Ray Horton. “Yes he was, but he was probably the most valuable of those 11 guys on the field.”</p>
<p>Polamalu was nicknamed “The Tasmanian Devil” by former teammate Chris Hope because of the frenetic manner in which he bounced around the field, surprising quarterbacks with leaping tackles over the line of scrimmage and making diving one-handed interceptions.</p>
<p>Former defensive coordinator Dick LeBeau, who is also in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, said Polamalu made plays with what he called “diagnostic intuition.”</p>
<p>“I was impressed with how quick he could react,” LeBeau said. “I had coached Carnell Lake…. Carnell was a great safety and could do so many things. The first time I saw Troy, I said, ‘Get out the old Carnell Lake stuff. We got another guy who could do it.’”</p>
<p>But Polamalu is probably best remembered for two plays in particular, both against division-rival Baltimore Ravens. The first came in the 2008 AFC Championship game at Heinz Field when he intercepted quarterback Joe Flacco and returned the pick 40 yards for a touchdown with 4:34 remaining, weaving his way through a host of Ravens players before squeezing into the end zone to secure a 23-14 victory.</p>
<p>The other came in December, 2010 at M&amp;T Bank Stadium when, with 3:13 remaining, Polamalu sacked Flacco and forced a fumble that LaMarr Woodley returned 18 yards to the Ravens 10, setting up the winning touchdown. The victory allowed the Steelers to win the division title and eventually send them to the Super Bowl for the third time in six years.</p>
<p>“His movement and his ability to play in traffic was just as good as his ability to play in space,” said Steelers general manager Kevin Colbert. “It did allow coach LeBeau and coach Cowher and then coach Tomlin, when Mike took over, the ability to do some different things because he was so unique. But beyond that, Troy would do some things on his own that weren’t scripted by the defense.”</p>
<p>Since his retirement in 2014, Polamalu has been strangely distant from the Steelers, failing to appear for any of their reunion events or celebrations. His absence has sparked whispers of discontent with the organization, though it has never been determined why he has stayed away.</p>
<p>But his popularity with his former teammates and fans has never waned, making him one of the all-time favorite players with a franchise loaded with Hall of Fame stars.</p>
<p>“He’s intelligent, he did things the right way,” Clark said. “Hall of Fame people should be acknowledged that way. Troy did it the right way. I’m not necessary surprised, I expected him to make it. Still, it’s great honor to see him get something he richly deserves.”</p>
