<h1>Steelers place Zach Banner on IR, sign Jerald Hawkins to 53-man roster </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers placed Zach Banner on injured reserve Wednesday and signed tackle Jerald Hawkins to take his place on the 53-man roster. Banner tore the ACL in his right knee in the season opener against the Giants on Monday night and won’t play again this season.</p>
<p>Hawkins, a fourth-round pick of the Steelers in 2016, was traded to the Buccaneers last summer. He was signed off the Texans’ practice squad.</p>
<p>Chukwuma Okorafor will start in place of Banner against the Broncos on Sunday afternoon at Heinz Field and Hawkins is likely to dress and be the swing tackle.</p>
<p>Hawkins has dressed for six games in his career, including five with the Steelers. He made one start in 2017.</p>
<p>The Steelers have Jarron Jones and Anthony Coyle on the practice squad, but they declined to sign them to the 53-man roster. Derwin Gray, who played tackle at Maryland, was one of four players the Steelers protected on their practice squad this week. Gray has been playing mostly guard with the Steelers.</p>
<p>The Steelers also protected defensive lineman Henry Mondeaux, running back Wendell Smallwood and outside linebacker Jayrone Elliott.</p>
<p>Safety Curtis Riley, who began the season on the practice squad, was signed to the Cardinals’ 53-man roster.</p>
<p><strong>Injury report</strong></p>
<p>Ten Steelers did not practice on Wednesday, including four offensive linemen. Stefen Wisniewski (chest) and David DeCastro (knee) sat out with injuries while left tackle Alejandro Villanueva missed with an illness and center Maurkice Pouncey was given a veteran’s day off.</p>
<p>Wisniewski, who started in place of DeCastro against the Giants, injured his chest during the game.</p>
<p>Also missing with injuries were: receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster (knee) and Diontae Johnson (toe), running back James Conner (ankle) and defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt (Achilles’).</p>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger also was given a veteran’s day off.</p>
