<h1>Empty surgical waiting rooms prompt furloughs at Indiana, Mon Valley hospitals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two community hospitals in the region furloughed hundreds of employees after the COVID-19-related shutdown of non-emergency operations emptied doctors’ office waiting rooms.</p>
<p>Indiana Regional Medical Center furloughed 200 employees through the end of May to “adjust staffing levels to match the current demand” for medical care, according to a prepared statement from the 166-bed Indiana County hospital.</p>
<p>Since Gov. Tom Wolf issued stay-at-home orders in March, the hospital has seen a 48% drop in patient admissions, 59% decrease in outpatient testing and a 58% decrease in surgeries.</p>
<p>“This was one of the most difficult decisions we’ve had to make in many years,” CEO Steve Wolfe said in a statement. “But we have to make changes in order to sustain operations and remain an independent health care provider in this current environment.”</p>
<p>The sharp decrease in patient volume and revenue also prompted IRMC to withdraw its final contract offer to about 380 unionized nurses, who have been without a labor agreement since Oct. 31, 2018. The layoff affects about 30 registered nurses, according to Annie Briscoe, spokeswoman for PSEA-Healthcare, a division of the Pennsylvania State Education Association.</p>
<p>No new contacts were scheduled, said Ms. Briscoe. IRMC nurses are represented by the Indiana Registered Nurses Association, which is an affiliate of PSEA-Healthcare.</p>
<p>At Monongahela Valley Hospital in Washington County, 100 employees or about 10% of the staff was furloughed due to government-ordered travel restrictions and shutdown of non-emergency surgeries.</p>
<p>Such surgeries generally account for a bigger share of revenue than inpatient care at community hospitals, according to a new survey by the Healthcare Council of Western Pennsylvania, a Warrendale-based trade group.</p>
<p>Mon Valley has 200 licensed inpatient beds and 60 of the furloughs were from the hospital’s Center for Fitness and Health in Belle Vernon, hospital CEO Lou Panza said.</p>
<p>“Our expectation is we’re calling everybody back. I want to see everybody back to work as soon as possible,” Mr. Panza said.&nbsp;“It’ll be based on patient volume.”</p>
<p>One sign that things may be changing: on Tuesday, Mon Valley had its busiest emergency room day in six weeks, Mr. Panza said.</p>
<p>Both Indiana Regional Medical Center and Mon Valley recently received low-interest loans from the state’s new Hospital Emergency Loan Program.</p>
<p>IRMC received $10 million, Mon Valley, $15 million at an interest rate of 0.5% for costs incurred between March 1 and Sept. 1.</p>
