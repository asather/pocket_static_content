<h1>Freshman Rodney Gallagher makes free throws to give Laurel Highlands WPIAL title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fifty-two years of futility was all riding on the shoulders of, get this: A 15-year-old ninth-grader.</p>
<p>Laurel Highlands freshman phenom Rodney Gallagher stepped to the free-throw line with 4.8 seconds left Friday night with the WPIAL Class 5A championship on the line. His team trailed Mars by a point.</p>
<p>Take the ball. Close the eyes. Open them. Dribble once. Dribble twice. Swish.</p>
<p>Take the ball again. Dribble once. Dribble twice. Swish.</p>
<p>Gallagher, with the poise and coolness of a seasoned senior, made both free throws and the many Laurel Highlands fans in Petersen Events Center were screaming and celebrating a few seconds later after Mars missed a final shot and Laurel Highlands won, 52-51.</p>
<p>Laurel Highlands (17-8) was a WPIAL champ. The previous time that was said was 1968. And the kid who drove the Mustangs to the title isn’t old enough for a drivers learner’s permit yet. Gallagher, a 6-foot guard, scored 24 points and made the two free throws that were the biggest in Laurel Highlands history.</p>
<p>“I’m really not surprised, to be honest,” said Laurel Highlands coach Rick Hauger. “He’s been coming through in pressure situations all year.”</p>
<p>But there are pressure situations — and then there is a WPIAL championship pressure. But Gallagher averages 22 points a game, so his performance shouldn’t be shocking.</p>
<p>But a championship for Laurel Highlands is shocking when you consider the Mustangs’ many years of futility. And they won eight games only a year ago. This year, the Mustangs kept Mars from becoming only the 10th team in WPIAL history to win three consecutive titles.</p>
<p>“I can’t even explain it. This is just an insane feeling,” Gallagher said. “A school like ours that hasn’t won in so long, and then win this year, it’s just an unbelievable feeling.”</p>
<p>Gallagher made 9 of 22 shots from the field. Laurel Highlands also got 12 points from senior guard Keandre Cook and 8 points and 13 rebounds from senior forward Tyvaughn Long.</p>
<p>Michael Carmody, Mars’ senior 6-foot-7, 290-pound center who averages 19 points and 19 rebounds, had 14 points and 17 rebounds. Sophomore forward Chris Dvorak also scored 14.</p>
<p>The last few minutes of the game were breathtaking. Mars (20-5) went on a 6-0 run to take a 49-48 lead, but Gallagher scored with 1:48 left to put the Mustangs ahead. Mars guard Mihali Sfanos scored with 27 seconds left to put Mars in front, 51-50, and Laurel Highlands gave the ball back when Cook was called for a charge on Carmody with 13.9 seconds left.</p>
<p>Zach Schlegel, one of Mars’ best free-throw shooters, was fouled with 12.4 seconds left and missed the one-and-one. Gallagher hurried up the court and was fouled by Schlegel on the right wing while driving to the basket with 4.8 seconds to go.</p>
<p>“I knew they were going to double-team me and I tried to get to my right,” Gallagher said. “I was going to go at Carmody, but he moved and then they bumped me.”</p>
<p>After Gallagher’s free throws, Mars called a timeout. Sfanos took the inbounds pass and got all the way into the lane, but his floater bounced away and Laurel Highlands was champion. Carmody kicked the ball down the court in frustration.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t have wanted a better shot,” said Mars coach Rob Carmody, Michael’s father. “I told him he could get all the way to the rim and he did. It just didn’t go in.”</p>
<p>“This is like a dream,” said Hauger, a former Laurel Highlands player. “To come this far, this fast. I’m so happy for the seniors because of the time they invested and because they kind of let Rodney be the leader. And Rodney did it well.”</p>
<p>Both teams will be in the PIAA playoffs next weekend. Laurel Highlands will play York Suburban (21-7), the No. 9 team from District 3 (Harrisburg area). Mars will play Elizabethtown (19-9), the No. 7 team from District 3.</p>
