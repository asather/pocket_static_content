<h1>State won't overhaul Medicaid transportation program following study</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State officials will not award a statewide brokerage contract and will continue to study how to best administer an assistance program that aids low-income Pennsylvanians who need non-emergency medical transportation, at least in the short-term.</p>
<p>What would have been a potentially sweeping change was halted last year after state legislators, advocates, and local county officials raised concerns and said the issue needed further study before a contract was awarded.</p>
<p>The Medical Assistance Transportation Program serves low-income participants in the state's Medicaid program and provides non-emergency transportation for medical-related travel such as trips to doctor’s appointments.</p>
<p>Currently, the state's 67 counties operate the program in a variety of ways — some providing transportation directly, some through hired vendors, and some through a hybrid system.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania's Department of Human Services <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2019/04/18/Transportation-program-changes-worry-rural-Pennsylvania-officials/stories/201904170105" target="_blank">had planned to contract with a brokerage firm to negotiate with transportation networks and manage call centers to provide the service</a>.</p>
<p>But a bipartisan group of legislators said they feared the proposed change would hurt constituents, particularly those living in rural areas, and inserted legislation<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2019/07/08/transportation-assistance-program-pennsylvania-study-before-changes/stories/201907050077?cid=search" target="_blank"> into a human services bill last year to require a study of any systemwide overhaul</a>.</p>
<p>The study concluded the program serves “a mix of low-income, medically needy, and aged populations” who would be harmed if the current system is disrupted. Those who use the program are generally satisfied with how it is administered today, the study concluded.</p>
<p>“This is a public good ... that should remain in the public hands,” said Chris Sandvig, director of policy at advocacy organization Pittsburgh Community Reinvestment Group, summarizing the results of the analysis. “DHS recognizes it has a pretty efficient program already.”</p>
<p>The study also said it would be difficult to extrapolate the experiences of other states onto Pennsylvania because every state has such flexibility in how programs are run.</p>
<p>A switch to a broker model could save the state money, though that could come at a cost to county transportation budgets, according to the analysis, which was performed by the departments of human services, transportation, and aging, and submitted to the Legislature at the end of December.</p>
<p>“They pointed out a lot of things that we had identified all along,” that counties were concerned about, said Brinda Penyak, deputy director of the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“The Medical Assistance Transportation Program is a vital resource for people who would otherwise not be able to access transportation to their physician, pharmacy, dentist, or other necessary services,” said Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller in a statement. “We want to be sure we are choosing the correct path forward so we can guarantee MATP’s sustainability and consistency for years to come.”</p>
