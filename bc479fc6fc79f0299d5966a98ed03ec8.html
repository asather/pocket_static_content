<h1>Review: At the Pittsburgh Symphony, violinist dances a 'polar bear polonaise' with spirit </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Classical music — like most music — is about communicating emotions. A symphony or a concerto may tell a specific, detailed story, but it’s not essential to know what that tale might be to enjoy the feelings conjured by some Sibelius or some Ravel.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Sibelius Violin Concerto. The first movement opens with a shivering, oscillating pattern in the strings before the violin soloist begins a keening, plaintive cry, leading listeners to extreme depths of pathos and heights of ecstasy.&nbsp;On Friday night at Heinz Hall, violinist Ray Chen joined the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and guest conductor Vasily Petrenko in Sibelius’ sweeping concerto, demonstrating a stirring sense of drama throughout the work.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen stood out in the first two movements in particular for his artistry, decisive yet long-form phrases building to peak after peak in a gripping account of the work. I remarked on a bit of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2017/10/14/Violinist-plays-power-packed-Bruch-with-PSO-Violinist-Ray-Chen/stories/201710140087" target="_blank">tightness in some of Mr. Chen’s slower passages</a>&nbsp;when he last appeared with the PSO in 2017,&nbsp;but this was not the case on Friday. Rather, in the final movement of the Sibelius, famously referred to as a&nbsp;“polonaise for polar bears” by a highly regarded musicologist (a polonaise being a form of Polish dance), Mr. Chen rushed some of the more technical passages, and his intonation (tuning) was not always clean. Still, his spirited delivery more than made up for such minor foibles. A strong, soulful performance like Mr. Chen’s is always preferable to a note-perfect, uninspired interpretation.</p>
<p>The orchestra delivered the remainder of the program, Ravel’s Suites Nos. 1 and 2 from&nbsp;“Daphnis et Chloe” and Elgar’s&nbsp;“Cockaigne” Overture, with similar aplomb. In the Ravel, strings stood out in transparent, delicate passes, while brass and winds helped land the finale with a fulfilling sense of weight and grandeur.&nbsp;Mr. Petrenko, the conductor, fared best with this music. His Sibelius and Elgar sounded somewhat imprecise rhythmically, diluting some of the punch of the music with what looked like overly finicky baton work in some passages.</p>
<p>Finally, the Elgar. The “Cockaigne” was beautifully played but the music itself lacks depth. Elgar himself said of the piece&nbsp;“Here is nothing deep or melancholy — it is intended to be honest, healthy, humorous and strong but not vulgar.” Regular readers might be familiar with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2019/04/12/Review-Pittsburgh-Symphony-Orchestra-Slatkin-Ohlsson-Rachmaninoff-Elgar-Enigma/stories/201904120120" target="_blank">my distaste for the English composer</a>&nbsp;due to his particular style of melodic writing.&nbsp;This is another example of a work I’d happily replace on a program with something with more substance or better humor.&nbsp;To each their own.&nbsp;The overall effect of the evening was enchanting, including Mr. Chen’s lively banter and two encores, a Paganini caprice and a self-arranged take on&nbsp;“Waltzing Matilda,” the unofficial national anthem of Mr. Chen’s native Australia.</p>
