<h1>Steelers have shuffling to do after injury bug bites early</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the principal fears among NFL medical personnel is that shortened training camps and no preseason games would lead to more injuries early in the regular season. The Steelers discovered that in a harsh way in their opening game.</p>
<p>They lost two of their starting offensive linemen — one possibly for the season — and had running back James Conner leave the game in the second quarter with an ankle injury in Monday night’s 26-16 victory against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>The most significant injury was to right tackle Zach Banner, who tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his knee, according to NFL Network, and is expected to be placed on injured reserve. His injury means Chukwuma Okorafor, who was in a training-camp battle with Banner for the starting spot, will start there Sunday against the Denver Broncos. It also means the Steelers will have to add a backup tackle to their 53-man roster — perhaps former draft pick Jerald Hawkins, who was signed to the practice squad Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I’m extremely comfortable with Chuks and his ability to play and his overall readiness,” coach Mike Tomlin said.</p>
<p>The prognosis did not seem to be as gloomy for guard Stefen Wisniewski, who injured his pectoral muscle against the Giants and did not return. Typically, injuries to the pectoral muscle can often be season-ending, depending on the severity, but that did not seem to be the case with Wisniewski. He told team members after the game he was not feeling any discomfort with the injury.</p>
<p>Tomlin said the forecast for Wisniewski’s return, as well as Conner, “is a more favorable one” than the bleak outlook for Banner. But, because the Steelers have been without Pro Bowl guard David DeCastro (knee) for three weeks, it is likely they will have to add a guard from the practice squad, probably Derwin Gray, to fill in for Wisniewski.</p>
<p>If DeCastro and Wisniewski are unable to play in the home opener against the Broncos, Tomlin’s options at right guard are backup center J.C. Hassenauer or rookie guard Kevin Dotson, their fourth-round draft choice. Tomlin, though, doesn’t sound quite so comfortable with Dotson, who missed several weeks of training camp with a knee injury.</p>
<p>“He’s a young guy who hasn’t had a lot of work throughout this process because of injury and lack of availability,” Tomlin said. “There is some angst there. So if he is called upon this week, it is going to take a tremendous effort by him and by us.”</p>
<p><strong>On an island</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin said after the game he put his secondary in harm’s way when the Steelers made a concentrated effort to stop Giants running back Saquon Barkley.</p>
<p>What he meant was the defense stacked the line of scrimmage, often bringing nickel back Mike Hilton (who played 42 snaps, two more than linebacker Vince Williams) into the box, to keep Barkley from breaking any long runs. That left the secondary short-handed and in single coverage, allowing Giants receivers to run open in the middle of the field.</p>
<p>The commitment to gang up on Barkley worked: He finished with just six yards on 15 carries and never had a run longer than seven yards. The downside is quarterback Daniel Jones threw for 279 yards and two touchdowns and converted eight of 15 third-down chances, numbers that Tomlin admitted are “not winning football for us.”</p>
<p>A perfect example of putting the secondary in harm’s way occurred when Jones hit receiver Darius Slayton on a deep post for a 41-yard touchdown in the second quarter. Slayton got behind cornerback Steven Nelson and didn’t have any deep help because free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick came up to cover a crossing route by Engram.</p>
<p>Cornerback Joe Haden was supposed to get back and help on the play but arrived too late. Curiously, the touchdown came one play after Haden was called for pass interference against Engram on a third-and-12 play from the Giants 47, keeping alive a drive that began at the 25.</p>
<p><strong>First impression</strong></p>
<p>New punter Dustin Colquitt did not distinguish himself with his first attempt in a Steelers uniform, delivering a low 39-yard punt in the first quarter that Giants safety Jabrill Peppers returned 8 yards.</p>
<p>But not only did he acquit himself by following with punts of 59 and 50 yards, he did a nice job to deftly handle a low snap on Chris Boswell’s 36-yard field goal early in the fourth quarter. Colquitt averaged 45.8 yards on four punts, but Peppers returned three of them for 39 yards.</p>
<p>Colquitt tied Bryan Barker for 14th place in league history with 1,132 career punts.</p>
