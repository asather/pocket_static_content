<h1>PPG plans restructuring program to stem losses from COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PPG on Monday said it is implementing broad cost cuts, including voluntary employee buyouts, as it tries to recover from a severe economic downturn during the global pandemic.</p>
<p>The paint and coatings giant said sales in April dropped by about 35% compared with April 2019.</p>
<p>Sales in May improved slightly and were down less than 30%, PPG said.</p>
<p>The company is targeting $160 million to $170 million in annual pre-tax savings from its actions and expects savings of about $25 million to $35 million in 2020.</p>
<p>“These measures will enable the company to come out of the crisis with lower structural costs,” Michael McGarry, chairman and chief executive, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The actions will result in a restructuring charge in the second quarter of $160 million to $180 million pretax and $125 million to $140 million after-tax, or 52 cents to 58 cents per share.</p>
<p>Most of that cost is related to employee severance, PPG said.</p>
<p>Future restructuring costs of about $10 million will be incurred over future quarters.</p>
<p>In April, PPG said it had taken some immediate steps to cut costs in connection with the impact of COVID-19 including salary cuts for top executives, employee furloughs and deferred capital expenditures.</p>
<p>PPG said the voluntary separation packages were offered in the U.S. and Canada but did not specify how many employees were eligible or accepted the offer.</p>
<p>The company has 47,000 company employees worldwide and about 2,400 in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>It is scheduled to release second-quarter earnings in July.</p>
