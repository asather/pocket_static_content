<h1>Bloomfield utility pole breaks, injuring worker in bucket truck</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A utility worker was injured when a utility pole fell onto the bucket truck in which he was working around 4:30 p.m. at Liberty Avenue and South Mathilda Street in Bloomfield, according to a statement from Cara Cruz,&nbsp;deputy public information officer with the Pittsburgh Department of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The wooden utility pole snapped and collapsed onto the bucket, causing the bucket itself to break in half.</p>
<p>The worker,&nbsp;a Duquesne Light contractor with J.W. Didado Electric, was left dangling from the arm of the truck, Post-Gazette news partner KDKA reported.&nbsp;A coworker in a separate bucket truck rescued the worker. Police and emergency services responded to the scene, and the worker was taken to nearby West Penn Hospital.</p>
<p>The worker sustained only minor injuries to his rib cage, Ms. Cruz said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Live wires at the scene forced the closure of South Mathilda Street from Liberty to Friendship avenues. Duquesne Light arrived to assess damage and cleanup.</p>
