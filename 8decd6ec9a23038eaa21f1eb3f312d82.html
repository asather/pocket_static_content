<h1>Pittsburgh won't be one of NHL's playoff hub cities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh will not be a hub city if the NHL playoffs start up this summer.</p>
<p>The Penguins announced Tuesday that the NHL informed them the city has not been picked as one of two hub cities for its 24-team postseason tournament. Each city would host one conference’s action. The NHL has not yet announced its selections. That could come later this week.</p>
<p>In late May, the league revealed that Pittsburgh <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/27/nhl-hub-city-pittsburgh-penguins-covid-19-allegheny-county/stories/202005270116" target="_blank">was one of 10 NHL cities</a> still in consideration to be a hub city. Commissioner Gary Bettman said at the time the NHL was waiting to select the two hubs because “things are rapidly evolving” and “we want it to be based on the best-available information at the time.”</p>
<p>The Penguins felt they made a strong pitch for Pittsburgh and were appreciative of the buy-in they received while putting it together.</p>
<p>“We know Pittsburgh would have been a great host city because of our fans and the support we received from the local business community, unions and our political leaders,” Penguins President and CEO David Morehouse said.</p>
<p>He added: “We thank Commissioner Bettman and the NHL for considering us as one of the finalists, which is a reflection on how great of a city Pittsburgh truly is. We now look forward to training camp and getting back to game action.”</p>
<p>In their pitch to the NHL in the weeks after the league suspended play March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Penguins pointed to three things they hoped would put them over the top: modern hockey facilities, experience hosting major events and their partnership with health care giant UPMC.</p>
<p>PPG Paints Arena and the city of Pittsburgh also met the NHL’s requirements for things such as NHL-caliber locker rooms, team meeting space, available practice ice in the area and the number and quality of hotels Downtown.</p>
<p>The team’s practice facility in Cranberry, UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, is the league’s only practice rink in the same building as a medical facility. UPMC said it was prepared to be hands-on if Pittsburgh was a hub city, making specialists and infectious disease physicians available to the league and its teams.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald were on board with the pitch. Fitzgerald told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month that “the city, the county, our health people, our VisitPittsburgh and our hotel industry” were all working together to prepare for Pittsburgh to be a hub city.</p>
<p>But in the end, the NHL decided it would be going in other directions. Las Vegas has been rumored to be one of the front-runners for weeks. And when the Canadian government indicated it would work with the league to ensure there would be a hub north of the border, Pittsburgh became a longer shot.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday afternoon, Las Vegas, Vancouver, Edmonton, Toronto, Chicago and Los Angeles were the cities still in the mix, according to reports.</p>
<p>The NHL and the NHL Players’ Association have yet to declare a start date for the playoffs. The Penguins are one of 16 teams who must survive a play-in round to officially enter the postseason field. They’ll start with a five-game series against the Montreal Canadiens, who have the worst record in the playoff field.</p>
<p>The NHL is currently in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/18/Pittsburgh-Penguins-NHL-Phase-2-Ty-Hennes-Sidney-Crosby-Jake-Guentzel/stories/202006180146" target="_blank">Phase 2 of its return-to-play plan</a>. In this phase, players are permitted inside team facilities in groups of only six at a time. Phase 2, which is voluntary, started June 8. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and Kris Letang are among the many players working out at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex.</p>
<p>Phase 3, team training camps, are tentatively scheduled to begin July 10.</p>
