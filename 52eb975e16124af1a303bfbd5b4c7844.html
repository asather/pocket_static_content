<h1>Amid pandemic and threats to ACA, health care providers turn to lobbying</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Last year,&nbsp;Thomas A. Scully, a former top health official who ran the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President George W. Bush, heard from a health care provider who had been a familiar face for him since the early 1990s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the time, UPMC wanted to keep an eye on federal policy as it finalized a landmark agreement with Highmark.&nbsp;“They didn’t get a curveball out of Washington” as it neared the finish line, Mr. Scully said in an interview.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>After the Highmark deal was signed in June 2019, UPMC retained Mr. Scully and the&nbsp;Washington lobbying firm he worked for — an arrangement that has flourished as the COVID-19 pandemic unfolded and legal challenges mounted against&nbsp;the the Affordable Care Act. UPMC spent $340,000 in lobbying during the first six months of 2020, up from the $193,000 in lobbying it spent all of 2019, according to a Post-Gazette analysis of federal disclosures.</p>
<p>The analysis showed the Pittsburgh-based health care giant joined its rival, Highmark, along with Greensburg-based Excela Health and other groups in hiring lobbyists to press for health care issues in the nation’s capital as the&nbsp;unprecedented health emergency spurred new federal funding to provide dollars for operations and research.</p>
<p>Congress in March passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, which created the Provider Relief Fund, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/05/12/health-providers-federal-aid-funding-Medicaid-home-care-COVID-19-Pittsburgh/stories/202005130017?cid=search" target="_blank">$175 billion pot of money</a>&nbsp;to help health providers cover COVID-19 costs and fill budget shortfalls created by canceling of elective procedures and routine doctor’s visits.</p>
<p>The health providers, according to the disclosures and statements, leaned on Washington lobbying firms that promise to provide clarity on complex issues and unfettered access to lawmakers and policy officials.</p>
<p>Two issues were top of mind: Financial shortfalls due to the COVID-19 pandemic and looming concerns about the Trump administration’s attempts in court to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law 10 years ago and has since become embedded in the U.S. health care system.</p>
<p>“Whether you like the ACA or not, it’s covered a lot of people,” Mr. Scully said, speaking generally and not about his clients.</p>
<p>Mr. Scully served in the Office of Management and Budget under President George H. W. Bush and — as CMS administrator under the younger President Bush — helped establish Medicare Part D, the prescription drug benefit program.</p>
<p>The ACA “has fundamentally changed the health care system, and anything that changes the status quo will cause chaos,” Mr. Scully said.</p>
<p>UPMC turned to the Lincoln Policy Group, a 12-person lobbying shop founded by Blanche Lincoln, the former Democratic senator from Arkansas.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. Scully, UPMC enlisted Colin Roskey, who joined the firm after serving as a deputy assistant secretary at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and as a health counsel to Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee; and Dan Elling, former staff director of the House Ways and Means Health Subcommittee.</p>
<p>UPMC, in response to questions, sent a statement from Scott Baker, its vice president and chief government affairs officer, that explained Lincoln Policy Group advises UPMC on “complex and rapidly changing regulatory requirements.”</p>
<p>Mr. Baker said UPMC’s government relations team drafted strategies with the firm to defend the Affordable Care Act “and its extension of health care coverage for many Western Pennsylvanians.” It pressed for legislation to expand telemedicine, control drug prices, and support funding for the National Institutes of Health, for which the University of Pittsburgh is a top recipient of research funding.</p>
<p>Amid the pandemic, UPMC pressed for more COVID-19 testing, vaccine development and better therapies. In July, UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh was selected to host a federally funded COVID-19 vaccine trial.</p>
<p>“In many cases, these changes can equate to millions of dollars that ultimately impact care and costs for our patients and members,” Mr. Baker wrote.</p>
<p>Highmark Health, the Pittsburgh-based health provider and insurance giant, spent a total of $660,000 for lobbying in the first six months of 2020, with 28 pieces of legislation, including the CARES Act, among its priorities. It is on pace for about the same level of spending as last year, when it spent $1.3 million.</p>
<p>Most of that lobbying money was spent using Highmark’s two internal government affairs officials, Mike Warfel and Greg Englert.</p>
<p>Highmark Health — the parent company of Highmark Inc., the insurance arm, and Allegheny Health Network, the health provider — spent an additional $80,000 on American Continental Group, a Washington-based firm run by David Urban. Mr. Urban is a Beaver County native and Republican political operative who served as a senior adviser to President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and is currently part of the Trump 2020 Advisory Committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Urban, who was also a chief of staff to former Pennsylvania Sen. Arlen Specter in the 1990s, did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>In response to an interview request, Highmark sent an emailed statement that the organization tries to “engage with policy makers in a number of ways to share our perspective and points of view on how their decisions will impact the communities we serve.”</p>
<p>“We continue to advocate for federal support to help develop, manufacture and distribute a vaccine,” Highmark Health spokesman Aaron Billger said in the statement.</p>
<p>Smaller groups and providers have also joined the lobbying hunt.</p>
<p>Excela Health, the Greensburg-based health provider, enlisted the help of a lobbying firm in June to ensure it was getting all the financial help it could from federal funding programs. Excela, the largest employer in Westmoreland County, paid three lobbyists for Washington-based Cassidy and Associates a total of $20,000.</p>
<p>Excela’s goal was to examine all potential federal grants and resources, said John Sphon, the provider’s CEO, in a statement in response to questions.</p>
<p>“This engagement was precipitated by the acute financial impact COVID-19 has had on Excela Health,” Mr. Sphon stated. “We have to be assertive in seeking incremental funding from all potential sources.”</p>
<p>Disclosures showed the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative hired a firm on July 1 to “advocate for a new patient safety agency,” though the Downtown-based organization declined to comment last week.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Assisted Living Association hired Commonwealth Strategic Partners this year to advocate liability protections and funding specifically for personal care and assisted living facilities at the state and federal level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Harrisburg group, with three staff members, brought on lobbyists for the first time shortly before the pandemic unfolded —&nbsp;and “thank God we did,” said Margie Zelenak, the association’s executive director, in an interview.</p>
<p>The focus has been on getting funding and protective equipment for hospitals and nursing homes, she said, while senior living facilities were left out. Pennsylvania has approved $15 million for those assisted living facilities — but they need much more to comply with mandates to continually test residents.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to be at the Capitol all the time, and our board of directors&nbsp;said we need someone there to represent us,” she said.&nbsp;“They’ve really been a resource during the whole month of March and April.”</p>
