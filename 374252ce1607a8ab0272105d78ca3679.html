<h1>Suit alleges Citizens Bank broke consumer protection laws by mishandling credit card disputes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is suing Citizens Bank, alleging violations of the federal Truth in Lending Act and other consumer protection laws by failing to properly manage and respond to credit card disputes.</p>
<p>The suit accuses the Providence, R.I.-based bank of failing to reasonably investigate and appropriately resolve consumers’ billing error notices and claims of unauthorized use, automatically denying them in certain circumstances. The bank also failed to fully refund finance charges and fees when consumers asserted meritorious disputes or fraud claims, and failed to send consumers required acknowledgement letters and denial notices in response to billing error notices, the suit claims.</p>
<p>Citizens — the second largest retail bank in the Pittsburgh region behind PNC Bank — also failed to provide credit counseling referrals to consumers who called the bank’s toll-free number designated for that purpose, according to the suit.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Citizens did not immediately respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The bureau’s complaint, filed in U.S. District Court in Rhode Island, seeks an injunction and civil monetary penalties.</p>
