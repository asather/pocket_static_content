<h1>Josh Bell on his struggles and how he expects to bounce back</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CLEVELAND — Josh Bell wasn’t happy with the numbers he produced in 2020. After an All-Star season in 2019, Bell struggled at the plate and also failed to make meaningful progress as a defender at first base.</p>
<p>The good news for Bell and the Pirates, however, is that he views this as a valuable learning experience for him, and the 28-year-old feels 2020 may ultimately become an important pivot point for the rest of his career.</p>
<p>“I know I expected more of myself going into the season,” Bell said. “I know what I’ve got to work on this offseason. I’ve just got to get after it, come back ready to go next year and come back a better player.”</p>
<p>The most important part there comes on offense. After slashing .277/.367/.569 and producing an OPS of .936 in 2019, Bell saw those numbers dip to .225/.304/.369 and .673.</p>
<p>In terms of FanGraphs’ Wins Above Replacement (fWAR), Bell went from 2.5 last year to -0.4 entering Saturday’s game against the Indians at Progressive Field.</p>
<p>There are several reasons why Bell struggled this season. For one, timing. Bell has talked plenty about needing to sync his swing to the fastball, and that never really happened.</p>
<p>A key indicator of that was Bell’s ground-ball rate, which jumped from 44.0% in 2019 to 55.6% in 2020, a career-high. When Bell’s timing is where it should be, he’s out in front and catching the ball at a point where he can drive it. When it’s not, Bell is late and beating it into the ground.</p>
<p>“With regards to my ground-ball rate, I just feel like I wasn’t on time,” Bell said. “If I’m missing balls pull side on the ground, that means I was beat. That’s just the way it is.”</p>
<p>Bell also missed a lot of pitches he traditionally has hit, which explains why his whiff rate jumped from 25.3% to 33.8%. A year after hitting .274 and slugging .590 against breaking balls, Bell saw those numbers drop to .159 and .227. Meanwhile, he fared even worse — hitting .143 and slugging .171 — against offspeed stuff.</p>
<p>Part of that involved pitchers being extra careful with Bell, who hit 37 home runs and had 116 RBIs last season, but there was also a rule change for 2020 that Bell was careful not to explicitly blame for his struggles.</p>
<p>The use of in-game video was prohibited this season after the Astros were caught abusing it, and Bell said that hindered his ability to make adjustments on the fly. Much of what Bell and hitting coach Rick Eckstein did in 2019 revolved around detecting certain “cues” using replay, but that wasn’t possible this year.</p>
<p>“Without those cues I kind of felt like it was definitely tough baseball,” Bell said.</p>
<p>It certainly produced more strikeouts than Bell would have liked, his percentage of them increasing from 19.2% in 2019 to 27.1% in 2020 while his batting average on balls in play stayed mostly the same (.288 in 2019 and .272 in 2020).</p>
<p>Another thing that had to be tough on Bell — though he didn’t admit this — was the first base/designated hitter dynamic. On the fielding side, Bell struggled. His sidearm throwing motion morphed into basically underhand, and none of it looked comfortable. Now, wants to adjust his arm angle based on the throw.</p>
<p>Results-wise, only one first baseman — Cincinnati’s Joey Votto with five — had more errors than Bell (four) entering Saturday, and he had played 15 more games. In terms of fielding percentage, Bell’s .983 ranked last, as did his three throwing errors.</p>
<p>“I feel like, in regards to defense as a whole, I was kind of still one step behind where I wanted to be,” Bell said. “There was a little bit more hesitation than I’d like to have. I think a lot of it comes with reps, reps I’m going to get in the offseason.”</p>
<p>As far as the DH angle, Bell saw his average drop from .276 in 32 starts at first to .129 in 21 when he focuses solely on hitting. That’s hardly a big enough sample, but it ties back to the video stuff Bell mentioned, the ability to quickly make adjustments.</p>
<p>Bell said his offseason work — likely in his garage with his father, Earnest, thanks to the coronavirus — will focus on being able to make those adjustments without a ton of video, since Bell doesn’t expect to have that back next season.</p>
<p>And assuming he does, one day Bell might actually be able to look back on this season fondly.</p>
<p>“I feel like in regards to my career and where it can go from here, this season as a whole was such a learning experience for me,” Bell said. “There’s one thing you can’t take away from me, and that’s the hunger and desire to be the best player on the field, hit the hardest ball in the game and make the play when it comes to me. That’s what’s driving me.”</p>
