<h1>Penguins add Todd Reirden, Mike Velucci to coaching staff</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated:</strong></em></p>
<p>The Penguins filled their vacant assistant coaching positions on Wednesday, rehiring former assistant Todd Reirden and promoting Mike Vellucci from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. The club also signed goaltending coach Mike Buckley to a two-year contract extension that will keep him in Pittsburgh through 2021-22.</p>
<p>Reirden, 49, will be tasked with getting a disjointed power play unit back on track, in addition to working with the defense. Vellucci, who served as the head coach and general manager of the Penguins’ AHL affiliate last season, will focus on the forwards and oversee the penalty kill.</p>
<p>The two new assistants replace Jacques Martin, Mark Recchi and Sergei Gonchar, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/12/penguins-coaching-staff-changes-sergei-gonchar-mark-recchi-jacques-martin/stories/202008120122" target="_blank">whose contracts were not renewed</a> following the Penguins’ disappointing four-game flameout in the NHL’s qualifying round against the Montreal Canadiens.</p>
<p>“I am pleased to add Todd and Mike to our coaching staff, and believe they will complement Mike Sullivan’s coaching style,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “Todd is a Stanley Cup winning coach with a decade of NHL experience as both an assistant and head coach. Mike brings championship experience at both the AHL and OHL level, and is very familiar with how we function as an organization.”</p>
<p>Reirden, 49, spent the last six seasons on the Washington Capitals staff, including the last two as the head coach. He was fired in late August after the Capitals lost in the first round of the postseason to the New York Islanders, who were led by Barry Trotz, the coach Reirden replaced in Washington.</p>
<p>Prior to his time with Washington, Reirden was an assistant coach with the Penguins from 2010-14. He also spent three years with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins from 2008-10 as both an assistant coach and head coach. During his four seasons as Pittsburgh’s assistant coach, only the Washington Capitals (20.7%) and San Jose Sharks (20.5%) had a better power-play success rate from 2010-14 than the Penguins’ 20.3%.</p>
<p>Vellucci, 54, joined the Penguins organization last season after spending the previous five years as the assistant general manager and director of hockey operations for the Carolina Hurricanes.</p>
<p>He also coached the Carolina’s AHL affiliate, the Charlotte Checkers, to the Calder Cup in 2018-19. He was honored with the Louis A.R. Pieri Memorial Award as the AHL’s outstanding coach during that campaign as the Checkers posted the best record in the AHL. They also led the league in penalty killing, a good sign for someone who will focus on that same side of the special teams battle in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Prior to his time with the Hurricanes organization, Vellucci spent 14 seasons as general manager and head coach of the OHL’s Plymouth Whalers. He was honored for both parts of his dual role, winning the OHL Executive of the Year award and OHL Coach of the Year award in 2012-13. He also won the Coach of the Year award during the Whalers’ 2006-07 championship season.</p>
<p>Vellucci’s promotion from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton will create at least one vacancy — possibly two — depending on if Rutherford wants to package the GM and coaching jobs together the way he did last season.</p>
