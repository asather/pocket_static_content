<h1>As Senate considers COVID-19 package, White House asks for $850 billion more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate will meet Tuesday to consider a&nbsp;sweeping package that would aid American workers and the health care system in response to the deepening COVID-19 crisis, three days after the House of Representatives approved the measure on the other side of the Capitol building.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The measure would be the second bill to respond to the crisis, after Congress passed a $8.3 billion aid package two weeks ago.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senate’s deliberations comes amid talk of a third package requested by the White House for $850 billion in stimulus aid to help the U.S. economy, which has ground to a halt amid orders to shut down businesses and cancel all nonessential travel. The Washington Post reported on the third package on Tuesday.</p>
<p>On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., took to the floor to promise&nbsp;“bold and bipartisan solutions.”</p>
<p>While pointing out the Senate was still waiting for the final version of the House bill, Mr. McConnell said, “I know that senators on both sides have spent the last several days studying the House proposal, and I know that all of us are eager to act quickly to support American workers, families and small businesses.”</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell added that “Senate Republicans are absolutely convinced that the House’s bill can only be the beginning, just the beginning of Congress’ efforts to secure our economy.”</p>

<p>The aid packages could face roadblocks amid competing ideas.</p>
<p>Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., proposed at least $750 billion “to wage war against COVID-19 and the economic crisis it is now causing,” he said during a floor speech on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Schumer said his proposal would include federal funding to address hospital and treatment capacity issues, expand unemployment insurance and increase Medicaid funding. He called for Congress to provide immediate loan payment forbearance for all federal loans, student loans, mortgages, small business loans and others.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell did not get specific on what he would support but said&nbsp;“the Senate majority is already working toward next steps.”</p>
<p>It is unclear if the Republican-controlled Senate will seek to significantly amend the House-passed measure, but President Donald Trump told reporters on Monday the Senate could make the bill&nbsp;“even better.”</p>
