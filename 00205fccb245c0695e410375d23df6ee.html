<h1>Proud of her forebears, Eliza Smith Brown is making spaces and history of her own</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“There’s an old saying: Don’t cry because you’ve lost it. Smile because it happened,” says Eliza Smith Brown, sitting in her Squirrel Hill home, talking about her feelings a year after losing her husband of 35 years, law professor Bill Brown.</p>
<p>“After a year, all the sad memories go away and the good ones come to the fore,” she says.</p>
<p>When I ask if the house feels lonely to her, she answers with characteristic stoic optimism.</p>
<p>“It’s right to scale,” says the<a href="https://www.elizasmithbrown.com/" target="_blank"> architectural historian</a>, noting that this house is not like others in the East End where a person might rattle around endlessly.</p>
<p>“There were two of us when we first moved in, and there are two of us now — me and the beagle [Knox].”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Brown is undertaking a home renovation, out of necessity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Railroad ties holding together tiered steps and a retaining wall in back are collapsing, causing supports beneath the kitchen and upper terrace to sag. While thinking about how to fix it, she began to ask herself how she wanted to live. She knew she wanted to be outside more, to spend more time on her writing and to have her friends around her.</p>
<p>Since so much of her writing has centered on the concept of place, it makes sense that she is creating space for this new phase of her life. Hence the idea to design and build an 18- by- 24-foot outdoor room with a working fireplace and roof but no windows or walls, surrounded by a secret garden. It is her first independent attempt at space-making, a pastime she and her husband enjoyed together. Indeed, she descends from a long line of renaissance men and formidable women whose architectural tastes have resulted in some elegant and impressive spreads.</p>
<p>Mrs. Brown’s ancestral roots go seven generations deep in Western Pennsylvania. Most of her family arrived from Ulster, Ireland, “with the exception of one German Mennonite,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>She-devils in the family</strong></p>
<p>Her great-grandfather, Julian Kennedy, was a Yale-educated engineer who designed Andrew Carnegie’s blast furnaces.&nbsp;His activist daughters Eliza Kennedy Smith and Lucy Kennedy Miller — Eliza Smith Brown’s namesake grandmother and great-aunt, respectively — are the subject of a book she is writing, “She-Devils at the Door.” It’s title reflects the lament that arose when the incendiary sisters turned up at Pittsburgh City Hall asking to see an accounting of expenditures, something they apparently did with regularity.</p>
<p>“The she-devils are at the door!” was the cry of city workers.</p>
<p>Julian Kennedy enjoyed lavish living and “putting on the dog,” his great-granddaughter says. He built a large house on the Schenley Park Golf Course and a Queen Anne-style mansion on the private island of Crusoe in Lake Muskoka, Canada —&nbsp;a resort enclave that has attracted old Pittsburgh families for generations.</p>
<p>In the late 1920s, his daughter Eliza and her husband, chemist R. Templeton Smith, built a vacation home by joining two cottages on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Nearby was a newer home, built in the 1960s, where Eliza Smith Brown’s family kept horses. The Federal-style house had a formal demeanor and looked older than it was, she says, because it was built at the end of a long drive framed by trees that had been planted decades earlier by her grandmother. By the 1960s, the trees were tall and broad, giving the house an intimidating first impression of grandeur that embarrassed Mrs. Brown and her brother, Templeton Smith Jr., who sold it just three years ago.</p>
<p>Eliza Kennedy Smith, the former she-devil and <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/womens-suffrage/" target="_blank">suffragist</a>, “was a bit scary,” according to her granddaughter, and hosted parties at her Maryland home for the League of Women Voters. Her favorite memories of life on the Eastern Shore were less of formal parties and more of weekend guests coming downstairs in pajamas for long, lazy breakfasts, followed by long, active days outdoors.&nbsp;A typical day on the farm entailed rising at dawn to “ride out” on horses.</p>
<p>“By the time you were coming back, you’d swear that the corn in the field had grown,” Mrs. Brown says.</p>
<p>After a big breakfast, young Eliza often went for a sail, maybe did some crabbing, then visited the cows that kept the grass mown. In the evening, the children and guests would all dine together. One night, she says, 30 people slept over because the hand bell choir from their church was touring and needed a stop-off point. Other special guests included members of the American Holly Association (her grandfather bred holly as a hobby).</p>
<p>It sounds like a life that was rich and vital and nurturing, but her modesty and stoicism would never allow her to label it as such. “I’m trying to think of anything interesting that ever happened to me.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meeting her husband was one such thing. Like achitecture, marriage is a “space-making proposition,” she says. Her family boasts many pairings of creative men who succeeded in corporate environments and strong, educated women who found space for each other. Her father, Templeton Smith Sr., was a Harvard-educated lawyer as well as a musicologist.</p>
<p>“He listened to Mozart and read Boswell when he got home from work” and “never took off his coat and tie before going to bed,” she says.</p>
<p><strong>‘Marked from birth’</strong></p>
<p>Most of the men in her family were Ivy Leaguers and the women went to Seven Sisters institutions, Vassar on her father’s side, Mount Holyoke on her mother’s. Her mother, Nellie Fergus, was the first female lawyer at Reed Smith, and her aunt,&nbsp;Emily Fergus Merritt, became a doctor. Both were such active alumnae of the college in South Hadley, Mass., that Eliza was “marked from birth.”</p>
<p>When she was born, her parents wrote to the college requesting her place in advance. An admissions officer wrote back congratulating them and requesting that they fill out the enclosed application card when the time was right.&nbsp;At age 17, she headed to Mount Holyoke, where she studied art and architecture.</p>
<p>She was home on a break when she was met Bill Brown while attending one of his lectures at the University of Pittsburgh, where her brother was a law student. A few years later, after graduating, she spent a year and a half at Cornell University studying historic preservation. She returned home to a froth of social activity&nbsp; — parties, dances at the University Club — that offset her cloistered years in the single-sex environment of South Hadley and chilly climate of Ithaca, N.Y.</p>
<p>A law student she was dating had a party and invited his favorite professor, Mr. Brown, who instantly took note of Eliza. It “didn’t even occur” to her to be interested in the professor who was 18 years her senior. Still, when he called several months later, the attraction became mutual.</p>
<p>“He was a lovely package,” she says. The two were married that December.</p>
<p><strong>Shared spaces</strong></p>
<p>When it came to decorating their first home together, the couple were “at different ends of the spectrum,” she says.</p>
<p>She favored 18th-century antiques while his apartment was furnished in mid-century modern. They eventually found a middle ground, a “fluid eclecticism” that stretched them both, she says.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown discovered early that he had been “born to teach,” but he was passionately obsessive about a number of other pursuits, too. He painted and made ceramics and eventually undertook “his magnum opus” after purchasing online two historical structures from the 18th and 19th centuries, a timber frame and log house.</p>
<p>He set about combining them into one house in Ligonier. Eliza and their three children, Will, Brendan and Regina, all contributed manual labor to the project, every detail of which Mr. Brown was fanatical about, down to the rectangular cut nails whose uniform alignment was mandatory.</p>
<p>The house became a getaway for family and friends. Not being “TV people,” the family favored charades and parlor games at weekend parties. She fondly remembers a plein air painting party for 35 people that they hosted for the Yale Club, led by Pittsburgh artist Ron Donoughe. Before the evening was over, Mr. Brown had to leave his guests and sequester himself because of his failing health.</p>
<p>“I took care of a lot of people for a lot of years,” she says.</p>
<p>Her husband had health issues for 18 years, and she helped her parents “to the finish line.” It can be “incredibly rewarding to give to people in that way,” she says, noting that she stays in touch with some of her husband’s former students.</p>
<p><strong>A new space</strong></p>
<p>Now Mrs. Brown is turning her attention to aspects of her own life. The she-devils book, for example. She started it 15 years ago and kept setting it aside for the other demands on her time.</p>
<p>She is working with architect Sarah Drake and landscape architect Joel LeGall on the details of her outdoor room, which will have a bluestone floor and metal roof. The latter she chose to accentuate the sound of falling rain, which she loves. There will be a table with room for eight guests and lounging furniture around the fireplace for writing, reading, napping and entertaining.</p>
<p>The secret garden on the lower level of the yard will be enclosed by a either a gate or vine-covered archway. She hopes it will become a sanctuary for quiet meditation.</p>
<p>While entertaining in the early days of her marriage was more formal, with linens and crystal, Mrs. Brown says she now prefers a more casual approach. Yet she remains rigorous about placecards and enjoys making deliberate and considered introductions between the old and new friends she cultivates.</p>
<p>Though she was “drawn to cities, to architecture, to museums” in her youth, she is becoming more and more drawn to nature.</p>
<p>“The notion of being able to step outside my kitchen door and escape into a room without walls and a secret garden beyond is so appealing,” she says. “Just to read or write there alone or to entertain friends there will be a sensory delight. I imagine the breezes, the sounds of the birds, the fragrance of flowers and shrubs —&nbsp;all very delicious.”</p>
<p>Each generation of her family “built an escape from Pittsburgh, a house for hosting that reflects their particular style.” The antique house in Ligonier reflected the life she shared with her husband.</p>
<p>“But my project will reflect just me,” she says, “and I only need walk out the kitchen door to escape!”</p>
