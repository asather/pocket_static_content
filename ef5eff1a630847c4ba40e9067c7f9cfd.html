<h1>Duquesne's most recent win set some records, but more challenges await</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne set a few program records with its win over St. Bonaventure on Wednesday.</p>
<p>With the win, the Dukes moved to 19-8 on the season and 9-6 in the A10. It marks the first time since the 1970-71 and 1971-72 seasons that Duquesne has won at least 19 games in two consecutive seasons. It’s also the first time ever the Dukes have won nine A10 games in two straight seasons and the first time they’ve won five road A10 games in a season.</p>
<p>In some ways those milestones say more about the Dukes’ past seasons than they do the current one. Duquesne has struggled for a very long time to gain traction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, the fact that this Dukes team, under coach Keith Dambrot, has reached levels it hasn’t seen in a very long time is something both the coaches and players are willing to applaud, even if it isn’t always at the forefront of their minds.</p>
<p>“We don’t really know that we break records until afterward,” sophomore guard Sincere Carry said on Friday.&nbsp;“But it does mean a lot to us because we all set goals and want to accomplish them. Really, we’re all trying to win the A10 championship and make it to March Madness. That’s what we’re trying to get to, but we’ve got to do those little things to get there first.”</p>
<p>The significance of Wednesday’s win goes beyond simply breaking new ground in the program.</p>
<p>Duquesne is still jockeying for position in the A10, currently tied for fifth place and a game behind the Bonnies, who sit in fourth. The larger significance of it is that the top four teams in the conference standings at the end of the year get a double-bye in the conference tournament, meaning they would only have to win three games to take the crown and receive an automatic bid into the NCAA tournament.</p>
<p>So not only does Wednesday’s win close the gap to that coveted fourth-place spot, but it also helps build belief in the Dukes that they can hang with the top teams in the conference.</p>
<p>“Especially against a team like [St. Bonaventure], they’ve had success in this league already,” Carry said.&nbsp;“They’re kind of considered one of the big dogs in this league. So to beat a program like that, it shows that we belong up there and we’re moving in the right direction.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Duquesne still has to prove it can put together strong performances night-in and night-out. At times this year, the Dukes have looked strong over stretches of games only to lose to a team in the bottom half of the conference standings.</p>
<p>Saturday’s game against George Mason presents a similar prospect.</p>
<p>The Patriots (15-13 overall, 4-11 A10) have some impressive wins this season. They beat Nebraska by 19 points in the non-conference, toppled VCU on the road and nearly beat Dayton their last time out.</p>
<p>Still, it’s a game Duquesne will be favored to win. And while the Dukes aren’t counting their chickens before they hatch, they know it’s a game that could help build momentum as the regular season winds down.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s another milestone to be reached. A win would give Duquesne its first 20-win season since 2008-09.</p>
<p>“Our guys are happy to win,” Dambrot said. “It’s a grind for every team in America, but we’ve been very close to being really good. So when you get validation, it gives you self-gratification. Can we re-validate and re-validate and re-validate? That’s going to be the question.”</p>
