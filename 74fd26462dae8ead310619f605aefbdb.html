<h1>Philadelphia Eagles running back makes tribute to Antwon Rose II</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Miles Sanders, a former standout running back at Woodland Hills High School and Penn State, planned to honor Antwon Rose II during Sunday’s game between the Philadelphia Eagles and the Washington Football Team.</p>
<p>Sanders, an Eagles tailback, posted onto his Instagram account a photo of his helmet with Rose’s name written across the back, incorrectly writing Antwon Rose Jr.&nbsp;However, Sanders will miss his team’s opener due to a hamstring injury, according to NFL.com.</p>
<p>Rose, 17, who was a graduate of Woodland Hills, was killed on June 19, 2018, when he was shot three times while running from former East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld during a traffic stop.</p>
<p>Rosfeld has since been acquitted.</p>
<p>Last season as a rookie, Sanders led the Eagles with 819 yards rushing. He was a second-round pick in 2019.</p>
