<h1>Philips looking for workers to assemble badly-needed ventilators in Murrysville</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With health officials warning of a possible shortage of ventilators for the sickest COVID-19 patients, Philips Respironics in Murrysville is ramping up its production and looking for production line workers to help.</p>
<p>The company’s website says it needs second-shift production line workers to assemble and package “various Respironics medical devices,” including ventilators from 2:45 p.m. to 10:45 p.m. Workers also must be able to work overtime if needed.</p>

<p>A Reddit posting linking to the job description says the company is making ventilators and other oxygen-related medical devices “that are essential for the most severe cases of COVID-19” and it is gearing up for round-the-clock mass production.</p>
<p>“They need help and fast,” the post said.</p>
<p>The job requires a high school diploma, GED or equivalent work history and “experience in manufacturing, service or assembly, in a regulated environment.” English proficiency is also required.</p>
<p>The ad says the position offers “a competitive salary,” vacation and sick time, medical, dental and vision coverage, a 401K and “an opportunity to earn a yearly bonus.”</p>
