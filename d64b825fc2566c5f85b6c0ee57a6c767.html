<h1>Won't you be good neighbor on 143 Day?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hate makes headlines. Kindness, not so much.</p>
<p>That’s why 143 Day matters. Friday, the 143rd day of the year, is the second annual celebration of the late Fred Rogers’ favorite number and shorthand way of saying “I love you.” (There is one letter in “I,” four in “love” and three in “you.”)</p>
<p>On Friday, people across the commonwealth are encouraged to act with kindness, especially in these extraordinary times.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Last year’s 143 Day brought together Pennsylvanians who shared more than 17,000 acts of kindness,” Frances Wolf, the governor’s wife, said in a statement.</p>
<p>“This year, my husband Tom and I are encouraging all Pennsylvanians to spread even more kindness on 143 Day by recognizing and thanking our helpers&nbsp;— those who are keeping us safe and healthy through this pandemic. Fred Rogers often said we could look for helpers in the darkest times, and our fellow Pennsylvanians have certainly not disappointed.”</p>
<p>Locally, there will be music, stories and maybe some fish.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra spent a week recording a video for its web page, <a href="https://pittsburghsymphony.org/" target="_blank">PittsburghSymphony.org</a>. Twenty-eight musicians contributed their talents to a video recording of “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” from “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”</p>
<p>In it, pianist Rodrigo Ojeda sits alone on stage at Heinz Hall, where he recorded his track, and there are vocals by Katy Williams. The video goes live Friday.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fredrogers.org/" target="_blank">Fred Rogers Productions</a> has year-round web features that encourage kindness; it’s a big part of what they do, after all. A special project is a virtual reading on Friday featuring Matthew Cordell, author and illustrator of a new picture book/bio: “Hello, Neighbor! The Kind and Caring World of Mister Rogers.”</p>
<p>The reading is a partnership with PBS KIDS, which has a weekly Read Along series streaming every Friday at noon on the PBS KIDS <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PBSKIDS/" target="_blank">Facebook page</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrNnk0wFBnCS1awGjq_ijGQ" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>WQED Multimedia has a web page (<a href="/wqed.org/kind" target="_blank">wqed.org/kind</a>) where viewers can access stories of kindness as well as videos from the “Sweater Sessions.”</p>

<p>The sessions range from the Beagle Brothers harmonizing and the Steel City Strings &amp; Cello Fury going classical to The Buckle Downs’ jazz-infused version of the “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” theme song, shot in Mellon Park.</p>
<p>The Children’s Museum of Pittsburgh has its own sing-a-long. More than 20 submissions were rolled into a video version of the&nbsp;“MRN” theme song that&nbsp; features individuals, families, musicians and one huge, fluffy white cat. It’s available through the museum’s home page, <a href="https://pittsburghkids.org/" target="_blank">PittsburghKids.org</a>, as well as YouTube and social media channels.</p>

<p>&nbsp;And don’t forget: the Post-Gazette has been collecting “<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/random-acts-of-kindness" target="_blank">Random Acts of Kindness</a>” stories for years now.</p>
<p>In Market Square, the Original Oyster House is going to donate $2 to the American Heart Association for each fish sandwich purchased for pickup from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Friday. One dollar is from the restaurant itself, the other from owner Jen Grippo.</p>
<p>How to get started? The state has a <a href="https://143day.dced.pa.gov/" target="_blank">143Day website</a> with a&nbsp;“Kindness Tracker” and tool kit. It encourages people to spread a good word Friday through social media, using the #143DayInPA hashtag. Beginning Friday, a&nbsp;“Kindness Tracker” hopes to document good deeds through it.</p>
<p>The motto: “Just imagine the change we would see in the real world if all 12.8 million PA residents participated.” Just because we can’t see smiles behind our masks, on 143 day, it’s nice to know they’re there.</p>
