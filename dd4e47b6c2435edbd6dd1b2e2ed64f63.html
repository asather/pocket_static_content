<h1>Steelers' draft gets lukewarm grades from national experts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>National experts aren’t too high or too low on the Steelers’ 2020 draft class. Many have weighed in on the group since the draft wrapped up Saturday, and while few are giving them top grades, they aren’t handing out many bad ones either. Here’s a recap of grades and some of the explanations offered for them. </em></p>
<p><em>And remember to check out Gerry Dulac’s pick-by-pick grades <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/26/gerry-dulac-grades-steelers-draft-2020-analysis/stories/202004260124" target="_blank">here</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Factor in the Minkah Fitzpatrick trade, plus the move up to land Devin Bush a year ago, and this draft class already has paid big dividends. Landing an athletic playmaker and special-teams demon in [Chase] Claypool was a smart first pick, and [Alex] Highsmith is a fascinating project. This class isn’t sexy but we’re fans of most of what Kevin Colbert and crew accomplished.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> They traded away their first-round pick to land safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, which was a good move. I didn't love the Claypool pick, but I did like [Kevin] Dotson and third-round linebacker Alex Highsmith.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Pittsburgh’s first-round pick is already a success considering it was dealt last year for Pro Bowl free safety Minkah Fitzpatrick. That takes a bit of the sting out of the possibility that no one from this draft class will make major contributions in 2020. ... The guy with the best chance to prove this wrong is Chase Claypool.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> No first-rounder, but the Steelers know how to evaluate, steal and develop receivers — and Claypool’s athleticism in a tight end body is intriguing. Big bet placed on small-school Highsmith.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The sneaky good pick in this group is Dotson. Both of the Steelers’ starting guards are over thirty.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Notre Dame’s Chase Claypool is a matchup nightmare, and the Steelers know a thing or two about finding value when it comes to pass-catchers on draft weekend. … Charlotte’s Alex Highsmith is one of this year’s most underrated edge defenders, and Maryland’s Anthony McFarland, Jr., gives the Steelers a home-run threat at running back.</p>
<p><strong>Vinnie Iyer, <a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/nfl-draft-grades-2020-best-worst-classes/2bs9w101joku1lruu8r1xwt9f" target="_blank">Sporting News</a>:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Kevin Colbert had an interesting draft as the team didn’t really prioritize key needs at defensive tackle (not taking one until Davis) and running back. Claypool is an intriguing hybrid, but was more of a luxury pick given they have JuJu Smith-Schuster, Diontae Johnson and James Washington. Highsmith was a third edge rusher they couldn’t resist. McFarland is more of pace-changer instead of a back able to carry a full load to replace James Conner.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> There was a lot of discussion of the Steelers going running back with their Round 2 selection, but they made the right call here by going with a player who can win downfield instead. Claypool has a freakish physical profile at 6-foot-4 and nearly 240 pounds with a 4.42-second 40-yard dash and a vertical jump over 40 inches. He also made plenty of plays down the football field at Notre Dame in 2019, pulling in 16 receptions on passes thrown 20 or more yards downfield (tied most in the class). The concern is that he won more with physicality than separation, not quite playing as fast as his 40 time would indicate, but there’s a lot of potential for him on this Steelers offense as a downfield threat.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> I liked the decisions to add Claypool at receiver and Highsmith as depth at edge rusher with their second- and third-round picks, respectively. That's a solid couple of days for GM Kevin Colbert. … Colbert went with another mid-round back in McFarland after using similar picks on James Conner (No. 105 overall, 2017), Jaylen Samuels (No. 165, 2018), and Benny Snell (No. 122, 2019) the past three seasons. He does have speed, though, which the team needed at the position. Dotson gives the team depth for now and could develop into a future starter at guard down the line. The team needed a nose tackle and Davis fits that bill well.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> As for players just picked, uber-sized WR Chase Claypool, uber-productive OLB Alex Highsmith and uber-swift RB Anthony McFarland all seem well-positioned to battle for jobs currently manned by veterans potentially on shaky ground.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Pittsburgh didn’t address its cornerback needs in a very deep class, instead vowing to become more explosive on offense with second-round receiver/tight end Chase Claypool, the pure athlete and combine star. At 6-foot-4 and 238 pounds, Claypool has the potential to become what Darren Waller has become in the Raiders’ offense. And fourth-round running back Anthony McFarland may be undersized, but he runs with authority and has potential as a pass-catcher. Watch out for third-round edge-rusher Alex Highsmith from Charlotte, a sleeper at his position who could be a force with his agility in Pittsburgh’s nickel fronts.</p>

<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Alex Highsmith, taken 102nd overall, is the type of versatile pass rusher the Steelers need. It’s a pick you could see coming because he fits the mold perfectly in Pittsburgh. Highsmith’s first step will get him on the field right now. If he can get stronger to play the run better, he can become a starter for Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Maske, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/04/25/nfl-draft-grades/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a>:</strong> B-</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> The trade for S Minkah Fitzpatrick last season left the Steelers without a first-round choice. But they did address some of their offensive issues by taking WR Chase Claypool in the second round and RB Anthony McFarland Jr. in the fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Leger, <a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/boston/patriots/2020-nfl-draft-final-grades-every-afc-team" target="_blank">NBC Sports Boston</a>:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> They made the most of their first selection with Claypool, who projects to be a matchup nightmare with his size. Highsmith was a reach at No. 102 overall. McFarland is an intriguing pick and will be a nice compliment to James Conner. This wasn't a star-studded draft for Pittsburgh, but it was a solid one.</p>
<p><strong>Tim Bielik, <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/browns/2020/04/nfl-draft-2020-grading-all-32-teams.html" target="_blank">Cleveland.com</a>:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> his was a draft for the Steelers that looked a lot like ones they’ve had in the past. They started it off with Claypool, who was one of my favorite players in the entire draft. It continued with a promising young pass rusher in Highsmith, and a solid final day. Dotson was a good pick to add depth and a potential starter at guard. Despite not having a lot of draft capital, Pittsburgh did pretty well.</p>
<p><strong>Phillip Heilman, <a href="https://www.denverpost.com/2020/04/26/afc-nfl-draft-grades-2020/" target="_blank">Denver Post</a>:</strong> B</p>
<p><strong>Analysis:</strong> Expect to see Chase Claypool become the latest Steelers receiver to be drafted outside of the first round and flourish. He’s big with strong hands and knows how to attack the football. Speaking of attacking, adding edge rusher Alex Highsmith to the T.J. Watt/Bud Dupree tandem is just plain scary.</p>
