<h1>Only one county in Pa. will remain in yellow COVID-19 reopening phase</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf along with the state health department announced on Friday that 12 more counties, including Erie, will move into the green phase on June 26.</p>
<p>The other counties are Berks, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Lehigh, Montgomery, Northampton, Philadelphia and Susquehanna.</p>
<p>Although Philadelphia has met the criteria set by the state’s health department, local officials have decided to continue to maintain additional restrictions until July 3. Philadelphia has had an additional 128 cases since Thursday.</p>
<p>With Mr. Wolf’s announcement, only one county in the state remains in the yellow phase, Lebanon.</p>
<p>“Case counts have escalated and the county is not yet ready to be reopened,” state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine in a news release. “Lebanon County has hindered its progress by reopening too early.”</p>
<p>In late May, county commissioners there had voted against state health department recommendations and had begun reopening.</p>
<p>An additional eight counties moved into the green phase Friday: Dauphin, Franklin, Huntingdon, Luzerne, Monroe, Perry, Pike and Schuylkill.</p>
<p>According to an analysis done by the CDC, Pennsylvania is one of three states that has seen a 42-day decrease in cases, along with Hawaii and Montana.</p>
<p>Also on Friday Pennsylvania reported 526 new cases of COVID-19, of which 65 are in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Based on new figures, the new statewide total is 80,762.</p>
<p>Erie County saw the highest increase in Western Pennsylvania with 18 new cases, and Allegheny saw the second highest with 16.</p>
<p>That brings the Allegheny County total to 2,138, of which 2,000 are confirmed and 138 are probable cases of the virus.</p>
<p>Allegheny County for the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/2020/06/18/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-29/stories/202006180122" target="_blank">second consecutive day</a>&nbsp;reported zero new deaths as a result of COVID-19 — keeping the total at 177, with 165 cases confirmed and 12 being probable.
