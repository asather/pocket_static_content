<h1>Spring training: JT Riddle shines in leadoff spot as Pirates lose to Tigers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — JT Riddle has made just 14 starts in the leadoff spot during his three-year career. You wouldn’t know it by how he performed during a 8-4 Pirates loss to the Tigers on Sunday in a split-squad game at LECOM Park.</p>
<p>The Pirates signed Riddle for $850,000 on Jan. 31 for extra infield depth, and he made a solid early statement in this one by drawing an 11-pitch walk to start, making a heads-up play on the bases, collecting two hits (including a triple) and scoring a run.</p>
<p>“I want to go out and give everything I’ve got and play as hard as I can for however long I’m out there,” said Riddle, a shortstop who started Sunday’s game at second base. “It’s the way I grew up, the way I’ve always played. Go out and play hard.”</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Derek Holland started and went 1 2/3 innings, striking out five and allowing two earned runs, the first courtesy of a leadoff home run from Detroit center fielder JaCoby Jones.</p>
<p>Holland tinkered with his pitches and kicked himself for not executing his last one — which got hit for a run-scoring double — but all in all came away pleased with the performance.</p>
<p>“I know I’m competing for a job, but I want to make sure I have everything where it needs to be,” Holland said. “If I make this team, I want to be prepared going into the season.”</p>
<p>The game could’ve been framed as an early battle between Holland and Steven Brault for the fifth starter spot, although Brault threw just eight pitches, the result of his slower-than-usual buildup this spring. Those eight pitches were executed well, however, giving Brault and the Pirates a 1-2-3 inning.</p>
<p>Keone Kela was electric in the fourth, striking out the side while hitting 96 mph and mixing in what was a really sharp curveball.</p>
<p>“I definitely wanted to start working on establishing my secondary pitches,” Kela said. “I know I have a fastball, but I also want to get guys off-balance to add more oomph to my fastball.”</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Some interesting stuff from 6-foot-7 shortstop prospect Oneil Cruz, who laced a double the opposite way to score a run in the second, then flailed at a pitch and struck out looking an inning later. In the second, Cruz was a smart read to score on a squibber to the left side from Riddle.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco made his spring debut and went 0-for-2 with a walk, while Luke Maile had a pair of hits and threw out a runner at second base.</p>
<p>Will Craig avoided an injury scare during a botched call in the second inning. The pitch hit Craig in the hand, although home-plate umpire Laz Diaz thought it nicked Craig’s bat. After head athletic trainer and manager Derek Shelton made sure Craig was OK, the first baseman struck out looking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The other group</strong></p>
<p>Trevor Williams gave up four earned runs over two innings in a 4-3 loss to the Phillies at Spectrum Field in Clearwater, Fla. First baseman Jose Osuna finished with two hits, including a run-scoring single in the third inning. Kevin Newman went 1-for-3 with a run scored.</p>
<p>Taking the mound for the first time since April 22, 2019, Nick Burdi pitched 2/3 of an inning, giving up a hit and a walk with one strikeout.</p>
