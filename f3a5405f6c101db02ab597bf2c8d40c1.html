<h1>Port Authority to disinfect vehicles every 24 hours</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After learning of two COVID-19 cases diagnosed in Allegheny County, Port Authority has activated its pandemic plan, at least when it comes to cleaning.</p>
<p>The transit agency will immediately begin disinfecting vehicles every 24 hours, CEO Katharine Kelleman announced Saturday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Port Authority <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/03/12/Port-Authority-Covid-19-coronavirus-disinfect-clean-buses-light-rail-vehicles-stations/stories/202003120145" target="_blank">launched a cleaning program every 72 hours</a> of&nbsp;“high touch” areas on buses and light-rail vehicles but left open the possibility of increasing the frequency as events evolved.</p>
<p>Those areas included&nbsp;poles, pull cords, hand straps, the tops of seats, fare boxes, ConnectCard machines, escalator handrails and elevator buttons.</p>
<p>“We have known that it was simply a matter of when — not if — we would see our first cases,” Ms. Kelleman said in a statement. “Luckily, I have observed firsthand Port Authority’s ability to overcome adversity during challenging times, and I know we will do everything possible to continue to watch out for our riders and for each other.”</p>
<p>Major stations are already being cleaned daily as are ACCESS vehicles on the agency’s paratransit system.</p>
<p>For now, Port Authority’s operations continue as normal.</p>
<p>But, the agency said, if drivers become unavailable,&nbsp;“it may be required to reduce service ad hoc or systemwide.”</p>
<p>Port Authority reminded riders to wash hands or use hand sanitizer after using public transit; change seats if someone nearby appears sick; and sitting and not touching straps or poles when possible.</p>
<p>“Even with increased cleaning, the inescapable reality is that the surfaces of a newly cleaned bus or rail car can no longer be assumed sanitary after passengers have climbed aboard,” Ms. Kelleman said. “But doing simple things like washing our hands and social distancing will have the greatest impact protecting ourselves, our families and our communities.”</p>
