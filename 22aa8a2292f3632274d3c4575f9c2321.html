<h1>The Next Page: A time for ‘tikkun olam’ </h1>

<p>On Fridays, she celebrates Shabbat services at Congregation Emanu-El Israel in Greensburg. On Saturday nights, she leads a Eucharistic liturgy with her religious community. The Torah and the Gospel are integral to the prayer life of Gemma Del Duca, a Sister of Charity at Seton Hill University.</p>
<p>Agile as a track star subsisting on locusts and wild honey, the 88-year-old nun wearing a bright aqua dress and flowing linen scarf hurries me through the labyrinth of Seton Hill’s administration building to the National Catholic Center for Holocaust Education, which she founded in 1987. Dedicated on the 49th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the center continues to evolve with the global mission she envisioned: to study the intellectual roots of the Holocaust so that the horror will never be repeated.</p>
<p>But the murders at the Tree of Life synagogue leave Sister Gemma weighing her life’s work. During the 40 years she lived in Israel, she witnessed terrorist attacks, but the massacres in Squirrel Hill unnerved her beyond any bomb planted in her Jerusalem neighborhood.</p>
<p>“We just don’t expect such things to happen here. The time is desperate for <em>tikkun olam</em>.” She translates the ancient Hebrew to mean “a time for mending of the world, a mending of the walls that keep us separated.”</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Learning from the past</strong></span></p>
<p>Her quest to heal division is apparent at the entrance to the Holocaust Center. Eight-foot multicolored banners frame the doorway and ask big questions: “What will it take for us to accept others despite our differences? Why do we love silently but hate openly?” More than a memorial, the doors open to a creative think tank that ponders the Holocaust for its lessons of bigotry and violence.</p>
<p>The center’s two rooms, mellow with buttery wooden tables, are a trove of books on the Shoah, Israeli art and artifacts. Photographs of mothers comforting children unaware of the burden of their yellow stars are on loan from the archives of Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center in Jerusalem. “We wanted pictures that showed the lives of women,” Sister Gemma points out.</p>
<p>Oddly jarring are six typewriters from the 1930s with broken keys, missing letters and torn ribbons. Limp sheets of foolscap, with only one or two crooked words, wrap around each roller. The installation, a collaboration of Seton Hill art students and faculty, conveys the strangled words of Jews during the Holocaust. “The Shoah is the tragedy of Christianity,” Sister Gemma adds.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Finding a purpose</strong></span></p>
<p>She describes herself as a “prissy young nun” until the ’60s when she began to interpret the signs of the times — the Vietnam War, Vatican II and feminism — in terms of her own life. Her awakening started in 1959 when she was sent to study theology for three years in Rome and enjoyed European travel. She had a two-week break in Israel for $300, but the time wasn’t right to explore. Moreover, she anticipated an appointment to Seton Hill’s history department where she did teach for four years after completing a Ph.D. in Ibero American studies from the University of New Mexico.</p>
<p>But when protests erupted on the streets of Greensburg against the Vietnam War, Sister Gemma came down from the Hill and joined them. She liked the action and began to question her commitment to the lecture hall. To think about her future, she took a job in campus ministry at the University of Virginia where she was in the thick of student unrest while remaining dedicated to the Sisters of Charity at home.</p>
<p>During this time, she read “Nostra Aetate” (“In Our Time”), the document that emerged from the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) calling for more open Catholic-Jewish dialogue. Sister Gemma was drawn to the challenge. In a leap of faith, she moved to Israel in 1975, lived with the Sisters of Sion in the center of Jerusalem and immersed herself for three years studying Judaism.</p>
<p>Once she felt confident in speaking and reading Hebrew, she joined an experimental community in Tel Gamaliel, founded in 1974 by Father Isaac Jacob, a Benedictine priest with the quixotic idea of grafting the ancient Rule of St. Benedict on the kibbutz model. Visitors worldwide traveled to Tel Gamaliel to engage in a communal life of daily prayer, Scripture study and hard labor to cultivate the hardscrabble land. On Shabbat, they read the Torah in Hebrew and English.</p>
<p>To enrich the intellectual experience of the Tel Gamaliel pilgrims, Sister Gemma organized seminars and lectures with scholars from Yad Vashem, where she also was a lecturer. When Pope John Paul II expanded the message of “Nostra Aetate” by urging that all levels of Catholic education should study the Holocaust to teach about the dangers of dictatorship and the causes of anti-Semitism, Sister Gemma knew the time was ripe to connect Seton Hill with Israel.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: large;"><strong>Merciful kindness</strong></span></p>
<p>Always the scholar-entrepreneur, she first tested the water. With her friends Sybil and Charles Schwartz, she created a Shabbat dinner for 300 Sisters of Charity in the Seton Hill gym. Heartened by their enthusiasm, she approached the president of Seton Hill, Dr. JoAnne Boyle, who won the approval of the board of trustees to open a Holocaust Center, with the help of Stanley Gumberg, Robert Davis and Donald Moritz.</p>
<p>Thirty-three years later, the center flourishes with programs and publications that explore how “theological anti-Judaism and social anti-Semitism played a major role in leading to the Shoa.” Hundreds of educators have engaged this topic in conferences at Seton Hill and Yad Vashem, initiated by Sister Gemma. She is the first non-Israeli to receive the Excellence in Holocaust Education Award from Yad Vashem.</p>
<p>But one worry is constant with her: What will happen as the Holocaust recedes in historical memory and survivors disappear? “First there was Charlottesville, then Tree of Life, then San Diego, and New Jersey, and more incidents in New York City — what we prepared against and feared is here.” She vows: “We have to double down. There’s not much time. Whatever happens to the Jews strikes the heart of Christianity.”</p>
<p>Psalm 117, the shortest one, is Sister Gemma’s favorite because she can quickly say it to herself in any contentious moment as a prayer for peace. She begins in English: “Praise the Lord, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people,” but stumbles, and speaks the rest in Hebrew. “For his merciful kindness is great toward us; and the truth of the Lord endureth forever.”</p>
<p>With the wisdom of the Torah and the grace of the Gospel, Sister Gemma has given her life trying to mend a fractured world. Tolerant of her own paradox, she says with quiet wonder: “Without being a nun, I never would have gone to Israel. But without Judaism, I doubt I would have stayed one.”</p>
