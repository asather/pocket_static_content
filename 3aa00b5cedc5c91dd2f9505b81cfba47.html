<h1>Wolf makes budget speech appeal for action on gun violence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf devoted a section of his annual state budget speech on Tuesday to expressing dismay over a lack of action to curb gun deaths, exhorting lawmakers to make this “the year we choose to stop being cynical about the politics of gun violence.”</p>
<p>It was unusual for a governor to devote a lengthy section of the address to a single policy issue, and his audience was a Legislature that has shown little appetite for policies the second-term Democrat supports.</p>
<p>Those proposals, Mr. Wolf said, include universal background checks on gun sales, mandatory reporting for lost or stolen guns, red flag laws to take guns from those at risk of harming someone and better counseling services for troubled schoolchildren.</p>
<p>“Now I know there’s no law that can eliminate every act of gun violence. But the steps I’m proposing are supported by the evidence — and supported by the vast majority of Pennsylvanians,” Mr. Wolf told a joint session of the Legislature. “We can pass them tomorrow, and, by doing so, we could make our commonwealth safer.”</p>
<p>The political divisions and strong feelings that characterize the gun issue across the country are mirrored at the state Capitol, where gun safety and regulation proponents hold regular rallies and the yearly “Right to Keep and Bear Arms Rally” always draws attendees by the busload.</p>
<p>Advocates seeking ways to reduce gun violence argue there is considerable public support for many of their legislative proposals, and widespread support for some of them, while gun-rights activists emphasize the Second Amendment and similar language in the state constitution.</p>
<p>House Republican spokesman Mike Straub said his caucus plans to focus on tougher criminal penalties for criminals convicted of gun crimes.</p>
<p>“Working on gun issues must begin with making sure those who should not have firearms in the first place are held accountable,” Mr. Straub said.</p>
<p>Lawmakers and Mr. Wolf last year set aside $3.2 million for private schools through the Department of Education’s safe schools grant program. The state also has a $60 million public school security grant program established after the high school shooting in Parkland, Fla., a program Mr. Wolf’s budget proposes to cut by 75%.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s budget proposal seeks $6 million in new money to prevent gun violence through a grant program administered by the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency. He also wants another $4 million for a Philadelphia-based gun violence task force.</p>
<p>A rare exception to the general stalemate over gun legislation occurred a few weeks before the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill</a> in October 2018, when Mr. Wolf signed legislation requiring those convicted of misdemeanor crimes of domestic violence or subject to protective orders to give up their guns within 24 hours.</p>
<p>The overall budget, Mr. Wolf’s sixth, would increase spending through the state’s main bank account to $36 billion for the 2020-21 fiscal year starting July 1. Including nearly $600 million in supplemental cash for the current fiscal year, Mr. Wolf is seeking authorization for another $2.6 billion in new spending, or 7.5% more.</p>
<p>Most of the increase would go to rising costs for health care for the poor and long-term care for the elderly and disabled. Public schools and pre-kindergarten programs would get about another $170 million, or 2% more, plus $280 million in savings from changing how charter schools are funded. Meanwhile, the administration wants to require that public schools start providing free, full-time kindergarten.</p>
<p>The plan would hold the line on sales and income taxes, the state’s two biggest sources of revenue. However, the administration is projecting an aggressive 4.5% growth in tax collections, including $240 million bump from restructuring the corporate net income tax. The administration also is seeking new fees on municipalities to pay for state police services and on waste hauling to underwrite a hazardous cleanups program.</p>
<p>Many of the governor’s items face long odds, since Republican lawmakers have reliably rejected Mr. Wolf’s most expansive proposals since he took office in 2015. The plan is already facing objections from the horse-racing industry and charter school proponents.</p>
