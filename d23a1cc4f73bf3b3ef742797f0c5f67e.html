<p><strong>The 72nd Primetime Emmy Awards</strong>&nbsp;—&nbsp;Late-night funny man Jimmy Kimmel is our virtual host for a socially distanced Emmy telecast that will look like no other. Kimmel is set to do the gig from a stage in Staples Center, but there will be no audience (or red carpet), and winners will deliver their acceptance speeches from home. Producers say they want the show to be “live as possible,” potentially cutting to as many as 140 locations worldwide. Technical hiccups? Count on some. As for leading contenders, “Watchmen,” “Ozark,” “Succession” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” top the nominees. (8 p.m. Sunday, ABC).</p>
<p><strong>Other bets:</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong>: The British comedy-drama “Last Tango in Halifax” makes a very welcome return, but there’s some turbulence ahead. After seven years of marriage, Alan (Derek Jacobi) and Celia (Anne Reid) discover that wedded bliss isn’t always blissful. Clashing politics, Alan’s new job and other distractions create lots of tension. (8 p.m., PBS).</p>
<p><strong>Monday</strong>:&nbsp;Kim Cattrall (“Sex and the City”) returns to series television in the sudsy new drama “Filthy Rich.” She plays Margaret Monreaux, the flamboyant wife of a super-rich, New Orleans-based televangelist (Gerald McRaney) who leaves behind some shocking secrets when he goes down in a plane crash. Plenty of devilish shenanigans ensue. (9 p.m., Fox).</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong>:&nbsp;It has become an election year tradition: “Frontline” airs a special called “The Choice.” The two-hour program offers interwoven investigative biographies of Donald Trump and Joe Biden through revealing interviews with those who know the candidates best. Included: Mary Trump, Valerie Biden Owens, Rudy Giuliani, John Bolton and many more. (9 p.m., PBS).</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong>:&nbsp; “I Can See Your Voice,” which premieres right before the Season 4 debut of “The Masked Singer,” puts another weird twist on a singing contest. Host Ken Jeong and celebrity panelists help a contestant weed out the bad singers from a group of six “Secret Voices,” based on a series of clues, interrogation and lip sync challenges. Yeah, we don’t get it, either. (8 p.m., Fox).</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong>: Perhaps you were unable to catch Season 1 of “Star Trek: Discovery” on the CBS All Access streaming service. Now arriving in prime time, the series follows the adventures of First Officer Michael Burnham (Sonequa Martin-Green) and the Starfleet voyagers. (10 p.m., CBS).</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong>: Gillian Flynn (“Gone Girl,” “Sharp Objects”) returns to TV with “Utopia.” It’s an audacious eight-part conspiracy thriller about a group of nerds who are obsessed with a comic book that could contain clues about dire threats to humanity. The cast includes John Cusack and Rainn Wilson. (Amazon Prime).</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong>: In the compelling 2019 film “Just Mercy,” Michael B. Jordan plays a passionate and idealistic young attorney who works hard to overturn the murder conviction of an Alabama inmate (Jamie Foxx). The movie is based on attorney Bryan Stevenson’s memoir. (8 p.m., HBO).</p>
