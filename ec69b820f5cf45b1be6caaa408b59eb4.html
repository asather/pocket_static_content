<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the third day in a row, the Pennsylvania Department of Health has reported a single-day increase of COVID-19 cases over 1,300. Nine new deaths were also reported Friday.</p>
<p>With 1,380 new cases for Friday, the state has had a total of 169,208 people test positive for the respiratory illness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania accounted for 313 of the state’s total cases, with Allegheny County having the highest increase for Friday with 78 new cases, followed by Westmoreland County with 72 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County saw a slight decrease in cases from Thursday.&nbsp;The county’s positive tests were taken between Aug. 24 and Oct. 8, but the majority of the results are from October, according to county health officials.&nbsp;Those who have recently tested positive range in age from 13 to 96 years old, with a median age of 48.</p>
<p>Among those new cases, 70 are confirmed from 1,398 tests while eight are probable. Five of the eight probable cases are from antigen tests.</p>
<p>Since March 14, when the first case was reported in Allegheny, 13,102 people have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>In the last seven days, the county has increased its case count by 576 cases. In the seven days prior — Sept. 27 to Oct. 2 — the county had been relatively close to that number, adding an additional 532 cases.</p>
<p>Allegheny County health director, Dr. Debra Bogen said this week that the county’s case counts have “remained steady.”</p>
<p>Statewide there were nine new deaths reported Friday, six of which were in the Pittsburgh region. Allegheny County reported four of the deaths, and Beaver and Indiana counties reported one death each.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The newly reported deaths in Allegheny included one person in their 60s, one in their 80s and two in their 90s, health officials said.&nbsp;Two of the four deaths are associated with long-term care facilities. The death toll in Allegheny now stands at&nbsp;397.</p>
