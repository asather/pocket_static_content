<h1>Pet Tales: October brings a happy Owl-o-Ween to the National Aviary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While many people look forward to Halloween, October at the National Aviary means two weeks of Owl-o-Ween activities. Bird-lovers can meet owls up close and personal at the North Side bird zoo or hear them in local parks, or do some “virtual birding” from the comfort of home.</p>
<p>All events require advance registration at <a href="https://www.aviary.org/event/owl-o-ween-2020/2020-10-17/" target="_blank">aviary.org</a> and masks and social distancing are required,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Owl-o-Ween is observed on two Saturdays — Oct. 17 and 24 — with trick or treat goody bags, owl-themed craft kits and an Owl Meet and Greet in the theater. These activities are included with general admission.&nbsp;Timed-entry tickets ordered on the website are required and the aviary is open 10 a.m.-4 p.m.</p>
<p>Massive great horned owls, very small and adorable Northern saw-whet owls and other winged raptors fly the skies of Western Pennsylvania and ornithologist Bob Mulvihill will lead twilight Owl Prowls to search for them in their native habitats.&nbsp;Mr. Mulvihill will explain owl behaviors and adaptations. On some of the Owl Prowls, birders have been able to hear owls calling from the trees</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aviary.org/calendar/?search=Owl%20Prowl" target="_blank">Owl Prowls</a> are set for Oct. 16 at Settlers Cabin, Oct. 24 at Glade Run Park and Oct. 18 and 25 at Frick Park. Cost is $15 per person. Recommended for ages 7 and older,&nbsp;Comfortable and sturdy footwear is needed to walk on unpaved, hilly parks. Bring a flashlight and face mask.</p>
<p>Virtual Birding With Bob will be held Oct, 28 at 10-11 a.m. on Zoom. Learn about the hunting skills of owls, habitats, social dynamics and nesting patterns as well learn how to identify their night calls.&nbsp;Cost is $13 for Aviary members and $15 for non-members. Space is limited and advance registration is required.</p>
<p>Owl Encounters are offered daily at 3:30 p.m. for $75 per person, which includes general admission. Visitors don a special glove so they can hold an owl on their arm. They’ll also learn that owls can turn their heads almost all the way around and have special feathers that enable them to fly without making a sound.</p>
<p>Junior Zookeeper Encounters with an owl and an armadillo are every day at 10:30 a.m. for $44 per person, which includes general admission.</p>
<p>General Admission is $17.95 adults, $16.95 seniors and $14.95 for children. Babies and toddlers younger than 2 get in for free.</p>
<p><strong>Virtual gala</strong></p>
<p>Black Tie &amp; Tails has been a major fundraiser for Animal Friends since 1998, but the coronavirus pandemic meant no dancing, dining and cuddling with rescue animals. So the Ohio Township shelter heled its&nbsp;first-ever virtual gala last month, and raised $280,011.</p>
<p>Over 500 guests signed up for an hour-long video presentation and online auction. Guest emcees were Heather Abraham and David Highfield from KDKA-TV. The honorary chair was Gisele Barreto Fetterman, co-founder of several area nonprofits and the wife of Lt. Gov. John Fetterman.&nbsp;Lead sponsor was Fragasso Financial Advisors.</p>
<p><strong>Fluffyjean Flea Market</strong></p>
<p>The Fluffyjean Fund for Felines will hold a flea market on Oct, 17, 10 a.m.-3 p.m. in the parking lot of the 84 Agway, 1025 State Rt. 519, Washington County. Proceeds benefit trap, neuter, vaccinate and return programs for feral cats.</p>
