<h1>Composer Anthony Davis wins music Pulitzer for opera with Pittsburgh ties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Composer Anthony Davis was awarded the <a href="https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/anthony-davis" target="_blank">2020 Pulitzer Prize in Music</a> for his opera “The Central Park Five,” from the production by California’s Long Beach Opera.</p>
<p>Davis should be a familiar name to Pittsburghers, because the opera as a whole, like the composer himself, has connections from classical music to the baseball field.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra premiered and commissioned Davis’ “Tales (Tails) of the Signifying Monkey” in 1998. And adding to his local connections, he is the father of Pirates center fielder Jonah Davis.</p>
<p>Then there is the Pulitzer-winning “The Central Park Five,” which began as “Five” and was first produced by Newark’s Trilogy: An Opera Company in 2016, under the direction of Mark Clayton Southers, founder and leader of Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company.</p>

<p>When the Pulitzer Prize was announced, Trilogy founder and artistic director Kevin Maynor, the renowned bass singer who was featured in the original work, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kevin.maynor.3/posts/10213581598453424" target="_blank">posted on Facebook</a>:&nbsp;“We really have to thank Mark Clayton Southers for his vision of the grand opera ‘Five’ by the Pulitzer winners Anthony Davis and [librettist] Richard Wesley.”</p>
<p>Southers said on Wednesday that he was very pleased for Davis. His contribution to the original production? “I put some things in there that were very visual,” he said.</p>
<p>As an example, he brought in a choreographer to create a dance that started with two gurneys, one holding the soprano who played the Central Park jogger, and, from the other, the victim rising to do a dance.”</p>
<p>He said the staging was “very complicated” because there were so many people, plus an 18-piece orchestra.</p>
<p>The 2019 Long Beach production was renamed and scaled down visually.</p>
<p>Davis told <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/music/the-central-park-five-in-song-composer-anthony-davis-on-his-new-opera/2019/06/19/597a556a-91db-11e9-b570-6416efdc0803_story.html" target="_blank">The Washington Post’s Anne Midgette</a> that is was Trilogy that sparked the opera’s creation.&nbsp;“I wanted to do Amiri Baraka’s ‘Dutchman.’ The director said, ‘I have this libretto that Richard Wesley wrote about the Central Park Five; would you be interested in reading it?’ I thought it had a lot of potential. I had never done an opera with five protagonists before. ... I started looking at what I could do with close harmony for five voices.”</p>
<p>A Los Angeles Times review of the Pulitzer-winning opera said, “He puts a good deal of what makes American music American in his score, particularly roiling jazz. The growling trombone and heckling trumpet could be characters themselves.”</p>
<p>“It was a great experience,” Southers said of the Newark production, one that included a pre-show discussion with actor Danny Glover and Ras Baraka, the mayor of Newark.&nbsp;“Anthony Davis was there as we laid the groundwork and I am very proud of the work we did, and I am happy for him to get his Pulitzer.”</p>
