<h1>Protest outside Massachusetts State House drew hundreds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hundreds of protesters packed Beacon Street outside the Massachusetts State House in Boston on Monday, blasting Gov. Charlie Baker for keeping the state closed due to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The group called for the governor to reopen the state’s economy.</p>
<p>“This is punishment for us daring to dissent,” one protester said through a loudspeaker. “That’s what this is. This is tyranny. This is dictatorship.”</p>

<p>A sign hovered over the crowd that said, “reopen business, close Baker.”</p>
<p>Baker announced last week the non-essential business closures would be extended until at least May 18 and that a reopening advisory board would be tasked with drafting a plan for a phased reopening. Baker also extended his ban on large gatherings of 10 people or more.</p>
<p>“I think all of us believe collectively here that the decisions that we’ve made were the ones that we felt were the best among bad choices,” Baker told reporters Monday afternoon. “We made them based on science and guidance that we got from people who study pandemics and infectious diseases in many different places.”</p>
<p>The Republican governor’s remarks haven’t quelled protesters over the last week. Protesters who gathered to oppose the governor’s closure last week returned with hundreds of supporters Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Deedee Dorrington, a Billerica, Mass., resident who showed up with red-white-and-blue pom-poms, was among the protesters gathered outside of the State House. She worse a mask that said “spiritual gangster.”</p>
<p>Dorrington said she started in Somerville, Mass., with other protesters and arrived shortly after 1:40 p.m.</p>
<p>“My biggest concern here is the collateral damage and the lives that are really being affected,” she told MassLive.</p>
<p>One chief concern of hers is that children who are victims of domestic abuse are now at home without anyone outside to monitor or comfort them. “They’re not having eyes on them, and they aren’t able to keep track of these kids,” she said.</p>
<p>Beacon Street was impassible as people crowded around the front steps of the State House. One person held a sign that said “all jobs, all churches, all freedoms are essential.” Another protester declined to speak with MassLive but held up a photo of a golf ball.</p>
