<h1>Ex-Steelers voice their displeasure with how NFL teams implement Rooney Rule</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The recent slate of NFL coaching hires has reignited a tricky discussion surrounding the league’s Rooney Rule.</p>
<p>The NFL adopted the rule, named after late Steelers owner Dan Rooney, in 2003. According to the rule, NFL teams must interview at least one minority candidate when searching for their next head coach. The <a href="http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000999110/article/nfl-expands-rooney-rule-requirements-to-strengthen-diversity" target="_blank">rule was later expanded</a> to included searches for general manager and equivalent front office positions.</p>
<p>It was meant to ensure that minority candidates would at least get an opportunity to interview for jobs they may otherwise have not gotten a chance to earn. A couple former Steelers aren’t happy with how the rule has been implemented by many NFL franchises.</p>
<p>Former Steelers linebacker James Harrison said earlier this week that he believes teams now only interview minority candidates so they can “check a box,” and that Dan Rooney would “be pissed to see what [his rule] has done.”</p>
<p>That sentiment was shared by former Steelers safety Ryan Clark, who earlier this week called the rule a “formality” for teams before they can talk to the candidates they’re really interested in bringing on as their next head coach.</p>
<p>NFL pundits from across the sports media spectrum have also <a href="https://twitter.com/jtylerconway/status/1214611522657378307" target="_blank">weighed in</a> with <a href="https://twitter.com/stephenasmith/status/1214605449519149056" target="_blank">their displeasure</a> at <a href="https://twitter.com/Marcus_Mosher/status/1214200679474049026" target="_blank">what they feel</a> is a problematic application of the Rooney Rule. The Washington Post <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2020/01/10/black-coaches-are-losing-patience-with-nfls-hiring-process-you-know-you-have-no-shot/" target="_blank">recently published a story</a>&nbsp;with the headline, “Black coaches are losing patience with the NFL’s hiring process: ‘You know you have no shot.’ ”</p>
<p>Currently, there are only three black head coaches — Anthony Lynn with the Los Angeles Chargers, Brian Flores in Miami and, of course, Mike Tomlin in Pittsburgh — and one Latino coach (Washington’s Ron Rivera) in the NFL. As a comparison, there were&nbsp;eight head coaches of color — seven black plus Rivera — at the beginning of the 2018 season.</p>
<p>During this latest round of head-coaching hires, teams did not hire any black head coaches. Washington went with Rivera, Carolina replaced Rivera with former Baylor coach Matt Rhule, the Cowboys hired former Packers coach (<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/06/dallas-cowboys-coaching-search-news-rumors-mike-mccarthy/stories/202001060053" target="_blank">and Pittsburgh native</a>) Mike McCarthy and the Giants brought in former Patriots special teams coordinator/receivers coach Joe Judge.</p>
<p>The last team left in need of a head coach is the Browns, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/29/Freddie-Kitchens-fired-browns-steelers-bengals-AFC/stories/201912290158" target="_blank">fired Freddie Kitchens</a> almost immediately after Cleveland’s season ended. So far, the only minority coach they are known to have interviewed is Chiefs offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy, though it looks like <a href="https://twitter.com/JFowlerESPN/status/1215719280039333894" target="_blank">they’re leaning toward</a> hiring either Patriots offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels or Vikings offensive coordinator Kevin Stefanski.</p>
