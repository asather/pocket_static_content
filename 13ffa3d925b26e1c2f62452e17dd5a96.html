<h1>Some without power after high winds blow through Western Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As high winds made their way through the area overnight Saturday and into Sunday, the electric utilities serving the region have reported outages.</p>
<p>Duquesne Light said — as of noon — it has 29 outages affecting 557 customers.</p>
<p>The majority of those customers are in Beechview, Hopewell, Penn Hills and Shaler.</p>
<p>West Penn Power is reporting that — as of 11:55 a.m. — 6,400 of its 2 million customers statewide are without power.</p>
<p>The utility said customers in the following counties were without power:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Allegheny, 96</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Beaver, 250</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Butler, 389</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Fayette, 123</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Washington, 38</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Westmoreland, 202</p>
<p>The winds may have been responsible for a fire in West Oakland.</p>
<p>No one was hurt after power lines fell onto the roof and started a fire at a building on the corner of Robinson and Terrace Streets, according to the city’s public safety department.</p>
<p>No one was inside the building when the fire started around 4 a.m.</p>
<p>Firefighters had to wait for Duquesne Light to shut off power to the building before they could battle the blaze, the city said.</p>
<p>The cause of the fire remains under investigation.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service canceled the wind advisory shortly before 10 a.m. Sunday. It had been scheduled to end at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>“The winds are decreasing. We canceled the wind advisory early,” said Jenna Lake, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service.&nbsp;“The system is moving east, so things have calmed down significantly (here) over the last couple hours.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Lake said the region’s highest wind gust — 56 mph -—was recorded at Butler County Airport. A wind gust of 45 mph was recorded at Pittsburgh International Airport. A gust of 52 mph was measured at Washington County’s airport. And in Sewickley, a gust was recorded at 51 mph.</p>
<p>Sunday’s high will be lower than Saturday’s record-high, but still above the average.</p>
<p>Temperatures today are expected to peak around 45 degrees. Tonight’s low will be around 34 as winds continue to calm.</p>
<p>On Monday, temperatures will rise again and reach near 52.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Pittsburgh hit 70 degrees, breaking the all-time record of 68 degrees on Jan. 11, set in 1890, according to the National Weather Service.</p>
<p>It also marked the first time the temperature reached 70 or higher in the month of January since 2005, said meteorologist Jenna Lake.</p>
