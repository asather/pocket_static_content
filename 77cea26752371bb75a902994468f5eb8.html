<h1>Pittsburgh parks ranked 15th in nation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s city parks jumped several spots higher and now rank number 15 in the nation, according to a California-based nonprofit that measures the quality of urban green space and its closeness to residents, amenities, access acreage and investment.</p>
<p>The San Francisco-based Trust for Public Land gave the city’s parks an 88 out of 100 for access based on its calculation that 92% of residents live within a 10-minute walk from a park.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto has repeatedly cited park access as a goal of his administration.</p>
<p>The organization also awarded the city a 79 for investment.</p>
<p>In November, voters narrowly passed a property tax hike that will be used to fund the city’s parks.</p>
<p>The nonprofit Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy petitioned for the ballot referendum, which Mr. Peduto supported.</p>
<p>City Council has not yet approved enabling legislation to establish the trust fund for the new tax revenue.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s parks ranked 22nd on the national list in 2019, and 39th in 2016.</p>
