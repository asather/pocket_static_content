<h1>West Mifflin offers options for schooling </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The West Mifflin Area School District is offering options for its students and parents as the start of the school year approaches.</p>
<p>The choices, outlined in a July 16 letter sent to parents by Assistant Superintendent Jeffrey Solomon, include full-time in-house instruction with mitigation, such as the wearing of face coverings by all students and staff while in the buildings and on the school bus. Students and staff with a medical reason preventing them from wearing masks will be exempt.</p>
<p>If the state remains in the green phase, students will be allowed to ride the bus. If Pennsylvania moves back to yellow, the number of students allowed to ride the bus will be restricted.</p>
<p>A survey of district parents stated about 41% of parents would be willing to drive their children to school.</p>
<p>In the classroom, the district is working on ways to maximize space by arranging desks to limit face-to-face contact. Hand sanitizer will also be readily available.</p>
<p>In the cafeteria, Mr. Solomon said, “Food preparation and distribution may look a little different than the norm,” and cleaning and sanitizing will be done on a more frequent specialized basis.</p>
<p>Another option would be to utilize the district’s remote learning program. The district uses the online learning platform Schoology for its remote learning.</p>
<p>“Schoology is a learning management system that allows teachers K-12 to engage students by organizing and managing academic content such as uploading calendars, creating assignments, posting homework and more,” Mr. Solomon stated in the letter.</p>
<p>Parents will have the ability to monitor their children’s assignments and progress and receive notifications. School lessons will align with in-house teaching and are monitored and created by the individual classroom teachers. Students who choose this option will also be able to participate in all school-sponsored activities.</p>
<p>Finally, parents will have the option to send students to the new West Mifflin Cyber Academy — the district’s own cyber school option, which is based in Edgenuity, another learning management system. Courses will be taught by West Mifflin teachers.</p>
<p>The district is asking parents to fill out an online form by July 31 if their child is interested in remote learning. Students who do remote learning will do so for nine-week periods at a time and will be have the option to transition to in-person instruction on campus at the end of each nine-week period.</p>
<p>The district is also asking parents who are willing to transport their children to school to fill out a bus transportation opt-out form by July 31. Forms are available on the district’s website at http://​wmasd.org.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the school board, at its Monday virtual meeting, tabled a motion to appoint a new district superintendent, citing the need for more paperwork to be filed.</p>
<p>There was a motion to appoint Jeffrey Soles, the current superintendent in the Blairsville-Saltsburg School District, to replace acting Superintendent Mark Hoover, who retired earlier this summer.</p>
<p>“There’s some documentation that needs to be done appropriately and filled out completely before we move forward,” said Krisha DiMascio, the district solicitor, in recommending the hold.</p>
<p>Board President Tony DiCenzo said tabling the motion was not an indication another person would be selected.</p>
<p>“We are all aware of the importance of this decision and getting this individual in as soon as possible, especially with the current circumstances,” he said. “He’s our guy, and he’s the selected candidate for a reason, and we’re looking forward to getting him here as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The board is to meet Monday to take up the superintendent matter.</p>
