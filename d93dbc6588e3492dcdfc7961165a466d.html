<h1>Governors ask for one-year extension of REAL ID requirements due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The National Governors Association has joined Pennsylvania’s call for federal officials to delay implementation of the REAL ID program scheduled to begin Oct. 1.</p>
<p>In a letter to the federal Department of Homeland Security late Tuesday, the association asked for a one-year delay in the program. In addition to states concentrating time and resources on fighting the COVID-19 virus, the governors said they believe there should be changes to the 2005 law requiring the change because of technology improvements since then.</p>
<p>Without an extension, anyone wanting to pass through airport security or enter most federal buildings would need a REAL ID license or identification card or a valid passport. In response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks, federal law requires states to issue&nbsp;new licenses or ID cards that are more difficult to duplicate.</p>
<p>“We remain concerned about the prolonged impact of the [COVID-19 virus] on our states and territories, supply chains, the travel industry and the economy,” the letter said. “On behalf of the nations’ governors, we urge the Department of Homeland Security to institute an extension of the REAL ID program for no less than one year.</p>
<p>“We believe an extension will allow all of us to focus our efforts on combatting the spread and severity of COVID-19. More time will also give Congress the ability to pass legislation that will update the 2005 REAL ID Act and bring it up to speed with today’s technology.”</p>
<p>Yassmin Gramian, acting secretary for the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation, asked for an extension of the deadline Friday as a result of the virus. The state has estimated it has issued REAL ID licenses or ID cards to about two-thirds of the people they expect to want it.</p>
<p>The governors association said a one-year delay would allow Congress to update the standards in the existing law to allow cards to be issued quicker, ensure better education of citizens, provide more resources to reach compliance and use technological improvements since the original law was passed. Cards already issued would remain compliant.</p>
