<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 05.06.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi folks. Welcome to my weekly chat. We'll get started at noon, but feel free to leave those questions. Thanks, as always, for participating.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Pirates are better suited for this financial chaos? Or Will it only get worse? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's a tough one to answer. Better suited than ... I supposed they're better suited than some teams, although not many. This situation is obviously no good for anyone, but baseball's economic system -- which is always bad, in my opinion -- feels especially rotten right now. Teams like the Pirates, Rays, A's, etc., obviously they're going to have it worse than the Cubs, Yankees and Red Sox. Then again, we're also not crying poor about the Penguins. There are ways to handle it, and it's naive to think that something like this won't affect the Pirates and how much they spend.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: What do you think of the pirates bullpen? I think they got some really good arms out there, a mixture of some with real good velocity others with good movement. Iâ€™m hoping cederlind makes the team <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Ricky. You bring up an interesting point, one I probably haven't thought of before. One, I like their bullpen a lot, too -- assuming everyone can stay healthy. I think it's entirely possible they could have one of the top 10 in baseball, if not cracking the top five. I like Kela, Crick, Rodriguez, Burdi and Santana a lot. If Feliz can get a little more consistent, maybe someone establishes himself as a solid lefty ... you have other guys like Holmes, Brault, Erlin, maybe Holland, Stratton ... there are options. As for Cederlind, it's an interesting thought. Rosters are sure to expand because of the schedule. Cederlind is very close. I would have to think they consider keeping him around, starting him out in some low-leverage situations and seeing how he does. He's certainly close.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: What do you think if major league rosters get expanded out to let's say 30 players. Shouldnt at the beginning of each series announce which players are active and which are on reserve? Such as 2 of the starting pitchers be on reserve in a 3 game series. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi wvpirate. I think 30 is almost certain. I have a tough time seeing them be any smaller than that. As for series, I don't see why you would have to do anything before a series. A 30-man roster would be the same as 26, just with four more players. And no, I'm not trying to be a smart [mouth]. Just making the point that if someone on your 30-man gets hurt, then you can call someone up. The trick will be, "From where?" Since there will almost assuredly be no minor league season, I'm expecting teams to have sort of a taxi squad of guys who are ready (and quarantined, if necessary) should anything happen.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: Nick Kingham seemed like the Nick Kingham we all know and love the other night. Your thoughts on his performance? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ha. He went 7 innings, gave up 3 runs. I get that it's the KBO, but that's not exactly awful. After hearing Tyler Glasnow (and others talk) about the former Pirates regime, I'm really hesitant to blame anything solely on the player. I was admittedly more wrapped up in the Dinos -- bonus points for the KBO talk, BTW -- so I'm excited to really focus on his next outing.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Can we solely blame the coronavirus for the delayed announcement by the Pirates regarding their deep dive i <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: What do you mean the announcement about their deeper dive?</p>
<p><strong>maz01</strong>: Hi Jason, what becomes of the AAA players or guys that are top 10 prospects such as Hayes, Cruz etc. Will they have like a taxi(development squad) that will stay with the team and practice with the team or will they make the 30 man roster? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it will be case-by-case. I think Hayes is the most interesting because maybe you could make Moran your DH and start Hayes at third if you feel he's ready. You probably have a middle infield mix that includes Cole Tucker. You have to figure, if they go with 30, at least two of those spots will be taken by pitchers because of guys not being built up all the way. I just think it'll be case-by-case. I certainly think Hayes will be around in a taxi squad setting, but someone like Quinn Priester might benefit more from working out at the facility and pitching in intrasquad games. Excellent question, maz01.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: Any update if the June draft is still happening on time? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's not a hard-and-fast update, but I expect it to happen in June, yes. I've been hearing June for the draft and June 10 for a potential spring training 2.0 startup date; however, that's very, very speculative, hence why I'm not "reporting" it and simply throwing it out there as something baseball people have seemingly been talking a lot about.</p>
<p><strong>A retired fan</strong>: So it's May 6 and no concrete proposals or time frame to start the season. Then what is the "drop dead" date where there is no season? Seems to me any start after July 1 is ludicrous. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: We're nowhere near the point where you should be worrying about a drop dead date, honestly. Even if baseball would have to wait into August and would only be able to get a half-season in, I think it still makes sense to do something. I also think they would try. I think the only way they don't is if it stretches into, say, September. Starting a season then would be kinda tough.</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: Do you expect a expanded playoffs if MLB has a season? Also do you see the pirates as having a chance to get in? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I do think they will roll out expanded playoffs, for a couple reasons. One, it's money. And everyone will want to make as much of that as possible. Two, it's not going to be 162 games. It might be 80-100 honestly. Expanding the playoffs essentially provides a bit of a safety net so teams like the Nationals last year aren't excluded simply because they had a bad start.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Should we blame the coronavirus for the delayed Pirates announcement regarding ballpark experience changes made to PNC Park prior to the 2020 season? Knowing may have swayed my decision to roll over my season tickets <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I'm not sure, honestly. I know what you're saying now. Travis Williams said back in February they would be rolling out a series of changes/upgrades to the fan experience in the next 20-30 days. Believe the only thing we heard is they're upgrading the seats and offering cheaper tickets for kids. Great gestures, sure, but I'm not sure I'd describe it as some sort of roll out.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: He got away with a few pitches that major leaguers would have put over the fence I thought. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Entirely possible. It's also possible he may be bad, and it's possible it was just one outing. We don't know. That's why I think it'll be interesting to watch it play out.</p>
<p><strong>Jaff Decker</strong>: Do you see many trades going down in baseball once the freeze ends? Could the pirates still make any trades or sign somebody? Bring puig to da burg <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Haha. Man. The Puig love is intense. I think you might see some trades once the freeze ends, sure, but I really don't see the Pirates bringing in Yasiel Puig. And, to be fair, I don't see why it makes a ton of sense for them. I don't see them as realistically being able to go anywhere in the postseason next year; so, why bother? Use what you have. If you must, use those reps to help Jared Oliva or Jason Martin improve. Maybe those guys can become something at this level. Who knows.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thoughts on the pirates lineup? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi self. If today was opening day -- dear God I wish it was -- here's how I would probably go: SS Newman, LF Reynolds, 2B Frazier, 1B Bell, RF Polanco, DH Moran, 3B Hayes, CF Dyson, C Stallings. ... If not Hayes, then I might think about involving Tucker in some way, either at third or moving Newman to third. I'd probably keep Will Craig around and give him a few chances, but he didn't do a ton in spring, not enough to say I need to start him yet on opening day.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: If players report back to spring training would they be playing games against other teams? If so, would these games be on tv? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's a good question. A lot is up in the air right now. Also, they may not report back to spring training. They easily could wind up doing it here. They also might not play games, thus no TV. I wish I could give you a concrete description of what this will look like, but shoot, I don't even know it would include me at this point. I do have a tough time, though, seeing them implement any sort of substantive travel right off the bat.</p>
<p><strong>Bva</strong>: Bell extension??? Anyone??? Like a Taillon Ext??? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi BVA. I'm not sure of your question. I did write about Bell recently, though. Hopefully this answers it: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/29/josh-bell-contract-pirates-mlb-coronavirus-pandemic/stories/202004290051" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/29/josh-bell-contr...</a> <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Or, of course, feel free to fire back with something a little more specific.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: Who should be the first inductees into the Pirates Hall of Fame? If that happens this year <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think I would go Roberto Clemente, personally. That's a tough one. Why do we only have to pick one? Can't we pick a class? I suppose you couldn't go wrong with Honus Wagner, Clemente, Willie Stargell or Derek Bell. But I would just do it as a group.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Flay</strong>: What all pirates do you see getting extended? I would like to see musgrove and kela <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't see Kela signing anything long-term here. Best-case for him, I think the season resumes, he pitches well, and another team trades for him at the deadline. Even if he's not traded, he can leave after the year, and I think he will. Musgrove is a different story. I think he likes it here. I think he's a really good dude and someone who represents the Pirates well. I think he still has considerable upside, too. It makes sense for them to try and keep Joe. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Secondarily, I see them trying to keep Reynolds and Newman. Hopefully Bell. Hayes is another they've chatted with and could still do something. That wouldn't surprise me.</p>
<p><strong>Murray</strong>: As this pandemic has helped look past the astros, do you think it will help put the Felipe Vazquez mess a little further behind us and focus on the future a little bit more? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't focus on Felipe Vasquez at all. Not because it's unimportant; it's the furthest thing from that. But the guy isn't gonna pitch in MLB again. So why waste your time with someone like that?</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: How do you see MLB deciding what teams you play on your regular season schedule? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think there are a number of directions this could go, Butch. I think it depends on the return-to-play plan. If it's everyone in Arizona, then maybe they try and keep the same schedule, although that would be really hard. The three-division plan, that would obviously require a brand-new schedule. I think they need to determine the plan first, then figure out how to handle scheduling.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: I'd keep Craig in the majors, late inning defensive replacement at 1B <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: That's fine. And he's a good defender. But he needs to improve as a hitter. How's he going to do that without getting regular at-bats, even if they're in intrasquad games? (That said, I might keep Craig up here. I would just play him, DH Bell and let Craig work through some stuff, provided I think he can handle that happening at the major league level, which I do.)</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: Like the idea of playing Craig and DHing Bell <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The defense would work. I think it would depend on whether Craig hits. He didn't have a great spring.</p>
<p><strong>PhillyJake</strong>: I'm not one for talking about extensions, so I'll ask an extension question: With the historically low payroll, why not try to sign Bell to a front loaded contract? Let's say a 7 year contract at $10m a year with a $25m signing bonus. Or something like that. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't understand why you wouldn't sign Bell to any sort of contract, unless he wanted like $150/million a year or something insane. I do understand waiting until next offseason just to make sure, and maybe that's what they're doing, but you don't build a consistent winner by letting your best players walk. I know I'm not breaking news with the Pirates, but Ben Cherington and Travis Williams know better than that. My expectation is for that sort of stuff to change. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. That's going to do it for this week. Thank you for participating. This was a lot of fun. Let's do it again in seven days!</p>
