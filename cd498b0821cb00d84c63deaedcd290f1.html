<h1>Paul Zeise: National media's obsession with Ben Roethlisberger is bizarre</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite being the Steelers’ most high profile player, Ben Roethlisberger hasn’t always been the greatest teammate.&nbsp;Heck, Roethlisberger, himself, said as much when he broke his silence last year after he was roasted on the national hot take shows for allegedly being a meanie to that poor victim, Antonio Brown.</p>
<p>I don’t think Roethlisberger is without sin or above criticism. He and the Steelers also probably&nbsp;didn’t win as much as they should have when Brown and Le’Veon Bell were around too.</p>
<p>That being said, I don’t quite understand how Roethlisberger has become such a lightning rod for all of these national hot take shows. It seems bizarre, actually, that in a league with plenty of material that Roethlisberger continues to be the subject of these attacks.</p>
<p>The latest came this week from national analyst Fox Sports’ Jay Glazer, who wrote that, essentially, Roethlisberger is out of shape and has never been committed to being in shape.</p>
<p>“First of all, let’s not put the words fitness and Ben Roethlisberger together, they are allergic to each other. There is no fitness in Ben Roethlisberger,” <a href="https://theathletic.com/1795259/2020/05/05/glazers-nfl-mailbag-is-jarrett-stidham-the-qb-of-the-future-in-new-england/" target="_blank">Glazer wrote</a>. “His idea of a great offseason workout program is doing one yoga session, playing golf and drinking some beer.”</p>
<p>ESPN had a similar sentiment recently after not so flattering photos of Roethlisberger working out surfaced.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And then Nate Burleson from the NFL Network said Roethlisberger is now the Steelers general manager, or something to that effect.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“Big Ben somewhat orchestrated them not taking a QB ... they should have went QB,” Burleson said recently. “But look what happened a couple of drafts ago with Mason Rudolph ... Big Ben wasn’t going to mentor him ... Big Ben is influencing the moves the Steelers make.”</p>
<p>Add all this to the fact that all of these hot take shows have spent an inordinate amount of time linking every quarterback with a pulse, including Aaron Rodgers, to the Steelers, and one has to wonder — why are all these people so fixated on Roethlisberger?</p>
<p>I don’t understand it, especially since Roethlisberger is no longer one of the premier players in the NFL. He isn’t one of the top three or five quarterbacks in the NFL anymore. His team isn’t coming off a playoff season. Why bring him up at all?</p>
<p>I don’t have an answer, other than one of two things: One, they are bored and Roethlisbeger makes a good whipping boy. Or two, their feelings are still hurt because they all looked so stupid by creating a victim out of Brown and making it seem like Roethlisberger was the problem child in the organization.</p>
<p>That second theory has probably been tough for many of them to absorb seeing as they spent so much time promoting Brown and trying to create a narrative that turned out to be wrong. Of course, those of us locally tried to warn them that Brown wasn’t worthy of any sympathy and would likely blow up no matter where he went, but they didn’t want to listen.</p>
<p>Regardless, though, the seemingly monthly, sometimes weekly, bizarre Roethlisberger story coming out by someone in the national media has reached a sad&nbsp;level and needs to stop.</p>
