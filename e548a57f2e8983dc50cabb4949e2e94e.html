<p>WASHINGTON — With the approval of an additional <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/04/23/coronavirus-aid-package-stimulus-House-Congress-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi/stories/202004230139" target="_blank">$310 billion in loan money</a>, Congress has made it easier for small businesses to access federal emergency loans amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said Thursday during the Post-Gazette’s&nbsp;“Politically Inclined” podcast.</p>
<p>In the latest bill, Congress has set aside $60 billion for smaller lenders. Half of that money will be allocated to community development financial institutions, which in Pittsburgh include Bridgeway Capital, Northside Community Development Fund and the East End Food Co-op Federal Credit Union, Mr. Doyle said. Another $30 billion is allocated for mid-sized banks and credit unions.</p>
<p>“These are smaller lending institutions that are closer to the mom-and-pop and small businesses that really, I believe, were largely left out from the initial funding,” Mr. Doyle said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle spoke with the podcast, which publishes Friday online, as he prepared to cast a vote in support of the bill that replenished the Paycheck Protection Program.&nbsp;The small business loan program — passed as part of the $2.3 trillion economic rescue plan signed on March 27 — initially offered $349 billion of fully forgivable loans for small business’ payroll costs and other operational expenses through June 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the loan money was depleted in about two weeks, and many small businesses complained of being crowded out by public companies and hotel and restaurant chains operated by a large ownership group.</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle said he recently had a teleconference meeting with about 30 restaurants in Pittsburgh to hear their concerns about being shut out from the loan money. He suggested that there may be a need for a separate loan program tailored to the smallest businesses.</p>
<p>“I’m talking about the small mom-and-pop restaurants, too, because a lot of times these guys get thrown in with the big hotel chains,” Mr. Doyle said. “When I think of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh, they’re primarily family-run restaurants.”</p>
<p>Mr. Doyle was joined by every member of the Pennsylvania Congressional delegation in voting Thursday to approve the legislation, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/04/23/coronavirus-aid-package-stimulus-House-Congress-Donald-Trump-Nancy-Pelosi/stories/202004230139" target="_blank">President Donald Trump has pledged to sign</a>. In addition to more loan money, the legislation contained an additional $75 billion in aid to hospitals and an additional $25 billion to increase testing nationwide.</p>
