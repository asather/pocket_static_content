<h1>Drug lord execution 3rd this week; Rep. facing charges quits committees; Ex-assistant charged in tech exec’s slaying</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. government on Friday put to death an Iowa chemistry student-turned-meth kingpin convicted of killing five people, capping a week in which the Trump administration restored federal executions after a 17-year hiatus.</p>
<p>Dustin Honken, 52, who prosecutors said killed key witnesses to stop them from testifying in his drugs case, received a lethal injection at the Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Ind. Two others were also put to death during the week after a hiatus of nearly 20 years, including Wesley Purkey. His lawyers contended he had dementia and didn’t know why he was being executed.</p>
<p>The first in the spate of federal executions happened Tuesday, when Daniel Lewis Lee was put to death for killing a family in the 1990s as part of a plot to build a whites-only nation. Lee’s execution, like Purkey’s, went ahead only after the U.S. Supreme Court gave it a green light in a 5-4 decision.</p>
<p>Honken, who had been on death row since 2005, was pronounced dead at 4:36 p.m. The inmate — known for his verbosity at hearings and for a rambling statement declaring his innocence at sentencing — spoke only briefly, neither addressing victims’ family members nor saying he was sorry. His last words were, “Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for me.”</p>
<p><strong>Rep. facing charges quits committees</strong></p>
<p>Kansas Republican Rep. Steve Watkins announced Friday he will voluntarily step down from his committee assignments in the U.S. House in the face of felony charges filed against him this week.</p>
<p>The decision to relinquish his committee posts comes as political allies have started distancing themselves from the first-term congressman. He’s become increasingly isolated in both Kansas and Washington, losing both committee roles and endorsements.</p>
<p>Fellow Kansas Republican Rep. Ron Estes endorsed one of his primary opponents Thursday. On Friday, Kansans For Life, the state’s leading anti-abortion group, pulled its endorsement of Mr. Watkins ahead of the Aug. 4 primary — a stunning rebuke of an incumbent who has voted consistently for the group’s agenda.</p>
<p>The Topeka freshman faces three felony charges stemming from an investigation into whether he voted in the wrong city council district in last year’s municipal election.</p>
<p><strong>Ex-assistant charged in tech exec’s slaying</strong></p>
<p>An executive assistant to global tech magnate Fahim Saleh was charged Friday with the grisly murder of his boss after embezzling $100,000 from the multimillionaire victim — whose dismembered and decapitated corpse sat for two days inside a ritzy Manhattan condo, police said.</p>
<p>Former employee Tyrese Devon Haspil, 21, was charged with second-degree murder in the death of the 33-year-old tech CEO, discovered Tuesday in the living room of his $2 million Lower East Side apartment, said New York Police Chief of Detectives Rodney Harrison in a brief news conference.</p>
<p>Mr. Saleh was attacked at about 1:45 p.m. Monday as he exited a private elevator into his seventh-floor apartment. The dead man’s cousin made the gruesome discovery a day later, Chief Harrison said.</p>
