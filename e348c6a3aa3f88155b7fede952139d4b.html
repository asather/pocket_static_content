<h1>Return to Colorado a reminder of grind to NHL for Andrew Agozzino</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DENVER – Many good memories came to mind for Andrew Agozzino on Thursday when he walked into Pepsi Center and took a twirl around the ice.</p>
<p>Agozzino first clawed out a footing in pro hockey in 2012-13 with the Lake Erie Monsters, then the American Hockey League affiliate for the Colorado Avalanche. He made his NHL debut for the Avalanche two seasons later. And after a stint with St. Louis, he returned to Colorado, skating for the Eagles of the AHL.</p>
<p>“I played in the organization for six years. So I pretty much know everyone top to bottom, both the staff and personnel,” he said after a Penguins practice. “It’s a big chunk of my professional career so, yeah, there’s a lot of roots here.”</p>
<p>Last season, for the first time, Agozzino stuck around at the NHL level for a little while. He played 11 games and on Feb. 19, 2019, scored his only career NHL goal at Pepsi Center, where the Penguins will play the Avalanche on Friday.</p>
<p>“Any time you get to play a former team, it’s exciting. You want to play well,” he said. “It’s another big game for us. But I’m sure it will be an exciting night.”</p>
<p>The center joined the Penguins organization last summer, feeling comfortable with management and believing he could eventually earn a role with the NHL club. A slew of injuries in Pittsburgh got him promoted earlier than he expected. But his call-up lasted one game. He logged less than two minutes Oct. 10.</p>
<p>“We were still going through an adjustment process with some of the new players we had .... We were going through [injuries] at the same time. So we had a lot of guys coming in and out of the lineup,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “To his defense, there wasn’t a lot of control on his part in his first experience.”</p>
<p>Agozzino returned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and with 14 goals and 31 points in 35 games, the 29-year-old was recently named the AHL team’s lone All-Star.</p>
<p>“It’s been a really good start to the season,” he said. “I had some great chemistry with linemates there, with [Sam] Miletic for the most part and [Stefan] Noesen early on. [Coach Mike] Vellucci lets us play our game and empowers us to be confident and comfortable out there. So I think that’s helped me big time.”</p>
<p>The Penguins recalled him on Monday and he played close to 10 minutes in their 4-3 win in Las Vegas on Tuesday, likely earning him another game Friday.</p>
<p>“I thought he had a strong game the other night,” Sullivan said Thursday, adding, “I think he’s been one of the best players in Wilkes-Barre to this point, if not the best player. He brings a different dimension than some of the other guys we’ve had up. He’s a good playmaker. He has good offensive instincts.”</p>
<p><strong>Top-liner Kahun having fun</strong></p>
<p>Dominik Kahun is expected to skate on the top line against the Avalanche. Kahun, who was initially promoted to play with Evgeni Malkin and Bryan Rust during last Saturday’s win in Montreal, had a goal and an assist Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It’s a huge opportunity and I love to play with those guys. They make it easy for me if I’m playing good. I thought we had a great third period there in Montreal when it all started,” he said. “The [Vegas] game we also scored. So it’s fun.”</p>
<p>Sullivan praised the young winger for his instincts, playmaking and scoring ability. But he also made it clear that Kahun’s top-line role is not set in stone.</p>
<p>“We’ve got a number of candidates,” he said. “We’re trying to, obviously, surround Geno with people that can help him be successful and in turn it helps us be successful. But we’re also trying to create some balance through our lineup.”</p>
<p><strong>Another day off for Crosby?</strong></p>
<p>Sidney Crosby was not among a small group of Penguins players who took the ice at Pepsi Center around lunchtime Friday. Crosby, after skating hard in Las Vegas on Tuesday and Wednesday, was given a scheduled day off Thursday.</p>
<p>Sullivan may have an update when he speaks with the media before the game.</p>
<p>Crosby last played for the Penguins on Nov. 9. He had sports hernia surgery five days later. Entering Friday, the team was 16-6-4 without the captain.</p>
