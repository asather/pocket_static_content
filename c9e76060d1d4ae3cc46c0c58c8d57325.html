<h1>Citing soaring unemployment, Casey calls for boost in Medicaid dollars based on economic factors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — As states contend with shrinking tax revenue and growing health care needs amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., is dusting off legislation proposed during the 2008 financial crisis: an automatic increase of federal Medicaid dollars to states as their unemployment rate rises.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey on Tuesday introduced the Coronavirus Medicaid Response Act, which uses a formula to determine individual states’ unemployment pressure point and delivers federal Medicaid assistance in proportion with the economic pain.</p>
<p>Under the formula, Pennsylvania would receive roughly $2 billion per quarter in additional aid if the unemployment rate would register at 10% during the three months ending June 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Casey said the arrangement would create a quicker and more responsive federal process for supporting state Medicaid programs, which reimburse health care provided primarily to low-income and elderly patients. Given the steep financial challenges states have seen in previous economic downturns, he said, Medicaid funding should be independent of Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The problem is, that determination [to increase Medicaid dollars]&nbsp;becomes a question of how may votes you can line up,” Mr. Casey said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It just doesn’t make sense to allow something as fundamental as Medicaid and the matching dollars to be at the whim of whoever is in power, as opposed to having a good program’s benefits be triggered by economic trauma,” he said.</p>
<p>In March, Congress approved a temporary increase in Medicaid funds for the life of the public health emergency. Both parties came together to pass legislation totaling more than $3 trillion in spending.&nbsp;Mr. Casey wants a permanent, more precise change.</p>
<p>It is not a new argument. More than a decade ago, Jay Rockefeller, the long-serving West Virginia Democratic senator, unsuccessfully pushed fellow lawmakers to support automatic payments during the recession.</p>
<p>Adjustments to the payments — doled out using a system known as FMAP, or the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage — remained the sole discretion of Congress. Historically, lawmakers have rarely given benefits a significant boost.</p>
<p>Then as now, Mr. Casey’s measure faces an “uphill battle” in the Republican-controlled Senate, the senator acknowledged. But he said this time could be different.</p>
<p>Both Democratic and Republican governors are contending with dual health care and economic crises. The COVID-19 pandemic has exposed long-standing shortcomings in Medicaid funding for health providers like nursing homes. And Medicaid-focused providers waited months to receive their chunk of provider aid approved by Congress.</p>
<p>“The lesson I learned from the Great Recession is you’ve got to go big to jump-start the economy and get it out of the ditch,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>“The danger here is we compound the problem of a public health and jobs crisis by penny-pinching when it comes to a program like Medicaid,” he said. “It will make every problem worse.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey is hoping to build momentum for his bill as Congress is set to consider a fourth round of major COVID-19 legislation in July.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey’s legislation was co-sponsored by 12 Senate Democrats, including Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, and endorsed by 22 think tanks, labor unions and health care organizations, including UPMC. A House version of the measure was introduced in April by Rep. Susie Lee, D-Nev.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-16-377T" target="_blank">2016 report from the Government Accountability Office</a> found the current aid distribution model, which is based on each state’s per-capita income, to be a “poor proxy for both the size of a state's population in need of Medicaid services and the ability of a state to fund Medicaid.”</p>
<p>This is especially true during economic downturns, the GAO report found. It recommended&nbsp;basing assistance on increases in a state’s unemployment and reductions in total wages and salaries of its workers.</p>
<p>From February through May, Medicaid enrollment in Pennsylvania grew by 118,000 people, or about 4.2%, the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services <a href="https://www.media.pa.gov/Pages/DHS_details.aspx?newsid=556" target="_blank">reported last week</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state’s unemployment rate nearly tripled to 16.1% in April and remained at 13.1% in May, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry. June figures are due out in two weeks.</p>
<p>The legislation is based on formulas that, using historical unemployment data, calculate a threshold for what constitutes high joblessness in each state. The percentage-point increase in unemployment is increased by a multiplier to arrive at the new level of Medicaid assistance.</p>
<p>For Pennsylvania, high unemployment is calculated to begin at 5.5%, so a 10% unemployment rate would trigger an increase in Medicaid dollars of 21.6 percentage points, or about $2 billion.</p>
<p>Tuesday’s bill introduction came as Pittsburgh workforce officials pledged to help connect new Medicaid enrollees with job opportunities.</p>
<p>Partner4Work, the Downtown-based workforce development agency, announced a $150,000 grant from the Richard King Mellon Foundation to open up job-seeking Medicaid enrollees to the PA CareerLink network to prepare them for careers.</p>
<p>A press release from the agency noted&nbsp;UPMC Health Plan’s Medicaid managed care organization serves 460,000 Medicaid members, of which nearly 120,000 are working-age adults in southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
