<h1>Scott Township Public Library to display model railroad </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The South Hills Model Railroad Club in conjunction with the Scott Township Public Library will host a model railroad display at the Scott Township Community Building located on Park Drive in Carnegie on March 6 and 7.</p>
<p>The 31-by-13-foot display is free to view and will be open to the public from 5 to 9 p.m. March 6 and from noon to 5 p.m. March 7.</p>
<p>This year marks the second year for the event.</p>
<p>Dave Murphy, a member of the clubs and a Scott resident, said about 400 people attended the event last year.</p>
<p>“We have many push-button activated displays,” Mr. Murphy said.</p>
<p>The interactive displays around the train track include an active volcano, a gazebo with moving dancers and music, six moving carnival rides, a box car unloading boxes, a car unloading logs, an operating smoke stack and Thomas the Train carrying candy to a mine.</p>
<p>A scavenger hunt will also be happening throughout the event with everyone who finds all the items on the list entered into a drawing to win a model train set.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy added that although the show is free, there will be a donation jar for the library.</p>
<p>“Last year we had several people ask if we could take donations, but the club does not, so we thought it could be an opportunity for the library,” he said.</p>
<p>Information on the South Hills Model Railroad Club can be found at shmrrc.org. For further information on the event, contact Mr. Murphy at murphytelecom@yahoo.com.</p>
