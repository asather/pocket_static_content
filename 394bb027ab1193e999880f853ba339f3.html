<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 06.18.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s get started</p>
<p><strong>Nivek Morris</strong>: How much grief did you get for listing the centers that were better than Wes Unseld-”Wilt Chamberlain, Bill Russell, Shaq, Hakeem Olajuwon, Patrick Ewing, and Tim Duncan...but that’s about it” while omitting Kareem? Live newspaper is rough! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Oh boy that is an awful omission on my part. How did I forget Kareem? And that’s especially since I was a sky hook guy when I played back in the day!! You are right - Kareem is right there at the top with Wilt and Russell</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: Hey Paul, have you heard if Coach T /any Steelers players plan on kneeling when the season starts? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Not definitely but I’m sure there will be some. I doubt Mike Tomlin will because he is always a “laser focus on football” guy but I’m sure some players will</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hi Paul. Is there anyone you would like to see (and hear) on Monday Night Football? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say not really. When it comes to announcers it is more about who I don’t want to hear. Like Booger was terrible. Dennis Miller was terrible. The guy with Booger this year (name slips my mind) was terrible. I hate guys that talk way too much and try way too hard to be clever or insightful. Just call the game and let it speak for itself</p>
<p><strong>Vincent</strong>: What do you think of Bobby Mo moving to a new conference? Thanks Paul. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is a great move and one they have earned because of their success and what they have accomplished. The Horizon League is a step up and it is also a much higher profile league in terms of exposure. And the football team is stepping up as well. I think it is always good to move forward</p>
<p><strong>Stand4theflag</strong>: i think if players take a knee and disrespect the flag and those who died for it, the reaction may be different than before. I think more people will do something else on Sunday and tune the NFL out. I know that what I will do. The political climate is different now. The country more divided than ever. I think it would be a big mistake for the NFL to piss off at least 1/2 of it’s customers. The players have other platforms to take on issues they feel strongly about. Why during OUR national anthem? If they do it they should realize they will be costing themselves future income. What say you Paul? And thanks for the chats. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This has to be a two-way conversation of understanding each side and if it became that - as opposed to two sides shouting at each other about it - we might have a chance at some progress. I actually see and understand and even respect both sides of the national anthem issue. I really do. It saddens me though that we are at a time and place where people are afraid of things they don’t agree with or understand. My advice to you would be this - turn the game on five minutes after it starts if that will bother you so much. But ask yourself why it bothers you? What about it has you so upset that You want to quit watching a sport you love? And I would say the same to those who want to demonize Drew Brees - are you even listening to what he actually said? Are you even trying to understand what he actually said and why he said it? People that kneel during the national anthem are expressing their first amendment right. People who believe we should stand in reverence to the national anthem are expressing their right. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Why can’t people on both sides of that equation think critically and get out of their comfort zone to try and understand the other point of view - even if in the end you don’t agree with it? Why are we so afraid of opposing opinions?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Hi Paul. Do you believe the MLB negotiations are about as tone deaf as it gets? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know what tone deaf means, that’s just one of those nonsensical meaningless phrases in the age of the woke. I will say MLB owners are the dumbest group of people on the planet if they allow this season to die. And the players aren’t much smarter if they think they are gonna get sympathy from a nation with 45 million people out of work. This is maybe the dumbest “negotiation” in my lifetime</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Any thoughts on how MLB can attract new fans? The game is not on any 35 and younger person’s mind! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This is a great question. And a real problem. Baseball needs to find ways to appeal to young fans but I think most sports do. I’m not going to say the golden age of sports is coming to an end but sports are clearly not quite the priority with younger generations. And society is changing in that we value our time more than we once did.</p>

<p><strong>Andre</strong>: Ok Paul, you have to walk down a dark Pittsburgh alley at 3:00 am. You can choose two or three players each from the Pirates, Pens and Steelers, (past or present)to walk with you. Who do you pick? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Paul Baxter, Ryan Reeves, Greg Lloyd .....</p>
<p><strong>Rob H</strong>: Paul, I think Pitt should be really good this year in football. Great defense, experienced QB, if some playmakers emerge at RB and WR and the OL is merely adequate, they could win the Coastal. Which of course means one thing, there will not be football this fall because of the return of the COVID. What say you? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This is classic Pitt fan - whatever doomsday scenario they can dream up they run with. That is no way to think man! I agree with you completely though - Pitt should be very good this year. The Panthers have all the elements to have a huge season. That defense has a chance to be nasty</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Paul - thanks for the chats. Two of the best arms in right field baseball history have been here in Pittsburgh....Clemente and Parker? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Naturally. Those two had tremendous arms. You just didn’t run on them. Ever. I have always said the outfield assist to home plate is one of the most exciting plays in baseball.</p>
<p><strong>The Nelson Twins</strong>: Why do you think Pittsburgh has a hard time with getting an NBA team? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They do because of corporate money and also because it failed here before and fans don’t easily forget that. I think it could only work if they brought a successful team here but I just don’t know that corporate money is here to support four teams</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: Paul, Roger Goodell stated that there is systematic discriminatory practices in America. Whether you agree with him or not, shouldn’t he resign his office and demand that his replacement be a minority? Obviously, he must had gotten his job that way. Why not put into action what he is saying? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I’m gonna assume the question is sarcastic and not really serious. A serious question, however, is what have you as commissioner of the NFL with the power to hire and fire and create policy done to buck the trend of systematic racism? What as the NFL done to become leaders in this field among corporate America? Those are legitimate questions</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Many PG writers admit they are not “fans” of the local teams and have no rooting interest. I think if they did, it would enhance their writing. Do you have a rooting interest beyond “it’s good for business”? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I only root for two teams - Florida State in every sport and Temokw <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Temple. Those are my teams. I obviously rooted for Pitt when Elijah played there because he is my son and I want Pitt to have success and do well but I want all the local teams to do well. Hard core fandom died for me in 1996 when the Houston Oilers, my beloved and favorite team of all time, went away and moved to Tennessee. That’s when I realized these teams don’t love you the way that you love them.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: I’m glad to see my alma mater renew the basketball series with West Virginia but not playing Duquesne is a bad look. On the surface, it seems like they are avoiding a local program on the way up. Is there more to the story? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well let me see - Nope not really. That is what it boils down to. They’d rather pay $95 K or whatever to make sure they can win as opposed to play a team who might - might - have a chance to beat them. That’s lame.</p>
<p><strong>John T</strong>: I grew up in the 60’s watching the Civil Rights movement and riots. Then there was Rodney King in 92. Don’t you think all of this rhetoric from the professional sports league offices is just another case of C.Y.A. until the next news cycle event has people looking elsewhere? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No doubt. But there will be some change and some attitudes will change and that’s how we make progress. Do I believe all these statements and whatnot amount to much more than CYA? No I think some of it is disingenuous. But change is hard and progress takes time, in increments and I do think some positive changes will come out of this all.</p>

<p><strong>John T</strong>: I think you should play the old Temptation song Ball of Confusion as a theme song for your show. Would fit well with the times. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I actually think I have that in my rotation for bumper music!</p>
<p><strong>Ray</strong>: Chances Belicheck tanks for Trevor this year? It’s kinda a wasted season regardless! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No chance. Bill Belichick wants nothing more to prove he can win without Tom Brady.</p>
<p><strong>Ray</strong>: Belicheat gonna Bellichoke for Trevor or Justin! I know it! I live in NE! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Nope, read above</p>
<p><strong>Ray</strong>: “What say you?” Ugh. Can we retire that phrase?! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know, what say you?</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: Thabks for the detailed answer! I’m not sure tone deaf is awoke phrase. It basically means “read the room” <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know what read the room, optics, robe deaf and every version of those phrases mean. I’m just not that smart I guess.....</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: On baseball attracting new fans: Speed up the game. A game that is played nightly should be 2 and half hours at the most. That is considered a quick game now days. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes that would help but purists bristle at any suggestion that there are things that should be done to speed it up</p>
<p><strong>jeff</strong>: The Pittsburgh Fish won it all right ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Pipers!</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Capel just offered scholarships to 3 of top players in PA what chance do you think any pick PItt? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Jeff is a great recruiter so I will say - not knowing a thing about any of them - he will get two of the three</p>
<p><strong>MjB</strong>: We hear a lot about football draft picks working out and what coaches are permitted to do. What about the Pirates new picks? Are coaches allowed to interact, coach, etc, assuming the player signs a contract of course? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Baseball right now is doing nothing because they don’t have a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Hey Paul. I thought your response to Stand4theflag was excellent. I have a hockey question. If Pittsburgh (PPG Paints Arena) is selected to host post season games, how many rounds would they host? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would assume that both host cities will host the playoffs all the way to the Stanley Cup. I would think then they would then have the city with the highest seed host the Final</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Can you please tweet more so I can stomach looking at the Twitter feed on the website? Why can’t “sports people” comment on sports? It’s a great personal weakness to force your opinions on non-sports issues upon people who just want to escape for a bit into the world of sports. Loved your earlier answer about people needing to be able to disagree w/o having to shut down opposing views. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: My bosses probably hope I will tweet less ha ha ha. Hey we are all humans living in this world regardless of what job we work in.</p>
<p><strong>Rob H</strong>: Can you be understanding, supportive and sympathetic to all of the Social Justice reforms being discussed, yet at the same time think people are taking this way too far? And that you would prefer not to deal with it on a minute by minute basis. Does this make me a bad human? I want to hear sports, not what injustice or slur that occurred 30 years ago to everyone. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I think so - I’m African American and I think some of the stuff that is being probed or goes on is going too far. We all can agree to disagree at times and again, the beauty of America is that is - or should be - OK</p>
<p><strong>DjB</strong>: After paying to go to a game, parking, etc, the last thing I want is a fast game. However, if that’s what you insist on doing, then the answer is obvious. It becomes a seven inning game. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t think you have to do that but just try and speed things up. Some of the unnecessary stuff can go and some of the stuff every at bats contains that drag it out can be sped up</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: Good response to my question. That is why you are a professional interviewer and I am not. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t know about that but I have the real problem of trying to apply common sense, logic and the same standards to every discussion <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: OK that’s it for us - have a happy Fathers Day!!!</p>
