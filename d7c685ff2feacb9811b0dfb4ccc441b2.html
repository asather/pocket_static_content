<h1>Fitzgerald submits 2021 budget proposal with no tax increase </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald submitted his budget proposal to County Council on Tuesday, a plan that — despite “very challenging times” during the COVID-19 pandemic — contains no property tax increase and includes funding for a new department devoted to early childhood needs.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said his proposed 2021 operating budget of $942.5 million reflects a nearly 2% decrease from 2020 “to ensure the county’s continued&nbsp;stabilization with the expected impact on revenue.”</p>
<p>“You will see that many of our revenues did decrease this year, and understandably so during the COVID pandemic,” he said during the roughly 10-minute address to council members.</p>
<p>The administration imposed a hiring freeze in the spring and is proposing that it remain in effect for the first six months of 2021. The county executive said no layoffs are anticipated.</p>
<p>Revenue streams that have decreased because of the pandemic include taxes on alcohol, car rentals, casino gaming and hotels, as well as court fees, he said.</p>
<p>The administration is proposing a&nbsp;“slight” increase for health and human services and administrative services.</p>
<p>“As you can imagine, running elections right now is extremely expensive. All 67 counties in the Commonwealth have been given an unfunded mandate by the legislature to run mail-in balloting as well as keeping all the polling places open,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, the county will be establishing a new department called Children Initiatives that will be funded through&nbsp;“public and private partnerships,” according to the administration.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a lot of interest in trying to help and provide services and help kids be ready for school when they hit kindergarten and first grade,” Mr. Fitzgerald said.</p>
<p>A countywide ballot referendum asking voters to increase millage to fund learning programs <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2018/11/10/childrens-fund-ballot-referendum-allegheny-county-failed-election/stories/201811080173" target="_blank">failed in 2018</a>; a subsequent <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2019/10/22/Allegheny-County-new-department-children-fund-early-childhood-education-preschool-after-school-programs/stories/201910280001" target="_blank">report recommended</a> that the county establish a department addressing early childhood education and after-school programs.</p>
<p>The administration’s proposed capital budget of&nbsp; $127.6 million includes 64 infrastructure and capital improvement projects.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said he attributes the county’s ability to increase capital spending from $100 million this year to the “fiscally responsible” decision to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/05/Allegheny-County-Council-racism-public-health-crisis-Rich-Fitzgerald-bond-bill/stories/202005050149" target="_blank">refinance bonds in Ma</a><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/05/Allegheny-County-Council-racism-public-health-crisis-Rich-Fitzgerald-bond-bill/stories/202005050149" target="_blank">y</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed $1.5 billion special accounts and grants budget includes several federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act grants; the county <a href="https://tableau.alleghenycounty.us/t/PublicSite/views/AlleghenyCountyCARESActFunding/Overview?iframeSizedToWindow=true&amp;%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AshowAppBanner=false&amp;%3Adisplay_count=no&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no&amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">received $212 million in CARES Act funding</a> in March.</p>
<p>Talks for an additional relief package broke down in Washington, D.C., Tuesday after President Donald <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/10/06/Trump-halts-COVID-19-relief-talks-until-after-election/stories/202010060151" target="_blank">Trump decided to end negotiations</a> with Democratic Party leaders.</p>
<p>“We’re certainly hopeful that they get back to the table,” Mr. Fitzgerald said, because “as the year comes to an end, that funding comes to an end.”</p>
<p>The county executive said the 2021 budget plan represents the 19th time in the past two decades that a millage increase has not been necessary.</p>
<p>Upon completion of budget hearings, council must pass a final budget no later than 25 days before the end of the fiscal year.</p>
