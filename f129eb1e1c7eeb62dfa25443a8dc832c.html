<h1>Pittsburgh diocese issues directives that put it on a path toward reopening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh announced new directives Thursday it said will help it move toward a return to normalcy by allowing “limited” public participation at certain events.</p>
<p>In a statement, the church said it is looking at a “safe way for us to begin” that process and will allow restricted participation at weddings, funerals and confessions.</p>
<p>Church buildings and Masses will continue to be closed until further notice — “out of concern for the protection and safety of the faithful,” according to the church —&nbsp;and have been shut down since March 28. Since then, many of its sacraments, confessions, and public functions, such as weddings, baptisms and funerals, have been postponed or forbidden in an effort to be compliant with government restrictions in the wake of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the statement, Bishop David Zubik said the directives will be carried out&nbsp;“at the discretion of individual parish administrators.” He advised people to contact their pastor with questions.</p>
<p><strong>Weddings</strong></p>
<p>The church said weddings — but only in “exceptional circumstances”&nbsp; —&nbsp;may be celebrated&nbsp;“with no more than 10 people including the priest/deacon officiant.” Once restrictions are lifted, a couple cannot repeat the ritual of matrimony but may have a Mass of Thanksgiving to allow for a more complete celebration.</p>
<p><strong>Funerals</strong></p>
<p>Once again, the church cites&nbsp;“exceptional circumstances,” but said funerals with a Mass can be scheduled, but with no more than 10 people.”</p>
<p><strong>Confessions</strong></p>
<p>The church will hold confessions, but only outdoors,&nbsp;“either in parking lots or another place where social distancing (six feet apart) is absolutely respected.”</p>
