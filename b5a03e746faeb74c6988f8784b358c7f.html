<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 05.13.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we will open our chat within the half hour, so get those questions ready. You don’t need to wear a mask in this room. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, here we go.....fire away!!</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: What’s your best guess on whether the season starts on schedule? Any preseason games? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I have not believed, and still don’t, there will be any preseason games this year. For sure, they would be played without fans if there were. I think the NFL will be like college football -- give the teams 5-6 weeks to prepare for the regular season, let them play a scrimmage or two if they wanted, or give them one preseason game. But I don’t think you will see preseason games any more than you will see them at Saint Vincent College.</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: Gerry, What’s your prediction of opening day roster at rb? How many and who? And - sidebar - if Kerrith Whyte isn’t on the roster, where does he wind up? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t know where Kerrith White will wind up but my guess is he won’t be on the roster.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Gerry Do you know if Eric Ebrons ankle is fully healed ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He said it is 100 percent healed and there are no issues. Of course, he has been unable to see the Steelers’ team doctors, even before he signed with them, so they don’t really know first-hand either. But Ebron said he went to an independent doctor to have his ankle examined and everything is good.</p>
<p><strong>Richard</strong>: I’ve asked this question of your colleagues and others and I’m confused by no one seemingly wanting to answer or try to get an answer. Scientists expect the virus will be here in the fall, possibly as strong as it was these past months. What will the NFL do when players test positive? The rules for the general public would dictate everyone who had had contact should be quarantined for two weeks. I understand everyone wants football to return and is enjoying speculating on who will play what position, etc., but haven’t journalists pressed the commissioner for clarity on something as obvious as this? It’s very hard for me to see how the NFL will get through a 2020 season. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They’re not answering for the same reason I’m not going to answer -- because nobody knows what’s going to happen, not just with sports, but in society.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Wallace</strong>: Will we get to see more of Ben In the preseason than we typically do ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Even if there is a preseason, and I doubt there will be, the answer is no. You might see him less. I don’t think you will see Ben until the season opener, whenever that is.</p>
<p><strong>Fineline</strong>: How did Cleveland get to host a draft before Pittsburgh? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe more available land on the lakefront?</p>

<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: When the 2020 NFL season is canceled will the 2021 draft order be frozen from last year .... minus trades of course. For example the Bengals would pick first again but the Steelers would get their first round pick and so on. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think anybody has thought that far ahead. Certainly I haven’t. I think, one way or another, though, the regular season will be played, even if it’s without fans.</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: Hi Gerry, with the limits of preparation time for NFL teams, do you think scheduling, i.e. the timing of easier vs tougher games, will have a more significant effect this year? Will good teams with tough openers and early games (good TV match ups) be at a disadvantage, and will there likely be more upsets this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, those “tough” games, as you call them, might not be so tough if all teams have had less time to prepare. Those tough games might just become a little easier.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Favorite Steelers player nickname? I always liked Big Snack. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Me too.</p>
<p><strong>Lambert’steeth</strong>: Gary, it’s obviously difficult to get good information these days. I’m curious what inside scoop you may have on TE Christian Scott Williamson? He seems to be on the fringe of breaking through. In your opinion does he have a chance to make the roster and if not, what’s his waiver exemption status? I thought it was only 2 years? He’s an interesting story. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He has another year with the team and, I will tell you, if there was ever a fantastic looking tight end, it’s this guy. And he is an interesting story. But I hate to ruin your story about him being on the verge of breaking through.</p>
<p><strong>Buzz</strong>: What is your gut feeling on Ben’s arm! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t have gut feelings, only what I know and what I’m told about the people who monitor him. And all I’ve heard is that he’s right on schedule and nobody is concerned about where he is at this stage of his progress.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: With the addition of the second Watt, will the Steelers run less QB sneaks ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hmmm...let’s see....zero minus zero is still.....ZERO</p>
<p><strong>RVErie</strong>: “The Standard is the Standard” appears to be an old, worn-out bromide as unfortunately the new standard appears to be that the Steelers will no longer be the dominant team in their division. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The Ravens were last season, that’s for sure.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: How many hours of meetings a week are players having this time of year? Is it limited by the CBA? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t know if it is or even has to be. Only so much can be accomplished with virtual meetings. You and I, conceivably, could learn the playbook during all these meetings. Doesn’t mean we can execute it.</p>
<p><strong>Picksixlisberger</strong>: Gerry, Any noise about signing any of the free agent players whose contracts weren’t renewed? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. Their next move will be to offer new contracts to existing players, starting with Cam Heyward. He’s next at the checkout counter.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Gerry I saw a tweet the other day that made some good points Steelers WRs without Ben:<br> <br> Antonio Brown (2011-2017):7 games, 32 catches, 433 yards, 61.8 YPG, 0 touchdowns.<br> <br> Juju Smith-Schuster (2017-2019):11 games, 40 catches, 533 yards, 48.4 YPG and 4 touchdowns.<br> <br> If you gave Antonio a pass for bad QB play, then Juju deserves the same, IMO. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Bingo, hold your cards!</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: Hearing rumors Pat McAfee is thinking about a comeback. Any chance Steelers brass look into this opportunity? Pat admitted on his YouTube show that Pittsburgh needs a punter! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You sure it’s not that the punter needs Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Gerry, based in your trained eye and being close to the team, às we speak who is the 5th WR? Cain or Switzer (Friend of Ben + maybe no Training Camp, etc.. things that might affect Cain) I like Cain quite honestly and don’t dislike Switzer, he played good when WR with Ben in 2018.. who you take? And thoughts please.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree. I liked what I saw of Cain last season. But sometimes it’s not about who is the best player, it’s about who might be the best fit for what you need, i.e., a slot receiver, possession receiver, receiver who can lose 2 yards per catch.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Will the Steelers have Ben in a complete throwing mode before the Giant game or wait until game day to decide if he is capable of doing the job? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will know long beforehand.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Week 1 on a passing down, who is dropping into coverage in the middle along with Bush? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Can’t answer that now. But the choice will probably come from Marcus Allen, Ulysees Gilbert III, Antoine Brooks and Vince Williams.</p>
<p><strong>Joe B.</strong>: Who do you believe will the starting defensive tackle this year? Damon Harrison is still a free agent! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they are set with what they have. Chris Wormley will play the most between he and Tyson Alualu, but Alualu will likely be the nose tackle when they are in their 3-4 front.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: Hey Gerry ...any predictions/thoughts on the upcoming Manning-Woods v. Brady-Mickelson matchup? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. I’m more interested in the one this weekend. All I know is the last Tiger-Phil pay-per-view event was a real dud, lifeless.</p>
<p><strong>Roberto</strong>: Who Knows what kind of season Lamar Jackson Will have, I think when playing against we must spy him 100 percent of the time and Their running game and force him tô beat you by air, actually every team Should try it.. agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree, but this guy is so fast, so shifty, so strong, I’m not sure there’s a spy out there to watch him.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi Gerry, thanks for the chat. Who do you expect to log the majority of the snaps at nose tackle when Steelers are in their base D (probably 300 snaps over course of the season)? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m not sure it will be that many snaps, but I expect the nose to be Tyson Alualu with Chris Wormley maybe getting some time there.</p>
<p><strong>Hugh</strong>: Good morning. Do you think the Steelers have any interest in Matthews? He could provide veteran leadership and depth. Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You mean Clay Matthews? As of right now, no. And I’m not sure he provides what they need -- an inside LB capable of dropping into coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Dino</strong>: Gerry, which team is the biggest húrdle for us to reach SB? Chiefs or Ravens in your view, pick one.. we really have a chance with no excuses on Paper.. sure, with no specific injuries.. what say u? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First rule of thumb -- get out of your own division before you can start thinking about the postseason. And, after going 14-2 last season as the AFC’s No. 1 seed, the Ravens are the biggest and most immediate hurdle. Should they clear that hurdle, yes, the Chiefs. But don’t get ahead of yourself.</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: Good morning Gerry. Do you think the there will be even more focus, than recently before, on improving the run game once camp begins? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think early on the Steelers will try to run the ball more and better to give BR’s arm a chance to ease into the season and not get overworked early.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: when would you expect to see some FA signings to fill a couple def gaps? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I wouldn’t hold your breath. You won’t see any more of that until at least the Steelers can get on a practice field with pads and see what they have. And the only conceivable move they will make then, barring injuries, is at ILB.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Good morning. Both media and fans alike seem to be so focused on comparing McFarland to Rainey and Archer and their failures. I see one similarity, height, and that’s it. What’s your stance on this? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s not a comparison between measurables. It’s the type of specialty role they will be asked to perform. There were NO big plays by Rainey or Archer</p>
<p><strong>George in Greenfield</strong>: Hi Gerry. Who would you like to see replace Tessitore and McFarland on Monday Night Football? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Anyone. Romo would have been great. I don’t know how good Eli Manning is but he would be really good. Maybe ESPN could borrow one of its college football guys, like Chris Fowler, for play by play.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Do you think Kevin Colbert will retire when Big Ben leaves? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think there is a good chance he and Mike Tomlin might depart the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: The Steelers do a really good job of drafting and acquiring talent. You just can’t give big $ to everyone. So I’m ok to roll with Gilbert and Spillane as back-up ILBs. Plus I would mind seeing more dime and just Bush at ILB. Thoughts? Thanks Gerry. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think they’re ready to roll the dice with those guys, particularly Spillane. And you just might see more dime, although that opens you up to a lot of mismatches in the run game.</p>
<p><strong>Tprod</strong>: Gerry, do the Steelers have an answer for when the Ravens go 3-wide forcing the Steelers to go to their 4-2-5 with the undersize Bush in the middle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, it’s called Joe Haden, Steve Nelson and Minkah Fitzpatrick. That not enough??</p>
<p><strong>Scott W.</strong>: Does Barrett have any value other than imitating Lamar Jackson when the Steelers prepare for the Ravens? From what I hear, he can’t even compete for the third string QB job. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think what you say you hear is correct.</p>
<p><strong>TJ</strong>: Gerry when does Tomlin get put on hot seat for being the average coach that he is? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If you think he is average, what must you consider good? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, that’s all the time we have today kids. Thanx for the questions.</p>
