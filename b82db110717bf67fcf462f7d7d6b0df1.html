<h1>Port Authority offers reimbursement for riders with passes who stay home due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority is offering reimbursement to riders who had purchased monthly or weekly passes and then were ordered to stay home because of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>But it is important for those riders to get in touch with the agency as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Spokesman Adam Brandolph said Tuesday the authority will offer prorated cash reimbursement on their ConnectCard for the unused days from the day they contact the agency. For example, if a rider with a monthly pass contacts the agency today, he or she would get credit for 14 days.</p>
<p>That credit can either be used to pay for individual rides at any point or used as cash when the rider buys their next weekly or monthly pass.</p>
<p>“If you contact us, we will reimburse the remaining stored value from that day forward,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Riders can call the authority at 412-442-2000, visit the website at <a title="Port Authority website" href="/portauthority.org" target="_blank">portauthority.org</a>, or go to the Downtown Service Center on Smithfield Street.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said the authority continues to monitor ridership and operator availability to determine whether it should reduce service. Ridership is “down significantly” due to the number of businesses that have closed or have employees working from home due tp the virus, he said.</p>
<p>At this point, the agency is maintaining service as much as possible so passengers can practice social distancing.</p>
