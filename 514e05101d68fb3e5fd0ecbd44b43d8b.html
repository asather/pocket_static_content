<h1>Koppers withdraws 2020 financial guidance because of COVID-19 pandemic </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Koppers said Monday it is withdrawing its prior guidance for the year because of the COVID-19 crisis and expects to hold monthly briefings with its investors as the global pandemic continues.</p>
<p>“Unprecedented times call for unprecedented measures,” Leroy Ball, Koppers’ president and chief executive, said during a conference call with Wall Street analysts.</p>
<p>The Downtown-based maker of wood products and chemicals said preliminary first-quarter results include a loss of $1.4 million, or 7 cents a share compared with income of $11.5 million, or 56 cents per share in the year-ago quarter.</p>
<p>Revenues are expected to total $401.9 million, up $25 million, or more than 6% from a year ago.</p>
<p>Excluding a negative impact from foreign currency exchange rates, sales rose by 8%, or $31 million.</p>
<p>Final first-quarter numbers will be released May 7.</p>
<p>In February, Koppers projected 2020 full-year sales of $1.7 billion and an expected gain in profits of between $5 million and $10 million.</p>
<p>“It is impossible to confidently forecast the immediate future of our business, given the uncertainty of when businesses can begin to reopen and return toward pre-pandemic levels,” said Mr. Ball.</p>
<p>Of 2,100 Koppers employees worldwide, only one has tested positive for COVID-19, and that person has recovered and returned to work, said Mr. Ball.</p>
<p>About 1% of its workforce has been furloughed or laid off and all are receiving compensation.</p>
<p>A plant in Auckland, New Zealand, is expected to reopen on Tuesday, bringing all 33 Koppers facilities back on line after some temporary closures due to pandemic restrictions.</p>
<p>Koppers’ business segments include carbon chemicals used in the production of aluminum and other metals; railroad and utility products; and performance chemicals used to treat utility poles and used in residential construction.</p>
<p>The company expects Its carbon chemicals segment to take the biggest hit from the pandemic because of reduced demand from industries that have experienced slowdowns including automobiles and aerospace parts, “and the cratering of oil prices,” said Mr. Ball.</p>
<p>The railroad and utility products segment is benefiting from the fact those industries are deemed essential during the crisis, he said.</p>
<p>The company will benefit from some provisions for businesses contained in the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act including $7 million in cash savings from deferred payroll taxes this year.</p>
<p>Koppers expects to sell its majority share of a coal tar distillation business in China by August in a deal that should generate about $65 million in cash after taxes and expenses.</p>
<p>Among the philanthropic initiatives the company and its employees have undertaken during the pandemic is All One Pittsburgh, a partnership with the Urban League of Greater Pittsburgh that will distribute hard-to-find household products such as hand sanitizers and disinfectants to underserved communities.</p>
<p>About $50,000 has been raised to date to fund the initiative.</p>
