<h1>Campus shutdowns due to COVID-19 reach Western Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Edinboro and Slippery Rock universities Wednesday became the first Western Pennsylvania campuses to suspend in-person instruction over COVID-19, telling students in those classes that their spring break is extended and that both campuses will transition temporarily to online instruction.</p>
<p>For those at Edinboro taking&nbsp;courses that already are online, classes will resume as previously scheduled this Monday, officials at the state-owned university said. The rest of campus will be off the week of March 16 as faculty prepare to deliver classes remotely.</p>
<p>Less information was available from Slippery Rock. A <a href="https://www.sru.edu/deluxe/covid19-information-test-page" target="_blank">banner posted to the school’s website at midday </a>simply stated: “Spring Break Extended Two Weeks; Instruction Moved Online.’’&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both moves come a day after West Chester University <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/10/Carnegie-Mellon-Silicon-Valley-suspends-face-to-face-classes-as-COVID-19-spreads-in-its-part-of-California/stories/202003100076" target="_blank">became the first of Pennsyvania’s 14 state-owned </a>universities to switch to remote instruction. <a href="https://www.bloomu.edu/" target="_blank">Bloomsburg Universty also announced</a> an extension of spring break, and late Tuesday night, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/10/WVU-spring-break-classes-suspended-West-Virginia-University-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202003100165" target="_blank">West Virginia University said it too</a> would switch to remote instruction across the sprawling research campus of nearly 30,000 students.</p>
<p>By midday Wednesday, <a href="https://bit.ly/2vdg2Ad" target="_blank">Millersville University</a> and <a href="http://www.ship.edu/coronavirus/" target="_blank">Shippensburg University</a> had made similar decisions. Bucknell University <a href="https://bit.ly/3cPnqCK" target="_blank">also announced a switch to online instruction</a> for the remainder of the semester.</p>
<p>Campuses in Pittsburgh, including the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/09/COVID-19-coronavirus-Pitt-CMU-Penn-State-contingency-teaching-plans-outbreak/stories/202003090109" target="_blank">were preparing contingencies</a> but as of early Wednesday had made no announcements.</p>
<p>Edinboro President&nbsp;Guiyou Huang delivered the news in an email Wednesday morning to students and employees. The university’s plan involves closing dorms and essentially running twin schedules for the next few weeks, as faculty prepare and then switch their courses to remote delivery.</p>
<p>For students now in face-to-face classes:</p>
<p>“Your spring break is extended through the week of March 16,” Mr. Huang said. “During this time, faculty who normally teach face to face will prepare to teach online. Your professors will be in touch via email to share further details regarding online delivery, so check your student email account regularly.”</p>

<p>He expressed the expectation that normal course delivery on the 4,800-student campus would resume in early April.</p>
<p>“It is our expectation that in-person classes will resume in their face-to-face format beginning Monday, April 6,” Mr. Huang said. “Between now and then, we will continue to monitor the situation to determine next steps. We will keep you informed as decisions are made.”</p>
<p>Officials at Edinboro, like other campuses, stressed that no suspected, presumed or confirmed cases of the virus have been reported among their students or employees.</p>
<p>But officials also said the prospect of students returning from far-flung spring break destinations, including those abroad, raised concern that some might bring the virus with them to campus.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bit.ly/2Q1jDZt" target="_blank">global death toll from the virus </a>caused by COVID-19 now approaches 4,400 with cases totaling nearly 122,000. As of late Tuesday, a dozen cases were reported in Pennsylvania, up from two last Friday.</p>
<p>Edinboro’s president said students involved in clinical/practicum courses, or serving as student teachers or as interns “will adhere to their schedules, assuming their placement sites remain open and are willing to host students in these programs.”</p>
<p>He said students in general would be expected to live off campus the next few weeks unless there was a justifiable reason to do otherwise.</p>
<p>“Students will be refunded on a prorated basis for the time during which they will not be living in the residence halls and will not be using campus food services,” he said.</p>
<p>“The Library, Pogue Student Center, Van Houten Dining Hall and Ghering Health Center will remain open for those who must remain on campus,” he said.</p>
