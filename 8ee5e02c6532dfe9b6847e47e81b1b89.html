<p>A small earthquake rattled New Jersey overnight and was felt in the Lehigh Valley.</p>
<p>The U.S. Geological Survey reported a preliminary 3.1 magnitude earthquake near Freehold Township in Monmouth County.</p>
<p>The tremor happened about 1.2 miles southeast of Freehold around 2 a.m. Wednesday, according to the USGS Earthquake Hazards Program.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service’s Mount Holly forecast office tweeted that the small earthquake was felt “in much of central New Jersey.” A community internet intensity map shows it was also felt in the Lehigh Valley, with at least two reports in Coopersburg.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have 2am #earthquake in NJ on my 2020 bingo card that’s for sure,” tweeted a woman named Crista Wolf.</p>
<p>People as far from the epicenter as Hartford, Connecticut, reported feeling the quake overnight.</p>
<p>The earthquake comes more than three weeks after a minor temblor shook the Milford, NJ, area. That quake, on Aug. 17, registered at 1.7 magnitude in the tiny borough located along the Delaware River in western Hunterdon County.</p>
<p>While larger earthquakes are relatively rare on the East Coast, the incident comes nine years after a magnitude 5.8 earthquake shook the region on Aug. 23, 2011. That seismic event was centered in Virginia and was also felt in the Lehigh Valley, with workers pouring out of office buildings. No injuries or structural damage occurred in this area, but the quake damaged the Washington Monument in Washington, D.C.</p>
