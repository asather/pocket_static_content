<h1>Ron Cook: Pitt's blowout of Austin Peay was just a small part of a surreal Saturday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I learned a few things Saturday about Austin Peay State University. It is located in Clarksville, Tenn. It was named in 1929 after the governor of Tennessee from 1923 until his death in 1927. Its nickname is — how clever? — the Governors. And it might have the worst college football team in the country.</p>
<p>I also learned a few things about watching a football game at an empty Heinz Field with no band, no cheerleaders and no fans. It seemed strange to stand for the national anthem that, with both the Austin Peay and Pitt teams in their respective locker room, was played for a few dozen game officials, stadium workers and photographers. It was somehow delightful to hear the stadium public-address announcer, the inimitable Joe DeStio, doing his best to inspire the Pitt defense early in the game with his trademark “third-and-1!” call. And it was downright surreal to hear “Sweet Caroline” blare through the stadium speakers before the start of the fourth quarter. I must have looked five times at the North end zone before I realized there were no Pitt students swaying back and forth. I was disappointed.</p>
<p>The game’s outcome seemed largely irrelevant. Certainly, it’s hard to judge what kind of team Pitt has because the competition was so laughable. Pat Narduzzi didn’t try to convince anyone that Pitt had just beaten Clemson, but he clearly was pleased with his team. “Since I’ve been here I felt like we haven’t come out and exploded against anybody. I don’t want to say played down, but the big emphasis today was to come out and play up and we were going to show that we were a different football team and really make a statement to the country about who we are and what kind of weapons we have on really all three phases of the game.”</p>
<p>The game was so one-sided that it begged for and received the college version of the mercy rule with both the third and fourth quarter reduced from 15 minutes to 10. Narduzzi admitted he hadn’t seen that in 31 years of coaching. Pitt settled for a 55-0 win but easily could have won by 100 if Narduzzi hadn’t called off his cats in the second half.</p>
<p>A cute scene after the game …</p>
<p>The Pitt players hurried to the corner of the North end zone — “The Panther Pitt” — as is their tradition after home wins. That’s where the band normally celebrates with them by playing the Pitt alma mater and fight song. This time, the players had to sing the fight song a cappella.</p>
<p>Talk about surreal.</p>
<p>My first star for Pitt? That was an easy call. Senior kicker Alex Kessman kicked off seven times and made six extra points in the first half. It’s no wonder he missed a 42-yard field goal attempt on the final play of the second quarter. The poor kid must have been exhausted.</p>

<p>I would predict we’ll see much better Pitt games this season, but I know there are no guarantees.</p>
<p>Not with COVID-19 everywhere.</p>
<p>That there was a game Saturday on this gorgeous afternoon and evening on the North Shore seemed like a miracle. It seemed like an impossibility six months ago, six weeks ago, six days ago, maybe even six hours before kickoff. I don’t own much, but I would have bet everything there wouldn’t even be the start of a college football season.</p>
<p>You might have heard the Big Ten and Pac-12 aren’t playing, at least for now. You might have seen that other schools are having major problems with the virus. Virginia Tech announced Saturday morning that it was postponing a game for the second time and won’t open its season until at least Sept. 26. Georgia Southern had 33 players inactive for its game Saturday against Campbell. Clemson played without three defensive starters at Wake Forest Saturday night. Memphis had to postpone its game this Friday night against Houston.</p>
<p>“We know the climate out there. We know what is going on,” Narduzzi said. “When games start getting cancelled and you hear pregame that Virginia Tech has a problem down there, you just kind of look at each other like, ‘Hey, Pitt could be next. We don’t want to be next.’ ”</p>
<p>Pitt played Austin Peay without seven players because of COVID-19 concerns. One was starting defensive end Rashad Weaver, who said on social media that he believes he might have been the victim of a false positive. Overall, Narduzzi, the Pitt doctors and players have done a tremendous job managing the virus. The players especially deserve a lot of credit. They have given up their social life for the good of the team.</p>
<p>“Our kids are doing it right,” Narduzzi said. “That was my message to our football team. ‘You earned the right to play one game. Now, earn the right to play two.’ ”</p>
<p>Nobody knows better than Narduzzi that, with the virus, it’s a day-by-day thing. Like all coaches, he won’t rest easy until Pitt plays Syracuse Saturday at Heinz Field. Then, he’ll start worrying all over again before the next game, against Louisville at home Sept. 26.</p>
<p>You get the idea how this strangest of college seasons will go.</p>
<p>Narduzzi said he sent his players into the warm September night with a word of advice: “ ‘Tonight, go to your room, put your mask on and do things the right way.’</p>
<p>“Anything can happen.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure that doesn’t happen to the Pitt Panthers.”</p>
