<h1>Kennedy’s Ashley Marina makes most of a second chance to advance on ‘America’s Got Talent’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ashley Marina proved she is more than a mere talent, she also has world-class poise.</p>
<p>Her audition on Tuesday night's broadcast of "America's Got Talent" was a roller coaster of emotions. Ashley, 12, a singer/songwriter from Kennedy Township, will be advancing to the next round of the NBC reality competition, but it wasn't easy.</p>
<p>Midway through her audition, judge Simon Cowell stopped her, saying the backing track was drowning out her vocals. At his request, she sang something a cappella. But even that seemed to leave him unimpressed.</p>
<p>"I think you brought the wrong songs with you today," he said, triggering a cascade of boos from the audience. Calling the song choices — "Anyway" and "Opportunity"&nbsp;— "a bit karaoke," he asked if she would take a break, work on a new one and return that afternoon.</p>

<p>The audition for Ashley, who attends Lincoln Park Performing Arts Charter School, had gotten off to a pleasant start. When she mentioned she was from Pittsburgh, judge Sofia Vergara&nbsp;— who is married to Mt. Lebanon native Joe Manganiello&nbsp;— replied "Oooh, that's where my husband is from!"</p>
<p>But what followed was, at best, confusing. Ashley was not thrown, and went down to a rehearsal room to regroup. Under pressure, she didn't seem to be feeling any of the other suggested song choices.</p>
<p>When she returned to the stage, she explained that she was going to do something else: "I know I can get into this, 'cause I wrote it."</p>
<p>She proceeded to earn a standing ovation from the judges with a song she wrote about her father, Mark, "You'll Always Be My Hero."</p>
<p>"Well, I think we finally met Ashley. I can't tell you how important that is," said Cowell.</p>
<p>There were some moist eyes in the house, including her father's.</p>
<p>"He's crying," she said, as her family stood off to the side of the stage.</p>
<p>"Well, he should be crying," judge Howie Mandel said. "That's the most wonderful, the best gift you can give a father."</p>
<p>"You now have three well-deserved 'yeses.'" Cowell said.</p>
