<h1>Online ticket scammer in Indiana, Pa., to pay refunds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An area company that scammed consumers by selling them fake tickets to events and concerts will provide $10,765 in refunds under a settlement announced Thursday with Pennsylvania’s attorney general.</p>
<p>The settlement with Ticket Victory, based in Indiana, Pa., also permanently shuts down the company and prohibits its owner, Brian Plowcha, from operating any online ticket business.</p>
<p>“Selling fake tickets online is unethical and illegal, and businesses [that] engage in these practices will be prosecuted by my office,” attorney general Josh Shapiro said in a statement.</p>
<p>The deal covers all known victims of Ticket Victory, which operated from 2015 to 2018.</p>
<p>It also provides for a 60-day window for any additional claims by unknown customers who paid for tickets and did not receive them, or for tickets that were not valid.</p>
<p>Those consumers should file a complaint — by Sept. 21 — at <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/" target="_blank">www.attorneygeneral.gov</a> or by calling 800-441-2555.</p>
