<h1>Senator Scarnati denies links between campaign funds and legislation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Senate Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati’s office denied a report written by <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/06/joe-scarnati-golden-entertainment-gambling-expansion-vgts-senate-republicans/" target="_blank">Spotlight PA</a>&nbsp;and The Caucus, which stated he was promoting gambling legislation based on funding he received from lobbyists for his campaign.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Scarnati denied the link between monetary contributions to his campaign and legislative support for additional gambling, calling the report “appalling.”</p>
<p>“I have not advocated for members of the Senate to support video gambling legislation,” the statement read. “In fact —&nbsp;in the past I actively worked against legislation that had been proposed for VGTs [video gaming terminals].”</p>
<p>The article, which appeared in Friday’s Post-Gazette, which is a journalism partner with Spotlight PA, said that Mr. Scarnati was pursuing this legislation because of donations to his campaign that were from “lobbyists for deep-pocketed video gaming companies.”</p>
<p>The legislation in question would allow bars, restaurants, clubs and other establishments with liquor licenses to have VGTs. As current legislation stands, only truck stops are allowed to have VGTs in them.</p>
<p>In his statement Mr. Scarnati noted that Spotlight PA accepts donations from individuals and organizations as one method of funding the publication.</p>
<p>Mr. Scarnati closed his statement by saying that he would meet “any further false media statements” with legal action.</p>
