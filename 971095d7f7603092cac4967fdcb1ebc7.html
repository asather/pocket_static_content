<h1>Penguins trade Nick Bjugstad to Wild; Jim Rutherford believes forward can get 'back on track'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This time a year ago, Nick Bjugstad was eager to prove to the Penguins in training camp that he was the man to fill their void in the middle of the third line.</p>
<p>The big center flashed that potential after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/02/01/derick-brassard-trade-nick-bjugstad-jared-mccann-penguins-panthers/stories/201902010111" target="_blank">they acquired him</a> late in the 2018-19 season. With his wife and their newborn baby settled into Pittsburgh and Bjugstad feeling comfortable with the team, he was hoping for a breakout season.</p>
<p>Instead, he had as many points as he had major surgeries, tallying just one goal and one assist in 13 games and missing the postseason. A rocky calendar year in Pittsburgh ended Friday with a trade to his hometown Minnesota Wild.</p>
<p>The Penguins acquired a conditional 2021 draft pick from the Wild in exchange for Bjugstad. They agreed to retain a portion of Bjugstad’s 2020-21 salary.</p>
<p>It was not disclosed how much of his $4.1 million salary remains on their books, but the trade does give salary cap relief to the Penguins, who like many teams will try to retool their roster amid financial losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“The cap is flat at $81.5 million, and there’s a number of teams that are like us, that are trying to get under it,” general manager Jim Rutherford said Friday.</p>
<p>But they also gave up a player who was their third best center when healthy.</p>
<p>When the Penguins in February 2019 acquired Bjugstad and Jared McCann from the Florida Panthers, they pictured him playing right wing on one of their top two lines. Listed at 6-foot-6 and a first-round draft pick of the Panthers, he had 191 points in 394 games in Florida. But he soon settled in at center here.</p>
<p>Bjugstad had nine goals and 14 assists in 32 games to close out that regular season. He did not have a point in four playoff games. But when his line didn’t show up on the stat sheet, they often boasted solid possession numbers.</p>
<p>Bjugstad is a skilled, responsible player who uses his gigantic frame to shield the puck from defenders. He is not a heavy hitter but isn’t adverse to contact.</p>
<p>This season quickly turned disastrous for Bjugstad, who turned 28 in July. He was dealing with a core muscle injury early in the season before undergoing surgery in November. He didn’t return to the lineup until early March. In just his third game back, days before the pandemic pause, Bjugstad was injured again.</p>
<p>With the playoffs pushed back, he was excited about potentially playing.</p>
<p>“I haven’t played many games this year. I don’t want to get used to it. I’m itching to get back,” Bjugstad said in the middle of April, adding, “With this time, I think it’s good for me to really take advantage of it and get my body right.”</p>
<p>A month later, he had spinal surgery for a herniated disc, ending his season.</p>
<p>Rutherford did not deny in interviews that he was open to trading Bjugstad but the general manager publicly left the door ajar for a return. In the end, based on the modest return and the retention of salary, it seems clear that the Penguins simply felt it was time to move on.</p>
<p>Now Bjugstad, named Mr. Hockey in Minnesota in 2010, is headed home.</p>
<p>“He is in a contract year, and he’s 100% healed from his surgery. I really like Nick. He’s a good guy and a good player,” Rutherford said. “But he just battled with injuries while he was here, and that made it difficult. Certainly this is going to give him a good opportunity to get back on track. And I think he will.”</p>
<p>This is the second trade Rutherford has completed with the Wild since Bill Guerin, his former assistant GM in Pittsburgh, took over Minnesota’s front office last summer. In February, the Penguins acquired Jason Zucker from the Wild.</p>
<p>With Bjugstad gone and McCann possibly still on the trading block, the Penguins will likely have another new third-line center in 2020-21. In the three seasons after Nick Bonino left in free agency in 2017, the Penguins have given long looks to Bjugstad, McCann, Derick Brassard and Riley Sheahan in that pivotal spot.</p>
<p>Their top internal option is Teddy Blueger, who thrived last season on a shutdown line that essentially played third-line minutes. He has 15 goals, 32 points and a plus-9 rating in 97 career games. He presumably must provide more punch in the offensive end to be the long-term answer there.</p>
<p>“I think Teddy Blueger can take on more responsibility,” Rutherford said.</p>
<p>For now, the alternatives to Blueger are McCann and Sam Lafferty, who split time at center in the playoffs. They both might be better off on a wing, but Rutherford isn’t ruling them out at center.</p>
<p>“Trying to get the right chemistry on a line for Jared McCann is another way of [improving the third line],” he said. “We’ll still continue to look at what all our options are. Certainly, we’re not pressured to do something. We also have Lafferty that can go there. He just continues to get better and better and better.”</p>
<p>Rutherford added: “There’s some options there, but we’re certainly going to expect some adjustments in the guys’ games in order to balance out our forwards.”</p>
<p>One way or another, the Penguins will add at least one center this offseason, even if it is someone who could start the season in the American Hockey League.</p>
