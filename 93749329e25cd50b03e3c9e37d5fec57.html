<h1>Marco downgraded to a tropical storm</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Marco, which strengthened from a tropical storm to a Category 1 hurricane Sunday, weakened overnight to sustained winds of 70 mph -- just under the hurricane threshold. Marco is expected to make landfall on the Louisiana coast Monday.</p>
<p>Tropical Storm Laura, which is forecast to strengthen to a hurricane before it makes landfall on the U.S. mainland late Wednesday or early Thursday, is also expected to make landfall on or near the Louisiana coast.</p>
<p>National Weather Service meteorologist Benjamin Schott said Laura could possibly be a Category 3 storm as it approaches the state, bringing up to 10 feet of storm surge to the southeastern coastline. If the storm holds its strength, water could be pushed back up the state's rivers as far as 30 miles inland, he said.</p>
<p>Parts of Louisiana will start to see the effects of Tropical Storm Laura by Wednesday morning, after Marco leaves the state Tuesday evening, Mr. Schott said.</p>
<p>"The unprecedented kind of thing here is that it's the same state within 48 hours of each other," Mr. Schott previously said.</p>
<p>"In modern meteorological history ... there's never been anything like this before where you could have possibly two hurricanes hitting within miles of each other over a 48 hour period."</p>
<p>The imminent threat of Tropical Storm Marco prompted mandatory evacuations Sunday in Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, and Grand Isle, Louisiana. As of late Sunday evening, the storm was about 185 miles south southeast of the mouth of the Mississippi River with maximum sustained winds of 70 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center.</p>
<p>And the one-two punch from Marco and Laura means "there may not be much of a window" for rescuers or power restoration crews to respond to victims between the two storms, Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said.</p>
<p>By the time Laura reaches the U.S. mainland, it's expected to be a Category 2 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of at least 96 mph.</p>
<p>Laura is expected to impact many of the same areas that Marco will hit.</p>
