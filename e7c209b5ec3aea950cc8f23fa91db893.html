<h1>Interfaith groups line Fifth Avenue in Oakland to support Black Lives Matter movement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An interfaith vigil was held in Oakland on Wednesday in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, continuing the string of protests and other shows of support held for weeks in Pittsburgh and across the country.</p>
<p>More than a dozen faith-based and community organizations participated in the vigil, which was hosted by Grace Memorial Presbyterian Church, including the First Baptist Church, the Commonwealth of Oakland and Temple Sinai, as well as passersby.</p>
<p>“The media may have lost its fervor for covering these events, but the energy among the people is still there,” said the Rev. Gavin Walton of Grace Memorial Presbyterian. “We decided that the urgency of the hour demanded that we pull together and make our presence known.”</p>
<p>About 100 people ultimately joined the vigil, which started at noon and was held on the sidewalk along Fifth Avenue. The protesters, all of whom wore masks and stood 6 feet apart to abide by social distancing rules, peacefully held signs and raised fists while passing cars honked their horns in support.</p>
<p>Gwen Brunasky, a parishioner at Grace Memorial Presbyterian, said she decided to participate in the vigil, her first since the killing of George Floyd sparked nationwide outrage in late May, because she couldn’t just stand by and let the movement fizzle out.</p>
<p>“How many [moments of injustice] were not filmed? How many were there when there was no-one else around to see it,” Ms. Brunasky said. “I don’t have children, but I have nephews and nieces and other family members and parishioners at my church that are depending on me to do this.”</p>
<p>About an hour after it began, Rev. Walton gathered the remaining participants to thank them for attending and to close out the vigil with a prayer. Everyone peacefully dispersed afterward.</p>
<p>“This event was organized in part by interfaith organizations, but today doesn’t hold any particular religious significance. All secular and faith traditions are welcome.” Rev. Walton said. “It’s more about demonstrating and renewing the idea that now is the time to act.”</p>
