<h1>Port Authority cuts service by 25% starting Wednesday due to low ridership</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Due to a decline in ridership of more than 50% during the COVID-19 emergency, Port Authority will reduce service by about 25% beginning Wednesday.</p>
<p>The authority said in a news release it is taking the step “to protect frontline employees while maintaining service for essential trips taken by hospital staff, government officials and emergency responders.</p>
<p>“Our region is speaking with one voice: If you don’t need to go out, please stay home,” said authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman.</p>
<p>The agency is reducing service with a&nbsp;“modified” schedule, which is less service than normal but not developed Saturday, Sunday or holiday service. This schedule was&nbsp;specifically developed to deal with the current situation, spokesman Adam Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Ridership has been down&nbsp;“significantly” for about two weeks because of the number of people who have been laid off of their jobs or are working from home.</p>
<p>The authority operates 98 routes and 720 buses during a regular day. It will continue to operate all routes, but it will use less than the full allotment of buses.</p>
<p>The authority said it developed the new schedule in conjunction with the Amalgamated Transit Union and healthcare providers to try to make sure essential employees can get to work</p>
<p>In addition, the agency said operating less buses will make it easier to sanitize buses.</p>
<p>The new schedules are available on the agency’s <a href="http://www.PortAuthority.org/coronavirus" target="_blank"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #000120;">website</span></span></a>. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The agency will maintain its usual Saturday and Sunday schedules.</p>
