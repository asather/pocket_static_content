<h1>Man dies of injuries two days after Homewood assault</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man assaulted by two people in Homewood North on Friday evening died of his injuries in the hospital on Sunday, authorities announced on Monday.</p>
<p>Police say that Roger Brown, 63, was assaulted near the 7200 block of Frankstown Avenue in Homewood North on Friday by Marlon Johnson, 31, and his cousin, Madera Johnson, 47.</p>
<p>When police and EMS arrived at the scene at around 4:40 p.m., they found Mr. Brown unresponsive and had him transported to a local hospital in critical condition. The affidavit of probable cause for Marlon Johnson said that Mr. Brown was bleeding from his head.</p>
<p>Mr. Brown died at the hospital two days later.</p>
<p>The affidavit implies that Mr. Brown and Madera Johnson had an antagonistic history.</p>
<p>An eyewitness to the crime, identified as Witness 1, told police that Madera Johnson had robbed Mr. Brown of $20 the week prior, and that when the two randomly met on Frankstown Avenue near the Rosing Lounge on Friday, Mr. Brown called her an expletive.</p>
<p>Witness 1 said that after Mr. Brownâ€™s comment, Madera Johnson called over Marlon Johnson, her cousin, and the two proceeded to attack him for about a minute and a half.</p>
<p>The assault was captured on a camera positioned above Frankstown Avenue, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>The officers who reviewed the footage of the camera were able to locate Marlon Johnson based on the clothing he wore in the video and arrested him on Saturday.</p>
<p>Witness 1 was later able to identify both Marlon and Madera Johnson, who was also found and arrested Saturday.</p>
<p>The cousins have criminal histories stretching back to the late 2000s, including several other assault and reckless endangerment charges, among others.</p>
<p>Both are currently facing a simple assault charge and an aggravated assault charge a piece, but authorities said that the investigation continues and could lead to additional charges.&nbsp;</p>
