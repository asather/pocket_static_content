<h1>Pa. university leaders hope paying out accrued sick leave will entice early faculty retirements</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Will paying up to 125 accrued sick days instead of the maximum 50 convince 200 State System of Higher Education professors to retire early, trimming the teaching force at the 14 state universities by almost 4 percent?</p>
<p>The State System’s board of governors is betting&nbsp;“yes.”</p>
<p>The panel, meeting Thursday in Harrisburg, approved the&nbsp;“Enhanced Sick Leave Payout Program,” after leaders including Chancellor Daniel Greenstein characterized it as necessary to help bring faculty numbers into line with declining enrollment — one key element of the system’s overall efforts to restore financial health.</p>
<p>Costs of the program and expected long-term savings were not immediately available Thursday, and board members did not discuss specific dollar costs in the public session. However, they characterized the program as an important step toward reconciling campus costs with revenue.</p>
<p>Since 2010, the State System’s enrollment has declined by 20 percent, from nearly 120,000 students to about 96,000 — a loss of almost 24,000 that approaches the combined enrollment of the system’s two largest campuses, West Chester and Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In his annual State of the System address a day earlier, Mr. Greenstein said the schools hit by population loss and budgetary woes are finally on the cusp of righting their finances. He asked the state for an additional $20 million in taxpayer funding each of the next five years beyond regular appropriations, to help with system redesign.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he articulated why the system is using accrued sick time to move toward what some critics in the state Legislature have argued was years overdue.</p>
<p>“This year is gong to be critical,” he said. “It is no longer a matter of choice about whether we align our costs with revenues, and they are unfortunately out of line. We have a limited number of tools that are available to us.”</p>
<p>Samuel Smith, board vice chair and chair of IUP’s Council of Trustees agreed.</p>
<p>“Its going to be important for us to get the employee and student ratios in line. Same as we have with our capital projects ... we need to tear some buildings down (to) appropriate-size the physical plant. We’ve talked about that for a couple of years at IUP.”</p>
<p>Last year, the State System announced a phased retirement offer for which about 900 professors are currently eligible. To date, 76 have indicated interest in participating, said system spokesman David Pidgeon.</p>
<p>He said those considering that offer are eligible for the enhanced sick leave program, but he said the new offer was not a result of any lack of interest in the earlier program. It’s “another creative and meaningful incentive and provides an additional option for faculty considering retirement,” he said.</p>
<p>The program, as outlined in the board of governors agenda, requires at least 200 faculty elect to retire in the 2019-2020 fiscal year, and they must qualify for majority paid retiree health care. They could rescind their decision if the target number is not met, officials said.</p>
<p>Those interested must notify the president of the their respective universities by March 2, 2020, and leave leave retire no later than Aug. 14.</p>
<p>The sick leave payout, outlined in a union side letter, is a temporary amendment to the sick leave payout schedule identified in the collective bargaining agreement with the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, which represents more than 5,000 faculty, plus several hundred State System athletic coaches.</p>
<p>The union could not immediately be reached for comment on Thursday’s board vote.</p>
<p>Backup material for the board of governors agenda indicated that those eligible for the program can range in age based on years of service, from 25 to 10 years, and 5 years for those with an approved disability. Those eligible for 125 days would have to have accrued at least 300 sick days over the course of their tenure, according to the board of governors agenda.</p>
<p>In addition to IUP, the State System schools include:&nbsp;Bloomsburg, California, Cheyney, Clarion, East Stroudsburg, Edinboro, Indiana, Kutztown, Lock Haven, Mansfield, Millersville, Shippensburg, Slippery Rock and West Chester universities of Pennsylvania.</p>
