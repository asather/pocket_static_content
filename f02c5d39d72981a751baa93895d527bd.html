<h1>College and COVID-19: Classroom equity in an era of social distancing</h1>

<p>Giving every student an equitable path to a college degree regardless of income, race or hometown has never been easy across the 14 state universities serving regions as distinct as suburban Philadelphia and Western Pennsylvania mill towns.</p>
<p>But the job could grow even tougher this fall amid the pandemic, as State System of Higher Education students return to campuses that are different from one another but must follow the same general rules for reducing density in classes and dorms.</p>
<p>Given that, the State System's board of governors held a special meeting Wednesday and endorsed creating a framework to guide each school's reopening plans. The measure says each plan must "support all students’ progress towards their degrees while mitigating health and safety risks that exist for students, employees, and their host communities."&nbsp;</p>
<p>What that ultimately looks like could vary significantly across the 14 universities -- among them California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock universities in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>All are preparing for some form of in-person instruction, system officials said, and many have announced strategies for keeping students safe with varying degrees of detail.</p>
<p>"Our universities serve students from different parts of the state and the world and are located in areas that have felt the pandemic’s impacts differently," State System Chancellor Daniel Greenstein told a Senate Education Committee hearing on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The campuses each have their own building configurations and access to different levels of off-campus health care. Some are simply larger than others.</p>
<p>For instance, managing health risks is one thing for Mansfield University, with just 2,100 students, located in north central Pennsylvania's Tioga County, which has 19 coronavirus cases as of this week.</p>
<p>It’s another at West Chester University, with almost 18,000 students, located in Chester County which has 3,134 cases and is west of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Student characteristics will inevitably shape the plans, too, Mr. Greenstein told the committee.</p>
<p>As universities weigh how many students they can bring back on campus at any given time, and for how long, they must consider how individuals may be affected differently. Students from rural parts of the state with poor internet access will be at a disadvantage if they must take classes remotely.</p>
<p>Giving first-year students in-person classes is a priority, he said.</p>
<p>The same is true for academically at-risk students from poorer households. "They don't do as well in online environments," he said. "They certainly don't do as well as their wealthier peers.”</p>
<p>Responding to a question about COVID-19’s disproportionate impact on the disadvantaged from state Sen. Lindsey Williams, D-West View, Mr. Greenstein said it has laid bare vividly many longstanding obstacles to graduation and careers.</p>
<p>"The pandemic has basically just done an MRI on the structural inequalities and unequal outcomes that exist across society whether that's in terms of health outcomes or educational outcomes or access to employment," he said.</p>
<p>The State System campuses enroll about 96,000 students. They and their families have been watching for weeks to see what a residential campus experience will look like in an era of social distancing.</p>
<p>Faculty have been watching, too.&nbsp;They are eager to return to face-to-face instruction, but some also have trepidation about health risks, said Jamie Martin, an IUP professor of criminology and the new president of the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties.</p>
<p>Will there be enough personal protective equipment on the campuses, including masks? How will classrooms be sanitized against the virus as one class leaves a room and another enters?</p>
<p>They or someone in their family could be immuno-compromised, or at higher risk because of age.</p>
<p>"Some have asked, ‘What if I go back to campus for face-to-face classes and I get sick? What happens then?’ ” Ms. Martin said. "Do I teach from home?"</p>
<p>How to maintain social distance while meeting with students in small faculty offices is another question she’s heard.</p>
<p>"What happens if a student comes to class and he's lost his mask? Do you ban him from the class?"</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s meeting, State System board members discussed via Zoom issues familiar to other universities that have pondered the pros and cons of bringing students back in the fall, from availability of COVID-19 testing and the impact on university finances to liability if cases spike and a student becomes ill or dies.</p>
<p>State Sen.&nbsp;Judith Schwank, D-Berks, a member of the State System’s board, asked how students will get transportation for testing if they become ill on a campus that is not within easy reach of a hospital. She also asked about off-campus housing leases that could leave students in a financial bind if the virus surges this fall and students must leave for home.</p>
<p>“If we have to flip back totally to remote instruction, how are we going to help these students?”</p>
<p>In recent days, State System spokesman David Pidgeon said how schools approach the fall was a local campus decision in part because they know their regions the best. But the agenda for Wednesday's special meeting said each school would have to adhere to federal and state health and safety guidelines, including those from the state Department of Education.</p>
<p>In addition, each would have to conform to State System guidance to ensure consistency in areas from curtailing institutional travel, expectations for students and employees about safety, and circumstances when a university must curtail or suspend in-person instruction.</p>
<p>The resolution up for adoption affirms the chancellor’s right to modify the framework “to nimbly respond” to uncertainties with the pandemic.</p>
<p>Ms. Martin said she believes the universities must be up front with students about ways in which any residential experience will be different due to precautions against COVID-19 in the class and across campuses. She expressed confidence that schools are already attempting to do so</p>
<p>"There has to be some truth in advertising," she said.</p>
