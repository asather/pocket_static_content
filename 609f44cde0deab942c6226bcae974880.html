<h1>Penn State planning tuition freeze for 2020-21 academic year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Citing economic upheaval wrought by the pandemic, Penn State University President Eric Barron says he will recommend a tuition freeze university-wide for the 2020-21 academic year.</p>
<p>The move would cover some 96,000 students on the main University Park campus and branches across the Commonwealth, including those in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Penn State's base tuition on its main campus is $17,416, not counting room, board and other fees.</p>
<p>The recommended freeze comes a week after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/16/Pitt-academic-calendar-university-students-Pittsburgh-fall-semester-coronavirus/stories/202004160183" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said</a> it would be hard to envision a tuition increase this fall for his university of 34,000 students in light of the financial hardships families now face.</p>
<p>Nearly 50,000 have died from COVID-19 in the United States and 26 million Americans have become unemployed in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Barron's recommendation will be presented to Penn State's board of trustees at its July 17 meeting, the university said in a statement.</p>
<p>If approved, it also would be the third consecutive freeze covering in-state residents attending the state's land-grant university.</p>
<p>“It is imperative that we give our students and their families some measure of certainty in these uncertain times,” Mr. Barron said in a statement Friday. “No one knows how long this pandemic and the associated economic disruptions will last, but we want to do our part to ease the strain on our students by letting them know as early as possible that their tuition will not increase for the next academic year."</p>
<p>He added that the university is committed to "doing all that we can to help our students continue in their studies and earn a Penn State degree.”</p>
<p>In addition to freezing tuition for the fall 2020 and spring 2021 semesters, Penn State also announced a plan to adjust tuition rates for the upcoming summer 2020 semester, using a pre-existing tuition structure. That measure also is subject to a trustees vote in July.</p>
