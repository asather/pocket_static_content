<p>The Ringgold School District in Washington County is closed Friday due to an undisclosed threat at the Ringgold Middle School, officials said in a statement. The missed day will be considered a Flexible Instruction Day, also due in part to Friday morning’s snowy weather.</p>
<p>In a statement posted on Twitter Thursday evening, the Monongahela school district said they received warning about a threat to Ringgold Middle School from a youth violence prevention program run by the state Attorney General’s office.</p>
<p>Authorities are investigating the Safe2Say tip in coordination with school district police. The notification raised “safety concerns” for the district’s students, officials said.</p>
<p>“We want to encourage students to feel comfortable reporting any information they may have that compromises their safety and the safety of others,” the district said in a statement. “Please contact your child’s school administrator with any questions.”</p>
<p>Students are asked to record their attendance Friday via the district website or the Ringgold phone app.</p>
