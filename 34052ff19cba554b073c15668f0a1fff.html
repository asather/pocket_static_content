<h1>All courts in Pennsylvania to close for at least two weeks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All courts in Pennsylvania are to close for at least two weeks to mitigate the spread of the deadly COVID-19 disease, as directed Wednesday by the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Beginning at the end of business Thursday, all courts will close except for essential operations. The announcement came with a declaration of a judicial emergency across all districts in the state.</p>
<p>The state’s highest court on Monday declared a statewide judicial emergency, giving the president judges in each district the power to do the same. The new declaration given Wednesday now states a judicial emergency exists in each district.</p>
<p>Facilities in all districts, Commonwealth and Supreme courts will be closed to the public until at least April 3. Jurors are not to report for duty before or on April 3.</p>
<p>The closures follow recommendations from state Health Secretary Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>“While recognizing the great concern for access to justice in the state of Pennsylvania, we urge the court system to consider statewide closure of the courts, expect for essential services, for a period of 14 days,” Dr. Levine wrote in a letter to Chief Justice Thomas Saylor.</p>
<p>Because of the economic consequences of the novel coronavirus’ pandemic, all evictions, ejections or other displacements of a tenant due to failure to make rent or loan during the period of a judicial emergency are stayed.</p>
<p>All legal papers and pleadings that require filing during the closure are to be filed by April 6, the high court said. Local and appellate courts may consider later dates according to the volume of filings.</p>
<p>Additionally, all time calculations and deadlines for individual cases are suspended through April 3. That overlaps with suspensions already given by president judges, and longer suspensions from other courts are to remain in place.</p>
<p>An amended plan from the Fifth Judicial District states hearings on juvenile delinquency detention and probation violation will be held by video or teleconference.</p>
<p>Juvenile dependency matters are suspended until further order of the court. Hearings involving shelter care, plus adjudicatory and dispositional hearings where the child is in&nbsp;kinship care, congregate care or foster care, will be held by video or teleconference&nbsp;“to the fullest extent possible.”</p>
<p>All cases in the Magisterial District Courts are postponed.</p>
<p>In the intermediate courts, essential functions that will continue include matters of election, Children’s Fast Track, credible emergency filings and any other matter a president judge declares essential.</p>
<p>Court orders that compel the appearance of any participant in a nonessential case are postponed. Jury and non-jury trials in civil and criminal courts are suspended and will be scheduled for a future date.</p>
<p>If a jury trial has already commenced, the presiding judge may determine, at the approval of the district’s president judge, that the completion of the trial without delay is essential in the interests of justice.</p>
