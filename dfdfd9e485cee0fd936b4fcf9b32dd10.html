<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Former Pirates outfielder Starling Marte shared on social media Monday night that his wife, Noelia, has died of a heart attack.</p>
<p>“It is a moment of indescribable pain,” Marte wrote. “On behalf of my family, I am grateful for the expressions of esteem and solidarity in this difficult time.”</p>
<p>Starling and Noelia Marte had two kids, Starling Jr. (born in September 2013) and Tiana (born in May 2016).</p>
<p>The Pirates traded the 31-year-old Marte to the Arizona Diamondbacks in January for a pair of prospects, shortstop Liover Peguero and pitcher Brennan Malone.</p>
<p>Marte, who was Pittsburgh's longest-tenured player at the time of the trade, signed with the Pirates in 2007 and debuted with the big-league club in 2012. He won two Gold Gloves and was an All-Star in 2016, when he stole 47 bases and batted .311.</p>
<p>Marte was coming off a strong offensive year in 2019, when he set career highs in home runs (23), RBIs (82) and OPS (.845).</p>
