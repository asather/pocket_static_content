<h1>Pirates injury updates: Mitch Keller inching closer to return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been a little more than a month since Pirates right-hander <strong>Mitch Keller</strong> pitched in a game.&nbsp;That was Aug. 1, a 4-3 loss to the Chicago Cubs in which Keller threw 2⅔ innings before departing with an oblique injury.</p>
<p>The road back to health can be agonizing, obviously, for any player, and Keller’s progress has been slow and steady.</p>
<p>Over the past weeks, he has begun throwing before slowly ticking up his workload in each outing. His most recent step in the right direction came Wednesday before the Pirates’ game against the Chicago White Sox, when he threw three innings and 43 pitches in a simulated game at PNC Park.</p>
<p>“Again, still early stages, all signs were very positive coming out of the sim game today,” Pirates’ director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk said Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a normal season, Tomczyk clarified, this simulated game would likely have been a rehab start for Keller with one of the Pirates’ minor-league affiliates. In 2020, with no minor league season at all, that obviously isn’t possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Instead, this is really the best the Pirates can do. Still, the same sort of goal was achieved, if not at the actual-game-like level the Pirates would like. Tomczyk said they would normally like to get players up to three-to-five innings before bringing them back to the team. Wednesday means that goal has been achieved for Keller.</p>
<p>The next steps, then, are to monitor his recovery from the simulated game before throwing a side session. After that, Tomczyk said, he, manager Derek Shelton, pitching coach Oscar Marin and general manager Ben Cherington will discuss a possible return plan for Keller.</p>
<p><strong>More injury updates</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;For the second straight simulated game/live batting practice session, Keller was joined by right-handed pitcher <strong>Jameson Taillon</strong>. The plan for Taillon, who is recovering from Tommy John surgery, is eventually to wind down in the near future and undergo a typical offseason workout.</p>
<p>In the present, his workload saw a slight increase from last week to this one, as he threw 25 pitches in a live batting practice session as opposed to the 20 he threw in his previous session.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Right-handed reliever <strong>Keone Kela</strong> threw off the mound recently for the first time since right forearm discomfort put him on the shelf.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He, like Keller, is still hoping to return to the Pirates before the end of the season, though he does seem to be a bit further away than Keller.</p>
<p>“He’s a competitor,” Tomczyk said. “He wants to be out with his teammates, and we as an organization have to do what’s best for Keone, first and foremost, which we have done from Day 1, and if that means that Keone’s going to pitch again this year, the little time we have, we’re going to try to honor that. He’s a really good asset to the team. He’s a really good pitcher, and I know he wants to finish strong, if that’s possible.”</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Right-handed reliever <strong>Yacksel Rios</strong> experienced a set-back in his rehab and has been shut down from throwing once again after playing some long toss last week. He will undergo some tests before the Pirates decide how to proceed forward.</p>
<p><strong>Consistency wanted</strong></p>
<p>There’s been plenty made about <strong>Gregory Polanco’s</strong> exit velocity this season — at 92.8 mph, only 14 in all of MLB (minimum: 50 plate appearances) have been better.</p>
<p>There’s also been a lot made of Polanco’s strikeouts. Among hitters with 50 or more plate appearances, only three have a higher strikeout rate than Polanco’s 40.4%.</p>
<p>For the right fielder, there has been entirely too much swing-and-miss and not enough consistency.</p>
<p>“I’m hitting the ball hard, but I want to be more consistent,” Polanco said. “I have to keep working on making contact and shortening my swing. Not try to swing so hard and [actually] see the ball. If you can’t see the ball, you can’t hit the ball.</p>
<p><strong>Time change</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates announced on Wednesday that the time of their game on Thursday, Sept. 24 against the Cubs at PNC Park has been changed from a 7:05 p.m start to 1:35.</p>
