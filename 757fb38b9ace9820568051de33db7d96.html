<h1>Penguins announce training camp roster, schedule </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the Penguins prepare to open training camp on Monday, the club announced its 34-player camp roster. It includes a number of interesting additions — and at least one noteworthy omission.</p>
<p>Samuel Poulin highlights the so-called “Black Aces” who will skate with the club at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex on Monday. The 19-year-old winger was the Penguins’ first-round pick in 2019. He’ll be joined by fellow prospects like&nbsp;Pierre-Olivier Joseph — a defenseman from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton who came over in the Phil Kessel trade — Sam Miletic and Philip Varone.</p>
<p>Nick Bjugstad (spine surgery), Dominik Simon (labrum surgery) and Zach Trotman (undisclosed injury) will not be part of the 13-day camp. Per NHL rules, players cannot join teams once a phase begins. There had been some rumblings and reports that Bjugstad might be ready to return by the middle of the playoffs. However, based on the fact that he’s not part of training camp, his season appears to be finished.</p>
<p>In total, the Penguins will carry 19 forwards, 10 defensemen and five goalies. The 13-day camp will consist of eight practice days, two off days and three “game-day simulations,” which will mimic a traditional game-day schedule and include an intrasquad scrimmage.</p>
<p>The Penguins will eventually have to trim the 34-player list to 31 before they enter the hub city in Toronto on July 26. The first game of a five-game series against the Montreal Canadiens is slated for Aug. 1. The game time and TV details will be announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Here’s the complete training camp roster:</p>
