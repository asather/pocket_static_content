<h1>High school sports activities get green light, but schools need to formulate plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>High school athletes should lace up the shoes, inflate the balls and get the sports equipment ready. Team workouts are permitted to start — as soon as their schools gives the OK.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf issued COVID-19 guidelines Wednesday for the startup of all school sports activities, including team workouts and even summer-league contests. The PIAA gave its approval to the guidelines, which pertain to any school located in a county that is in the green or yellow phase.</p>
<p>The guidelines allow for school sports teams (kindergarten through 12th grade) to begin workouts immediately. But ultimately, the onus for the start of high school sports rests on every individual school.</p>
<p>The guidelines from the Governor’s office state: “The decision to resume sports-related activities, including conditioning, practices and games, is the discretion of a school entity’s governing body.”</p>
<p>In other words, school districts must now come up with their own plan.</p>
<p>“We worked collaboratively with the Governor and the Pennsylvania Department of Education,” PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said. “Like anything, there was some give and take, but overall this is a good thing.</p>
<p>“We’re also following the guidance of our PIAA sports medicine committee. This couldn’t be a ‘one size fits all’ thing, because every school, every community is so different. Individualized assessments need to be tailored to the needs of the school.”</p>
<p>The PIAA issued a release last Friday telling schools they should start formulating their own plans for restarting sports workouts, using the CDC guidelines to help. In the spring and summer, many high school teams start workouts that are supposed to be “voluntary.” High school football teams go to their field and have workouts without contact. Basketball teams have open gyms and participate in spring and summer leagues. But the PIAA, under the Governor’s office direction, declared in April that no school teams could have group workouts on school grounds until July 1, at the earliest.</p>
<p>“Heck, if there are schools that already have come up with their own rules, teams could start voluntary workouts today,” Lombardi said.</p>
<p>Schools will now have to come up with rules that will try to answer a number of questions: Will there be screening for athletes before every workout? What if an athlete tests positive for COVID-19?</p>
<p>The Governor’s guidelines would allow full high school football teams to have workouts, provided they are in the green phase. The guidelines say, “Any sports-related activities in yellow or green phased counties must adhere to the gathering limitations set forth by the Governor’s Plan for Phased Reopening (25 in yellow, 250 in green).”</p>
<p>All counties that are in the WPIAL area will be in the green phase by Friday.</p>
<p>The Governor’s guidelines also state, “as more public health information is available, the administration may work with impacted entities to release further guidance which could impact fall, winter or spring seasons.”</p>
<p>When asked whether the new guidelines give promise to the thought of Pennsylvania having high school games in the fall, Lombardi said, “My positioning is still the same. I’m cautiously optimistic. I don’t want to get ahead of that or behind it. This guidance is helpful and I’m hoping all our schools take this seriously and handle it properly. I think it will go a long way in allowing a foundation to be set for the fall.”</p>
