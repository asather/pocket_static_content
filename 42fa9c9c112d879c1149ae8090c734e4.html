<h1>Pirates spring training: Slow offensive start continues in loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The Pirates dropped a rain-shortened game — called after 7 1/2 innings — on Wednesday at LECOM Park, falling to the Boston Red Sox, 6-3.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh, which managed just four hits, is now 0-5-1 thus far in spring training, having scored a total of 16 runs in those games. Only three MLB teams have scored less.</p>
<p>With three home runs allowed Wednesday, Pirates pitchers have given up seven this spring while their hitters have just one.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Mitch Keller started and fared pretty well. He actually said he was happier with this outing than his first one, a big reason being how well he used his fastball at the top of the strike zone.</p>
<p>The right-hander lasted 1 2/3 innings and allowed two earned runs on three hits with a walk and three strikeouts. Both runs came on a home run by Jarren Duran, when the Red Sox center fielder rode a 2-0 fastball the other way out to left.</p>
<p>Most impressive might’ve been Nick Burdi, who twice hit triple digits on the LECOM Park radar gun. Burdi gave up a hit and struck out two during a scoreless inning of work.</p>
<p>After missing much of last season because of surgery to relieve symptoms of neurogenic thoracic outlet syndrome, Burdi has looked terrific thus far in spring.</p>
<p>“It’s very obvious the level of his stuff,” manager Derek Shelton said. “It’s just making sure that every time he goes out, he’s feeling OK. He’s definitely one of those guys we’re checking in with just to make sure he feels the way he should.”</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Jose Osuna, who started at third base, went 1-for-3 with a double and an RBI, while Cole Tucker was also 1-for-3 with an RBI single. Gregory Polanco, who started in right field for the first time this spring, drove an 0-2 fastball from left-hander Martin Perez for a hit.</p>
<p>“Really aggressive — good,” Shelton said of Polanco’s at-bats so far. “Left on left [Wednesday], he hit another rocket. That’s really good. The consistency of his at-bats stands out in a very positive way.”</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>One interesting sequence came in the top of the fifth inning. Tucker made a leaping grab, and Osuna followed with a barehanded stab to get the out at first.</p>
<p>With Erik Gonzalez not quite game ready, what Osuna showed could be important assuming the Pirates choose to start Ke’Bryan Hayes in the minors.</p>
<p>At minimum, because of what he’s done as a pinch-hitter, it seems that Osuna has the inside track on keeping a bench job in 2020.</p>
<p>“If you don’t watch him play every day, it’s tough to appreciate how good of an athlete he is,” Shelton said of Osuna. “With the number of at-bats we’re trying to give guys at that position, it was important to get him on that side of the field for a game.”</p>
