<h1>Pirates' Michael Feliz moved to 45-day injured list, reliever Yacksel Rios joins team</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With a shortened lead up to a shortened 2020 season, a large concern for Pirates manager Derek Shelton has been his pitchers’ usage as he tries to prevent injuries as much as possible.</p>
<p>Even still, the Pirates have seen starter Mitch Keller go down with an oblique injury and relievers Kyle Crick, Clay Holmes and Michael Feliz go to the injured list, as well.</p>
<p>On Monday, the news got slightly worse for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Feliz, after originally being placed on the 10-day injured list with right forearm discomfort, has now been moved to the 45-day injured list with a right forearm/elbow strain. In a corresponding move, the Pirates selected the contract of reliever Yacksel Rios, who has joined the Pirates’ 40-man roster and is in Minnesota with the team for their series against the Twins.</p>
<p>The move does not necessarily indicate that Feliz’s injury is worse than previously thought, according to Shelton.</p>
<p>“I think it was the fact that we got him back and we got him re-evaluated by our doctors and realized we need to have some more tests run and that it was probably going to be a little bit longer than expected — actually not longer than we expected. We didn’t know until we got him evaluated,” Shelton said Monday.</p>
<p>Feliz left Saturday’s game against the Chicago Cubs in the eighth inning, when catcher Jacob Stallings appeared to notice something was wrong with Feliz and called Shelton and the training staff out to the mound.</p>
<p>So far this season, Feliz has struggled. In his three appearances, which have totaled 1 2/3 innings and six earned runs on four hits, including a home run, cranking his ERA up to a 32.40 mark.</p>
<p>Still, the loss of Feliz puts another dent in a Pirate bullpen that is already doing a bit of patch work.</p>
<p>On Sunday, in the wake of Keller and Feliz’s injuries, the Pirates activated Sam Howard and Cody Ponce off their taxi squad. Both appeared in Sunday’s loss to the Cubs, with Ponce, making his major league debut, allowing the game-winning run in the 11th inning.</p>
<p>Now, Rios joins the squad after spending the beginning of the season with the alternate training squad in Altoona. He made 10 appearances with the Pirates last season, allowing six earned runs and striking out 10 batters in 10.1 innings. He was acquired midseason of 2019 on waivers from the Philadelphia Phillies, where he pitched 55 innings over three seasons with an ERA of 6.38.</p>
<p>The good news for the Pirates is that they will be getting their best reliever back in short order. Closer Keone Kela produced the needed negative tests to allow him to return to the team after testing positive for COVID-19 before the start of summer camp.</p>
<p>While it is unclear when exactly Kela will return to the team, the Pirates are certainly eager to have him back. That is especially true with the injuries to Holmes, Crick and Feliz. Their absences, while unwanted, would not necessarily be catastrophic on their own, but in a Pirates bullpen with relatively few established pitchers, the absences add up.</p>
