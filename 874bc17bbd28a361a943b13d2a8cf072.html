<p>Vice President Mike Pence is in Western Pennsylvania and making several campaign stops in a run-up to November’s general election.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence landed at the Pennsylvania Air National Guard’s 171 Air Refueling Wing in Coraopolis at 10:40 a.m. and is headed to Cornerstone Ministries Church in Export where he participated in a fireside chat highlighting President (Donald) Trump’s record as the most pro-life president ever."</p>
<p>After exiting Air Force Two, Mr. Pence was greeted by Col. Brian Lehew;&nbsp;Jondavid R. Longo, the mayor of Slippery Rock; and Mike Slupe, the sheriff of Butler County. From there, Mr. Pence boarded a blue bus emblazoned with the Trump/Pence 2020 logo.</p>
<p>On the way to Export, the motorcade made a surprise stop at a GOP Victory office, which is a short drive from the Cornerstone church. Outside the office, around 100 people, many holding Trump/Pence and Keep America Great signs, were waiting. The crowd applauded and chanted&nbsp;“four more years” as Mr. Pence waved and stepped off the bus.</p>
<p>“The road to victory goes straight through Pennsylvania,” Mr. Pence said.</p>
<p>Re-election would mean more jobs, more support for troops, more judges and more support for law enforcement and law and order, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s gonna take at least four more years to drain that swamp,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence talked about the ongoing pandemic and said Mr. Trump has led nation through the greatest mobilization since World War II. Billions of supplies and testing delivered.</p>
<p>“We’re slowing the spread, we’re flattening the curve, we’re saving lives and we’re opening up America again and we’re opening up American schools,” Mr. Pence said.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing to think our economy already ... added back more than 10 million jobs.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pence said the president is a leader who has kept every promise he made. Meanwhile, “the Democratic Party has been overtaken by the radical left,” who supports open borders, “abortion on demand” and cutting funding for law enforcement.</p>
<p>“Bring all your energy, bring all your enthusiasm and have faith,” he said.</p>
<p>The bus arrived at Cornerstone shortly after noon, and in the short drive between stops, supporters lined the side of the road, some waving flags. At the church, some held signs thanking Mr. Pence for being pro-life.</p>
<p>Inside, Mr. Pence was seated in the front of the room, and seven people were seated and socially distanced at tables around him.</p>
<p>He thanked the group fro helping women during the most challenging time of their lives. More than 7,000 children have been born into the community because of the network, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump is&nbsp;“the most pro-life president in American history” and stands for sanctity of life, he told the group. He called the people who service at crisis pregnancy centers as&nbsp;“the hands and feet of faith and compassion in this country.”</p>
<p>Those who participated in the discussion were:&nbsp;Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of Susan B. Anthony List;&nbsp;Paul Mango, deputy chief of staff for policy at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services;&nbsp;Natalie Pineda, director of Women’s Choice Networks Center;&nbsp;Amy Scheuring, executive director of Women’s Choice Network;&nbsp;Chuck Donovan, president of Charlotte Lozier Institute;&nbsp;Susan Geer, co-founder of Women’s Choice Network; retired Judge Cheryl Allen, Pennsylvania Superior Court; and&nbsp;Ikea Wellens and Ne-Lynn, mother and child.</p>
<p>From there, Mr. Pence went to another room where he patricipated in a&nbsp;“fireside chat” with Ms. Dannenfelser. The event, which included about 200 people in attendance, was part of SBA List’s national&nbsp;“LIFE Wins! 2020” tour. SBA List is a pro-life, anti-abortion nonprofit group.</p>
<p>After a prayer, Ms. Dannenfelser opened the event and introduced Mr. Mango, who ran as a gubernatorial candidate in Pennsylvania in 2017. Mr. Mango gave a shoutout to Mike Kelly and John Joyce, Pennsylvania Congressmen who were in attendance.</p>
<p>Mr. Mango recapped the things Mr. Trump has done, through HHS, to prove the case he's a pro-life president. These include:</p>
<p>● In Jan. 2017, rescinding guidance that "precluded us" from providing health assistance to non-government organizations that either supported or promoted abortion.</p>
<p>● Rescinding guidance that precluded states from excluding Medicaid providers who performed abortions.</p>
<p>● "Remember Little Sisters of the Poor?" Mango asked. "Our president liberated those Little Sisters from the Poor from having to pay ... for ... contraception."</p>
<p>● Jan. 2020, preventing discirmination in grants and research for faith-based organizations.</p>
<p>After the stop at Cornerstone, Mr. Pence is scheduled to continue the bus tour with a stop in Freedom, Beaver County, where he is scheduled to&nbsp; showcase the administration’s economic policies — notably, on fracking — to a “Workers for Trump” crowd.</p>
<p>At the event at the PennEnergy Resources Natural Gas Producing Well, Mr. Pence is expected to outline how the administration has defended the energy industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Pence’s visit happens two days before his running mate, Mr. Trump, is set to commemorate the 19th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks at a memorial service for Flight 93 in Stonycreek, Somerset County. Democratic candidate Joe Biden also is scheduled to visit the Stonycreek area that day. No further details have been announced.</p>
