<h1>Pirates players and coaches will wear No. 21 on Roberto Clemente Day</h1>

<p>The number 21 is making a pretty big comeback, as the Pirates announced on Wednesday that players and coaches will all wear it on Roberto Clemente Day, which is Wednesday, Sept. 9, against the Chicago White Sox.</p>
<p>In the days after the game, the jerseys will be placed for auction on <a href="http://pirates.auctions.mlb.com" target="_blank">pirates.auctions.mlb.com</a>. Proceeds from the sale will benefit the Clemente Foundation and Pirates Charities.</p>
<p>The number 21 isn’t officially retired by Major League Baseball, although it probably should be. Players are often hesitant to wear it because of the association with Clemente and the reverence that players — specifically those from Latin America — have for the Pirates legend.</p>
<p>“Our staff and players are excited to wear the number 21 with pride as we constantly search for ways to not only honor Roberto’s legacy but to keep his memory alive through our community actions,” Pirates owner Bob Nutting said in a statement announcing the move. “We recognize what this moment represents for all of us within the organization, the Clemente Family, our fans, and the people of Puerto Rico. We take great pride in representing such a great ambassador of the game.”</p>
<p>Each season the Pirates honor Clemente with the Roberto Clemente Day of Giving, with the entire organization volunteering its time by getting out in the community and making donations to local nonprofits and schools.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball first observed Roberto Clemente Day in 2002. Each September it’s celebrated across both leagues.</p>
<p>Since Clemente’s death on Dec. 31, 1972, no Pirates player has worn 21 on the field, as Pittsburgh retired the 12-time All-Star’s number in 1973.</p>
<p>“Since 1973 the only persons allowed to wear no. 21 in a Pirate uniform would had been any of the three sons,” Luis Clemente added. “I became the closest to have that honor but didn’t continue to play to reach the Major League level.</p>
<p>“History will be made this Sept. 9, and we would like to express our deepest gratitude to Derek Shelton for his initiative and supporting the Clemente Family endeavors. We thank Bob Nutting and the Pirates organization for continuing the goodwill of the Clemente name in their community efforts.”</p>
