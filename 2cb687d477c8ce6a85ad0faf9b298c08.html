<h1>U.S. probing if Russian bounties played role in killing of York County Marines</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating whether a roadside bomb that last year killed two Marines with ties to York County was linked to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/30/GOP-lawmakers-urge-action-Russia-Afghanistan-briefing-trump-bounties/stories/202006300068" target="_blank">bounties offered by Russia to kill American soldiers</a>.</p>
<p>Officials are focused on an April 8, 2019 attack on an American convoy that killed the Marines&nbsp;after a car rigged with explosives detonated near their armored vehicles as they returned to Bagram Airfield, the largest U.S. military installation in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Sgt. Benjamin S. Hines, 31, a York native and Dallastown Area High School graduate, and Staff Sgt. Christopher K.A. Slutman, 43, a Newark, Delaware, resident whose parents live in Lower Windsor, York County, were killed in the attack.&nbsp;Cpl. Robert A. Hendricks, 25, of Locust Valley, New York, also died.</p>
<p>The three Marines were all infantrymen assigned to 2nd Battalion, 25th Marines, a reserve infantry unit headquartered out of Garden City, New York.</p>
<p>The Marines exchanged gunfire with the vehicle at some point; however, it’s not known if the gunfire occurred before or after the car exploded.</p>
<p>Abdul Raqib Kohistani, the Bagram district police chief, said at the time that at least five Afghan civilians were wounded after the attack on the convoy, according to previous reporting by the Associated Press. It is not known if the civilians were injured by the car bomb or the gunfire from U.S. Marines.</p>
<p>The York Dispatch was unable to reach members of the families of Sgt. Hines or Staff Sgt. Slutman.</p>
<p>Hendriks’ father told the AP that even a rumor of Russian bounties should have been immediately addressed.</p>
<p>“If this was kind of swept under the carpet as to not make it a bigger issue with Russia, and one ounce of blood was spilled when they knew this, I lost all respect for this administration and everything,” Erik Hendriks said.</p>
<p>Marine Maj. Roger Hollenbeck said at the time that the reserve unit was a part of the Georgia Deployment Program-Resolute Support Mission, a recurring six-month rotation between U.S. Marines and Georgian Armed Forces. The unit first deployed to Afghanistan in October 2018.</p>
<p>The Associated Press reported Tuesday that the investigation was ongoing as lawmakers urged action <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/06/30/GOP-lawmakers-urge-action-Russia-Afghanistan-briefing-trump-bounties/stories/202006300068" target="_blank">following reports over the weekend</a> that the GRU, a Russian military intelligence unit, offered Taliban militants in Afghanistan bounties for dead Americans.</p>
<p>The White House first became aware of alleged bounties in early 2019, although President Donald&nbsp;Trump has dismissed those claims, saying he was never briefed because the information was not verified. His administration has largely focused on supporting his rebuttal.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Republican lawmakers have recognized the gravity of the reports, but they have said more information is needed to verify if they are true.</p>
<p>U.S. Rep. Scott Perry, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, echoed those sentiments in a Tuesday news conference with House Minority Whip Steve Scalise, R-La.</p>
<p>But if the intelligence is accurate, he said, the U.S. should issue “the absolutely strongest response we can level on that.”</p>
<p>Perry, of Carroll, Pa., and Scalise also highlighted the dangers of the bounty allegations being leaked. Media reports have heavily relied on anonymous sources over the past few days.</p>
<p>“We should be vigorously seeking to find out who leaked this information and prosecute them,” Perry said, claiming individuals leaked information about the bounties for political purposes.</p>
<p>Not only were the leaks illegal, Scalise said, but they have put American lives at risk and tipped off Russia, giving the country time to destroy evidence.</p>
<p>Russia had already been under sanctions for interfering in the 2016 presidential election and invading Ukraine in 2014.</p>
<p>Perry and Scalise argued Trump has been by far more aggressive than former President Barack Obama, who ejected 35 suspected Russian intelligence operatives and penalized four GRU officers in response to Russian meddling in the 2016 elections.</p>
<p>However, critics have said the lack of a timely, aggressive response to news of the GRU offering Taliban militants bounties highlights Trump’s failure to hold to account Russian President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;For years, Democrats have accused Trump of pandering to Putin.</p>
<p>Over the past couple of days, Democrats have also attacked the Trump administration for not briefing Congress on the intelligence reports.</p>
<p>Eight Republicans were the first to be briefed by the White House on Monday, news that U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., immediately pounced on.</p>
<p>“That’s not a congressional briefing. That’s a strategy meeting,” Casey tweeted Monday. “Russian schemes to target and kill U.S. service members is not a partisan issue. It’s an American issue. The full House and full Senate must be briefed immediately.”</p>
<p>Eight Democrats were briefed Tuesday on the matter, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., joined Casey in labeling the briefings insufficient and partisan.</p>
