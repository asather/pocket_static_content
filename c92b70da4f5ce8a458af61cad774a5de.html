<h1>Mail-in voting draws politics into the nation's courtrooms</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A crucial swing state for both parties’ White House hopes, Pennsylvania is seeing a groundswell of election-related litigation run through its court systems that could have consequences on a “presidential scale,” says a constitutional law professor who tracks similar suits across the country.</p>
<p>Since the state’s primary election a month and a half ago, Pennsylvania’s new focus on mail-in voting has been at the center of at least four high-profile legal petitions or complaints, each of which may seem solely dedicated to issues of procedure but could actually impact every important issue in American life, said Loyola Marymount University professor Justin Levitt.</p>
<p>“It’s really the infrastructure of infrastructure,” Mr. Levitt said of election administration. “You don’t notice it until it breaks, but when it breaks, you notice this a lot. That’s what all of these cases are about.”</p>
<p>As of this week, there have been at least 154 election-related cases that have gone through or are proceeding through the courts in 41 states and Washington, D.C., said Mr. Levitt, who tracks them for&nbsp;“<a href="https://electionlawblog.org/?p=111962" target="_blank">Election Law Blog</a>.”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign and several local Republican Congressman <a href="https://www.democracydocket.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/41/2020/06/complaint_trump-campaign-v-boockvar.pdf" target="_blank">sued Pennsylvania and the election boards of its 67 counties in late June</a>, alleging that the defendants’&nbsp;“hazardous, hurried and illegal” implementation of mail-in voting will open the door to “chaos” and fraud in the Nov. 3 general election.</p>
<p>The GOP’s lawsuit — filed in the U.S. District Court’s Western District of Pennsylvania —&nbsp;specifically seeks a ruling from the court preventing counties from allowing voters to return their absentee and mail-in ballots to locations other than their respective county elections offices. They also want to stop counties from tallying absentee and mail-in ballots that lack a secrecy envelope and give poll workers the permission to watch over all locations where votes are cast, not limited to the county of their residence and including where absentee or mail-in votes are returned on or before Election Day.</p>
<p>“Shifting from an absentee voting system to one that pushes unmonitored vote-by-mail creates opportunities for fraud, and encourages ballot harvesting where paid political operatives try to collect and deliver loose ballots,” said Jenna Ellis, the Trump campaign’s senior legal adviser, in a statement. “This lawsuit seeks to restore integrity into the process and mandate the ability of campaigns to monitor the casting, collecting, and counting of all votes.”</p>
<p>When political entities are involved in the suits, they’re typically trying to influence actual change, but also win the war of messaging, Mr. Levitt said. It gives voters the impression that they’re fighting for them, and might shake out some donations along the way.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Democratic Party — touting the fact that more than one million Democrats voted by mail on June 2 — <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/PA-PDP-20200710-complaint.pdf" target="_blank">filed a countersuit this past week</a> in Commonwealth Court in response to the Trump campaign complaint, asking the court to&nbsp;“issue declaratory and injunction relief so as to protect the franchise of absentee and mail-in voters.”</p>
<p>Insisting that the stakes in November’s election&nbsp;“could not be higher,” the Democrats wrote in their suit that the Trump campaign has made&nbsp;“wild” and&nbsp;“unsupported” assertions even though mail-in voting remains a&nbsp;“safe and ... important health measure in these times.”</p>
<p>The Democrats’ suit asks the court to issue an injunction protecting against all of the the efforts pursued by the GOP — which had claimed, among other things, that permitting ballot returns to&nbsp;“unmonitored ad hoc drop boxes” would allow&nbsp;“illegal [absentee] and mail-in voting, ballot harvesting, and other fraud to occur and/or go undetected, and will result in dilution of validly cast ballots.</p>
<p>“So long as ballots are returned by the elector to the Board in a manner that respects the integrity of the election, creative solutions by county Boards to facilitate ballot return are permitted by the Election Code,” the Democrats wrote in their countersuit. “Thus, there is a clear right to relief.”</p>
<p>State Rep. Ed Gainey, a Lincoln-Lemington Democrat who is named as a plaintiff in the Democrats’ suit along with several other officials, said he’s seen no evidence of fraud or cheating in vote-by-mail, and that if the GOP had evidence, they’d show it instead of naming hypotheticals.</p>
<p>Democrats, meanwhile, are trying to make it more convenient for people to vote during a pandemic, Mr. Gainey said.</p>
<p>“Here’s the reality: the Republicans can still have their constituents go to the polls,” Mr. Gainey said. “You can still go to the polls. Come on. What’s the next excuse?”</p>
<p>“If you can get your people to go to the polls because they’re not comfortable with mail-in ballots, and you have not given one shred of evidence that there’s been any kind of corruption or problem, what’s the issue — other than putting politics over people?” Mr. Gainey added.</p>
<p>This past Thursday, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People’s&nbsp;Pennsylvania State Conference, Common Cause Pennsylvania and League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/filing-penn-voting-case" target="_blank">filed a motion to intervene</a> directly as defendants in the Trump campaign’s suit.</p>
<p>“Given the unprecedented threat COVID-19 poses to in-person voting — a threat Plaintiffs completely fail to acknowledge — Plaintiffs’ requested relief would make voting impossible or unreasonably dangerous for many eligible voters,” they wrote.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Conference of the NAACP had <a href="https://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/PA-NAACP-petition-20200618.pdf" target="_blank">filed a separate suit in mid-June</a> in the Commonwealth Court seeking&nbsp;“injunctive relief, including requiring a minimum number of polling places per population, expansion of voting days, increased access to vote by mail, and use of hand-marked paper ballots for the general election,” according to a news release.</p>
<p>All matters appear to be pending before their respective courts.</p>
