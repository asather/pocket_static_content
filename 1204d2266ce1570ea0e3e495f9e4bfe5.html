<h1>WATCH: Steven Brault teams up in song with Broadway stars — and Josh Bell</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates pitcher Steven Brault has been dabbling in music since his days as a vocal performance major at Regis University. In April, he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/12/10/Pirates-Steven-Brault-Broadway-Winter-Meetings-two-way-player-pitcher/stories/201912100173" target="_blank">released his debut album</a> “A Pitch to Broadway,” which featured covers of 12 Broadway songs. One of those Brault-ified tunes was “Wait for Me” from “Hadestown,” a musical that won eight awards at the 2019 Tony Awards, including Best Musical.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Brault leveled up from covering “Hadestown” songs to performing a quarantine-themed version of “Wait for Me” over video chat with the stars of that show and Pirates teammate Josh Bell, who was also featured in a speaking role on Brault’s&nbsp;“A Pitch to Broadway” cover of that song.</p>
<p>The song featured Brault, Bell and “Hadestown” stars Andre De Shields (who won Best Actor in a Musical at the 2019 Tonys), Jewelle Blackman, Kay Trinidad and Yvette Gonzalez-Nacer.</p>
<p>In another Broadway-baseball crossover, Brault and the “Hadestown” cast and creatives also worked together on a heavy-duty version of “Take Me Out to the Ballgame.”</p>
<p>That cover featured everyone who participated in the first song (minus Bell) plus multiple members of the “Hadestown” band; Anais Mitchell, who did the show’s music, lyrics and book; Sharon Robinson, Jackie Robinson’s daughter; MLB Hall of Famer Ozzie Smith; MLB All-Star Nick Swisher; and Yankees great Bernie Williams on guitar.</p>
<p>Both covers were apparently the brainchild of Mitchell, who heard Brault’s cover of “Wait for Me” and decided she wanted to work with him in some capacity.&nbsp;De Shields also seemed thrilled to be working with Brault on these projects.</p>
<p>“Steven Brault made a pitch at Broadway, and I knocked it out of the park,” he said in a statement. “It was a match made in heaven, or rather Hadestown, since we both have ‘Damn Yankees’ on our resumes, he as the young Joe Hardy in a high school production, and I as Mr. Applegate in a regional one. I hope the fans have as much fun watching the videos as we had making them.”</p>
<p>There was a hint of melancholy to both songs, as they highlighted the fact that Broadway has been shut down since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic and just this week announced that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/06/29/Broadway-will-remain-dark-through-2020-COVID-19-pandemic-theater/stories/202006290071" target="_blank">it will remain dark</a> until at least Jan. 3, 2021. The tour of “Hadestown” was supposed to grace Pittsburgh this year, but it and the rest of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/06/23/End-of-the-road-Pittsburgh-will-not-see-Broadway-tour-in-2020/stories/202006230080" target="_blank">city’s 2020 Broadway Series</a> was also canceled.</p>
<p>Brault was able to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-pirates-steven-brault-opera-album-heinz-hall-spring-training/stories/202002100111" target="_blank">get in one live performance</a>&nbsp;with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra at Heinz Hall in February before the pandemic hit. He got <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/07/pirates-baseball-steven-brault-album-covid-19/stories/202004070072" target="_blank">some extra time</a> to work on his music during MLB’s hiatus, but with summer camp starting in a few days, he’ll have to focus on making sure his body — especially the left shoulder <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/02/steven-brault-injury-shut-down-pirates-spring-training/stories/202003020081" target="_blank">he injured in March</a> — is ready for a 60-game season.</p>
<p>At least he probably won’t have to worry as much about fellow <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/30/trevor-williams-pirates-2020-mlb-season-spring-training-2-0/stories/202006300112" target="_blank">Pirates pitcher Trevor Williams</a> bugging him about a potential guest appearance.</p>
<p>“Trevor Williams has asked me about being on my album so many times that I refuse to continue hearing about it because I don’t trust him,” Brault told the Post-Gazette in April. “I think that anything he does will be detrimental to the sound of the album.”</p>
