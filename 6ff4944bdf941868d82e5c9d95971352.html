<h1>Jos. A. Bank men's clothing stores, including Downtown site, fall victim to the pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Downtown retail is taking a hit.</p>
<p>The Jos. A. Bank men’s clothing store, a longtime fixture in the Golden Triangle, is expected to close its doors Aug. 8, a victim of pandemic-related cost cutting by its parent company, Tailored Brands.</p>
<p>A store representative confirmed the closing but referred all other questions to Tailored Brands in Houston, where no one could be reached for comment Friday.</p>
<p>The Downtown retailer, located at 230 Fifth Ave. in Market Square Place, is one of several Jos. A. Bank stores in the Pittsburgh region targeted for closing, according to local store reps.&nbsp;Other expected closings are in the Mall at Robinson, also on Aug. 8, and in Monroeville, where a store representative declined to give a closing date.</p>
<p>The Ross, Cranberry and Mt. Lebanon stores are expected to remain open, according to local reps.</p>
<p>In an announcement last week, Tailored Brands said it would be closing up to 500 stores over time based on current and anticipated trends in consumer demand.&nbsp;It stated that it “re-evaluated the forecasted profitability and strategic value” of each of its stores based on those trends.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its significant impact on our business, further actions are needed to help us strengthen our financial position so we can navigate our current realities,” said Dinesh Lathi, Tailored Brands president and CEO.</p>
<p>Tailored Brand stores also include Men’s Wearhouse, Moores Clothing for Men and K&amp;G.</p>
<p>The Jos. A. Bank store Downtown moved to its current location nearly a decade ago in what used to be the old G.C. Murphy building, which was converted into retail, apartment and fitness space as part of a $40 million renovation.&nbsp;Before that, the store was located in the Oliver Building on Smithfield Street for a number of years.</p>
<p>“Whenever you lose a retailer, I think it’s a loss for Downtown. Unfortunately, it’s due to the times we live in,” said John Valentine, executive director of the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corp.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it doesn’t reflect on Downtown because they’re closing 500 of 700 stores. It does reflect on the pandemic but not specifically on Downtown.”</p>
<p>Tailored Brands is the latest retailer to be devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;Earlier this week, the parent company of Ann Taylor and Lane Bryant filed for bankruptcy, with plans to permanently close up to 1,600 stores.</p>
<p>In addition, the venerable Brooks Brothers clothing store, a 200-year-old company that fitted many U.S. presidents, filed for bankruptcy in early July, with plans to close a quarter of its 200 stores.</p>
<p>The Brooks Brothers store on Smithfield Street in Downtown is not among those closing. A company spokesman said Friday night the store would reopen soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Valentine noted that there are several other men’s clothing stores still in business in the Golden Triangle, including Larrimor’s, Joseph Orlando and Heinz Healey’s.</p>
