<h1>Tuned In: Original stars join ‘Saved by the Bell,’ ‘thirtysomething’ sequel series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – “Saved by the Bell” fans can relax: Zack Morris (Mark-Paul Gosselaar, currently starring on ABC’s “mixed-ish”) will be in the “Saved by the Bell” sequel series for upcoming Comcast streaming service Peacock after all.</p>
<p>“Everybody can sleep well at night,” Gosselaar joked at an ABC party Wednesday during the Television Critics Association winter 2020 press tour. “I think Tiffani [Thiessen] has been engaged with. It looks like you will have us in some capacity.”</p>
<p>When the show was announced in 2019, the description included mention of Gosselaar’s Zack Morris character, now California’s governor, getting into a scandal for closing too many low-income schools and trying to rectify the controversy by sending the affected students to the best-performing schools, including Bayside High. But at the time of the announcement, Gosselaar hadn’t been contacted about returning.</p>
<p>Original series stars Mario Lopez (as A.C. Slater) and Elizabeth Berkley (as Jessie Spano) are already confirmed to be on board.</p>
<p>Just don’t expect Zack Morris to appear regularly on the new “Bell” — Gosselaar’s “mixed-ish” contract precludes that.</p>
<p>“I’m happy to be a part of it,” Gosselaar said of the new “Bell” from writer Tracey Wigfield (“30 Rock,” “Great News”). “What I’ve read so far, I’m good.”</p>
<p>Trans actress Josie Totah (“Champions”) will play Lexi, the most popular girl at Bayside who is both admired and feared by her fellow students.</p>
<p><strong>‘thirtysomething’ sequel plans</strong></p>
<p>When ABC announced plans Wednesday to shoot a pilot for a potential sequel series to its award-winning “thirtysomething” (1987-91), the cast for “thirtysomething(else)” seemed a little incomplete.</p>
<p>The new pilot, from the same creators as the original (writers Marshall Herskovitz and Ed Zwick), will follow the now grown, thritysomething children of original series characters Michael Steadman (Ken Olin), Hope Murdoch (Mel Harris), Elliot Weston (Timothy Busfield) and Nancy Weston (Patricia Wettig, who grew up in Grove City).</p>
<p>But what about Ellyn Warren (Polly Draper) and Melissa Steadman (Melanie Mayron)?</p>
<p>“I think that the show focuses on the kids and it was explained to me always that it was [about] the couples,” Busfield said at an ABC party Wednesday night. “I've spoken to Polly and Melanie and I'm desperately hoping that they can join the squad after the pilot.”</p>
<p>Busfield co-stars on another upcoming ABC drama, “For Life,” and Olin is an executive producer on “This is Us” so they’ll both be doing double duty and not front-and-center in “thirtysomething(else).”</p>
<p>“Ken and I both have a reduced amount. We have reduced size orders,” Busfield said. “It's about mostly the next generation, what that generation’s about.”</p>
<p><strong>FX’s future plans</strong></p>
<p>FX Networks chairman John Landgraf said the Peak TV era continues to grow with 532 scripted comedy, drama and limited series that debuted in 2019, up 7 percent from 2018. And that’s before the launch of HBO Max, Peacock and Quibi this year, which will likely push that number higher.</p>
<p>While FX shuttered its FX Now service in 2019, it will launch FX on Hulu on March 2 with scripted original series streaming only on Hulu, including limited series “Devs” (March 5), a twisty mystery about a tech company and its murderous managers, and “Mrs. America” (April 15), about the movement to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and the backlash to the ERA led by Phyllis Schlafly (Cate Blanchett).</p>
<p>Based on the first episode, trippy “Devs” seems designed for viewers who want a TV show more weird and challenging than FX’s “Legion.”</p>
<p>“This is science fiction that is barely fiction,” said “Devs” star Alison Pill, who notes the show deals with questions of quantum physics and determinism. “It asks real questions about reality and the nature of the universe. Those are all very real scientific questions. This is speculative fiction that doesn’t lean so hard on the fiction.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. America” is grounded in the more familiar style of a period miniseries following the women’s rights movement in the 1970s through the work of Betty Friedan (Tracey Ullman), Bella Abzug (Margo Martindale) and Shirley Chisholm (Uzo Aduba).</p>
<p>“Every single one of these [real-life] women wrote a book,” said executive producer Stacey Sher. “We really wanted to make sure the piece was not skewed from any one person’s point of view. I think [series creator] Dahvi [Waller] and the writers and researchers created this highly researched and very clear-eye version of this time period.”</p>

<p>Returning FX Networks series include “Better Things” (10 p.m. March 5, FX), “Cake” (10 p.m. March 5, FXX), “What We Do in the Shadows” (10 p.m. April 15, FX), “Fargo” (10 p.m. April 19, FX) and “Archer” (10 p.m. May 6, FXX).</p>
<p>Already renewed for a 10th season to air later this year, FX renewed anthology “American Horror Story” for seasons 11, 12 and 13.</p>
<p>FX’s “Atlanta” won’t return for its third season until January 2021 with the fourth season following in late 2021.</p>
<p>FX’s “Impeachment: American Crime Story,” about the Clinton impeachment scandal and initially announced for a September premiere, may not debut until later due to producer Ryan Murphy’s busy schedule that will keep the series in production through October. A new premiere date has not been announced but it could push to after the Nov. 3 presidential election.</p>
<p><strong>Channel surfing</strong></p>
<p>DirecTV’s Audience Network will become a promotional channel for AT&amp;T’s HBO Max, launching in May, with some Audience Network series possibly making the move to HBO Max, though it’s unclear which of the shows, which include “Mr. Mercedes,” “Condor” and “Loudermilk,” might survive the transition. … Verizon announced a new “mix and match” plan for FiOS with no bundle or contract requirements, greater pricing transparency and an ability to personalize TV packages to a greater degree but it’s still not a la carte.</p>
