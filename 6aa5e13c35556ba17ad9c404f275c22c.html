<h1>Bishop Zubik calls for day of prayer for racial reconciliation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Catholic Bishop David A. Zubik is asking all people of faith in Southwestern Pennsylvania to pray and fast for racial&nbsp;reconciliation on Wednesday, the memorial day of St. Peter Claver, patron of interracial justice.</p>
<p>“In solidarity with all people who suffer from discrimination and violence due to their race, I join my brother&nbsp;bishops nationwide in asking everyone to pray and work for racial justice and reconciliation,” Bishop Zubik&nbsp;said.</p>
<p>“May God use this opportunity to inspire change, first in our own hearts and then by showing us what we can&nbsp;do as individuals, parishes and communities to build bridges of understanding and true friendship across racial&nbsp;lines,” he said in the statement</p>
<p>St. Peter Claver was a 17th-century Jesuit priest from Spain who ministered to enslaved Africans in the&nbsp;Caribbean, providing material and spiritual care.</p>
<p>Bishop Zubik also asked local Catholics to seek the intercession of another patron saint of racial justice, who&nbsp;once lived in Pittsburgh. St. Katharine Drexel, who died in 1955, was a wealthy heiress who founded a religious&nbsp;order to educate Black and Indigenous Americans and to oppose racism. She prepared for her ministry while&nbsp;living with and learning from the Sisters of Mercy in Pittsburgh, according to the release.</p>
