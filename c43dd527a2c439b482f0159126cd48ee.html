<p><em><strong>THIS STORY WILL BE UPDATED:</strong></em></p>
<p>Sunday’s Steelers-Titans game has been postponed after a mini-outbreak of COVID-19 cases with the Titans organization.</p>
<p>“​The Steelers-Titans game, originally scheduled for Sunday at 1 p.m. ET, will be rescheduled to allow additional time for further daily COVID-19 testing and to ensure the health and safety of players, coaches and game day personnel,” the NFL said in a statement released Wednesday morning. “Details on the new game date and time on either Monday or Tuesday will be announced as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Steelers are practicing Wednesday at their facility on the South Side and plan to do the same every other day this week while the Titans are barred from entering their facility until Saturday at the earliest. Any preparations the Titans do this week will be in a virtual setting until the weekend.</p>
<p>Tennessee placed three players on the reserve/COVID-19 list Tuesday afternoon. Five other Titans team personnel also are being isolated after testing positive, and there was a new positive test result Wednesday.</p>
<p>It’ an obvious competitive disadvantage for the Titans, but the Steelers and every other NFL team knew something like this might happen.</p>
<p>“We were told during training camp that this could happen if you’re not diligent and careful,” Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Wednesday morning before the postponement became official. “And I don’t know what’s going on down there so I’m not going to speak on what’s going on down there; I’m just telling you what we were told. We were told there might be a situation if you weren’t careful and there some COVID issues in Pittsburgh then we might not be able to practice until Friday or Saturday.</p>
<p>“That’s why they made the rule with more practice squad guys this year. We were made aware of those possibilities. So, I don’t want to say ‘it is what it is’. But that’s why the plan was put in place, to have guys be prepared. I know in Pittsburgh — and I’m sure in Tennessee too — guys are being diligent about not being reckless and being careful. We’re home-schooling our kids. We’re not having guests over the house. You have to do those things if you want to play the games on Sunday.”</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns center JC Tretter, the president of the players’ union, said the outbreak was a reminder that everyone must be more vigilant despite low testing numbers across the league.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to fall into a sense of ease or relax on some of the protocols,” he said Wednesday. “But the protocols are what’s keeping us going, making sure that we’re making the right decisions. … We have been going really smoothly for a long time and now there was some expectation that this was eventually going to happen. It’s tough to keep the virus completely out.”</p>
<p>Titans linebackers coach Shane Bowen tested positive Saturday and did not travel with the team to Minnesota for its game against the Vikings. Others received positive tests upon returning from Minnesota.</p>
<p>The NFL tests players every day of the week except for game days. The Vikings suspended in-person activities Tuesday and&nbsp;released a statement Tuesday saying they had not received any positive results from their testing after Sunday’s game. The Minnesota complex was set to remain closed at least through Wednesday.</p>
<p>Titans coach Mike Vrabel said soon after the announcement Wednesday: “Some of them are indeed experiencing flu-like symptoms, nothing I think out of the ordinary. We anticipate they will feel better shortly. Nothing of overly concern. But my concern is always with the health and safety of our players, our staff and their families.”</p>
<p>As for a potential Saturday return to working out, Vrabel was skeptical.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t just assume that Saturday,” he said. “We are preparing to play the football game now as early as Monday. Again, I think the focus and the understanding of this football team is now going to be shifted toward playing on Monday. I’m confident the league will allow us time ... to get some good practice in, to get on the field and move forward with the game.”</p>
<p>Steelers defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt said there is some level of concern about playing a game against a team with a COVID outbreak, but he also believes the NFL will make sure there is a safe environment if the game is played.</p>
<p>“A lot of guys have family members and loved ones they go home to after they play this beautiful game,” Tuitt said. “I think the NFL and the people who run the NFL are doing a tremendous job to make sure each player is tested. I think the NFL is going to do a good job to make sure [for] anyone that steps on the field, that the risk is low. This is something to learn from, and I’m very curious as to how this will be handled.”</p>
<p>Added Roethlisberger: “We just focus on what we can control and that’s preparing for the Tennessee Titans like today is a normal in-season Wednesday, and the rest of the week has to be like that as well.”</p>
