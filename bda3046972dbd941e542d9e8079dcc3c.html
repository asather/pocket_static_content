<h1>Will you be able to buy flowers this spring? The answer is complicated</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>To most of us, the difference between garden centers and nurseries is merely nomenclature. They’re the places we go to get Easter flowers, Mother’s Day baskets and plants each spring.</p>
<p>Once the COVID-19 pandemic hit, things became more complex. The name on the sign meant the difference between opening or remaining closed for these businesses that supply the same goods. Lawn and garden centers were deemed non-essential retail operations by the governor’s office and were shut down. Nurseries and farms were deemed essential agricultural operations and remained open. All of this was based on the classification that the businesses chose when they registered with the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s not good news for small businesses caught in the middle. North Hills customers pass Hahn’s Garden Center in Ross, which is closed, and roll down the road to Soergels’ Orchards in Franklin Park, which, according to its website, is offering curbside service, delivery and limited greenhouse hours for nursery items. Trax Farms in Finleyville, meanwhile, plans to reopen their outdoor nursery and greenhouse on Saturday. Both of the latter businesses are considered agricultural and can be legally open.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>While the classifications may seem cut and dried, there is a lot of overlap, says Gregg Robertson, who does government relations for the <a href="https://www.plna.com/" target="_blank">Pennsylvania Landscape &amp; Nursery Association</a>. Many garden centers grow plants. Some nurseries are wholesale only and sell their products to garden centers. There are also nurseries that purchase most of their plants from other growers. But only garden centers had to close unless they applied for, and received, waivers to remain open.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several weeks ago, the landscape and nursery association applied to the state for a waiver for all garden centers. Last Friday, the governor’s office rejected the request and said:</p>
<p>“This prohibition applies to independent lawn and garden centers and those attached to large retail chains. The [Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development]&nbsp;sent letters to large retail chains providing this clarification.&nbsp;This prohibition does not apply to establishments primarily engaged in retailing farm supplies, such as animal feed.</p>
<p>“Online orders and delivery of those orders are not prohibited, including for lawn and garden centers that did not apply for or were denied a waiver.&nbsp;Curbside pickup is prohibited for businesses without a waiver, as they do not qualify for in-person operations under the Governor’s Order.”</p>
<p>It’s still not clear who will enforce these regulations.</p>
<p>“It’s all being policed by the local police,” says Mr. Robertson, “So how they are interpreting it is not clear. There are just no real guidelines.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>As of Thursday, the Home Depot garden center in Ohio Township was open for business and selling landscape plants, although it would appear to fit the definition of a garden center attached to a large retail chain.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Another question that has been raised is whether a company that has a waiver because it sells essential items is allowed to sell non-essential items, too. Best Feeds Garden Centers and Tractor Supply sell animal feed, which is an essential agricultural item, and flowering plants, which are not. The state has provided no clarification.</p>
<p>Randy Stetor, operations manager at PGH Garden in Bethel Park, says his store is closed under the state guidelines. He and his wife own and run the small business that sells annuals, perennials, shrubs and vegetables along with other garden-related merchandise. According to Mr. Stetor, 75% of his business and 90% of income is generated in the months of April, May and June.&nbsp; Right now, the couple have plants sitting in greenhouses that they ordered before the pandemic.&nbsp; All of those plants will have to be paid for even if they can’t be sold, he says.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>He points out that their business is dependent on small local growers to supply them, so the hurt will be spread around to those that are allowed to open but can’t move their product.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson from the PLNA said many garden businesses are in a similar predicament.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Garden centers] are the very end of the supply chain, and when you cut that off, the wholesale greenhouses have nowhere to go.&nbsp; A lot of nurseries have already dug trees for customers.&nbsp; It’s a heartbreaking mess.... It’s like shutting the grocery stores but everything else stays open.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>And some plants will not keep. Mr. Robertson uses Easter flowers as an example.&nbsp; A business owner he recently spoke to said he had over 50,000 potted spring bulbs that would have to go in the trash. “A week after Easter they are not worth anything.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Robertson says the association has developed best management practices that will maintain social distancing.&nbsp;&nbsp;“A lot of these [businesses] are outside. You are not breathing circulated air.&nbsp; I think we could open safely.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Landscape &amp; Nursery Association has applied for an expedited waiver to allow curb service only for garden centers.&nbsp; Although that might help some businesses, it won’t help Mr. Stetor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We would not open for curbside,” he says, “I don’t know how that really works. I can’t even imagine how you bring a hanging basket out to a car.&nbsp; People have to browse plants. We carry 40 kinds of tomato plants. There are too many variables.”</p>
<p>Right now he’s holding out hope that the business can open by May 1. They are currently seeking financial help, he says, but “if we don’t open in May we will be bankrupt. After May, for us it will be all over.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
