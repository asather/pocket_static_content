<h1>Biden rips Trump during campaign stop in Pittsburgh  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Doing what they were advised to do in a presidential debate that was instead overshadowed by interruptions, cross-talk and insults, President Donald Trump and Democratic challenger Joe Biden spoke directly to voters in key electoral states Wednesday, one by rally and one by train.</p>
<p>It was Mr. Biden whose post-debate travels brought him through Western Pennsylvania, on board a nine-car Amtrak train that made multiple stops for conversations with union workers and families whom the Republican president appealed to en route to victory in 2016.</p>
<p>A few states away to the northwest, Mr. Trump attended an afternoon fundraiser in Shorewood, Minn., a suburb of Minneapolis, before appearing at an evening campaign rally in Duluth on the shores of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>As the campaign nears a crucial 30-day blitz toward the Nov. 3 election, the candidates hit the road -- and each other. Mr. Biden called Mr. Trump’s behavior in the prime-time confrontation Tuesday night “a national embarrassment.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, on Twitter, wrote, "Nobody wants Sleepy Joe as a leader, including the Radical Left (which he lost last night!)."</p>
<p>With just five weeks until Election Day and voting already underway in several key states, Mr. Biden holds a lead in national polls and in many battlegrounds. Polling has been stable for months, despite the crises that have battered the country this year, including the pandemic that has killed more than 200,000 and a reckoning over race and police.</p>
<p>Increasingly, the candidates have trained their attention on working-class voters in the Midwest, and did so on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden and wife, Jill, traveled through Ohio and Pennsylvania aboard a train bearing his campaign logo, a throwback to Mr. Biden’s days as a senator when he commuted most days via Amtrak from his family’s home in Delaware to Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Exiting the train to address a few dozen union workers at Pittsburgh's Amtrak station Downtown, Mr. Biden said Mr. Trump had charted a "trail of broken promises and lies all across the industrial Midwest."</p>
<p>"A lot of folks around here had been hurt when the steel factories closed," Mr. Biden said, "and President Trump made a lot of hay out of that four years ago. He came and said...'take a chance on me.'"</p>
<p>But since then, Mr. Trump has proven to care only about himself, Mr. Biden said, and has forgotten the "forgotten man" he had pledged to remember. It showed at Tuesday's debate, he said.</p>
<p>"He didn't speak to you all in that debate," Mr. Biden said. "He spoke about him. He didn't talk about the concerns of the American people."</p>
<p>The first of three scheduled debates between Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden deteriorated into bitter taunts and chaos as the Republican president repeatedly interrupted his Democratic rival with angry — and personal — jabs that overshadowed any substantive discussion of the crises threatening the nation.</p>
<p>"The truth is, I don't think [Mr. Trump] ever respected us in the first place," Mr. Biden said in Pittsburgh, alleging that the president "looks down his nose at working families" who pay taxes and play by the rules.</p>
<p>On his way to stops in Greensburg, New Alexandria, Latrobe and Johnstown, Mr. Biden was able to unveil an endorsement from the nation's two largest construction unions, whose presidents confirmed -- in their words -- the former vice president's commitment to "working people."</p>
<p>"The current public health and economic crisis has laid bare the deficiencies in our national infrastructure system," said the presidents of the International Union of Operating Engineers and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America. "Rebuilding our country and creating career opportunities in the building trades will take clear-eyed, bold leadership from the next President."</p>
<p>That person, they wrote, is Mr. Biden.</p>
<p>While some Republicans feared that Mr. Trump’s debate performance was too aggressive, he opened his day by attacking his opponent and debate moderator Chris Wallace on social media.</p>
<p>“Chris had a tough night,” Mr. Trump tweeted. “Two on one was not surprising, but fun.”</p>
<p>Of Mr. Biden, the president added, “He will destroy our Country!”</p>
<p>As Mr. Trump departed for Minnesota, the White House announced that he had signed an executive order to "expand the domestic mining industry, support mining jobs, alleviate unnecessary permitting delays, and reduce our Nation’s dependence on China for critical minerals."</p>
<p>"We will put our miners back to work," Mr. Trump said in a statement shared by the administration.</p>
<p>While Mr. Trump carried Ohio and Pennsylvania four years ago, he narrowly lost Minnesota, one of the few states he hopes to flip from blue to red this fall. The president’s path to success likely depends on finding more votes in rural, conservative areas and limiting his losses in the state’s urban and suburban areas.</p>
<p>It’s a strategy Mr. Trump’s campaign is trying to execute in other states and it depends on a robust field operation with the money and time to track down infrequent or first-time voters. That could be a tall order since Minnesota already has one of the nation’s highest voter turnout rates.&nbsp;</p>
