<p>PHILADELPHIA — The city of Philadelphia took a step to heal a notable scar from its past early Wednesday morning by quietly removing the statue of the former mayor Frank Rizzo, who took a confrontational approach to black and gay people as police commissioner in the 1960s and ’70s.</p>
<p>But even as the city carted away the bronze statue, long criticized as a symbol of racism and division, it still had to confront fresh anger from protesters decrying police brutality as well as a wave of looting and destruction that have evoked some of the anguish of Rizzo’s era.</p>
<p>“This is the beginning of the healing process in our city,” Mayor Jim Kenney said on Wednesday as he stood near the empty space where the statue had been. “This is not the end of the process. Taking the statue down is not the be-all and end-all of where we need to go.”</p>
<p>The statue of Rizzo, his hand aloft in a wave, had sat on the steps of a municipal services building facing City Hall since its unveiling in 1999. Rizzo, whose funeral in 1991 was presided over by two cardinals and was one of the largest in the city’s history, was loved and detested before he died of a heart attack at age 70 in the midst of his fifth campaign for mayor.</p>
<p>But most of his supporters, overwhelmingly white, have also died and his confrontational style as police commissioner and mayor is viewed as the relic of another time when he could appeal to racial resentment while trying to run for a third term as mayor, by urging supporters to “vote white.”</p>
<p>The statue of Rizzo, which was often vandalized, was scheduled to be removed in 2021, according to The Philadelphia Inquirer. In recent days, protesters rallying after the death of a black man in Minneapolis police custody tried to take it down with a rope and light it on fire.</p>
<p>Its removal was the culmination of days of sometimes destructive protests in the city. Protests that began peacefully escalated into violent clashes with the police and acts of looting and vandalism.</p>
<p>About 50 ATMs around the city were damaged or blown open by explosive devices since Saturday as thieves tried to take advantage of the chaos in the city to steal cash, the police said.</p>
<p>Protesters said they were attacked by police officers even as they demonstrated peacefully. State police used tear gas on protesters who marched on the Vine Street Expressway, stopping traffic after authorities said officers were pelted with rocks.</p>
<p>In the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia on Monday, dozens of white men patrolled the streets with baseball bats, golf clubs and even a hatchet, claiming they were protecting police officers and local businesses from protesters. But some residents said they heard the men screaming racial epithets as they assaulted people. A public radio producer was treated for a broken nose, he said, after he was attacked by four of the men.</p>
<p>Kenney said the protests showed that the statue “had to go away for us to understand where we need to go to look forward.”</p>
<p>“If there’s someone who wants it, wants to take it somewhere else, we’ll talk,” Kenney said. “We needed to get it to a place where it was out of people’s sight.”</p>
<p>For many black residents of Philadelphia, the removal was long overdue.</p>
<p>“A lot of people look at the statue and see that he’s saying hello, but to me it’s more like ‘Heil Hitler,’” said Frantz Douion, 44, who walked by the municipal building shortly after Kenney made his remarks.</p>
<p>“The type of mayor he was, it doesn’t make sense that the city would even have a statue of him up there unless they are trying to rub it in people’s faces,” said Douion, a home health care worker. “He was not a good mayor. He split the people apart.”</p>
<p>Rizzo’s son, Frank Rizzo Jr., a former city councilman, said he learned the statute was coming down around 2 a.m. Wednesday, when police officers began texting him the news.</p>
<p>“I’m very disappointed about how it was handled,” said Rizzo, 77, who worked with Kenney in the early 1990s when they were both councilmen. Rizzo said he had not heard from the mayor about the decision.</p>
<p>Rizzo said his father was often misunderstood by critics who failed to give him credit for protecting black-owned businesses as police commissioner or for hiring black officers for his security detail when he was mayor.</p>
<p>“There are people who love him. There are people who dislike him,” he said. “He loved Philadelphia as much as he loved his family.”</p>
<p>Frank Rizzo became the police commissioner in 1967 and served two terms as mayor, from 1972 to 1980. As police commissioner, he rounded up gay people late at night and forced members of the Black Panthers to strip down in the streets.</p>
<p>He was celebrated by some as a law-and-order leader who cracked down on crime. But his tactics, to many, bordered on the dictatorial, intended to suppress opposition and keep black people out of middle-class neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Verbose and imposing — he stood about 6 foot 2 and 250 pounds — he both courted media coverage and attacked the press, especially as it documented police abuses. He was once filmed threatening to beat up a reporter and his camera crew, after they tried to interview him while he was walking his dog.</p>
<p>“I want to fight you,” Rizzo said. “Because you’re a crumb, creep, lush, coward.”</p>
<p>In 1978, after members of MOVE, a group of radical black separatists who lived in West Philadelphia, refused to heed an eviction order from a rowhouse, the police descended on the property. Rizzo vowed he would “show them more firepower than they’ve ever seen.”</p>
<p>Firefighters aimed hoses at the house and flooded it in an attempt to remove the residents inside. Television cameras filmed naked children trying to crawl out of the house.</p>
<p>During the confrontation, an officer was shot and killed. (In 1985, seven years after the raid, the police bombed MOVE’s headquarters, killing six adults and five children.)</p>
<p>In 1979, the Justice Department filed a civil complaint against the city, Rizzo and other city and police officials, which accused them of police abuse that “shocks the conscience.”</p>
<p>For years, Rizzo was viewed as a fighter for working-class Philadelphians, especially in South Philadelphia, where he was raised and where a mural of him on a three-story building looms over the Italian Market on 9th Street.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the mural was marred by splashes of cream-colored paint. Mural Arts Philadelphia — the nation’s largest public art program — said on Twitter on Wednesday that it would not longer be involved with the mural.</p>
<p>Andrew Bonazelli, who lives in the Italian Market, said there are still people who remember Rizzo as a hero of Italian-Americans, even as South Philadelphia has changed and immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam have settled in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>The mural should be removed like the statue was, said Bonazelli, 43, an editor whose wife is Vietnamese.</p>
<p>“It shouldn’t have taken the events of the last couple of days to have it not be here,” he said.</p>
<p>But John Szymanski, 66, a realtor who has lived in the Fishtown section all his life, said he didn’t believe Rizzo was a racist or that the statue should have been removed.</p>
<p>“I was a kid when he was the police commissioner,” he said. “The city was pretty good; we didn’t have all this rioting and stuff. These people go crazy with all this looting and rioting. Once you start taking things down, you are giving in to them.”</p>
<p>Rizzo ran for mayor again in 1983 and tried to temper his abrasive style, casting himself as the “new Rizzo.” The effort failed, and he lost in the Democratic primary to Wilson Goode, who became the first black mayor of Philadelphia. In 1987, Rizzo ran as a Republican but lost once more to Goode. Rizzo then died during his 1991 campaign.</p>
<p>The statue was commissioned by a committee of friends and relatives of Rizzo who selected Zenos Frudakis, then an artist in his early 40s, to create it. Frudakis said the statue was based on a picture of Rizzo walking down Benjamin Franklin Parkway and waving during a St. Patrick’s Parade.</p>
<p>It was unveiled in January 1999 by Mayor Edward Rendell.</p>
<p>Frudakis, 68, said he was relieved on Wednesday when he learned it came down.</p>
<p>“It was creating pain and distress for people,” he said. “I can understand why people don’t want to look at it anymore.”</p>
