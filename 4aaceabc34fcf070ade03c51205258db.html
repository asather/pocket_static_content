<h1>Moon's Adam Kaufman, one of the WPIAL's top basketball coaches, resigns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Adam Kaufman has for years been considered one of the top basketball coaches in the WPIAL, but if Kaufman coaches this upcoming season, it won’t be at the high school level.</p>
<p>It will be with his daughter’s third-grade team.</p>
<p>Kaufman, who guided teams to two WPIAL titles and a PIAA title in 14 seasons, has resigned as coach at Moon a year after leading the Tigers to a state championship.</p>
<p>For Kaufman, 40, this move was all about family. He and his wife, Katie, have four children between the ages of five (twins) and nine. Kaufman has seen his family a lot over the past few months, and said he wants it to remain that way.</p>
<p>“Just through the whole pandemic, I’ve really enjoyed time with my kids and really enjoyed time with my wife,” he said. “Our four children, at their age, sports are becoming a little more serious. I just want to be a dad. That’s the most important thing I will ever do, and I want to commit more of my time to that.”</p>
<p>Kaufman made the most of his time coaching, compiling a 226-135 record during stops at Bishop Canevin, Montour and Moon. He guided Montour to two WPIAL titles before taking the Moon job in 2014.</p>
<p>In six seasons at Moon, he went 83-62. The 2019 team won the PIAA Class 5A title when it defeated Philadelphia Catholic League power Archbishop Wood in the final. Kaufman was named the state Class 5A coach of the of the year and Post-Gazette coach of the year. The Tigers went 6-16 last season.</p>
<p>“The people at Moon were great. They were all understanding and supportive, and that was one of the reasons that made it hard to resign,” said Kaufman, who teaches algebra and geometry at Moon High School.</p>
<p>Kaufman is one of only three coaches in modern history (since 1970) to guide two different WPIAL boys teams to PIAA title games. He also took Montour to the final in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>Kaufman also experienced a lot of success as a player. He was a standout point guard at Montour and Edinboro University. He is in the Edinboro Athletics Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>As a coach, Kaufman was known for having great defensive teams. By not coaching, he said he’s guarding against something different — regrets.</p>
<p>“I know in 10 years when I look back, I won’t regret that I quit coaching,” Kaufman said, “but I would 100% regret not spending time with my family.”</p>
