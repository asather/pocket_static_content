<h1>Joe Starkey: Keeping fans away from arenas is right call in face of pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the afternoon wore on, delivering one haymaker headline after another, it soon became clear: March 11, 2020, would go down as one of the most significant and stunning days in the history of American sports.</p>
<p>First, the World Health Organization, which had been reluctant to do so, officially declared COVID-19 a pandemic, with over 100 countries reporting cases.</p>
<p>Next, NCAA president Mark Emmert released a statement saying the men’s and women’s Division I basketball tournaments would be played in near-empty arenas, with only “essential” personnel and some family on-hand.</p>
<p>I never thought I’d say this, but Emmert was a leading voice of reason here. It was nothing short of stunning to see the NCAA putting human welfare over gross revenue, and it might yet cancel the tournaments altogether.</p>
<p>Which brings us to something else I didn’t think I’d say: The NCAA story was just a prelude to the biggest news of the day. At approximately 9:30 p.m., the NBA announced it would suspend its season in the wake of Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert testing positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>That, quite obviously, changes everything.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, around the time of the NCAA bombshell, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine turned a recommendation into an order: mass gatherings would be prohibited in his state. That meant no fans for Thursday’s game between the Penguins and Columbus Blue Jackets at Nationwide Arena.</p>
<p>Now, it’s the NHL’s move. The league released a statement shortly after 10 p.m. that read as such: “The National Hockey League is aware of the NBA’s decision tonight to indefinitely suspend its season due to a player testing positive for the coronavirus. The NHL is continuing to consult with medical experts and is evaluating the options. We expect to have a further update tomorrow.”</p>
<p>For many, all of this is a wild overreaction, a concession to fear and paranoia.</p>
<p><em>It won’t last.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s no worse than the average flu.</em></p>
<p>Let’s hope so, right? I’d love to believe it, except I see the numbers coming out of other countries — Italy, for example — and they are at the very least highly concerning.</p>
<p>Two weeks ago, Italy had 322 confirmed cases of COVID-19. One week ago, 2,502. By Wednesday, 10,149, and the country was in total lockdown. Even the restaurants were closed.</p>
<p>In the United States, as of early Wednesday evening, the number of positive COVID-19 cases had increased to 1,190, in 41 states and Washington, D.C., according to the New York Times. Now go back and track Italy’s upsurge.</p>
<p>Chico Harlan, a former Post-Gazette sports writer, is the Rome bureau chief for the Washington Post. He tweeted Wednesday that “in a matter of three days, the coronavirus death toll in Italy has gone from 366 to 827.”</p>
<p>Seems to me those are just pertinent facts, not alarmist “fake news” warnings.</p>
<p>Harlan also tweeted: “This is the problem many countries will face with coronavirus: the disease spreads under the radar, and the restrictive measures seem worthwhile to a society only AFTER the explosion has been set in motion.”</p>
<p>So what’s wrong with trying to be aggressively proactive here? What is wrong with erring on the side of extreme caution? That it might interfere with our precious games? That it might interfere with teams’ precious profits?</p>
<p>Pardon the intrusion to your sports-addled haze — I know this is terribly inconvenient and might even affect your fantasy lineup — but there’s a pandemic happening, and all we really know is that it’s growing and there is no current vaccine.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean we’re all doomed. But I’m gonna go ahead and believe the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and what he told a congressional committee Wednesday.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci said he would advise the NBA, as an example, to ban fans from games in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We would recommend that there not be large crowds,” Fauci said. “As a public health official, anything that has crowds is something that would give a risk to spread.”</p>
<p>Importantly, Fauci also said COVID-19’s death rate is 1 percent, or 10 times “more lethal” than seasonal flu, and his estimate was lower than the WHO’s estimate of of 3.4%.</p>
<p>“I can say we will see more cases,” Fucci said, “and things will get worse than they are right now.”</p>
<p>Again, none of that strikes me as hysterical. It strikes me as sensible, and every professional sports team currently in session, including the Penguins, should get on board — not that banning fans will suddenly resolve a burgeoning health crisis.</p>
<p>As of early Wednesday evening, the Penguins intended to allow fans into games. Their statement: “The Penguins have been in regular contact with the NHL, the city, county, and health authorities and have determined that, based upon the facts before us, home games, including Sunday’s game against NYI, will go on as scheduled in front of fans.”</p>
<p>Extra precautions will be taken, such as regular cleanings of the escalator handrails, and I suppose that is laudable.</p>
<p>But I’m also guessing that by Sunday, the Penguins won’t have a choice. If the NHL lets the games go on — and hopes no player tests positive — it has to empty the arenas.</p>
<p>It has to.</p>
