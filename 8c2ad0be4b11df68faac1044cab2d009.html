<h1>How a park bloomed Downtown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s a magical moment when a drab building that dominated a city block disappears and is replaced by a large lush park filled with flowering trees, ornamental grasses, winding paths and whimsical artwork.</p>
<p>“Nobody’s going to take down a building and put in a park. That doesn’t usually happen,” said Rachelle Wolf, a landscape architect who drew many sketches of Firstside Park, a Downtown oasis that opened to the public in 2007.</p>
<p>Created by PNC Bank, the 1.5-acre park features bronze sculptures of a seated rabbit, two frogs and two monkeys, all created by Albert Guibara, a California sculptor. The largest artwork is a steel sculpture called&nbsp;“Up and Away” by Clement Meadmore, an Australian American artist who died in 2005.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you cannot envision the building that once occupied this land, that’s because it was the rather forgettable Public Safety Building, a bland seven-story box with a parking lot. Formerly home to offices for city firefighters, police, detectives and magistrates, it occupied the block bounded by Grant Street, the Boulevard of the Allies, First Avenue and Ross Street.</p>
<p>Originally, the three-story building housed the Sun-Telegraph newspaper and, later, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In 1960, the City of Pittsburgh bought it for $650,000 and added several stories. In 2004, PNC Bank paid $4.2 million for the building and deconstructed it, recycling 2,500 tons of concrete for use in the park.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Susan Golomb, a project manager with PNC Bank, worked closely with two landscape architects, Steven Gillespie and Ms. Wolf, both then employed with Astorino, a local architectural firm.</p>
<p>“The park had already been designed. I had to look at the budget for the park ... and figure out how we could maintain the integrity of the design within a budget,’’ Ms. Golomb said.&nbsp;“We didn’t cut a lot of the plants out of the budget. That was so important.”</p>
<p>The park’s main diagonal path was designed to connect with the Eliza Furnace Trail that parallels First Avenue and riders leaving the First Avenue T Station.</p>
<p>“They could walk through that park to reach their offices in town,” Ms. Golomb said.&nbsp;“The park, especially at the beginning, was most beautiful when seen from above. If you were in a high-rise building and could look down on it, the swirling patterns were much more visible.”</p>
<p>The roughly 100 trees have matured during the past 13 years, making this particular patch of green a good place to eat your lunch outdoors.</p>
<p>“Up and Away,” the Clement Meadmore sculpture, arrived in Pittsburgh in 1977 during a Three Rivers Arts Festival event called Sculpturescape. First, it animated Commonwealth Plaza, opposite the former state office building on Commonwealth Way. Later, it moved to PNC Plaza at Fifth Avenue and Wood Street. Once the bank drew up plans to install a green wall at that Downtown branch, the decision to move “Up and Away” was made.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Clement Meadmore installed “Up and Away,” Ms. Golomb photographed him at work.&nbsp;Decades later, she recalled,&nbsp;“I was very instrumental in getting it moved to Firstside.&nbsp;It was black, and it was not in very good shape. It needed to be restored.</p>
<p>“I think putting it in the park saved it. That place was chosen because it had a lot of public viewing. It had high visibility. It’s a&nbsp;nice kind of flowing form. They could have scrapped it.”</p>
<p>But perhaps the true test of public green space is whether people use it.</p>
<p>“There are people sitting there all the time,” Ms. Wolf said.</p>
