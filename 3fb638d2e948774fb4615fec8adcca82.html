<h1>An unwanted Etna lot to become a vibrant green space for residents </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>What was once a damaged piece of property that no one wanted in Etna is soon to become a vibrant center for residents to enjoy while the important job of stormwater management takes place under their feet.</p>
<p>Etna Community Organization has begun a few projects suggested by residents and is working closely with the borough to create a new park in Etna. Everybody’s in on the design and amenities, which will include a fountain and other creative touches that will make stormwater management beautiful.</p>
<p>The four-unit apartment building that stood at 37 Grant St. was abandoned after Hurricane Ivan flooded much of Etna on Sept. 17, 2004. &nbsp; Severely damaged, it sat vacant for more than a decade while the borough’s applications to the owner for demolition of the deteriorating structure were ignored. </p>
<p>“We were concerned about the safety of the property, and in our application for demolition we stated that we would attempt to acquire ownership after demolition for the purpose of open green space due to the property’s location in the floodplain,” said Mary Ellen Ramage, borough manager and secretary.</p>
<p>“We received $28,000 in Allegheny County Community Development Block Grant funding for the demolition in 2018. After the property was demolished, we made application to the Vacant Property Recovery Program to take ownership with the promise that it would be green open space as it was in a floodplain for our community, especially given this area in our community had very little open green space.”</p>
<p>That application was submitted in late 2018 and Etna became the official owners in the fall of 2019. The borough invested approximately $2,200 to acquire the property.</p>
<p>AVPRP acquires blighted, tax delinquent properties and resells them to applicants for a reuse outlined in their application and approved by council.</p>
<p>“This is your park and we want you to have a say in what goes on here,” said Alex Boytim, ECO director. While the borough will install a rain garden to collect and disperse rain water, she said, “The park will have the dual purpose of function, education and beauty.”</p>
<p>Ms. Boytim reminded participants to remember the six quality-of-life issues developed in 2018 as many of the same people participated with community leaders on evolveEA, a project to develop a shared understanding of relevant social, economic and environmental issues. The yearlong series of workshops resulted in key areas of focus for strategic action: air, energy, equity, food, mobility and water. </p>
<p>How can the quality of life issues become part of the park, Ms. Boytim asked. What do you want to see in the space and how do you want to spend time there? “This will help inform the future design,” she said.</p>
<p>Residents young and old, new and established responded with a variety of ways to incorporate mobility assets such as bike racks and a covered bus stop to make the park accessible to all. Solar-powered lighting was suggested as a way to save energy and fruit-bearing plants such as mulberry trees and raspberry bushes would meet the community’s goal of food security. Meanwhile, water will be the priority because the main use of the property will be something unseen — stormwater management.</p>
<p>While Brian Golgan, owner of Pondering, A Water Garden Shop at 21 Grant Ave., donated a decorative fountain to the park, grants from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation will pay for an artist to decorate the park. But the elbow grease used to construct the park and install the fountain will be courtesy of Etna residents. Artistic assistance will also be provided by Shaler Area School District students.</p>
<p>Don Newman, Etna borough engineer, spoke about the slope of the land as participants grabbed markers, pencils and paper to create what they’d like to see in their park. He said the area of the property that collects the most stormwater must have only green infrastructure in that spot.</p>
<p>Etna Mayor Tom Rengers spoke about how the site will have drainage swales diverting rain to an overflow catch basin. The park, he said, will serve as a water harvesting area, where rain will be collected underground for later use, perhaps to keep the Gardens of Etna moist this spring and summer. Established in 2011, the Etna Community Garden is an allotment garden where residents can rent or adopt individual beds to grow crops. Workdays, organized events and social outings are set by project partners the borough and Glenshaw Presbyterian Church.</p>
<p>Mr. Newman told residents working at the paper maps that sand, compost and topsoil will help with drainage, as will a permanent retaining wall. A wooden railing will protect plants, and a quarter of the site will be for stormwater management. </p>
<p>“Most of Etna’s lots are small,” he said. “It will be challenging to find space to do everything people would like to do.” </p>
