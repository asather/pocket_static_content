<h1>USAA sues PNC Bank, accusing it of illegally using remote deposit technology</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Bank is being sued by USAA — a group of insurance and financial services companies based in San Antonio — which alleges the Pittsburgh-based bank is illegally using USAA’s patented technologies for remote check deposit.</p>
<p>The technology allows customers to deposit checks using their smartphones.</p>
<p>“We have spent significant time and resources transforming our technology from an idea on a whiteboard to the service our members enjoy today and led to a revolution in consumer banking,” Nathan McKinley, USAA vice president of corporate development, said in an email Friday. “Our goal has always been to be reasonably compensated for the benefits that others in the industry have received” from using the technology, he said.</p>
<p>PNC spokeswoman Marcey Zwiebel said the bank was aware of the lawsuit but declined comment.</p>
<p>According to the complaint — filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Marshall, Texas — USAA developed the system, launched in 2009, to help its military customers bank while out to sea or deployed outside the U.S.</p>
<p>USAA previously won $300 million from Wells Fargo in a similar claim.</p>
<p>The patent infringement suit against PNC seeks unspecified damages and costs.</p>
