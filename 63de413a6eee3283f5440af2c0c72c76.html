<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn Stateâ€™s Blue-White spring scrimmage will be broadcast to a national audience in 2020. The school announced Friday afternoon that Fox Sports 1 will carry the game, slated for Saturday, April 18 at 1:30 p.m. It will also be streamed on the Fox Sports app.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Admission is free for all fans. Parking is free as well for 2019 season ticket and parking permit holders, though they must display a white pass that was mailed to them last summer. Those who did not have season tickets or parking permits for last season will be charged $20 for a spot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Penn State said an estimated 61,000 fans turned out for the event last season, and the game has drawn 51,000-plus for nine of the past 11 years.&nbsp;</p>
