<h1>Colson Whitehead wins second fiction Pulitzer, making history</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Colson Whitehead took the Pulitzer Prize in fiction Monday for his novel "The Nickel Boys," published by Doubleday.</p>
<p>The Pulitzer committee lauded "The Nickel Boys" as "a spare and devastating exploration of abuse at a reform school in Jim Crow-era Florida that is ultimately a powerful tale of human perseverance, dignity and redemption." Whitehead's second Pulitzer win marks the first double victory for an author of back-to-back novels.</p>
<p>"It's pretty nuts!" Whitehead said by email. "I'm very honored and I hope that it raises awareness of the real life model for the novel — The Dozier School for Boys — so that the victims and their stories are not forgotten."</p>
<p>In addition to the Pulitzer, "The Nickel Boys" won the Kirkus Prize for fiction and was a New York Times bestseller. It was also a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and was longlisted for a National Book Award and the Carnegie Medal.</p>
<p>Whitehead, who lives in New York City and has written seven wide-ranging novels, won his first fiction Pulitzer in 2017 for his novel "The Underground Railroad," which is currently being adapted for television by Barry Jenkins.</p>
