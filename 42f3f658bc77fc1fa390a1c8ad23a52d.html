<h1>'We’re dealing with the unknown': Steelers' Cam Heyward on contract situation and football's return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward would love to already have in place a contract extension that, when it can be negotiated, will make him one of the top-paid defensive linemen in the NFL. But that is going to have to wait.</p>
<p>Like just about anything with the league — training camps, preseason games, the start of the regular season — everything is on hold because of the COVID-19 pandemic. And, until Heyward and the teammates he represents as their defensive captain and player rep gain more clarity about health and safety, he is willing to be patient about contracts and playing football.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ top contractual priority in the offseason was to extend Heyward’s deal, which expires after the 2020 season. But, because of the uncertainty surrounding so many elements of the league and the ramifications it will likely have on the salary cap in 2021, the Steelers have decided to wait to begin any discussion of an extension for their two-time All-Pro defensive end.</p>
<p>“I would love it to get done, but obviously it hasn’t and there’s not really much more I can do about it,” Heyward said on a Zoom call with Pittsburgh-area media Thursday. “With everything going on, I have to be patient. Things have to happen and they should, but I’ll be ready either way. If I have to go into this year knowing that this might be my last year [with the Steelers], so be it.”</p>
<p>That was not any type of threat by Heyward, 31, who will enter his 10th season with the Steelers. Nor is there any doubt what the Steelers will do once the financial implications of an altered and potentially truncated season are better understood.</p>
<p>But, what looked as though it would be a mere formality sometime after the NFL combine in February has turned into a waiting game under which both sides really have no control.</p>
<p>“Early on, it was just wait and see what happens,’ Heyward said. “But everything has been halted with the virus. It definitely halted regular NFL operations. We understand that. We understand this is uncharted territory. If football is going to pick up, we have to be ready either way.”</p>
<p>But there are still many questions that need to be answered before the players proceed.</p>
<p>Heyward, who has asthma, said he knows the risks of playing during the COVID-19 pandemic and understands the potential risks of contracting the virus, especially in a contact sport. But he said he and his teammates need more clarity on the health ramifications before a season should commence.</p>
<p>“We’re dealing with the unknown,” Heyward said. “We like to be calculated and have all the facts before we commit to something. With everything changing, we really can’t grasp what’s going on. We know the NFL and the NFLPA have to come to an agreement.</p>
<p>“But, my main thing is, I want my guys to have all the information first. I don’t want to be in a situation where we agree to something when a lot of guys are still up in the air about it.”</p>
<p>Heyward said he has been told that some type of decision of how the league will proceed is expected by July 5. He said it will be difficult for the league to operate under some type of “bubble,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/18/Dr-Anthony-Fauci-football-may-not-happen-second-COVID-19-wave/stories/202006180157" target="_blank">as suggested by</a> health expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, because of the size of an NFL roster and coaching staff.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of moving parts that have to go along with this,” Heyward said. “It can’t be rushed. I know the NFL and NFLPA have been working on this for a while, but there’s so many different parts that have to be cleared before me and my fellow teammates can go play.</p>
<p>“I know we have a lot of teammates that want to play. We’re going to have to make a lot of decisions for ourselves and we have to make sure we have all the questions answered.”</p>
