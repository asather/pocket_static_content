<h1>Complaints about Allegheny County bars, restaurants flouting face-mask rules skyrocket</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department was fielding hundreds of complaints about restaurants and bars not enforcing face masks and other pandemic rules just before the county shut down indoor dining again last week because of a record number of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>According to county health department data, there were 419 virus-related complaints involving restaurants and bars the week of June 29.</p>
<p>That compares with 116 complaints received during the first 20 days of the green phase of the state’s reopening plan from June 5-25. Most of those complaints were related to masks.</p>

<p>On June 30, restaurants and bars were ordered to stop serving alcohol indefinitely as county officials grappled with how to contain the spread of the highly infectious virus. As cases continued to soar, indoor dining was cut off July 3 for one week.</p>
<p>The shutdown is set to end Friday. Officials haven’t said if they will extend the order, but cases of COVID-19 have continued to surge.</p>
<p>At a news briefing Tuesday, county officials said they have been working on “modifications” to the closure order and alcohol ban, which they expect to announce Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Health department director Dr. Debra Bogen said the recent spike in complaints was probably due to a recent request by the department for customers to report what they were seeing, as well as a growing concern about the big jump in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>“As we reported more cases, concern increased among the public and made them more likely to report their concerns,” she said during the briefing. “It is helpful for the department to understand what is happening in the community, and we appreciate those reports.”</p>
<p>Dining rooms in southwestern Pennsylvania had only been open for a month after leaving the yellow phase when Allegheny County moved to halt business again on the eve of the July 4 holiday.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, restaurant and bar operators were not happy. Business owners who said they were following all of the rules complained about being penalized unfairly. Others took to the streets to protest.</p>
<p>Just before closing down restaurants and bars again last week, the county had toughened up face mask requirements, ordering that masks be worn by customers even when seated at their tables, only to be removed when eating or drinking.</p>
<p>At the time, officials said businesses caught violating mask rules, social distancing restrictions or capacity limitations would be ordered to close for a minimum of one week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, several state legislators joined Gov. Tom Wolf in emphasizing the importance of wearing a mask while in public to help curtail the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“As we increasingly resume public activities in our commonwealth, we need to remain vigilant about taking precautions, especially wearing a mask that covers our noses and mouths while around other people,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “This is an easy yet important action that has been shown by research to reduce the spread of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen said it was unlikely that Allegheny County would move into the yellow or red phase again to curb the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to be strategic” with mitigation steps, she said during Tuesday’s briefing. “I don’t think it’s effective to shut down [entirely]. We’ll take it one step at a time.”</p>
<p>In response to a question from a reporter, Dr. Bogen said the health department would consider posting the names of bars and restaurants on the county’s website when they are cited for violating rules on masks, social distancing or other COVID-19-related protocols.</p>
<p>“I think that’s a good idea,” she said. “We will look into it.”</p>
