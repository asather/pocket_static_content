<p>NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — During a raucous rally here Friday on the eve of the state’s Democratic primary, President Donald Trump brushed off the nation’s rising concerns about the coronavirus, declaring that “confidence is surging” in the economy, despite the stock market having just suffered its worst week of losses since 2008.</p>
<p>He accused Democrats of “politicizing” the growing public health crisis — but even as he outlined his administration’s response, including the creation this week of a coronavirus task force led by Vice President Mike Pence, Mr. Trump suggested that the crisis over the pandemic is just the latest attempt by Democrats, frustrated that he’s withstood the special counsel probe and impeachment, to take him down.</p>
<p>“This is their new hoax,” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>Accusing the news media of being “in hysteria mode,” Mr. Trump boasted that his decision last month to quarantine people returning from China has kept the virus from spreading in the U.S. Mr. Trump said 15 cases had been reported in the nation so far, but Johns Hopkins University is reporting 62 such cases. That number is expected to rise.</p>
<p>“So far we have lost nobody to coronavirus in the United States,” he said. “We are totally prepared.”</p>
<p>The rally, which came on the eve of Saturday’s Democratic primary contest in South Carolina, was the latest effort by the president’s campaign to assert his own presence — and counternarrative — in an early state nominating contest.</p>
<p>With the state Republican Party canceling its 2020 primary, largely out of deference to Mr. Trump, the president sought to flex his muscle, asking his supporters to vote in Saturday’s Democratic contest and polling the crowd on whether Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders or former Vice President Joe Biden, the two leading candidates in the statewide polls, would be easier to run against.</p>
<p>“Bunch of losers,” Mr. Trump said, deriding former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg for what he said was “the worst debate performance in history” and Mr. Biden for his verbal stumbles.</p>
<p>“Can you imagine if I made just a small fraction of the mistakes he makes?” Mr. Trump said.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden appears to be in line for his first major primary victory as a presidential candidate, with a Monmouth University poll Thursday showing him sitting high atop the field with 36% of the vote. Another recent poll by The Charleston Post and Courier, however, showed a closer race with Mr. Biden at 28%, just four points ahead of Mr. Sanders.</p>
<p>During his final South Carolina campaign event Friday, Mr. Sanders told voters in Columbia that Mr. Trump’s decision to hold a rally in the state on the eve of the primary, especially considering rising concerns about the coronavirus pandemic, was “pathetic.”</p>
<p>“We might think that in the midst of a major health care crisis the president of the United States would be assembling doctors and scientists and researchers,” Mr. Sanders said. “Not Donald Trump. He is here in South Carolina. For one reason: to disrupt the Democratic Party.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bloomberg, campaigning in Memphis, Tenn., on Friday, also blasted Mr. Trump’s response to the crisis, blaming him for the week’s massive sell-off on Wall Street, the market’s worst week since 2008.</p>
<p>“The stock market has plunged partly out of fear, but also because investors have no confidence that the president is capable of managing the crisis,” Mr. Bloomberg said.</p>
