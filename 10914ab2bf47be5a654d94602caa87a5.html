<h1>Penguins mailbag: Should Pittsburgh be afraid of Carey Price?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.&nbsp;</em><em>It’s been a newsy week in the NHL. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/22/Penguins-vote-yes-to-24-team-playoff-format/stories/202005220143" target="_blank">NHL Players Association approved a 24-team playoff format</a>. On Sunday, the league sent out a memo <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/25/nhl-phase-2-guidelines-return-to-play-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/202005250064" target="_blank">detailing protocol in Phase Two</a>. And on Tuesday, commissioner <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/26/NHL-adopts-24-team-playoff-format-if-it-can-resume-season/stories/202005260106" target="_blank">Gary Bettman formally announced the playoff plan</a>,&nbsp;provided some information on the draft lottery and said Pittsburgh remains in contention to host playoff games along with nine other possible&nbsp;“hub cities.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>A lot to talk about. Let’s jump right in.</em></p>
<p><strong>Abby:</strong> If the NHL doesn’t like the idea of the hub city team playing at “home,” where do the Pens play, or any hub city team for that matter?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;Personally, I don’t understand the issue with a team playing in its home arena. The fans are really what makes home-ice advantage. If the seats are going to be empty, does it really matter if the Penguins are playing at PPG Paints Arena, Las Vegas or a pond in Nova Scotia?</p>
<p>Gary Bettman said Tuesday that he recognizes there could be “perceived” advantages and will take that into consideration when assigning teams to hub cities. How will this work? Bettman noted that the hub cities aren’t necessarily tied to East and West. So even though Las Vegas plays in the West, for example, T-Mobile Arena could host the East to alleviate these concerns. That’s just one solution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also sounds like the league hasn’t completely ruled out the idea of a team playing at home yet, either. The commissioner noted that if a team plays in its own city, players will have to stay in hotels and be subject to the same conditions as out-of-town players to keep everything on a level playing field.</p>
<p>More information is supposed to be announced in about three to four weeks. We’ll see then how much they care about perceived advantages. In the meantime, Matt Vensel did a nice job of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/27/nhl-hub-city-pittsburgh-penguins-covid-19-allegheny-county/stories/202005270116" target="_blank">breaking down the Penguins pitch</a>&nbsp;for Pittsburgh.</p>
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> How does the recent injury new impact the Penguins? What do you anticipate the lineup will be with Simon and Bjugstad out?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> To catch everyone up, Dominik Simon <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/14/dominik-simon-shoulder-surgery-injury-penguins/stories/202005140128" target="_blank">had labrum surgery</a> on his left shoulder and is expected to miss about six or seven months. Nick Bjugstad, who has been hit by one injury after another this year, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/05/27/Nick-Bjugstad-will-not-return-to-Penguins-this-season/stories/202005270088" target="_blank">had spinal surgery</a> on a herniated disk this week. He’s been ruled out for the postseason by general manager Jim Rutherford.</p>
<p>Losing two able bodies for the postseason isn’t great, especially after the way the injuries have ravaged the Penguins roster. But even before the surgeries, there were questions about how these two players fit in a possible playoff roster.</p>
<p>Simon is an interesting case. The coaching staff seems to like the way his puck possession skills and ability to navigate in tight spaces meshes with Sidney Crosby. But when Conor Sheary was acquired, he immediately supplanted Simon on Crosby’s right wing. if Simon isn’t on the top line, is it possible he’s in the press box? He would have at least been a candidate if healthy.</p>
<p>With Bjugstad, there were even more questions. Is he a winger? Is he a center? Top six? Bottom six? I had him penciled in on the third line or else the press box. Turns out it’s going to be the latter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While we’re talking about the roster, here’s my guess of how the Penguins will line up. Keep it handy so you can laugh at me when I’m wrong:</p>
<p>Guentzel – Crosby – Sheary</p>
<p>Zucker – Malkin – Rust</p>
<p>Marleau – McCann – Hornqvist</p>
<p>Aston-Reese – Blueger – Tanev</p>
<p>The two biggest questions I have are: Does Jason Zucker stay on that top line somehow, maybe on Crosby’s right wing? Can Evan Rodrigues crack the lineup somewhere, possibly on the third or fourth line?</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl:</strong> Why are we afraid of Carey Price? I know that he’s been a great goalie historically and that players still think he is, but his last three seasons have been decidedly ... meh. When you get down to it, any goalie can get hot and steal a series, even Murray or Jarry, right?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> In my mind, the Carey Price debate is a matter of reputation vs. reality.</p>
<p>Clearly, Price has everyone’s respect around the league. He won a gold medal with fellow Canadians Crosby and Patrick Marleau at the 2014 Sochi Olympics. He’s the highest-paid goalie in the league with a salary that carries a $10.5 million average annual value. And for the second straight year, NHL players selected Price at the league’s top goalie in the annual player’s poll.</p>
<p>But if you look at his stats, you’re right, Sheryl, it’s a different story entirely. Over the last three seasons, Price has posted a save percentage of .910 that ranks 26th among qualifying goalies. This season, Price posted a save percentage above .900 in just 56.9% of his starts. That was 35th among qualifying goalies.</p>
<p>In a three-game series, I would be more concerned with Price stealing a series. In five games, that’s still a risk but obviously less so. We’ll have to wait and see how it actually unfolds.</p>
<p><strong>John A.:</strong> I know I’m looking ahead, but if the Penguins beat Montreal, which teams should I want them to play in the next round?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Tampa Bay. The Lightning was one of two teams to vote against the 24-team proposal. Listen to what player rep, Alex Killorn, told The Athletic.</p>
<p>“My team also felt it was unfair that the teams with a bye would not be as well prepared for a playoff series as the teams that have already basically played a playoff series to get into the playoffs,” Killorn wrote in a text.</p>
<p>I love this quote for a couple reasons. Even though there’s a chance the Penguins might get&nbsp;bounced before they get to a seven-game series, the Lightning is basically arguing that there are advantages to using the so-called “qualifying” round to knock off some of the rust. I actually agree here. After sitting on the couch watching&nbsp;“Tiger King” for 12 weeks, it might actually help the Penguins to warm up against the Canadiens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, these comments make Tampa Bay sound like exactly the kind of team the Penguins want to play. Last year, the Lightning was embarrassed in the playoffs when it was swept in the first round. Sounds like they’re already in their own heads about losing in the first round this year.</p>
<p><strong>Frank:</strong> Jake Guentzel update?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Here’s your semi-weekly Jake Guentzel update: July 1 marks six months since surgery. That’s the more conservative estimate on the initial four-to-six month recovery window. And it sounds teams won’t be in hub cities until late July or August at the absolute earliest. It seems like everything is lining up nicely for Guentzel to be back.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Paul G:</strong> When do you actually expect this 24-team tournament to start?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Bettman said “anyone who is giving you a date is guessing.” So the last thing we’d want to do is guess. Instead, why don’t we, um, make an informed prediction.</p>
<p>The NHL said it will not move into Phase Three (formal training camp) until July 1 at the earliest. Most players estimate that phase will need to last three-to-four weeks. Best case, we’re talking about teams in the hub cities in late July or early August. It’s not here yet. But we’re starting to see that light at the end of the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
