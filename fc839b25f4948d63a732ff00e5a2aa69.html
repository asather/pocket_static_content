<h1>Some universities moving away from letter grades as students, faculty adapt to remote learning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Should letter grades for courses at Penn State University this spring be replaced in some cases by a designation of "satisfactory" or "unsatisfactory" amid the pandemic?</p>
<p>That is the recommendation from faculty leaders at the state’s flagship public institution. It reflects a conversation underway on campuses in this state and nationally about balancing the need to preserve academic integrity, with recognition that students face suddenly changed circumstances — ones that could weigh on their progress toward degree.</p>
<p>A university with 96,000 students and nearly two dozen campuses, Penn State is the largest single institution in the commonwealth weighing such a move in light of a universitywide switch to remote learning. But other institutions are doing so or contemplating it, including Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon University, Provost Jim Garrett said this week as the semester resumed remotely that the university needed “to create a temporary modification to the grading policy for this spring that is reflective of this extraordinary situation.’’</p>
<p>“Effective immediately, all undergraduate and graduate students will be permitted to convert any of your courses to pass/no-pass grading for this semester,” he wrote to students. “All courses for which you receive passing (P) grades will count toward degree requirements, which overrides some departmental or college policies.”</p>
<p>“At the undergraduate level, all grades of D or better in a course for which you elect the pass/no-pass grade will convert to P,” he explained. “At the graduate level, the grade for which a P can be assigned if you elect to have your course be pass/no-pass will be made at the school or college level.”</p>
<p>The reasons he and academics elsewhere stress flexibility are rooted in unknowns as higher education in the nation embarks on an extraordinary push into web-based and other remote classes.</p>
<p>Students and faculty in some cases need to learn the technology and etiquette to communicate effectively in classes where in-person contact has ceased, he said. Faculty on CMU’s campus have been asked to record lectures and make them available to students who might have trouble accessing them online in real time.</p>
<p>Worries about internet connectivity have surfaced, in particular in rural areas like those in north central Pennsylvania surrounding Mansfield University. It was a reason <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/13/Mansfield-University-State-System-of-Higher-Education-COVID-coronavirus-internet-Patterson-Pennsylvania/stories/202003130114" target="_blank">cited by that school’s president</a> for giving students the option to remain in dorms.</p>
<p>Mr. Garrett stressed that faculty be flexible in assignments, especially this week as any glitches or complications become apparent. But he also told students that resuming classes without further delay was important so the school year would not slide into summer.</p>
<p>At Penn State, under a non-binding resolution adopted by the Faculty Senate, "students would be able to coordinate with their academic adviser to request certain courses be graded as “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory,” with “satisfactory” representing a grade of C or better," according to Penn State. "Any courses graded as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory would not impact a student’s GPA."</p>
<p>The body met Wednesday in a special session held remotely.</p>
<p>A statement posted to Penn State’s website said idea is being examined by the administration. It quoted Provost Nick Jones as saying staff are considering all possible options.”</p>
<p>The Faculty Senate suggests that&nbsp; "students would be able to coordinate with their academic adviser to request certain courses be graded as “satisfactory” or “unsatisfactory,” with “satisfactory” representing a grade of C or better.</p>
<p>"Any courses graded as either satisfactory or unsatisfactory would not impact a student’s GPA.”</p>
<p>Nicholas Rowland, chair of the Faculty Senate, stressed that the resolution is “a matter of exploration” that must be the subject of further discussion with University administration before potential implementation</p>
<p>The transfer to remote instruction is a major transition at a school&nbsp; the size of Penn State, according to the university, upward of 63,000 students participated in around 350 zoom video conferencing sessions across the University as of Monday morning alone.</p>
<p>Concerns have been expressed by some by Penn State’s decision to the university’s move to synchronous remote learning, instead of asynchronous learning. Penn State President Eric Barron said cited as a reason the need to keep students fully compliant with financial aid requirements established by the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency. That agency’s board was meeting Thursday and expected to discuss possible relief.</p>
<p>Like other campuses across the Pittsburgh region, the University of Pittsburgh&nbsp; also is finishing the semester with remote instruction, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/09/COVID-19-coronavirus-Pitt-CMU-Penn-State-contingency-teaching-plans-outbreak/stories/202003090109" target="_blank">prepared for weeks</a>&nbsp;for that possibility. Spokesman Kevin Zwick said Wednesday no decisions about alternative grading have been made.</p>
