<h1>King of a cultural moment </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chadwick Boseman, a uniquely unifying actor and storyteller, has died of colon cancer at 43.</p>
<p>The world is mourning.</p>
<p>Mr. Boseman’s talent as an actor manifested in serval notable roles, including that of Jackie Robinson in the film “42” and Thurgood Marshall in “Marshall.”</p>
<p>But it is for his 2018 Marvel role as T’Challa, the Black Panther, that his brand of dignity, calm assurance and sheer virtuosity won over hearts and minds around the globe.</p>
<p>The movie explores a tale of rivalry and succession in the fictional, Afro-futuristic land of Wakanda, merging tradition and tech in a visually arresting style that set fire to public imagination.</p>
<p>Some of the politics of the movie are arguable. Its excellence as a piece of pop culture is not.</p>
<p>The film, thanks in large part to Mr. Boseman, according to director Ryan Coogler, touched off a global moment, a celebration of Blackness that stirred hope and pride in many and simple appreciation and awe in others.</p>
<p>Racial tensions have been running hot for years. “Black Panther” provided a chance for people to come together and enjoy a movie. Not because it was bereft of politics and voice, but because it transcended rudimentary sloganeering and spun a wonderful, nuanced tale.</p>
<p>Mr. Boseman’s gifts as a storyteller were extraordinary. And as the leader of a cultural celebration, he was regal — and human. His decision not to tell the world about his illness makes his passing a shock.</p>
<p>There may be another T’Challa, but not another Chadwick Boseman.</p>
<p>The world can only hope his successor bears the mantle with the same grace and decency.</p>
