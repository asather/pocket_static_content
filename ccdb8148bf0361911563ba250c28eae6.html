<h1>Dozens more temporary election staffers set to be hired by Allegheny County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Funded by a $2 million private grant it was awarded this week, Allegheny County plans to hire 76 more temporary election workers to process and canvass the influx of mail-in ballots cast in this November’s presidential election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The funds — administered by the Center for Tech and Civil Life, a nonprofit group that focuses on modernizing elections and informing America’s democracy — will go toward addressing the&nbsp;“significant challenges” Allegheny County faces in executing the Nov. 3 election, the county wrote in its application for the grant.</p>
<p>The county had requested $1.24 million to hire dozens of additional staffers, who will help with processing mail-in and absentee ballot applications, verifying ballots as eligible and completing any post-count canvassing tasks. Currently, the county has six staff members to tabulate the ballots, the county wrote in its application.</p>
<p>It also intends to spend a little over $800,000 on ballot printing and mailing automation, noting that it’s&nbsp;“enlisted the services of a printer/mail house collaboration to assist with the automation of printing and mailing ballots to voters based on request.”</p>
<p>“Typically&nbsp;the ballots would have been printed, followed by a manual insert by staff and mailed through our in-house mail operation,” the county wrote. “However, due to the dramatic increase in volume, we can no longer handle this process in house.”</p>
<p>Upon signing the grant agreement, the county will agree to use the funds only for&nbsp;“planning and operationalizing safe and secure election administration” this year, and only for additional spending — not to reduce its budget or supplant previously appropriated funds. The money must be spent by the end of the calendar year.</p>
<p>The nonprofit said it would give $250 million to local election jurisdictions across the U.S. to help them fund staffing, training and equipment, re-gifted from a large donation by Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, philanthropist Priscilla Chan.</p>
