<h1>Like many, Kris Letang trying to focus on positives of being at home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kris Letang has accomplished a lot during his 14 years in the NHL. With several Penguins franchise records, five All-Star Games and his name engraved on the Stanley Cup three times, he could be a Hall of Fame candidate someday.</p>
<p>But over the years, the 32-year-old has been robbed of opportunities to pad that resume and create more magical memories. First there was a stroke in 2014. Then neck surgery that sidelined him for the 2017 Cup run. Now a pandemic.</p>
<p>Asked Tuesday, with the NHL season still suspended due to COVID-19, how he is dealing with another tough break, the blue liner looked for silver linings.</p>
<p>“It’s tough, obviously. Everybody knows hockey is what I love to do,” he said on a conference call with Pittsburgh media. “But there’s more than hockey in this situation. To be with my family, making sure they’re safe, that’s been most important. Obviously, having the chance to spend time with them … it’s been fun.”</p>
<p>It has now been more than a month since the NHL announced on March 12 that it was putting hockey on hold. The Penguins were in Columbus that day, waiting to hear if their game against the Blue Jackets was still on.</p>
<p>For many, it felt like the pandemic came out of nowhere. But Letang said he and his wife, Catherine, had kept tabs on the coronavirus for a while. When the team was in California in late February, Letang was already taking precautions.</p>
<p>“I was a little bit aware that it was about to hit hard,” he said. “I was washing my hands. I was trying to stay away a little bit from people the best I could.”</p>
<p>The night of March 11, when the dominoes in the sports world started to fall with Utah Jazz player Rudy Gobert testing positive for the virus and the NBA calling off its games, Letang saw the writing on the wall for the NHL season.</p>
<p>But, he said, “the health of people is so much more important” than hockey.</p>
<p>“It puts everything into perspective,” he said. “And I’ve kind of blocked the will [to play] hockey right now and just try to worry about what people are going through and what the real difficulties are. … I just hope everybody is safe.”</p>
<p>The NHL on Tuesday announced it was extending its self-quarantine recommendation for players, coaches and team staff through the end of April.</p>
<p>Letang is enjoying his time at home with his wife and two children. Alex, 7, is busy with homeschooling and making Letang’s back ache by making him play so many games of mini-sticks in the house. Victoria will turn 2 this summer. They are trying to have her soak up as much as possible while teaching her big brother.</p>
<p>Letang, like many of us, has killed time by watching the old Cup runs on TV.</p>
<p>As far as his training goes, Letang said he is taking this opportunity to recharge his batteries in case the playoffs still take place sometime this summer. He figures a condensed schedule will be taxing if the NHL is able to award the Cup.</p>
<p>“You have to treat this period as your rest. That’s the way I like to see it. It’s like my summer break right now,” he said. “I’m trying to heal my body and make sure that when I come back I’m fully rested. That’s kind of my approach right now and I mix it with trying to keep my cardio up with some biking and running.”</p>
<p>Letang was asked a few hypothetical questions about what it will take for players and teams to get back up to speed after several weeks off the ice or what the best way is for the NHL to go about getting the season restarted. Letang didn’t have a great answer. With still so much unknown, nobody does right now.</p>
<p>“I think hockey will be missed by a lot of people, so it’s going to be important that everybody gets going,” Letang said. “But there’s no right [answer].”</p>
