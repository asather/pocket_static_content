<p>Despite Governor Tom Wolf’s expanded mask-wearing order, a spokeswoman for Pittsburgh Public Safety said Thursday the department will not fine people for not wearing masks outside and will remain focused on education and counsel.</p>
<p>According to an earlier release, the department will ensure that holiday revelers out for this year’s Fourth of July celebration maintain social distancing and wear masks, and also will disperse large gatherings.&nbsp;This year’s festivities will not include the usual fireworks display or the sale of alcohol for consumption inside bars and restaurants,</p>
<p>“Public Safety officials will continue to educate and encourage people to wear masks and practice social distancing. That has not changed,” said Cara Cruz, a public safety spokeswoman, in an email. “As well, all public safety officials will continue to remind people that free masks are available to them outside of all six police zones.”</p>
<p>The governor’s order, signed by Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine, mandates the wearing of masks anytime a person over the age of two is outside the home and is “unable to to consistently maintain a distance of six feet from individuals who are not members of their household,” according to the order.</p>
<p>“We all know that these are uncertain and trying times,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich in a statement released Wednesday. “But if we can pull together as a city and each of us do our part to keep ourselves and our neighbors safe, hopefully we can come together as a city next year and have a Fourth of July celebration that no one will ever forget.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported on Thursday 233 positive cases of COVID-19, the highest single-day increase since the pandemic began. It was the third day in a row that more than 100 cases were reported in a day and the first time more than 200 cases were reported. There are now 3,103 cases countywide.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich and other city officials also released guidelines for enjoying the holiday this weekend and reiterated that fireworks are illegal within 150 feet of buildings and on public land such as at Point State Park. The city recently established a fireworks task force after receiving 137 fireworks-related complaints between June 1 and June 21.</p>
<p>Those caught violating fireworks laws are subject to a $100 fine.</p>
<p>Firing guns into the air also is illegal and will be tracked by police using the ShotSpotter alert system established in 2019. Anyone caught firing weapons in public will be arrested.</p>
