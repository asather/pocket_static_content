<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. — From her fifteenth-floor office, Angela Charles has a sweeping view of downtown, overlooking a city she has helped manage for more than three decades in government.&nbsp;Ms. Charles, the assistant city manager, previously ran the water agency and holds a resume of professional awards highlighting her leadership skills.</p>
<p>But there’s another reason she was selected to lead the coordination of the 2020 Republican National Convention in August: Just eight years ago, she was involved in the last one in Charlotte. She recalled working at the 2012 Democratic National Convention in a new 24/7 public works operations center tasked with responding to everything from horse manure cleanup to&nbsp;delivery of traffic cones and barricades.</p>
<p>“We just have the capacity, the backbone, the structure to do an event like this, and to do it successfully,” said Ms. Charles, chair of the RNC Executive Management Committee, in an interview earlier this month. The committee,&nbsp;which began meeting last August,&nbsp;oversees coordination of tasks including security, marketing and permitting processes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than six months before this year’s convention, organizers in Charlotte say they are prepared to throw a flawless four-day bash aimed at boosting the re-election prospect for President Donald Trump.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presidential nominating conventions are mammoth undertakings for any city. The COVID-19 outbreak, which has cancelled events and public gatherings across the country for the coming weeks, has thrown another wrench into the planning process.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Every four years, Republicans and Democrats host late-summer conventions to officially nominate their candidate for the White House. Perhaps just as important to the parties, though, is projecting a unified, confident image to the rest of the world.</p>
<p>Neither convention has been cancelled yet due to the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The host city, charged with keeping happy tens of thousands of people over the week-long event, can make or break that image.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>By choosing Charlotte as a backdrop, RNC planners said they were hoping to tap into the experience that only comes from lessons learned.</p>
<p>“We want to provide five-star customer excellence” for the delegates, the media and the city, said Marcia Lee Kelly, president and CEO of the Republican National Convention, in a call with reporters last week.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelly, who has helped plan four RNC’s previously, emphasized the importance of training an unfiltered media spotlight on the event, to be held Aug. 24-27 in the&nbsp;Spectrum Center, an arena in the heart of the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kelly said the convention floor will be constructed more than 10 feet off the ground, creating more workspace underneath the floor and allowing all the delegates to be on the floor at the same time. The raised-floor design will provide “spectacular views,” the planners said.</p>
<p>“This idea changed everything for the better,” Ms. Kelly said.</p>
<p>The RNC will construct the largest media&nbsp;broadcast area, in the nearby convention center, in its history, allowing media outlets to customize their requests for booth size to better fit the pre-built sets, the planners said.</p>
<p>“We will continue to strive to provide maximum access while helping media showcase the convention,” Ms. Kelly said.</p>
<p><strong>A battleground</strong></p>
<p>The GOP wants to avoid any stumbles in the what is increasingly a political battleground state.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump does not face any serious challenger in the Republican primary and is widely expected to sail through the nominating convention — a contrast to the 2016 RNC in Cleveland, where he was met with street protests and dissent from some Republicans. Then-Ohio Governor John Kasich, who had run for the nomination, did not even attend the event.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump received about 70% of the delegates at the 2016 RNC, compared with 90% of delegates received by Mitt Romney at the 2012 convention and 99% received by John McCain and George W. Bush in the previous three. A simple majority is required to win the nomination.&nbsp;</p>
<p>North Carolina has voted for both Republicans and Democrats. After former President Barack Obama won the state in 2008, Mr. Trump defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton by 3.6 percentage points in 2016. That same year, Democrat Roy Cooper defeated an incumbent Republican governor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Charlotte, the state’s largest city, has grown tremendously since 2012, city officials and RNC planners said.</p>
<p>The RNC will use up to 17,000 hotel rooms, with a third of those rooms within a mile of the Spectrum Center, Ms. Kelly said. And it has a partnership with 100 venues throughout the city that will host 1,200 third-party events around the convention.</p>
<p>“The city is buzzing with energy,” Ms. Kelly said.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the money to put on the convention is “beating our expectations,” said John Lassiter, president and CEO of CLT Host 2020, Inc., the economic development nonprofit tasked with fundraising for and hosting the event.&nbsp;Mr. Lassiter would not share the current fundraising totals, which will be published in public filings later this year.</p>
<p>The nonprofit’s goal of $71 million compares to $24.1 million raised by the DNC host committee, which came up $8 million short on covering the expenses of the 2012 convention.</p>
<p>The DNC pledged to turn away corporate donations and political action committee funds, which led to the shortfall that caused the cancellation of a major event at the Charlotte Motor Speedway.</p>
<p>Mr. Lassiter, a former Republican city councilman in Charlotte, said the 2012 DNC was a&nbsp;“bit of a reach” for the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve started off with a very different fiscal view,”&nbsp;Mr. Lassiter said.&nbsp;“We want to make sure we pay our bills. ... We accept money from virtually any source.”</p>
<p>Many of the people who led the 2012 planning efforts also are involved this time around. That “puts us in a great position to run a very smooth and efficient position,” Mr. Lassiter said.</p>
<p>“The city has changed a lot in eight years,” he said. There are “more restaurants, more venues, more activity, which gives us a lot more to promote.”</p>
<p>The RNC planners have praised Charlotte.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I can tell you, having worked on six conventions, they are the best partner that we’ve ever had,” said Max Everett, vice president and chief information officer for the convention.</p>
<p>Ms. Charles, the assistant city manager, said her committee is similar in structure to the 2012 DNC. But the city is implementing new ways to streamline permitting requests and communicate with convention guests via mobile apps.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During the Democratic convention in 2012, Ms. Charles worked in the Public Works Operations Center, a division tasked with round-the-clock coordination of operations requests.&nbsp;It received hundreds of calls over the week. The average response time: 10 to 15 minutes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s looking at the same basic structure, but the technology has changed,” Ms. Charles said.&nbsp;</p>
