<h1>Cox Automotive furloughs 300 employees from Cranberry site due to COVID-19</h1>

<p>Cox Automotive Inc., an Atlanta-based company that works with car dealers, lenders and consumers to streamline operations from inventory to sales, is planning to furlough about 305 employees at its Cranberry Township location.</p>
<p>A result of the economic impact of COVID-19, the furloughs will last up to 16 weeks but could go longer than anticipated, the company said in a letter filed with the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry on May 8.</p>

<p>The extent of the public health crisis, and the resulting downturn in business, was “sudden, unforeseeable and outside of our control,” Cox Automotive wrote.</p>
<p>The company, which has 34,000 employees across its operations, is not alone in feeling the strain on business from COVID-19. Already, auto dealers have shed 265,000 jobs, according to an industry analysis that Cox Automotive released May 11. Nearly 10% of those job losses are classified as permanent.</p>
<p>In April, used vehicle sales were down 34% compared to the previous year and new vehicle sales were down 47%, the report found.</p>
<p>April’s seasonally adjusted annual rate, a way to report economic numbers that accounts for seasonal fluctuations, for new vehicle sales was 8.6 million, down from 16.5 million the prior year and the lowest monthly level since 1976.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, vehicle sales had halted almost entirely due to Gov. Tom Wolf’s orders to cease all in-person operations and state regulations that limited online vehicle sales.</p>
<p>Following weeks of protests from car dealers and advocates that said the restrictions were unfairly hindering the industry and forcing residents in need of a vehicle to shop out-of-state, the Wolf administration released new guidelines for online sales April 21.</p>
<p>Under the new guidance, vehicle sales are allowed, but most aspects of the transaction must be completed online. No in-person viewing of vehicles is allowed, the dealer must schedule appointments with customers one at a time and the vehicle handoff must be limited to the least number of people required to complete the sale.</p>
<p>Manheim Pittsburgh, the Cox Automotive location in Cranberry Township, said on its website it has closed all locations, lots and lanes to clients in response to COVID-19 and local and state ordinances. In May, the company began allowing limited access to property at some of its 100 locations as state governments began lifting restrictions.</p>
<p>Manheim, a wholesale vehicle marketplace with 17,000 team members, had $3.5 billion in revenue in 2019.</p>
<p>Cox Automotive partners with 40,000 auto dealers across the world and is a subsidiary of Cox Enterprises Inc., which has revenues of $21 billion.</p>
<p>The furloughs in Cranberry Township will start around May 17, according to Cox Automotive’s letter.</p>
<p>“We are hopeful that the COVID-19 pandemic will improve in the very near future, that current economic conditions will change and that we will be able to have employees return to work as soon as possible,” the letter read.</p>
<p>“However, as we cannot predict how long the COVID-19 situation will last, its public health impact and its effect upon our operations and business, we cannot rule out that furloughs could be longer than initially anticipated.”</p>
