<html><head><title>Bidding war: Private equity firm made $2.8 billion offer to buy Wesco in middle of bid for another firm</title></head><body><p>Last month, as Wesco International Inc. intensified its pursuit of another electrical equipment distribution company, the Station Square-based firm found itself the target of a potential takeover bid.</p><p>The buyout offer came from New York-based Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice —&nbsp;the same private equity firm that Wesco is competing with to buy Anixter International.&nbsp;</p><p>CD&amp;R offered Wesco $68 per share — an approximate value of $2.8 billion — in early December. According to public filings disclosed by Illinois-based Anxiter on Friday, Wesco decided not to entertain the overture.</p><p>Instead, the PIttsburgh company is sweetening its offer to Anxiter for the seventh time. On Friday, the company announced it had raised the buyout bid to $97 for each share of Anixter’s stock, which opened at $96.75 on the news.</p><p>Wesco started the day trading at $58.88 per share.</p><p><strong>A long history</strong></p><p>The tug between Wesco and CD&amp;R has a historical context.</p><p>Wesco, which is a distributor of industrial, electrical and construction products, began as a division of Westinghouse Electric Co. in 1922. In 1994, CD&amp;R bankrolled the spin-out of the division into an independent company.</p><p>The private equity firm sold its majority stake four years later for $1.1 billion. Soon after that, Wesco became a public company.</p><p>Since then, it has grown significantly. According to its public filings, revenue was $8.2 billion, its employee count around 9,300 and its customers span 18 countries.</p><p>A lot of that growth has come through acquisition — more than 45 deals since 1994, Wesco’s CEO John Engel marveled at the company’s investor day last June. But the acquisition streak really intensified within the past decade.</p><p>The strategy for the future, company leaders said during their investor day presentation, is to pursue much bigger targets than before —&nbsp;“transformational acquisitions.” The U.S. market for electrical distribution products was too fragmented, Mr. Engel said then, and unsustainable.</p><p>“I'm being very clear that we intend to continue to lead in terms of consolidation,” he stressed.</p><p>So it made sense that a month before Wesco publicly admitted to negotiating a deal with Anixter, the industry had taken it as a given that the unidentified bidder Anixter reported was in the running was the Station Square-based firm.</p><p>Last week, Wesco predicted its acquisition of Anixter, if successful, would bring some $200 million in cost savings.</p><p><strong>Offer, counteroffer</strong></p><p>Anixter signed a merger agreement with CD&amp;R at the end of October, which would award its shareholders $82.50 per share and take the company private.</p><p>Wesco’s first proposal, made on Nov. 12, offered $85 per share.</p><p>Anixter decided that money wasn’t worth it because of uncertainties inherent in the deal. It had what it considered a sure deal with CD&amp;R.</p><p>But the bidding wasn’t over. On the same day Anixter told Wesco it wouldn’t be considering its offer, Anixter also told CD&amp;R that it had another bidder and that its board “would be open to receiving an improved proposal from CD&amp;R.”</p><p>Two days later, Wesco upped its bid to $90 per share. CD&amp;R raised its bid as well, to $86 per share.</p><p>Wesco had upped the ante for sure, Anixter’s board decided, but the deal still carried a lot of risks: it needed to gain the approval of Wesco’s stockholders, it depended on the value of what Wesco’s stock would do over the coming months, it could bring antitrust concerns in the U.S. and Canada that might push back the closing date.</p><p><strong>Buying Wesco?</strong></p><p>Then CD&amp;R threw the curve ball, offering to buy Wesco.</p><p>The private equity firm also sent over a new proposal to Anixter linking the two deals — CD&amp;R proposed making its acquisition of the Station Square company contingent upon a closing of a deal with Anixter.</p><p>Anixter thought entertaining this deal might anger Wesco or cool its pursuit — Wesco was making more concessions in its negotiations, including figuring out a way to not to bring the deal before its own shareholders for approval. Anixter told CD&amp;R that it didn’t accept the private equity firm’s latest proposal.</p><p>A few days later, CD&amp;R said it would separate the two deals —&nbsp;the private equity firm would still pursue an acquisition of Wesco but it wouldn’t be contingent on buying Anixter.</p><p>Wesco, meanwhile, didn’t think CD&amp;R’s buyout offer was worth it.</p><p><strong>Still negotiating</strong></p><p>CD&amp;R is keeping the door open. In its latest proposal, it offered Anixter stockholders a $2.50 per share bonus if CD&amp;R ended up buying Wesco or selling Anixter to Wesco in the next year.</p><p>Last week, Wesco raised its offer price to $93.50. Then CD&amp;R matched it, noting again that it would pay cash.</p><p>Wesco, too, had increased the percent of its offer that would be payable in cash, in part to alleviate Anixter’s concerns and, in part, to avoid having to get shareholder approval. It also proposed creating a new “preferred stock” category to fund part of the transaction. This new stock, which would be granted to Anixter shareholders, would be traded separately from Wesco common stock.</p><p>CD&amp;R argued that creating a new vehicle without an active trading market is too risky.</p><p>All along, the private equity firm kept stressing it would pay cash and close fast, whereas dealing with a public company would likely stretch the closing date months into the future.</p><p>The arguments have swayed Anixter’s board every time Wesco submitted another offer and CD&amp;R countered to match it.</p><p>On Jan. 3, Anixter sent a letter to shareholders recommending they vote for the CD&amp;R deal at a special meeting on Feb. 4. It was the same day that Wesco raised its offer yet again, to $97 per share.</p><p>Anixter’s board said it is, once again, considering the offer.</p><p><em>Anya Litvak: <a href="mailto:alitvak@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">alitvak@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;or 412-263-1455.</em></p><p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/06/03/BOPnewsletterinsert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/03/Private-equity-firm-offer-buy-Wesco-bidding-war-Anixter-electrical-CD-R/stories/202001030121</original_url>
