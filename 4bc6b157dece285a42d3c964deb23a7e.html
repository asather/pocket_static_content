<h1>These five Pirates have a lot to prove in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A truck loaded with thousands of pounds of equipment left PNC Park last week to make the journey to Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla. In the next few days, a cavalcade of men chasing their dreams of baseball success will follow.</p>
<p>Despite publications like USA Today <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/04/usa-today-mlb-predictions-national-league-2020/stories/202002040087" target="_blank">predicting a 60-102 finish</a>, the Pirates, like every other club in the majors, are still hopeful heading into spring training.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a group that they expect themselves to be better than they were last year,” first-year manager Derek Shelton said. “That’s the central theme that I hear out of them when you talk to them. They said, ‘We want to get better. We want to grow. We want to learn.’ When you have the conversations that they’re having with me and the rest of the coaching staff, it’s a good sign. They’re talking about those things. It’s a good group.”</p>
<p>Negative predictions for the Pirates are partly based on the team’s horrendous finish in 2019. On the field, they stumbled to a 4-24 record after the All-Star break. Off the field, Felipe Vazquez, one of the best closers in baseball, was arrested and faces sex charges involving a teen.</p>
<p>More recently, they traded one of their top performers in Starling Marte and didn’t exactly make significant splashes in free agency, signing players such as JT Riddle, Luke Maile, Guillermo Heredia and Cody Ponce.</p>
<p>All of that sounds like another long season for Pirates fans. But there’s always a chance&nbsp;they can exceed expectations. To do that, these players either have to improve from 2019 or show they can repeat their performance:</p>
<p><strong>Chris Archer</strong></p>
<p>Around this time a year ago, we were writing about how the pitching staff would lead the Pirates to contention. We were wrong. It happens.</p>
<p>Archer entered last spring after having a hernia surgery following the 2018 season. The 31-year-old got off to a slow start and never quite found a consistent groove.</p>
<p>He showed flashes of being a dominant power pitcher in certain games. For instance, Archer pitched seven strong innings against the future World Series champion Nationals in April, with nine strikeouts and one run allowed.</p>
<p>On that day, he was economical with his pitch count and attacked hitters. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough outings like that for Archer, who finished the season with a 5.19 ERA.</p>
<p>The Pirates need Archer to get back to the fastball and slider mix that gave him success in Tampa. Shelton, who coached in Tampa from 2010-16, is excited to be reunited with Archer and believes he can be great again in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“I’ve talked to Arch a couple of times, saw Arch during the winter meetings, met with him, was able to sit down,” Shelton said. “He looks great, so I’m excited.</p>
<p>“The one thing about Chris Archer is he’s really good. But when he’s motivated, he’s even better. And I think Arch thrives on people telling him he can’t do things. He’s going to prove to you that he can. He didn’t have the year that he wanted last year. I’m excited about Chris Archer this year. I’m excited talking to him, just knowing him as a person, hearing it in his voice, the way he is. I’m excited about where Arch is at.”</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Williams</strong></p>
<p>Williams saw a severe decline in production from 2018 to 2019. His ERA jumped from 3.11 in 2018 to a whopping 5.38 in 2019.</p>
<p>The right-hander had some of his worst struggles against lefties. Southpaws had a .335 batting average against Williams, combined with a .561 slugging percentage and .952 OPS. Williams was much better in 2018, where he limited lefties to a .228 batting average, .342 slugging percentage and .637 OPS.</p>
<p>Williams, like many of the Pirates, battled injuries and never found consistency.&nbsp;He spoke to the Post-Gazette during the offseason and acknowledged that he couldn’t repeat his delivery in part because of recovery from a right side strain.</p>
<p>“With my delivery, I was making sure my body felt right rather than whether my body was good enough to pitch consistently with how I am,” he said. “For me, it’s being consistent with my delivery and recognizing certain delivery faults, sequencing pitches better and throwing my off-speed in all counts.”</p>
<p>The Pirates rotation can certainly use the Williams of two seasons ago.</p>
<p><strong>Bryan Reynolds</strong></p>
<p>Many were too busy being captivated by Cole Tucker hitting a home run April 20 to realize that a star was being born in Reynolds.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the flash of Tucker’s debut, but Reynolds got a hit on that day and pretty much got hit every day afterward in 2019.</p>
<p>Reynolds hit .314 with 16 home run, and 37 doubles. He also played all three outfield positions at different points in the season. The rookie impressed teammates and fans with his output, and for the Pirates to have any sort of success in 2020,&nbsp;Reynolds will need to show he can have similar or perhaps better numbers.</p>
<p>“He’s a monster,” Josh Bell said. “You see the numbers, but people don’t see how hard he works at his craft. He doesn’t say much because he’s focused. He also won’t let the praise go to his head.”</p>
<p><strong>Josh Bell</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of Bell, 2019 presented incredible highs and lows for him. The good was his first All-Star appearance and the 37 home runs. The bad was in the second half, when Bell’s hitting swoon coincided with the team’s downfall.</p>
<p>Hitting will likely be easy for the 27-year-old slugger.&nbsp;but the most significant area of improvement for Bell will need to come at first base.</p>
<p>Bell had 13 errors last season and a minus-5 Defensive Runs Saved, according to FanGraphs. That runs saved total was the second-worst in baseball.</p>
<p>Bell is changing his throwing motion to a sidearm, and he’s hoping that his offseason work will result in him being able to turn double plays and throw out runners at home.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have to become a Gold Glove candidate, but he can be an average defender. If he does that, the Pirates will be much better defensively than they were in 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Keone Kela</strong></p>
<p>Vazquez’s absence leaves a hole at closer, and Kela is the reliever with the most experience there.</p>
<p>Kela posted 24 saves in 2018 with the Texas Rangers before the Pirates acquired him in a trade. When healthy, he possesses a good curveball and an electric fastball. And when both pitches str going, Kela makes quick work of opposing hitters.</p>
<p>The 26-year-old had a 2.12 ERA with 33 strikeouts over 29⅔ innings in 2019.&nbsp;Shelton wouldn’t confirm last month whether or not Kela would be the closer in 2020 but is excited to see him throw in spring training and beyond.</p>
<p>“Kela is going to pitch at the back end of games,” Shelton said at PiratesFest. “He will pitch significant innings at the back end of games. ... He has a very big arm. I’m not ready to say that he’s going to be our closer. Multiple people could fill that role.”</p>
<p>The Pirates will have a thin margin for victory in most games. If they have late leads, they need to hold them. And Kela, closer or not, will be key to that in 2020.</p>
