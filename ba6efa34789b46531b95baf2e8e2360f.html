<h1>WPIAL announces 2021 Hall of Fame class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The WPIAL has another class for its Hall of Fame. Those selected will just have to wait a year to be inducted.</p>
<p>The WPIAL released its newest HOF class Tuesday morning. This would’ve been the class of 2020, but a banquet for the inductees in May was canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The WPIAL then decided to call this the class of 2021, and a banquet to honor the inductees is set for May 28, 2021.</p>
<p>The new class includes an all-time great NFL player, a two-time NCAA champion, two female athletes from Latrobe High School and the first WPIAL team to win a state softball championship, a feat accomplished 40 years ago.</p>
<p>A committee makes the Hall of Fame selections, considering nominations from schools. Selections are made in seven different categories — athlete, coach, official, contributor, team, Heritage Award, Courage Award.</p>
<p>Here is the class of 2021:</p>
