<h1>City of Asylum passes the baton to new executive director</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three years ago, City of Asylum began partnering with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for some of its many free cultural and literary events.&nbsp;The orchestra’s resident conductor, Andres Franco, often hosted the events, which paired musicians with some of the exiled writers served by the North Side nonprofit.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Franco was announced as the new executive director at City of Asylum, effective Oct. 1.</p>
<p>“When I first saw the space, I had one of those moments, an&nbsp;‘Oh, my god, I could live here’ reaction,” Mr. Franco said in a phone interview.&nbsp;“I fell in love with the collaborative, creative atmosphere of the organization.”</p>
<p>Mr. Franco, a native of Colombia, will step down from his role at the PSO at the end of the 2021 season, though he will continue as a guest conductor. He moved to Pittsburgh five years ago and lives on the North Side with his wife, Victoria Luperi, the PSO’s associate principal clarinetist. He praised City of Asylum for its swift pivot to digital programming when COVID-19 caused the cancellation of live events in March.</p>
<p>City of Asylum has been without an executive director since June 2019, when Kristen Wesloh&nbsp;stepped down after four months on the job.</p>
<p>“Andres Franco’s warmth, energy, creativity and imagination as well as his commitment to literature, music and social justice give me confidence that he will lead City of Asylum brilliantly into a wonderful next chapter of its life,” said Diane Samuels, who co-founded the organization with Henry Reese in 2004.</p>
<p>All of City of Asylum’s programming is free and open to the public, and Mr. Franco said that he will continue to prioritize multimedia and collaborations across art forms.</p>
<p>“There are so many things happening right now in the world that make you think very deeply,” he said. “At this time in my career I am thinking, ‘How can I move us even a very little bit in the right direction?’ The&nbsp;more I learned about the different programs in the organization, the more excited I got.”</p>
<p>City of Asylum is currently celebrating Jazz Poetry Month. Virtual programming is available at <a href="https://www.alphabetcity.org/" target="_blank">alphabetcity.org</a>.</p>
