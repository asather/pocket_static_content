<h1>Hello Neighbor intensifies help to refugee families during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With his grandchild squealing in the background, Hannan Osso recently explained by phone through interpreter Hiba Wagner how the threat of the coronavirus has plunged his family into need.</p>
<p>He is 54, living in Munhall on disability with his wife, Kadifa, 52, and three children. The couple’s two daughters, aged 23 and 24, lost their jobs at the Sharpsburg decorative apparel factory, Stitches. Their 18-year-old son is an 11th grader at Steel Valley High School.</p>
<p>Their life before COVID-19 was challenging enough. They are Syrian refugees from war and religious persecution by ISIS because they are Yazidi, a minority religious group. They gained asylum four years ago, arriving in Pittsburgh from a refugee camp in Turkey.</p>

<p>But since the pandemic shut down their only employment, they have been stressed by the threat of eviction. It’s not legal during the stay-at-home order. But they didn’t know that.</p>
<p>That’s where their mentors came in.</p>
<p>The Ossos met Wesley and Kathleen Oliver shortly before the pandemic forced a shutdown of most businesses and required social distancing. The Olivers trained as mentors with Hello Neighbor, a nonprofit whose mission is to help refugee families adapt and thrive in their new life.</p>
<p>Since its founding in 2017, Hello Neighbor has served 122 families. Eighty percent of them continue to participate and maintain relationships with their mentors, said the organization’s founder Sloane Davidson.</p>
<p>The Ossos and Olivers met just last month.</p>
<p>“We only met them once, when we were introduced,” said Mr. Oliver, a law professor at Duquesne University and director of its criminal justice center.</p>
<p>“We met in their home with a translator,” said Ms. Oliver, an administrative business partner at Google. “They were gracious and welcoming and offered us food.”</p>
<p>Food became an issue when the Ossos’ landlord declined to give them some time to pay the April rent. The Olivers tried to intervene, but the Ossos feared eviction and scratched together the money.</p>
<p>“That’s when I contacted a colleague, Joe Mistick,” he said. Mr. Mistick is also Ms. Davidson’s father. “He asked me if the Ossos had enough after paying the rent, and I said, ‘Not if they expect to eat this month.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Mistick, an attorney and associate law professor at Duquesne University, wrote a letter to alert the landlord that the family cannot be evicted now. By the time Mr. Oliver went to post it, the Ossos had already paid the rent.</p>
<p>“They had needed that money for food,” Mr. Mistick said, “so I called Jimmy Coen,” owner of Yinzers, a sports apparel store in the Strip. “He went to Salem [a Halal grill and market in the Strip.] Salem put together a box of food and Jimmy delivered it to the family in Munhall.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Hello Neighbor set up a <a href="https://www.helloneighbor.io/refugee-assistance-fund" target="_blank">refugee assistance fund</a> and raised $25,000, enough to give each of its families a $250 micro grant.&nbsp;Ms. Davidson said if the fund grows with new donations, she will offer families additional chances to apply.</p>
<p>Layoffs due to the coronavirus have affected more than half of Hello Neighbor’s families, Ms. Davidson said, mainly because of the types of jobs they do. In addition, members of families who are working as custodial staff in essential services are pulling double shifts, she said.</p>
<p>When COVID hit, “immediately we saw huge percentages of our families lose their jobs” in housekeeping, laundry, dish washing. “We also had a number of dads who moved to the gig economy, mostly ride sharing, so all of that fell off as well.”</p>
<p>Cultural issues have slowed some refugee families’ willingness to depend on food banks, she said.</p>
<p>Hello Neighbor had previously raised money to help pay for such needs as school uniforms, workbooks for dads working in landscaping or construction, summer camp offsets, childcare and bus passes, Ms. Davidson said.</p>
<p>Ms. Davidson said Hello Neighbor has asked the families getting the new grants how they’re going to spend the money, “so that they aren’t missing out on other assistance. If they say ‘food,’ we make sure they know about food distributions, food banks, food stamps, etc., so they can use their grants for other things.”</p>
<p>Mr. Osso said he is disabled by a disk problem in his back.&nbsp;“I used to have a store that specialized in embroidery,” he said of his former life in Syria. The store made linens, blankets, comforters and specialized items for couples entering marriage.</p>
<p>“Everything I did, I did with my hands,” he said, “I started doing that when I was 15. Yes, I miss it.”</p>
<p>Ms. Oliver said she and her husband realized early on that the Ossos’ employment here was “not of the sort that would survive the pandemic.”</p>
<p>In fact, Stitches, the factory at which the Ossos’ daughters sewed, laid off all 53 of its employees. Keith Kearney, husband of the owner, Cindy Kearney, said the company has been in business since 1985 but is not allowed to be open now.</p>
<p>Mr. Oliver said his wife “immediately reached out to the Ossos and has spent countless hours helping them with applications for unemployment and with rental assistance.</p>
<p>“Those applications are not easy to fill out for an English speaker,” he said. “If you looked at the forms and knew your life depended on it, you would get someone to help you.”</p>
<p>Ms. Oliver said she was working on the unemployment applications when the Ossos brought dinner to the Olivers’ home in Shadyside, with a safe hand-off from the sidewalk.</p>
<p>She believes the Ossos are putting the best face on their situation.&nbsp;“After all they have been through as refugees, they might be handling this [pandemic] better than we are.”</p>
<p>Mr. Osso, who said he and his family hope to become citizens, said the Olivers and Jimmy Coen Salem’s food have been lifelines. “Thanks to God. I am very grateful to them.”</p>
