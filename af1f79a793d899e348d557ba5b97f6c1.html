<h1>Pitt-Duquesne City Game won't happen in 2020-21</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The City Game between Pitt and Duquesne, once a fixture of the basketball calendar in Western Pennsylvania, will not be taking place for the second time in as many seasons.</p>
<p>Pitt confirmed Thursday that the Panthers’ and Dukes’ men’s basketball teams are not scheduled to play during the 2020-21 season, marking only the second time in the past 50 years that has been the case.</p>
<p>The rivals, with campuses separated by only a two-mile stretch of Forbes Avenue, did not play last season, either. That was the first time since the 1969-70 season the two had not met.</p>
<p>The program’s women’s teams have met every year since 1984 including last season, when Duquesne beat Pitt, 81-62.</p>
<p>The absence in the men’s basketball series came with the hope of resumption, as it was announced in March 2019 that the two schools had agreed in principle to play in 2020. No reason was provided by Pitt for the change in plans.</p>
<p>With 87 all-time meetings, Duquesne is Pitt’s fourth-most-played opponent in men’s basketball program history. The Panthers hold a 55-32 advantage in the series, which includes victories in 17 of the past 18 matchups.</p>
