<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kick off your growing season with garden author and photographer Ken Druse and other experts at the Garden and Landscape Symposium and Marketplace on April 25.</p>
<p>The event’s 25th year will be at a new venue, Hampton Community Center, 3101 McCully Road, 15101.</p>
<p>Mr. Druse, the keynote speaker, will discuss his 2019 book, “The Scentual Garden: Exploring the World of Botanical Fragrance” (Harry N. Abrams, $50).</p>
<p>Niki Jabbour, an author and expert on vegetable gardening from Nova Scotia, will discuss how to grow food all year long, regardless of climate zone. She is one of four gardeners who created <a href="https://savvygardening.com/" target="_blank">savvygardening.com</a>, a website that offers information for gardeners of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
<p>Two Penn State experts will talk about gardening amid climate change and adding pollinator diversity. Beth Brantley, a forestry professor and now technical support specialist with Bartlett Tree Experts, will present “Creating and Maintaining a Climate Resilient Landscape.” Harland Patch, director of pollinator programming at the Penn State Arboretum, will discuss “Garden Landscapes for Pollinators.”</p>
<p>Programs run from 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. with breaks for a continental breakfast, lunch, a silent auction and plant shopping at the Garden Marketplace, which is open to the general public from&nbsp;8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Vendors include nurseries and specialty shops that offer garden-related items. Here are a few:</p>
<p>• Locust Spring Nursery specializes in uncommon woodland plants. John Totten and Linda Kramer will bring seed-grown trilliums, tough but hard-to-find groundcovers, and woodland peony and salvia species that flower in the shade.</p>
<p>• Leslie and Dave Danaher of central Ohio specialize in woody plants including dwarf conifers, Japanese maples and unusual flowering trees and shrubs.</p>
<p>• Dennis James of DJs Greenhouse in Transfer, Pa., will bring deer-resistant hellebores, shade-tolerant barrenwort (<em>Epimedium</em>) and other perennials and unusual annuals.</p>
<p>• Sunny Sprouts Greenhouse owners Nancy and Richard Neel will offer succulents, carnivorous plants and bonsai trees.</p>
<p>• High Tech Garden Supply specializes in equipment for hydroponics and offers a range of organic and all-natural fertilizers.</p>
<p>Penn State Master Gardeners have also begun potting perennials that they will grow and sell at the Garden Marketplace.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost for the symposium is $120, $105 if you register by March 23 at&nbsp; <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/garden-landscape-symposium" target="_blank">https://extension.psu.edu/garden-landscape-symposium</a>.</p>
