<h1>Fresh Fest goes on, online </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fresh Fest, America’s first Black beer festival, is going online this year as Fresh Fest Digi Fest,&nbsp;“America's first Black (digital) beer festival.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The online event on Aug. 8 is once again being presented by the Drinking Partners Podcast, but without Black Brew Culture, the local entity with which the fest was launched in 2017. In June, Black Brew Culture’s Mike Potter announced on social media that&nbsp;“we have officially severed ties” with podcasters Day Bracey and Ed Bailey “over money, contracts and operational structure” of the fest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier in June, organizers announced that due to COVID-19 concerns, the event wouldn’t happen in the city neighborhood of Allentown as planned. The previous two fests, spread out over the North Side’s Nova Place, were voted the second-best beer festival in the country in USA Today reader polls. Honors included a Brewers Association grant for fostering diversity and inclusion and a starring role in a documentary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The show will go on virtually, decided Mr. Bracey, who has been busting it since then to continue the goal of&nbsp;“celebrating Black culture through art, education, collaboration and representation,” something they were doing before Black Lives Matter became such a huge part of the national and world experience.</p>
<p>“For us, it’s the same message going forward,” he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What he and his partners, sponsors and supporters have come up with for this #fresh3st take is six online&nbsp;“channels” of speakers, performers and artists, with a free app to guide attendees. He promises it’s NOT a daylong Zoom meeting, but rather, a multifaceted exploration of Blackness and brewing and busines via Zoom panels, live-streamed Drinking Partner podcasts, music, art, brewing and cooking tutorials and other programming.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most of the speakers will present between noon and 3 p.m., while most of the entertainment runs from 3 to 9 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“You can go in and out of these streams,” says Mr. Bracey, who suggests people partake with small groups of friends in a coronavirus-safe setting such as outdoors. If you want to&nbsp;“attend” on your own, you can still hang out with like-minded folks in virtual taprooms during the fest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Much of the programming will be live-streamed from Allentown venues such as the Work Hard Pittsburgh studios, RE360’s warehouse and Black Forge Coffee House. Mr. Bracey says organizers are taking pains to make sure no more than 15 festival contributors are at any one spot, and they wlll be able to check people’s temperatures outside tents that will be set up as temporary green rooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing about being online is that people can join from all over the world, as can heavy-hitter speakers and past FF alums including Brooklyn Brewery brewmaster and author Garrett Oliver and J. Nikol Jackson-Beckham, Ph.D., who founded Craft Beer For All. She is to lead&nbsp;“a conversation on the role of race in Prohibition, the rise of the 40-ounce, craft breweries and urban gentrification, and the transformative potential of #craftbeercareers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>An all-access pass to the event, which is to run from noon to 9 p.m. that Saturday, is $10, and there are packages that include the traditional souvenir taster or bigger glass ($20 and $30), shirt ($35) and all the swag ($60). So far, people are paying for the upgrades, which Mr. Bracey says&nbsp;“helps us exponentially.”</p>
<p>You can fill the glasses yourself from four-packs of collaboration brews created by local and Black-owned breweries. Two packs containing four cans of beers — one hoppy, one lager, one sour, one dark&nbsp;— can be delivered to homes.</p>
<p>Some breweries collaborated with artists, entrepreneurs and others on Fresh Fest brews that can be sought out and enjoyed at those breweries and other local outlets.&nbsp;For instance, Aurochs Brewing in Emsworth is working with state Rep. Summer Lee on a gluten-free beer. Grant and Shane Saylor at Bellevue’s Lincoln Avenue Brewing invited over Michael Orellano, the front of house manager from Hitchhiker Brewing in Sharpsburg, to brew a hoppy amber named Just A Little Bit Darker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The app includes a directory of black breweries as well as&nbsp;a “Fresh3st Market” of Black-owned businesses. There’s even a small business workshop that day with New Sun Rising.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Bracey says that thanks to sponsorships, all the fest’s speakers and artists will be paid, and the app will allow attendees to give additional donations as tips. Especially during a pandemic that’s been extremely tough on breweries and performers, he’s proud to be able to say that “people get beer, Black folks get paid” —&nbsp;no matter how this virtual event goes down. So far, buzz and ticket sales are in line with a first-time event, which this is, in a sense. If it goes as planned, he says,&nbsp;“I think it’ll be a great success.”&nbsp;</p>
