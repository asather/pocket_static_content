<h1>All-Pro Cam Heyward, Steelers agree to new deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers and defensive end Cam Heyward agreed on a new contract Sunday night, eight days before the team’s self-imposed deadline.</p>
<p>The new deal has $65.6 million in new money. The $16.4 million average over four years is the richest contract in NFL history for a defensive player over 30. Over the next five years, he’ll make $75.1 million if he plays out the remainder of the contract.</p>
<p>It was the first contract extension the Steelers did this year, and it came after months of uncertainty due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though the salary cap could decrease by as much as $23 million next season, other teams began signing their star players in July.</p>
<p>The Steelers followed suit on Sunday, though it remains to be seen how they’ll manage their cap going forward.</p>
<p>It was only 20 days ago that Heyward expressed some doubt about getting a new contract before the season began.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty uncertain right now,” Heyward said Aug. 17. “I don’t know what to think. I’ve seen a lot of teammates in the past sign, but at the same time I know the NFL is moving forward with its business. You see other guys getting their contracts resolved. I want to have faith, but I’m going to be ready to play either way. I’m going to make sure I’m locked in on this season.”</p>
<p>Heyward doesn’t have to worry any longer. He was the top priority for the Steelers all offseason, and they took care of business with a week to spare.</p>
<p>The Steelers don’t negotiate contracts once the regular season begins, and they didn’t want to let one of their best players test free agency in March.</p>
<p>Heyward, who turned 31 in May, has registered 29 of his 53 career sacks in the past three seasons. He made All-Pro twice in the past three years, including last season when he set his career high in tackles with 83.</p>
<p>Heyward was the Steelers’ first-round pick in 2011. He didn’t start a game during his first two seasons in the league, but he’s been a consistent force as a starter since the 2013 season. He’s become one of the most dominant interior defensive linemen over the past three seasons.</p>
<p>The Steelers have several other players entering the final years of their contracts, including receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, running back James Conner, cornerback Mike Hilton and offensive linemen Matt Feiler and Alejandro Villanueva.</p>
<p>All five are set to become unrestricted free agents next year unless the Steelers sign them in the next week.&nbsp;It’s going to be a difficult task to do another extension, though. The Steelers already created cap space last week when offensive lineman Davie DeCastro converted $3.85 million in salary into a signing bonus.</p>
<p>The salary cap figure for next season is not definitively known at this point, but the floor will be $175 million. It’s $198 million this year, a figure that was determined in March and remained unchanged throughout the pandemic.</p>
<p>The NFL set that floor earlier this summer, but there is a chance the cap could be higher than $175 million depending on the revenue that is generated this season. Many teams, including the Steelers, will not have fans at home games this month. They are holding out hope that fans can attend later in the season.</p>
<p>Ticket revenue, along with parking concessions and merchandise sales account for close to one-third of the league’s revenues on a yearly basis.</p>
<p>The Steelers have a number of other big contracts to negotiate in coming years. All-Pro outside linebacker T.J. Watt is a candidate to be extended next year when he’ll be playing on the fifth-year option in his rookie contract. All-Pro safety Minkah Fitzpatrick is due for a new contract the following year.</p>
