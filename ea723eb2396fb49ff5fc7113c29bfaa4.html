<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An alleged serial rapist was arrested Tuesday in State College in connection with the rapes of four Penn State University students.</p>
<p>State College police arrested Jeffrey P. Fields, 36, of Port Matilda in connection with four rapes of women that occurred between 2010 and 2017. Two of the victims were 19 years old and two other victims were 20 at the time of the respective incidents.</p>
<p>In all four cases, the assaults took place outdoors by an unknown male. DNA samples taken during examinations performed at the time of each assault linked all four rapes to one unknown suspect.</p>
<p>During the investigation process, State College police utilized genetic genealogy screening to develop Mr. Fields as&nbsp;the suspect involved in the rapes.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields was charged with multiple counts of felony rape, sexual assault, involuntary deviant sexual intercourse and misdemeanor simple assault.&nbsp;A preliminary hearing on the case has been scheduled for July 29 before Magisterial District Judge Donald M. Hahn.</p>
<p>Mr. Fields&nbsp;is being held at&nbsp;Centre County Correctional Facility without bail.</p>
