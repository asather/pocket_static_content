<h1>MLB draft shortened to five rounds; will be held in June</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>According to multiple reports, the Major League Baseball draft in 2020 will be confined to five rounds and held June 10-11.</p>
<p>This is obviously not great news for the Pirates, who need to acquire more talent.</p>
<p>One of the cheapest ways to do that is via the draft, and the Pirates took steps in improving their draft performance this offseason by hiring general manager Ben Cherington and assistant GM Steve Sanders, both of whom have a solid track record with this exercise.</p>
<p>There was some hope that MLB and the MLB Players Association could agree on a 10-round draft; however, it appears that the owners' won out on their preference that the draft be kept to five rounds.</p>
<p>Teams can sign as many undrafted players as they want after the draft for $20,000 per player.</p>
<p>The Pirates hold the seventh pick in the first round. They will also pick No. 31, a competitive balance pick awarded to either one of the 10 smallest markets or 10 smallest revenue pools.</p>
<p>The Pirates hold the seventh selection in the second round, which is 44th overall, and will draft in the same spot for the remaining three rounds.</p>
