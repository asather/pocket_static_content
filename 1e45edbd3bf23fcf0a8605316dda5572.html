<h1>Immigrant rights activists protest Colcom Foundation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Immigrant rights activists gathered in downtown Pittsburgh Thursday morning outside the Colcom Foundation office, asking that local civic and environmental groups reject support from the "leading funder of anti-immigrant hate groups."</p>
<p>Protesting groups included members of Pittsburgh Labor Council for Latin American Advancement, Thomas Merton Center, Veterans for Peace and Bend the Arc. Moderated by Guillermo Perez of the LCLAA, additional members from each group spoke and called for Pittsburgh to "drop Colcom," and reject support from the organization during a brief rally that lasted less than an hour.</p>
<p>Supporters and organizers from each of the four protesting groups stood near Stanwix Street by the Gateway T-Station holding signs that read "Colcom is racist" and "Everybody's got a right to live."</p>
<p>Founded in 1996, the Colcom Foundation was created by Cordelia Scaife May and Dr. John Tanton, an environmentalist and avowed eugenicist who advocated for a majority white population in the U.S. and a sealing off of the U.S.-Mexican border to protect against what he called a “Latin onslaught.”</p>
<p>The Colcom Foundation has poured millions into a network of groups that spent decades agitating for policies now pursued by President Donald Trump: militarizing the border, capping legal immigration, prioritizing skills over family ties for entry and reducing access to public benefits for migrants, according to the New York Times.</p>
