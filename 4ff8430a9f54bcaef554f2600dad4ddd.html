<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kennywood and its sister parks, Sandcastle Waterpark and Idlewild &amp; SoakZone, will open in phases beginning Monday, July 6 and fully reopen to the public July 11&nbsp;with new safety guidelines due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The parks, which had delayed their season opening, will limit capacity and require masks and temperature checks upon entry. Any person with a temperature of 100.4°F or higher or displaying other COVID-19 symptoms will be denied entry, parks officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Visitors will need to register for the date they wish to visit in advance, in addition to their regularly purchased Ticket or Season Pass. The RSVP system will be available beginning June 17. Dates will be released in phases, officials said.</p>
<p>Walk-up sales will not be available this summer, and all sales by third parties, such as schools and community groups, will be conducted online.</p>
<p>Masks will be required for all staff and entrants, except children under 3 and those with a valid medical condition. They are not to be worn on any attraction or pool and are not necessary while waiting in line or walking between attractions.</p>
<p>The parks will also offer hand sanitizer and request social distancing of six feet between parties.</p>
<p>Kennywood in West Mifflin is open daily through Aug. 25, and open weekends until Nov. 1. Idlewild (in Ligonier Township) and Sandcastle (in West Homestead) are open daily through Aug. 23, with Sandcastle being open on weekends until Labor Day and Idlewild through Oct. 25.</p>
