<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools 'disappointed' it didn't receive Pa. remote learning grant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Department of Education in April allocated about $5 million in grants to some of the schools that needed the most help providing remote instruction for their students amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but Pittsburgh’s application was rejected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools could use the state-funded equity grants to purchase devices, software, instruction and administrative supplies, as well as other items the education department deemed necessary for learning to continue during the shutdown.</p>
<p>The state awarded grants to 96 local education agencies, including school districts, charter schools and intermediate units. Grants of various sizes were allocated to schools with a wide range of demographics, but the largest amounts were provided to three urban districts — Philadelphia, Reading and Scranton — each of which received $500,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools applied for a grant, but did not receive one, which spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said was “disappointing” for the district.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It would definitely have helped us,” she said.&nbsp;“We were definitely concerned that we would not get one.”</p>
<p>The transition from brick-and-mortar schools to remote education has been an expensive challenge for the Pittsburgh Public Schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district has spent about $2.6 million on remote instruction since schools closed in March, investing about $1.5 million on laptops for students alone. Printing and preparation of the first two rounds of work packets cost the district about $600,000. Other expenses include WiFi hot spots and personal protective equipment for employees helping to prepare and distribute remote learning tools.</p>
<p>Beyond the expenses for remote instruction, Pittsburgh Public Schools officials this week said the pandemic could <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/05/12/Pittsburgh-Public-Schools-board-district-budget-revenue-projections-coronavirus/stories/202005120151" target="_blank">significantly harm the district’s finances</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Education allowed schools to apply for two types of equity grants: Systemic Continuity of Education&nbsp;and&nbsp;Student Group Continuity of Education.</p>
<p>According to the criteria, local education agencies would be eligible for&nbsp;systemic grants if more than 10% of students were unable to participate in continuity of education. Agencies would be eligible for&nbsp;student group grants if more than 5% of students in a specific demographic were&nbsp;unable to participate in continuity of education.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools applied for a systemic grant worth $565,000, according to Ms. Pugh. The district asked for the funding to help with several needs, including buying devices, printing packets, software, cost of postage and translation services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Pugh said the state told the district that it did not receive a grant because of an issue with the application.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement provided to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Department of Education said “PPS provided both systemic and student group-level data that could not be reconciled during the very brief application window.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools proposal&nbsp;“demonstrated a significant level of need,” the education department said, adding that it was&nbsp;“working aggressively to identify resources that can support the critical work underway in Pittsburgh and elsewhere.”</p>
<p>State Education Secretary Pedro A. Rivera said local education agencies around the state applied for about $22 million in total.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Rivera said he would try to use federal funding from the CARES Act to make up some of the difference to schools that did not receive grants.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools was slated to receive about $11.1 million from the CARES Act, though it could be less.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is the second-largest district in the state with an enrollment of more than 23,000 students.</p>
<p>Of the districts that got the $500,000 grants,&nbsp;Reading, the state’s fourth-largest district, is closest to Pittsburgh in enrollment with about 17,800 students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The percentage of students in each district that needed to be provided with items to participate in remote learning was unclear.</p>
<p>However, about 48% of Reading students come from families below the poverty level compared to about 32% of Pittsburgh students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Philadelphia is by far the largest district in Pennsylvania with more than 202,000 students, 34% of whom come from families living below the poverty level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Scranton School District has around 10,000 students with about 35% coming from families below the poverty level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state gave equity grants to more than a dozen school districts in southwestern Pennsylvania, including $94,750 to Big Beaver Falls Area, $76,650 to New Brighton Area, $75,900 to Steel Valley and $74,950 to East Allegheny. Several local charter schools also received grant money, including $24,700 to the Urban Academy of Greater Pittsburgh in Larimer, $25,272 to Young Scholars of Western Pennsylvania in Baldwin Township and $21,762 to Young Scholars of McKeesport.</p>
<p>During a state Senate Education Committee hearing on Monday, Mr. Rivera said the $5 million in grants allocated by the education department will help schools serve 35,000 students&nbsp;“who would have otherwise been unable to stay educationally connected during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“These grants, admittedly, addressed only a fraction of existing needs, and we have pledged to continue to explore every opportunity to provide additional resources to students, to families and schools in need,” he said.</p>
