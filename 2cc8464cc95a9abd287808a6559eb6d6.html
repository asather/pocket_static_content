<h1>Penn State 'excited' for football's return, but uncertainty remains</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Football is back in the Big Ten, but with all the money, prestige, passion and pride the sport provides, it also offers one more thing this year: Uncertainty.</p>
<p>Five weeks after conference leaders voted to postpone fall sports because of the coronavirus pandemic and after pressure from players, coaches and even President Donald Trump, the Big Ten announced on Wednesday it plans to start its 2020 football season on Oct. 23-24.</p>
<p>But with the news comes trepidation. COVID-19 cases have been on the rise in several Big Ten cities, and the Penn State athletic department on Wednesday reported 50 positive tests among 859 athletes tested in its most recent testing period from Sept. 5-11. According to data from the university’s dashboard, the total number of cases on the school’s main campus rose by 458 on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The school, which is continuing with in-person learning, doesn’t specify in its weekly report the sports from which positive tests arise, and a spokeswoman for the athletic department said Wednesday the school currently doesn’t have “any teams paused from a sports medicine perspective,” though some programs did pause last week.</p>
<p>Penn State president Eric Baron acknowledged Wednesday that he voted “no” to fall sports last month. This week’s vote to restart sports by the Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors was unanimous.</p>
<p>“Yesterday, I voted to move forward with fall sports,” Baron said in a letter posted on the school’s website. “I did so based on an extraordinary amount of effort by a Big Ten task force over the last month to create the necessary conditions for a COVID-free arena of play.</p>
<p>“Our new approach is data-driven and guided by a chief infection officer to be designated by each institution,” Baron said. “Consistent and uniform testing will be ready for the entire Big Ten, managed by the conference, with point-of-care rapid antigen testing six to seven times a week with results ready at least four hours before every practice and game.”</p>
<p>That antigen testing will begin Sept. 30. According to the Associated Press, the earliest an athlete will be able to return to competition after a positive test is 21 days, and that will follow an “evaluation and clearance from a cardiologist.”</p>
<p>“We can’t emphasize enough that what we’re putting forward still requires prevention, requires accountability from everyone involved from our student-athletes to coaches to staff to be doing the things to prevent getting this infection,” Dr. Jim Borchers, the team physician for Ohio State, told the AP. “And our progress will be measured by their efforts but also we hope by the efforts to provide a clean competition and practice environment.”</p>
<p>Many schools from other Power Five leagues such as the ACC and Big 12 launched their football regular seasons this past weekend. It’s unclear how other fall sports at Penn State will proceed, and it might not be known for a while whether the Big Ten and its leadership made the right call in August or September. But what is clear is many people, including head football coach James Franklin, are elated.</p>
<p>“We are excited for our guys to have the opportunity to get back to action safely,” Franklin said in a statement. “Our guys have remained relentless in following our COVID-19 protocols and in their preparations to be ready to play football. We are also thankful the Big Ten presidents and chancellors considered the information presented and voted for the safe return to play.”</p>
<p>That excitement extends to the State College community. Tickets will not be sold to the general public for Big Ten games, and it seems highly unlikely that any fans will be able to attend games at Beaver Stadium. But Fritz Smith, president and CEO of the Happy Valley Adventure Board, expects at least some economic boost to a region that likely would lose millions of dollars without a standard football season.</p>
<p>“I think we’ll have some alumni and friends come back to the community and gather to watch the games just to be in Happy Valley,” Smith said. “Even with no fans, you’ll have some impact. They’ll want to go to their favorite restaurants and bars to watch the games. Hopefully, a few will stay in hotels for a night or two.”</p>
<p>On the field, Penn State is scheduled to play eight conference games with no off week. A ninth game (and the league’s championship game) will be played Dec. 19 based on conference standings. If that format existed last season, the Nittany Lions, who finished second in the East Division, would’ve played Minnesota, which finished second in the west. College Football Playoff selections are set for Dec. 20, so a national championship isn’t out of the realm of possibility for a team that finished the 2019 season ranked No. 9 in the country.</p>
<p>Standout Micah Parsons remains the only Penn State player who chose to opt-out of the season, doing so a week before the conference’s initial vote to postpone. There were some reports that star tight end Pat Freiermuth would do the same, but the draft prospect showed up during Franklin’s interview Wednesday on the Big Ten Network.</p>
<p>”There were some reports out there about me opting out, but I never opted out,” Freiermuth said. “I’m just excited to play football again for Penn State, and I can’t wait for the season.”</p>
<p>Freiermuth, however, admitted that he considered not playing. Franklin said he would have supported the junior no matter which decision he made.</p>
<p>“If Pat had left, there would have been nobody that was more supportive and caring about Pat’s future than myself and my staff and our team,” Franklin said. “At the end of the day, this is Pat’s decision. I do think we were able to have some candid conversations, which helped.</p>
<p>“For him to come back, I wanted him to be 100 percent on board with that decision, and if he was going to leave, then we were going to be 100 percent on board with him.”</p>
<p>But Freiermuth is returning, and so is fall football. Will it work? That uncertainty is how 2020 has been defined in and outside of sports.</p>
<p>“The opportunity to safely return to athletic competition is a positive for not only our athletics department but our campus community and Penn State nation,” athletic director Sandy Barbour said. “Most importantly, I am thrilled for our student-athletes, coaches and staff, as I know how much continued hard work they have put in during this summer and fall with their eyes on returning to competition.”</p>
