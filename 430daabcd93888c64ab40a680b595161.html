<p>TAMPA, Fla. – Rookie defenseman John Marino escaped a Steven Stamkos slap shot to the face without major injury in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/06/penguins-lightning-score-results-matchup-game-NHL-pittsburgh-tampa/stories/202002060181" target="_blank">Thursday’s 4-2 loss</a> in Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>Late in the third period, after Marino had scored his fifth goal of the season to pull the Penguins within 3-2, Stamkos ripped a one-timer from the left circle that hit Zach Aston-Reese’s stick and ramped up into Marino’s cheek.</p>
<p>When the whistle blew, players from both teams waved for an athletic trainer to come take a look at Marino, who lay face-first down on the ice. After about 30 seconds, Marino got up on his skates and was helped off the ice by head athletic trainer Chris Stewart. Marino went to the locker room and did not return.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan said after the game that Marino was still being evaluated but the team believed he would be OK. That is indeed the case. According to a source, Marino is fine, other than getting some stitches at Amalie Arena.</p>
<p>Marino, whom the Penguins acquired from the Edmonton Oilers for a sixth-round pick last summer, has been one of the NHL’s most impressive rookies. The Harvard product has 25 points and plus-14 rating through his first 51 games. He figures to get votes for the All-Rookie team and maybe the Calder Trophy.</p>
<p>The Penguins are scheduled to practice Friday in Sunrise, Fla. They will then wrap up their three-game road trip against the Florida Panthers on Saturday.</p>
