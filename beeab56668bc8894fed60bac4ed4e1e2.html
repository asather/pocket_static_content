<h1>Pittsburgh controller finds some bright spots in revenue flow</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some aspects of City of Pittsburgh finances have taken a significant hit so far in 2020, but other areas of revenue are more optimistic, according to the city controller.</p>
<p>At a Thursday press conference detailing the new mid-year Popular Annual Financial Report —&nbsp;the city’s finance report for “non accountants and the layperson” —&nbsp;City Controller Michael Lamb said that although 2019 was a strong fiscal year for Pittsburgh, the COVID-19 pandemic has dampened several aspects of the city’s income sources.</p>
<p>Diminished revenue from amusement taxes, facility usage fees and parking taxes account for the largest losses so far.</p>
<p>“The amusement tax, which is a $17 million line item for Pittsburgh, normally brings in about 6 to 7 million dollars at this point in the year,” Mr. Lamb said. “But this year we’ve only brought in about $4 million&nbsp; so far, and about one and a half million of that is from events from last year.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said that revenue loss from parking taxes accounts for the most significant hit, only bringing in about $17 million so far compared to the roughly $30 million normally brought in at this point in the year.</p>
<p>Other than taxes, revenue from other areas, such as permits, is only slightly behind from last year.</p>
<p>Despite these losses, Mr. Lamb said that other areas of revenue are surprisingly not taking as big a hit as expected.</p>
<p>Property taxes taxes are bringing in numbers close to last year, or even slightly higher than last year according to the city controller, while the earned income tax is outperforming expectations.</p>
<p>Because these areas are performing well, Mr. Lamb wondered if other revenue areas might be suffering from reporting issues.</p>
<p>“The payroll preparation tax, which is the main tax on business, is significantly under-performing from last year, which does not really jibe from what we’re seeing on the earned income tax.” Mr. Lamb said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said he would argue the same thing about the reported drop in the local services tax, which is the $52 tax that everyone who works in the City of Pittsburgh pays. Even though people are working from home, Mr. Lamb said, they are liable for the tax if their employer is located in the city.</p>
<p>Another silver lining is the fact that the city finished last year with a $20 million surplus, meaning that the city’s unassigned fund balance can help stabilize the budget in the interim.</p>
<p>Although the losses are perhaps not as significant as city officials originally thought, Mr. Lamb said, the revenue hits that the city is taking right now are largely unrecoverable due to the nature of those income sources.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at significant revenue that we’re gonna miss out on, and the city is going to have to deal with that.” Mr. Lamb said.&nbsp;</p>
