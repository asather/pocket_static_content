<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 04.15.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, we're going to start our chat is just a bit, so get those questions ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, kids, let's get started....</p>
<p><strong>TJP</strong>: Gerry, I think it’s unbelievable laziness on the national media for continuing to mock hurts in the second, they clearly aren’t following the Steelers closely. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's not laziness, just incredulousness.</p>
<p><strong>TJ Thomas</strong>: I was against the idea of drafting Jalen Hurts, but what he did in college cant be ignored, and he has that Lamar Jackson in him, can run and sling it. Now, I wouldnt mind Hurts at 49. Any chance that happens(I dont think so)? Keep Mason 1 more year as backup, Hurts is QB3 for 2020. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't forsee that happening at all, but, of course, nothing shocks me. Hurts is not the type of QB the Steelers have employed under Tomlin. The only one close was Josh Dobbs, and you see how quickly he was replaced by a pocket passer such as Mason Rudolph.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Thanks for the chats. Wanted to see your thoughts on what the Steelers may actually do next week in the draft? National talking heads seem to think they may move up into Rd 1 for a QB or take another QB (Hurts) in Rd 2. Both feel like a stretch to me. Do you think a JK Dobbins or KJ Hamler in Rd 2 is possible to give Ben and the offense more weapons? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First off, they aren't in any position to move into the first round -- none whatsoever. So that's not happening. And, if the Steelers think they can win now, which they do, they aren't going to draft a player who might sit for a year or two (Hurts). I don't think there is much question what the Steelers want to do with the first pick -- find someone to help their offense. Hamler is that type of player, but it won't be Hamler. He is not on their radar.</p>
<p><strong>Clibison Rapgoopski</strong>: Gerry, what would you say is the chance that the NFL season is played without fans in the stands this year - only televised, until the pandemic is put down and deemed safe to gather in crowds per the CDC ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Right now, I'd say there is a good chance. I also think there is a good chance there will be no preseason games. I think it will be like college football -- teams will get a 3- or 4-week period to train, condition and get ready for the regular season, with no games before then. At this point, I'd be surprised if it were any different.</p>
<p><strong>rick_kane</strong>: Hey Gerry! With the draft just a week away I see that Kiper and McShay have the Steelers taking a QB. Am I the only one that wonders how they come to their conclusions? Yes, the window is closing on Ben but with his return and a solid D they have to be in win now mode so a QB at 49 makes no sense. I know the mocks are for show but come on! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The only way they come to their conclusions is that they believe the Steelers are hedging their bets and protecting themselves in case Ben isn't going to be ready -- either this season or ever. And, right now, there is no evidence to support that he won't. I will say this: the Steelers were enamored with DeShaun Watson in 2017 and considered taking him. Of course, they didn't.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Gerry do you really have faith in our OT’s as we stand today based on some expiring contracts soon and most importantly “Performance” overall, I don’t honestly.. OT must be considered above anyone else @ 49 if value is there No Doubt! Agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Disagree. They doesn't help them score points.</p>
<p><strong>soggy</strong>: Hi Gerry, let's assume the Steelers decide to part ways with Ben after the 2020 season. How much of his 2021 $40,000,000 plus salary will they be on the hook for? Is it different if he retires? Thanks for the chats! Stay safe &amp; sane. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They aren't going to part ways with Ben, not if he's relatively healthy. But, even if they did, or he retired, they are still on the hook for the final year of his pro-rated signing bonus, which is $22.5 million. That was before he restructured his contract last month.</p>
<p><strong>Mike J.</strong>: What are the Steelers plans at DT? Trading for Wormley has to mean something right? Thanks Gerry! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, it means he will be a backup who can play both nose and DE.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Dr. Fauci suggests leagues play all their games at one site. Where would you like to be stuck and where would that likely be? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'd like to be stuck in Arizona</p>
<p><strong>Sean</strong>: I think the Steelers are unlikely to target a specific position at 49 and are more likely to trade down or go BPA based upon who has fallen. Safe assumption? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hi Gerry...do you know who will be presenting Troy for the HOF? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He has not said yet. If it isn't a family member, I'm guessing either Ike Taylor, Dick LeBeau or Ryan Clark.</p>
<p><strong>CarolinaBob</strong>: In my opinion, the Steelers need a dominant and dependable running back more than anything else at this time. A strong running game opens up the passing game and helps to keep the opposing high octane quarterbacks from being on the field. Everyone knows this. The backs that the steelers have now, while solid, are not elite. If Jonathan Taylor is available and the Steelers pass on him, I will be very dissappointed. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not disagreeing with you at all, Carolina man</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: Go for the Sure thing if going WR (1st Pick) that is Claypool if there.. very complete WR for years to come.. don’t risk it with boom or bust.. grab the Sure thing.. tell the FO Please! Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: My thoughts on Claypool or telling the front office?</p>
<p><strong>Dugan</strong>: I think a position that is being neglected in draft conversations is DT. Would someone like Gallimore from Oklahoma be of an interest to the Steelers at 49? I feel that inside presence is vitally important to the success of both Watt and Dupree. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The position might not be ignored, but it won't be addressed at 49. They need offense, not defense, right now.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Medium Chest</strong>: Is Justin Layne in witness protection? 3rd round pick I never hear mentioned <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: How and why do you want him mentioned? There are no practices, no workouts, and won't be until the summer, at best. Maybe then you will hear about him.</p>
<p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: HI Gerry, read a good piece in the Wash Post about Dr. Bennet Omalu. Had no idea he was such embellisher/con artist type. That's not to discount the NFL's bad faith denial of CTE. Was the local Pitt media on to this guy a lot sooner than the rest of us? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It was an outstanding piece, a must-read for the CTE conspiracy theorists out there. I am in the process of talking with several doctors/neurologists about a followup. Dr. Omalu did bring a lot of much-needed attention to the concussion problem in the NFL and his quest eventually resulted in better monitoring, testing and league guidelines. There is no question about that. But, according to the story in which more than 50 of the top researchers in the world were interviewed, he took his findings too far and made too many assumptions about CTE.</p>
<p><strong>Clibison Rapgoopski</strong>: Gerry, look into your crystal ball - who will be the most successful QB in the AFC North in 2025 ? Burrow, Jackson, Mayfield, TBD Steeler ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 2025? I have a hard time predicting what will happen in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>JB</strong>: I believe we have to address the offensive line first and get back to smash mouth Steeler football. Follow that up with inside linebacker as we are only an injury away from being in a bad situation. Vince is another year older and is a liability in pass coverage. Your Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't dispute your areas of concern, but not immediately.</p>
<p><strong>chuck Mac</strong>: Can you envision playing games in empty stadiums his fall? More likely to delay the season? more likely to have fans in the stands with masks and some modified way to socially distance if that is even possible? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As of right now, I can definitely see games being played without fans. So many people stream and watch on television anyway.</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: Hello from Steeler Country Midwest region! I see the Steelers as a team that CAN win it all this year with BB coming back to typical form. JuJu and Conners along with OL has to step up though. Agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, those are a lot of what-if scenarios, but it is a very good possbility if No. 7 can return and be close to his normal self. If there is something good to come from a delayed start to the season, it's that it will give BR's elbow more time to get healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Clibison Rapgoopski</strong>: Thank you for providing this chat Mr Dulac, as the game has evolved to a more finesse-type passing attack, do the Steelers still value physical, smash mouth type athletes on offense or will they totally sell out to the passing game while #7 is still playing ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think the latter is more likely. He is your star player, your best player, so why build the offense around someone else? I wouldn't call it selling out. I call it orientating.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: My personal intuition is to go RB and then WR in the 2nd and 3rd especially if Jonathon Taylor is available and then a speedy WR. I am concerned about ILB and OL. Is there a logical compromise? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't have a problem with that draft order because the Steelers are interested in a playmaker, whether wide receiver or running back. And what's all the concern about the offensive line, as though they lost all their starters? They lost one guy, who everybody complained about anyway, and replaced him with a veteran NFL-starter. Trust me, the Steelers don't share the concern about the OL that you guys do.</p>
<p><strong>J</strong>: This may be too long for a chat, but I basically understand how comp picks are rewarded. But, how do they determine the order in the specific round? For example, why was Bell not the First Comp pick in the 3rd round? Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not exactly sure, but I do believe it's based on ther number of players lost versus the number of players a team signed. The Steelers counted just a plus-1 in that category, and the 1 was a big one. Maybe the teams in front of them counted a plus-2 or plus-3. Again, don't hold me to that without having time to research.</p>
<p><strong>Clibison Rapgoopski</strong>: Gerry, who is the veteran on the hot seat if the Steelers need to create cap space due to an injury or a FA that fits their scheme better ? Alejandro - Mccullers, maybe Pouncey ( because of his inciteful comments during CBA vote ) <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pouncey is untouchable, Villanueva would save $5 million and McCullers wouldn't save much at all ($1.5 million) to compensate for signing a dependable player. It's incredible to me that a player heading into his seventh season who averages slightly less than 7 tackles a season -- not a game, a season! -- is still part of an NFL team.</p>
<p><strong>SteelEternal99</strong>: Hi Gerry, what do you think the chances are of the Steelers getting a new deal with Cam &amp; Bud then taking the savings and putting them into getting TJ locked down right away. Or do you think they make him wait with the 5th year option and concentrate on Juju or James at a decent price? Also, I know the Steelers pushed back the Season Ticket Due Date, but what happens in your opinion if no fans can attend/// refund or push money to 2021? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are going to sign Cam Heyward, they will sign T.J. Watt, and they are not going to sign Bud Dupree to a long-term contract anytime soon, if ever. As for your question about tickets, I would assume the team would push any down payment into 2021 if there are no games (or fans) this season.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Gerry, do you think any of the XFL players signed by the Steelers have a legitimate chance of making the team? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not really.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: Any chance Chickillo or Barron return to Pittsburgh on a lesser contract? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: hello Gerry: any chance the Steelers make a play for Leshon McCoy? This could be a helpful move at a good price, depending on the market. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That's about the last thing they would do. They've already wasted enough good money on free agents who are habitually injured and didn't last a year -- Jon Bostic, Morgan Burnett, Mark Barron. Don't do it again. I like Shady, always have, but it wouldn't be a good move.</p>
<p><strong>buckeye black and gold</strong>: Hello Gerry, what are your thoughts about the steelers picking up shady? I know hes on the downside of 30 but he may be the vertran back we need for the youngsters. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: See above answer</p>
<p><strong>Ike</strong>: If the Steelers draft a back in round 2, should the expectation still be Conner as the clear 1 unless he suffers an injury? We know the coach has not been into the committee situations. Love your insights! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: One thing that has changed over the years -- the Steelers don't use a top pick on players who won't play immediately. If it's Jonathan Taylor or Cam Akers or whomever, they will find a way to use them.</p>
<p><strong>MJ Khan</strong>: I really think they need to strengthen the D. They are good but very thin, especially at LB. I'd draft the best LB available whether inside or out. preferably a bigger LB who can stuff the run and cover the TE's. They seemed vulnerable in these areas the past few years. I was at the Jacksonville playoff game and was astounded on how the D got pushed around. I'd go DT in round 3 and finish the draft with mainly O picks. They'll all be for depth anyway. Ben is the key to the O. If he's back everyone will look better. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I hate to tell you, I stopped reading your questions after the very first sentence. Really?</p>
<p><strong>George in OKC</strong>: Why do you think fans and even colleagues get so upset about Big Dan being on the roster? I get it. He doesn’t do very much if any thing. The guy was a 6th round pick that managed to stick around this long. How many D tackles have been cut since he was drafted that went on to be starters? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's not so much that, it's that NFL teams rarely give a guy more than three seasons to develop before they move on and find another player who might develop in three seasons. That's why it's so puzzling. Big Dan is never going to be more than what he is.</p>
<p><strong>Ginelle</strong>: Hey Gerry, if a running back is taken at #49, do you think Steelers may trade Conner to move up in the draft? Thank you. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hey, something like that is always a possibility, but I'm not counting on it.</p>
<p><strong>fLORIDA STEELERS</strong>: Gerry, Do you think Ebron is the real deal? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think he was a good pickup and a good addition, but I'd like to see him catch the ball more frequently. He has an issue with drops.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Any concerns that you've heard about Reagor's demeanor off the field? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I haven't, but it doesn't mean they might not have some. On the field, I like him. I'd take him right now at 49 if he's there.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Any additional prospects you've heard that have had virtual visits with the team? Saw Cal LB Evan Weaver spoke with them. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I have not</p>
<p><strong>George in OKC</strong>: Johnathan Taylor or Jaylen Reagor are both sitting at 49, who would you pick and who do you think the Steelers would go with. Personally, I’d be very happy with either one! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree. I could see them going either way. The concern with Taylor is his 900+ plus carries for three seasons at Wisconsin, but I'm not sure the Steelers share that concern.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: Hello Jerry -- it seems to me that our o tackles are more geared toward pass protection than run blocking. Given the new commitment to the run, and the shortness of Ben's window, what type would we draft ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are built to protect Ben, and understandably so. And now, when he comes back, more so than ever. But, uh....what new commitment to the run.</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: Any updates on Ben and his progress? With the quarantine I feel like it's going to make it harder for him to work out, throw to people, etc. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is going through his medical rehab and is allowed to throw as part of that process. But I don't think he is at the point where he is throwing pass over the middle or down the field to other people anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Any interest you've gleaned in WR Michael Pittman and/or Tee Higgins? Or is the team more focused on speed ala Reagor? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Michael Pittman is on their radar, and should be. Reagor is what they need -- a playmaker.</p>
<p><strong>Augusta Steeler</strong>: Hello Jerry. Looking forward to the draft next week. Is there a chance a guy gets picked that no one has mentioned to date ? A deep Sleeper. Playing golf next week in Athens at the UGA course and the Georgia Club. Have you played at all this year ? Thanks for the chat as always. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, that is always possible (witness Terrell Edmunds), but I think it will be a WR or RB you are aware of. I have played golf just once. Have already had three trips and two more upcoming that were golf-related that were cancelled.</p>
<p><strong>Fl Matt</strong>: Do you think when teams are planning/anticipating who others may draft, they refer to beat writers such as yourself? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Lord I hope not.</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: With all things being equal and the steelers are going to take the best player on the board at #49, what do you feel the prioritization by position that should be in place here? RB if one of the big 4 are present? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: RB or WR, or WR or RB. Take your pick</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: If we get our November Masters, does this hiatus benefit anyone in particular? Maybe let's Tiger get additional rest? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, that will help him because he's been struggling with his back, but it doesn't give any player an advantage over another.</p>
<p><strong>Augusta Steeler</strong>: Golfing is good in Arizona. Getting stuck would not suck. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Wondering why Hamler isn’t on their radar in round 2? He seems to fit exactly what the team needs. That over-the-top speed to help open up the field. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree. He is the type of player they need because of his style, a home-run hitter. But there must be some reservations.</p>
<p><strong>Brett</strong>: Hi Gerry. O Line seems good for this season, but any concern that AV, Pouncey, DeCastro will all be gone after 2021 (contracts all end and over 30)? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they'll re-sign two of those guys. Al might lose out. Can't re-sign everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Tprod</strong>: Gerry, will the Steelers pay JuJu 15-20 million as a NO 1 receiver after this season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think this season, if Ben is back, will speak to that. Depending on who they take with their top pick in the draft could speak to that. But it is their intent, as of right now, to re-sign him, but for how much will depend on what he does.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: If Reagor and Claypool are available at 49, do you see a scenario where Claypool would be the pick? Seems like the prototypical WR that Ben likes to have. Big frame/red zone weapon. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sure. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, that's all the extra time we have today. Thanx for the questions. See you next week.</p>
