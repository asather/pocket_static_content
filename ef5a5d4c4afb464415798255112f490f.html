<h1>TV Q&amp;A: Is there any hope for a ‘Mindhunter’ revival?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions online every Friday in Tuned In Journal blog at <a href="/post-gazette.com/tv" target="_blank">post-gazette.com/tv</a>. Here’s a selection of recent queries.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: I still have to believe they will eventually make another season of “Mindhunter.” My heart won’t allow anything else. Is there any reason to hope?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—JOHN, VIA TWITTER</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> I hope so, too, but I also have to be realistic: If director/executive producer David Fincher has lost interest, it seems unlikely the show will continue, but it’s not impossible.</p>
<p>Fincher owns a piece of “Mindhunter,” so any continuation would require his blessing. And perhaps in a few years Fincher will decide he wants to return to it. The series hops through the years so if the actors are older, that’s not such a big deal; odds are there would be a time jump between the second and third season anyway.</p>
<p>Even if “Mindhunter” does get activated for a third season, I wonder if it would return to Pittsburgh to film. Each season so far has taken the better part of a year for a small number of episodes due at least in part to Fincher’s exactitude — he shoots more takes of a scene than most directors.</p>
<p>And then there’s this: Deadline.com reported, “There has been chatter that Fincher was not particularly thrilled to do another lengthy location shoot (‘Mindhunter’ films in Pittsburgh) and was looking to raise the series’ production value with a bigger budget.”</p>
<p>The good news is “Mindhunter” has a relatively small primary cast, which would make getting schedules to work out easier than if it was a sprawling ensemble. And yet, realistically, I'm not sure there’s a lot of reason to hold out hope. David Fincher, please prove me wrong.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Where was Hallmark’s Channel’s “A Beautiful Place to Die: A Martha’s Vineyard Mystery” filmed? Are all the Hallmark movies filmed in Canada?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—ELAINE, MT. LEBANON</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Once upon a time Hallmark Channel did film pretty much all their movies in Canada. That’s no longer the case, but Hallmark does still film many movies in Canada.</p>
<p>“A Beautiful Place to Die” shot in September in Vancouver and Victoria, British Columbia.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the status of “Evil” on CBS? Is it catching on with viewers?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—ANTHONY, VIA E-MAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> We reported in October that CBS renewed “Evil” for a second season. Ratings have been so-so but stable and the show gets good marks from critics, including landing on Top 10 best-of 2019 lists.</p>
<p>The first season wrapped last month at the conclusion of its first 13 episodes.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I was looking but didn't find a way to submit an idea for the “Survivor” show. Is there somewhere I can do that? I think I have a pretty good idea for a season.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thanks for any help,</strong></p>
<p><strong>—OLIVIA, VIA E-MAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Alas, the people who make TV shows actively do not want viewers’ ideas for fear that they might get sued if they hear an idea but had already come up with the same idea independently. You can always write to CBS, but my guess is it would go in the circular file.</p>
<p>“Survivor” returns for its 40th season at 8 p.m. Wednesday.</p>
