There was a legitimate star, an unproven youngster, a veteran reinforcement and a prototypical slot receiver, all expected to play at least some role in a wide-open offense.</p><p>By the end of his rookie season, Johnson had spent the past three months being utilized more than any of them.</p><p>“I feel like I fit in perfect,” said the 10th wide receiver taken in the 2019 draft. “The offense that we run, the coaches, I’m comfortable around them. … I wasn't expecting to be in this position this early, but opportunities come around and it’s just what you do with them. And I took advantage of it.”</p><p>Johnson would've rather been preparing for the first playoff action of his NFL career Monday, but instead, he was assessing his first year of pro football. One year after ending his final college season in the Bahamas Bowl, he was wrapping up his rookie campaign on a soggy field in Baltimore, fresh out of chances to break away from cornerbacks or make would-be tackles miss.</p><p>But Johnson did plenty of that in a promising Year 1, an experience that was as much about potential as production. He paced all NFL rookies with 59 receptions, 15 more than James Washington to lead the Steelers, who never did get much out of JuJu Smith-Schuster, Donte Moncrief or Ryan Switzer. But Johnson finished outside the top five newcomers in yardage (680) and touchdowns (5) while his five fumbles were tied for the second most among all non-quarterbacks in the NFL.</p><p>“He has been explosive at times. He has been pretty reliable at the catch point. He needs to continue to work on his ball security,” offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said last week. “This league is nasty when it comes to always playing to the whistle and trying to force that ball.”</p><p>One of the concerns about Johnson coming out of Toledo early was his size, and one of the first issues he ran into with the Steelers was his durability. Adding muscle this offseason can help with his play strength, with or without the ball, as well as staying healthy through another 16-game season (he and Johnny Holton were the only Steelers receivers to play all 16 games this year, and Johnson led every skill-position player in snaps outside of tight end Vance McDonald).</p><p>Johnson is listed on the roster at 5-feet-10, 183 pounds, but according to him, he ended the season right around 178. Tweaking his frame will be something of a risky process between now and OTAs, as he tries to find the right balance between putting on weight that can help him functionally without slowing him down.</p><p>“I’m not worried about getting too big. I’m <em>not</em> going to get too big,” Johnson said. “I'm just going to try to add as much weight as I can, see if I can maintain it or I can't.</p><p>“It wouldn't hurt to bulk up a little bit. That would just make my game better, make me tougher to guard and whatnot, but that's something I'm going to focus on this offseason.”</p><p>Slippery off the line of scrimmage, Johnson already was hard to guard. Per NFL Next Gen Stats, he led all NFL receivers with an average of 3.6 yards of separation on his routes. He was just as impressive with the ball in his hands, finishing second on the team with 10 broken tackles, behind only James Conner.</p><p>According to Pro Football Focus, Johnson entered Week 16 with more missed tackles forced (16) than any other rookie wideout. Stats like that back up Fichtner’s evaluation that “there is no limit to where he can go.”</p><p>“He is a special talent,” Fichtner said. “He can win some one-on-ones against some good football players. He has a knack for run after [the catch]. The future for him is very bright, and I think he knows that, and I think that we have to continue to grow that.”</p><p>That means more plays like the one that is Johnson’s personal favorite so far.</p><p>It wasn't his first pro touchdown — that came Week 3 at San Francisco — but four games later, on Monday Night Football, when Johnson made his way into the highlight reel. With the Steelers facing third-and-20 with just 26 seconds left in the first half at the Miami 45, Dolphins coach Brian Flores sent a zero-blitz. That means just one safety deep, and easy work for Johnson against a cornerback playing off coverage.</p><p>“I caught a slant and took it to the end zone,” Johnson recalled.</p><p>That flipped the momentum for the Steelers en route to their 27-14 win at Heinz Field and bolstered Johnson’s career-best game of five catches for 84 yards and a score.</p><p>He hasn't hit the century mark in a game yet, but if his ceiling is as high as it looked at times in 2019, it shouldn't take long in 2020 for him to get there. Especially if Ben Roethlisberger returns to form and this offense looks like it once did.</p><p>“We’ve got the right pieces. … Next year we’re going to come back even better,” Johnson said. “There’s nothing we need to be worried about. We’ve just got to focus on next year.”</p><p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://my.post-gazette.com/purchase/?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=steelers" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2018/08/06/steelers-subscribe-banner-2" alt="Go to section"> </a></p><p><em>Brian Batko: bbatko@post-gazette.com and Twitter @BrianBatko.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/03/diontae-johnson-rookie-season-2019-2020-steelers-wide-receivers/stories/202001030072</original_url>
