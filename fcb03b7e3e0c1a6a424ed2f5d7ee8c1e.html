<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 03.18.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, I’m sure we will have record numbers today because y’all house-bound, so we will start our chat shortly. Go wash your hands.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, let’s get started.....</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Gerry...do you think they would have signed Derek Watt if he wasn’t related to TJ? A weird way to spend the limited amount of money they have. Could it partially be a ploy to get TJ to take a discount? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No ploy at all. And there will be no discount</p>
<p><strong>Thomas</strong>: When can we expect to see Cam Heyward contract extension? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Soon</p>
<p><strong>Harrisburger</strong>: With all the restructuring, especially Ben’s, it seems the Steelers are kicking some big salary problems down the road. Any thoughts on the long-term impact? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They do that all the time, though this year it has been more extreme. Part of the thinking I’m sure is the notion that the salary cap will jump even higher next year. All it is is housekeeping</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Ron Cooks article was spot on. I still don’t understand tagging Dupree. I would rather look to fill one hole (OLB) versus now 3-4 (ILB, TE, RB, WR). Reminds me a little of the Pirates...if everything goes right...no injuries, awesome draft, better defense, better offense with Ben back to normal then we have a shot at finishing above .500. Oh and everyone else in the division has to get worse. sound familiar? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I disagree with him and you.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hey Gerry. Now that FA has started let the fun begin!!! Of all the QB movement yesterday which one was most surprising to you. And are you ready for an increase in JJ Watt to the Steelers talk along with the Jameis Winston talk that already started??? lol <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I was probably a little surprised that Marcus Mariota went to the Raiders. I thought he would go where it was all but guaranteed he would be the starter. I don’t pay attention to that talk. I only pay attention to the truth.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: With Finney and Foster both gone does this increase the likely hood that we draft an interior lineman in the draft or do you believe we have what we need in house? Or do we go the FA route??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think you will see them look to free agency first, for sure. In fact, they already are perusing.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Things can change and not all players signed work out but the Steeler’s have lost a lot of ground to other teams in their division. Assuming Ben can pick up where he left off before injury is a big if. Salary cap hit is going to take its toll on the Steeler’s. Even with Ben and elite talent last 8 years have not brought any runs in the playoffs. We are going to be better with lesser talent?? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t consider the loss of Foster, Barron, Chickillo, Finney and soon to be Nix a drain on their talent. Losing Hargrave will hurt, but not as if they lost Cam or Tuitt. He’s only the third best lineman on the team. Plus, in case anyone missed it, his number went DOWN last year despite more snaps than ever. This is like losing Steve McLendon. Don’t get me wrong, I like Hargrave and it would have good if they had been able to keep him, but it’s not going to impact whetheer they can win the division or not. Plus, paying him on top of Cam and Tuitt is not the reality of the NFL. So I suggest everyone relax about Hargrave....and was their hands.</p>

<p><strong>Guest</strong>: We need OL the most, at any position! Agreed? Our offense lost the games last year. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They need playmakers on offense more than anything else. Guards are nothing more than converted tackles, unless you’re DeCastro or Quentin Nelson. Get those anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>Justin</strong>: I’m sure Watt is a great fullback/special team player, but with such limited cap space I thought they would target more a position of need. Your thoughts on the signing? Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I have to admit, I was surprised. But, with the loss of Matakevich (special teams) and the injury woes of Nix, I get the move for Watt, who can handle both roles. Still...</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Gerry, I am not a fan of the new CBA. I’m happy for the special teamers but I worry about the quality of play. The NFL already limits the amount of contact through camp and the season, and now they are limiting it even more in camp. How can a team practice blocking and tackling if you can’t hit? The preseason is probably more important now than ever because of the limitations in practice, but now they are taking a game away. How do you feel about it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no doubt the limiting of padded practice and live drills hurts the quality of play. That’s why you see such horrible tackling. I also think it contributes to more injuries. But that’s the world of today’s NFL.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: Morning Gerry, overthecap.com had Ben’s ‘21 cap hit at $31M before yesterday’s restructure. That restructure pushed another $20M into ‘21, leaving Ben’s cap hit at $51M for the ‘21 season. How in the world are the Steelers going to manage such a large number for one player? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, the $20 million they shaed off the cap was for the restructure of FIVE players, not just Ben.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: Why all the rumors to add Winston &amp; Hurts as Steelers QBs. We can use the next 2 years to determine RM’s growth before BB retires - then move accordingly! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I suggest you not pay attention to that stuff</p>
<p><strong>Claude Ballzac</strong>: i was just wondering if duck hodges is still on the team or if he has moved on to another duck pond. thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is still on the roster.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: With Finney gone does a G/C become a higher priority in the draft? In my opinion it’s the top need as this OL needs to get a lot younger. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think it becomes a higher priority in free agency more so than the draft. At least for now.</p>
<p><strong>VT61</strong>: Hi Gerry, can you update us on the current salary cap situation? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: All I can tell is Art Rooney II told me yesterday they will be in compliance with the cap at 4 p.m. today. They have to be.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers2020</strong>: Gerry, we all knew Javon Hargrave was going to leave. Any idea who the Steelers are targeting as his replacement? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Keep an eye on free agency.</p>
<p><strong>IowaSteel</strong>: Hey Gerry, love the chats and thanks for making them GREAT! With the COVID-19 situation going on, I worry my tickets I just received for the HOF enshrinement will not come to fruition? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I understand. Who knows how long this will last. I asked Art Rooney II yesterday if training camp is in jeopardy and he said way too early to tell but, obviously, he hopes not.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio</strong>: Aren’t the Steelers always a worse team than last season in the period between free agency start and the NFL draft? What was news in that PG article? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not sure I follow...</p>
<p><strong>Zach</strong>: With the signing of Derek Watt, does this mean we cut ties with Rosie Nix? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Uh, I’d take that to the bank.</p>
<p><strong>AZ</strong>: Watt FB, is he an upgrade or basically a wash? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe a wash, but, if he can stay on the field, that’s an upgrade from Nix, who couldn’t. He played in only three games for 34 snaps last season.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas</strong>: Keeping Vance, probably lose Vanett, does that make a future TE a high priority in the draft, say 2nd rd? What you think about the WR from Texas, Duvernay? Seems like a steelers kind of WR, maybe with the 102 pick? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, not now. Keeping McDonald means they are committed to him as their top TE. I still think they need a more productive second TE, but Kevin Colbert seemed to indicate they like Vannett (as do I) and that Zach Gentry keeps getting better. I’ll hold off on that before I would agree, but we’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>NC Steel</strong>: Gerry, What position should the team draft with their 2nd round pick--OL, DL or ILB? And what position do you think they will pick? Thanks. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Playmaker</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Where do you stand on folks who are criticizing the NFL for continuing with business as usual amid this Coronavirus pandemic? Do you believe they should have halted business operations??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. There would have been no harm to wait two more weeks. None. And because the draft is being done by phone, it could have been easily pushed back as well. But, I will say this, their business is certainly helping to keep people’s minds off the virus scare and that’s a good thing, no matter what people say. Perhaps I just contradicted myself...</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Everyone complained that when Nix went down the Steelers couldn’t run the ball and and pointed out how important the FB is, now that they’ve signed a good FB they complain that it wasn’t a “position of need?”. Do people just like to complain? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Bingo!! Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Do we have enough cap room to sign any veteran OL or DL. Someone like Andrew billings or A’Shawn Robinson? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will figure out something, trust me. But I’m not sure it will be someone like that.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Gerry is there legit reason to be panicked at these roster losses or is it the usual Yinzer overthinking and needless hysteria ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Why should anyone panic? Foster? Finney? Can find them anywhere. Chickillo? Matakevich? Dime a dozen. Hargrave’s loss will hurt because there is no quality depth behind him, but it will certainly not cripple the defense.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: Do you agree with Ron Cook’s column ? I don’t. Your thoguhts <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I didn’t read it. But, if it’s based on the premise I heard from an earlier question, no.</p>
<p><strong>Mike92</strong>: Do you know if the Steelers attempted at all to bring back Finney? His new 4 million per is not much more than what the Steelers were paying him as a backup a year ago. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It was one of those cases where they weren’t going to stand in his way if he got a better deal but to check back just in case they would think about matching. You saw what they chose.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Of the “Playmakers” expected to be there when the Steelers select at 49, who is your personal favorite? Mine is Reagor and I only say that because I love Taylor but I don’t think he will be there... And no you didn’t contradict yourself. lol <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree with that. If Reagor is there....boom...I take him</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Are the Steelers forced to move fieler to guard and start chuks at tackle since they lost finney? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They’re not forced to do that, but I think that’s what will happen if they don’t sign a starter-capable guard in free agency. Above all else, the Steelers build their offensive line to protect Ben, so there will be something of a priority to make sure that position is addressed properly.</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Under the new CBA, when does the changes to training camp occur( acclimation period 16 padded practices)? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I have to check on that one...sorry</p>
<p><strong>PdxJaxon</strong>: Gerry - any possibility to trade paxton lynch for another mid round pick and just keep the Duck as our 3rd stringer? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Mid-round pick?? Nobody wanted him when he was a free agent.</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: What do you think the Front Office thinking was about signing Derek? Does he offer something Nix doesn’t, a sign of a renewed commitment to the run, etc.? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they saw dependability, desire and a two-role guy. But $3.25 million per year average?</p>
<p><strong>Jon</strong>: How are teams checking the medicals on free agents? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Players are being checked by their team doctors or independent doctors in their town and that information is being shared with every team in the league. Free agents are not allowed to travel to a team’s facility for a physical or visit.</p>
<p><strong>RD</strong>: Losing Finney a significant loss? Especially given he was the best backup on the roster for center? Not to mention guard? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Tough to call a backup a significant loss. Does it hurt the depth? Yes. But don’t start ripping up your playoff tickets because he left</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: Does Shazier count against the cap at all? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. That’s why they put him on the reserve/retired list -- so they can pay him a salary that doesn’t count against the cap.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: Good afternoon Gerry Any contract restructures coming today like Tuitt decastro pouncey <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think that is a safe assumption.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: From sunny Fla via cranberry. In your opinion do you think Ben will be ready by Aug. it’s not like he a baseball pitcher and grows 95 mph fastballs 70% of the time. I think will compete for div title. Ron cook is a Wacko,defense alone makes them competitive. Thanks for your opinion, <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: First of all, don’t rub it in. I can’t tell you for sure that Ben will be ready bu August. All I can tell you is that I was told the other day that Ben is doing very well, which means he is on schedule to return hopefully for the regular-season opener. That was the stated goal given by Kevin Colbert</p>
<p><strong>Rocky B</strong>: do you think the steelers are really that committed to Rudolph, or just trying to keep his confidence up? are they seeing something in practice or in the locker room that was not evident in the games? I’d really like them to sign a former starter as backup (Dalton, Flacco, Winston) just in case Ben gets hurt. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes I do, and I think it is unfair for people to criticize a player who had never played in or started an NFL record and, with the exception of one game in Cleveland and a quarter in Cincinnati, was pretty good, all things being considered. And, they are not is financial position to sign any of those QBs you mentioned.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: what year is the salary cap supposed increase significantly? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 2021</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Do you expect the Steelers to follow the same schedule for Ben this year in training camp. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think he will be even much more limited.</p>
<p><strong>Jon</strong>: Should we expect anymore moves today or are we mostly done? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I was told by AR2 there will be more moves in some form.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: if all those mentioned are easily found then why didn’t we sign them? Old saying in any job is that your always worth a little more somewhere else apply here? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Cause you find players like there anywhere. You act as though they just lost Pouncey, DeCastro and Heyward.</p>
<p><strong>Colts Corral</strong>: So would they consider permanently moving camp from St Vincent starting this year because of Corona and going forward because it’s inconvenient for the team and fans ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good question, but I think if the all-clear is given by July they will go to Saint Vincent. But I’m not going to bet the house on it just yet.</p>
<p><strong>BigAL757</strong>: Jerry, thanks for the chats. Do you think that the Steelers will have any interest in pursuing Andrew Billings as a stopgap solution at NT? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s all he would be -- a stopgap. But, unless they think Isaiah Buggs is on the fast rise, they will need someone. Tyson Alualu will be 33 and Dan McCullers should be on the way out too.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Pitt</strong>: Obvious to me that the offense needs a big time play maker. Brady made a career throwing to small quick backs; just check out their work against the Steelers. Also, JJ doesn’t seem to be able to cut it as a #1. My solution is K J Hamler...he is a human joy stick. He runs better in tight spaces than any one I’ve seen and is a TD threat every time he touches the ball whether it’s passes, sweeps or punt returns. He makes everybody else on the O that much better. Switzer just doesn’t cut it. If available: Hamler or Claypool? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m not saying it should or will be Hamler, but someone like him. They need someone who can make plays, whether catching or running jet sweeps (reverses), someone who can score touchdowns. Do I need to remind anyone that the Steelers were the only NFL team not to score 30 points in any one game last season???? You can nit-pick position help all you want; the reality is they need playmakers on offense to score touchdowns. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio</strong>: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Ron Cook: Steelers are worse now than they were at season’s end</span><br> This article <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Thanks for the headline E. Wrong. Ben should be back, Tuitt will be back, JuJu will be healthy, Conner should be healthy and almost has to be better than he was in 2019. That was the state at season’s end. And, in case people have forgotten, they ended their season with three consecutive losses. So....no.</p>
<p><strong>Rocky B</strong>: what are your odds The Masters will be played this year? Jack thinks it won’t <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Tough to say. I think they will still play, tho it won’t shock me if they don’t. I don’t think they will play it in the fall. If that’s the only solution, I agree with Jack.</p>
<p><strong>jacks5859</strong>: Love Your Chats,keep up the good work and don’t believe the bs everyone says <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Believe? Sometimes I don’t even read. Thanx</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Is bell coming back to the steelers <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m guessing that’s not the case. Be careful what you read.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Given the Steelers just signed TJ’s brother, there is no way Rosie Nix stays on the team, right? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That would be correct <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: One additional point about McCullers: He averages slightly more than 100 snaps per season in his six seasons with the Steelers. Yet he averages slightly less than 7 tackles PER SEASON. How he manages to stick around this long amazes me.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: Why is Switzer still occupying a roster spot? He is definitely not the playmaker they need <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That doesn’t he will be in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><strong>AZ</strong>: DL by FA or draft? Regarding the loss of Hargrave <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think that should be the first defensive position they address in the draft, wherever that is. Keep in mind, though, they are now down three linebackers.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Do you think we missed on signing Finney to a multi-year deal last year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Maybe.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Is Watt and upgrade over Nix as a FB? (blocker and pass receiver)? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: We’ll find out. Nix was a good blocker when he was able to be on the field.</p>
<p><strong>Rocky B</strong>: i am a little surprised they’re sticking with mcdonald. injury prone and unreliable hands do not make up for his blocking and high salary. agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I get your point, but they think McDonald is a high-quality NFL tight end who can make plays. And I agree.</p>
<p><strong>Joe in Orlando</strong>: Hell maybe O’Brien trades JJ to us for a 4th round pick and we have all 3! Lol <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hey, after that trade for Hopkins..... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we’re out of time. Stay well and don’t forget -- wash your hands.</p>
