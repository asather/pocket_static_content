<h1>Schools seek ways to minimize COVID-19 learning loss</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Educators have been concerned for years about student learning loss during extended periods without school, such as summer break.</p>
<p>While experts say research is inconclusive about how much learning is set back during those times — and varies between subject, grade levels and along socio-economic lines —&nbsp;there is little doubt that it has some impact student achievement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>With some schools closed for a month or more because of the COVID-19 pandemic, educators are turning their focus toward how they can reduce losses from what Pittsburgh Public Schools Superintendent Anthony Hamlet called the&nbsp;“second-semester slide.”</p>
<p>“What’s on all of our minds right now is the drastic learning loss that we know is going to happen,” Mr. Hamlet said last week during a video conference. “Yes, we’re going to have some drastic learning loss, but what are we doing to minimize those and mitigate those as best we can?”</p>
<p>The Northwest Evaluation Association, a Portland, Ore.-based education research organization, said it is difficult to predict how missing months of school could impact student achievement. But it said previous research on seasonal learning and summer learning loss can help.</p>
<p>“Seasonal learning research allows researchers to&nbsp;compare student learning patterns when school is in&nbsp;versus out of session,” NWEA researchers Megan Kuhfeld and Beth Tarasawa said in a report published this month.&nbsp;“While there is some controversy&nbsp;about the magnitude of summer learning loss, three&nbsp;trends are consistent across seasonal learning research&nbsp;findings: achievement typically slows or declines over&nbsp;the summer months, declines tend to be steeper for&nbsp;math than for reading, and the extent (proportionally)&nbsp;of loss increases in the upper grades.”</p>
<p>The researchers estimated COVID-19-related learning loss by using data from a group of 5 million third through eighth graders who took assessment tests in 2017-18. The research compared what student achievement would be if learning growth continued at the same rate as when schools closed to what it would be if learning loss was typical of a summer slide. For their purposes, the researchers used March 15 as the last day of school.</p>
<p>Preliminary COVID-19 slide estimates, according to the report, suggest students would return in fall 2020 with&nbsp;70% of the learning&nbsp;gains in reading and less than&nbsp;50% of the learning gains — and nearly a year behind in some grades&nbsp;—&nbsp;compared to a regular school year.</p>
<p>The researchers, however, cautioned that the projections do not account for the remote instruction being instituted by many school across the country, which could help offset some of the losses. The state Department of Education has required all schools in Pennsylvania to continue classes with remote instruction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools began remote instruction last week for seniors and continue to initiate it for other grades this week, but Mr. Hamlet said he remained worried about the time students have already missed.</p>
<p>He said the district was looking into expanding summer programs, including the Summer Dreamers Academy learning camp, as well as finding funding for after-school enrichment and academic programs in the fall.</p>
<p>An option like holding students back a year because of the amount of time they missed is unlikely in Pennsylvania because the state said schools must provide a pathway for students to be promoted to the next grade or graduate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Linda Hippert, an assistant professor in Point Park University’s School of Education, said it is important to remember that&nbsp;“grades are merely structures for some type of organization of our students.”&nbsp;Instead, teachers should focus on what content and standards students should know by certain age or grade so that they are ready to learn what comes next.</p>
<p>She said she believes teachers are equipped to handle the responsibility of evaluating their students.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think teachers will look at what it is a student needs at this level, or that they should have had in the previous level,” Ms. Hippert said. “How much did they retain, and what do I need to reteach as the students are back in my classroom for the beginning of the new year?”</p>
<p>Before students and teachers get back into the classroom, they must navigate the world of remote instruction, which for many means cyber schooling.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Transitioning from a brick-and-mortar school to a cyber school creates challenges in terms of equity,&nbsp; engagement and quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, Cindy Walker, dean of the Duquesne University School of Education, said the transition may also provide an opportunity to make learning more interesting for students.</p>
<p>“When we’re teaching student teachers, we always talk about project-based learning and individualized instruction for students, and this could be the opportunity for teachers to be able to do that,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“So instead of thinking about having to fill every minute of every class period with something for the kids to do — be it a worksheet or rereading or whatever — this could be a time where instead teachers have student work on projects and things that they’re really interested in learning and using the internet as a resource.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
