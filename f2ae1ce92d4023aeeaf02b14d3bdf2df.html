<h1>WPIAL baseball-softball realignment: Number of Class 6A teams shrinks considerably </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WPIAL Class 6A baseball and softball will still have some strong teams in the future. But there will be nowhere near as many teams overall in the classification.</p>
<p>The WPIAL board of directors met Monday afternoon and released baseball and softball section alignments for the next two years. The biggest change is in the number of teams in Class 6A. Both sports lost about one-third of their teams.</p>
<p>For the next two years, WPIAL Class 6A baseball will have only 12 teams, compared to 19 this year and in 2019. Meanwhile, WPIAL softball will have only 11 teams, compared to 16 the past two years.</p>
<p>The PIAA realigns sports classifications for all sports every two years, and a school’s enrollment determines its classification.</p>
<p>“The big schools are just decreasing for us and it makes it harder to provide valuable section games for those teams because of the limited amount of schools,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>In WPIAL baseball, six teams that were Class 6A will be in 5A next season. They are Latrobe, Penn-Trafford, Plum, Bethel Park, Connellsville and Peters Township. Brashear, a City League team that competed in the WPIAL for baseball, decided it will no longer play in the WPIAL.</p>
<p>Some of the teams dropping to Class 5A have strong programs. Penn-Trafford played in the WPIAL championship a year ago. Bethel Park was a Class 6A semifinalist last season and was expected to have one of the best teams this year, but the COVID-19 pandemic canceled the season. The addition of the teams from 6A will make 5A extremely competitive.</p>
<p>In softball, Fox Chapel, North Hills and Upper St. Clair all dropped to Class 5A. City League members Allderdice and Brashear, which played in 6A last year, also decided not to compete in the WPIAL next year.</p>
<p>In a few other notable baseball moves, California, a WPIAL Class 1A finalist last season, moved up to Class 2A. Laurel Highlands, a WPIAL finalist in Class 5A, dropped to 4A.</p>
<p>Here are the new sections for WPIAL baseball and softball.</p>
