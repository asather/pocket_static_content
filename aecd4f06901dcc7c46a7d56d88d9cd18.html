<h1>Fishing Report: Steelhead move on Walnut Creek, fish more active in cooling water</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Steelhead circling off tributaries were caught from shore by “surf zone” anglers using spinning and fly gear. Little Precious was the go-to fly. Many trout succumbed to spinners off Trout Run, where a 6-pound brown was taken. At Elk Creek, few fish moved through small channels at the mouth. Carrying runoff water that washed over impervious asphalt, Walnut Creek ran high and dirty early this week, hosting the season’s first good steelhead run. Chromers were caught as far up Walnut as the stop sign hole. Filling more slowly with rainwater absorbed into undeveloped land, Twentymile Creek was dammed at the mouth with sand, pebbles and debris. Substantial rain is expected to blow open the blockage in coming weeks. Walleye anglers reported hookups at 70-75 feet. Good-sized panfish were still being caught in the bay.</p>
<p><strong>Shenango River</strong> (Mercer County) Heavy angler pressure was reported from the Pymatuning outflow to the Shenango Reservoir.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Armstrong County) The state Fish and Boat Commission will close the approach to the Freeport Access on Oct. 12-15 to repave the road and parking area.</p>
<p><strong>Kiskiminetas River, Crooked Creek</strong> (Armstrong County) Largemouth and smallmouth bass were taken in cooling waters.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Allegheny County) On a windy Wednesday, few fish were caught during Venture Outdoors’ TriAnglers fishing program on the North Shore. The best were channel catfish. John Force of McKees rocks released a 17-incher that went for a shiner, and Squirrel Hill fisherman Chet Stofman’s 16-inch cat took a worm. For the first time, Venture Outdoors will extend its TriAnglers season through October. The free program runs 11:30 a.m. through 1:30 p.m. Wednedays under the Clemente Bridge. Gear and bait provided, license requirements apply. Get details at 412-255-0564, <a href="https://www.ventureoutdoors.org/events/752028837/" target="_blank">ventureoutdoors.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Monongahela River</strong> (Washington County) Sizeable largemouth and smallmouths fed actively on baitfish in tributaries and creek mouths. Shore anglers reported a dwindling catfish bite.</p>
<p><strong>Dunlap Lake, Virgin Run Lake</strong> (Fayette County) Good catches of bluegills were reported.</p>
