<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 02.24.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What's up, folks? I'm currently in the car on the way to the combine in Indianapolis. Don't worry, I'm not driving. But if you're lucky, maybe I'll have Gerry Dulac weigh in for a celebrity answer to one of your questions. Here we go...</p>
<p><strong>John D</strong>: I have season tickets to the XFL LA Wildcats. I really like the way the XFL does their kickoffs and punt returns. It is way more exciting than the NFL and it seems a much safer way to protect the players. The PAT’s are interesting the way they offer 1 to 3 points. What are your thoughts on these XFL rules? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Wow, NFL combine is a few days away and we're talking XFL? To be honest, I haven't watched much. But I have seen the two rules you mention and the kickoff setup is interesting. I don't think it's a bad idea at all in an effort to minimize injury and maybe provide some big play excitement. As for the PAT rule, with no kicks, I don't hate it but I can't see the NFL ever changing to something that radical. Good luck to your 'Cats.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Brian, I saw a video of Ben throwing a football. Did he start with a tennis ball ? And he looked quite a bit overweight. As a indicator of things to come this is a positive utlook as I hope it is. Thanks for your chat. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It sounds like he was able to skip over the tennis ball portion of recovery, so yeah, that seems positive. And I actually thought he looked slimmer in that clip than he did when he was wearing puffy coats and who knows how many layers on the sideline during games.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Is there something specific that Steelers brass can point to, that Ben will fare against father time more like Brady and Brees than Manning and Rivers? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: According to some, it might just be the extra cushion.</p>
<p><strong>lamberto</strong>: will the steelers finally realize they need to find a big aggressive nose tackle who will clog up the middle and get a push into the offensive backfield, even if it's just a third of the time on the field <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Every team CAN use a guy like that, it's just a matter of what you're willing to spend on a part-time player. Although I will say this offseason seems like one where the Steelers should decide if they're actually going to use Dan McCullers in 2020. If not, just cut him and move on.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: What do you think about us getting Thaddeus Moss with our first pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think he'll be available at 49. The question is whether the Steelers would want him there. It's far too early to declare anyone a "winner" or "loser" at the combine, if you're into that, but the tight ends weighed in this morning and Moss stood out in a bad way. He measured shorter than 6-2 and weighed 250. Good luck finding a lot of starting-caliber NFL tight ends at that size.</p>
<p><strong>Ace</strong>: Hey Brian! I’ve noticed that draft analysts consistently mock an edge rusher to the Steelers at 49. Is it just me or are they completely neglecting the fact that Pitt is dead-set on bringing Dupree back? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hiya, Ace, love the name. I'm seeing a lot of that too, and some even more bizarre selections such as a cornerback in Round 2. Even Daniel Jeremiah, excellent scout/draft guru of NFL.com was asked about the Steelers on Friday and first mentioned edge rushers. Anyone projecting that is just not as aware of how much the Steelers want to keep Bud Dupree, is my guess.</p>
<p><strong>Tbone</strong>: Knowing the $5 mil in cap space he will create, and with Bush taking on an expanding role next season, does this make it all the more likely we cut ties with Barron? I really liked Gilbert III last year and stinks he got hurt, but I think he can have the opportunity to be the 3rd or 4th ILB in the mix. Should make it easier to move on from Barron if that is the case. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There are some positives to keeping Mark Barron, but there might be too much working against it. I don't know that the Steelers would factor in someone as young and unproven as Ulysees Gilbert into that conversation, but it will be a matter of deciding how much they can afford to spend on Barron. He was up and down last year, in my eyes, but overall something of a stabilizing presence on a defense that improved over the course of the season. Tough call there.</p>
<p><strong>DennyNevo</strong>: With a huge contract in TJ Watts future, could the Steelers be looking at locking up Bud Dupree for 1 year and then drafting a replacement in the 2nd round. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, I think they'll lock him up for one more year on the franchise tag, but might have too many other holes to fill to use their first pick on his eventual replacement. Assuming Ben is healthy, the window is still open now, so you can't plan for the future quite as much. Find someone who can and will help right away, tricky as that may be with your first pick at No. 49 overall.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Do the Steelers sign BJ Finney to a new contract? Your thoughts, <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Depends how much he wants to make and what the market is for him. The guess here is yes, but if that's the case, you might have to make him a starter to justify it.</p>
<p><strong>Marko</strong>: Is ILB Tyler Matakevich really worth bringing back? I get the ST’s value and all that, but could we count on others such as Ola Adeniyi or Tuzar Skipper to help fill that void? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'd say that's how it SHOULD work with role players, Marko. But if he'll play for cheap, they can maybe make it work. For whatever reason, Tuzar Skipper doesn't seem to be a guy they love using on special teams, at least not at this point. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK, quick pause on the chat while I grab a bite for lunch. Consider this an intermission. Be back shortly.</p>
<p><strong>I"m Hungry Too</strong>: Watcha having for lunch? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nothing special. Grabbed some apple slices, cheese and an uncrustable thing. Enough fuel to finish this chat, though.</p>
<p><strong>crazytalker</strong>: Tom Brady can't find anyone to sign him as a starter and he comes to Pittsburgh to back up Ben for one more Super Bowl run? We offer him great real estate deal at a price he cannot beat in New England. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And on the side he can help coach some WPIAL football.</p>
<p><strong>Carolina Steeler</strong>: No question. Just a shout out to you and your colleagues at the PG for the great job y’all do with these chats and your articles about the Steelers. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thank you, my friend.</p>
<p><strong>Alberto</strong>: Hello Brian. What do you think of Josh Rosen? I know a lot of people dislike him but he’s been with terrible OL. I would rather prefer the Steelers trading for him than drafting another qb. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think I feel bad for the guy. Hasn't really helped himself with his play, but as you said, less-than-ideal circumstances for him so far in his career. Not sure he'd want to come here and likely be a third-stringer though.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: Hi Brian, I know Steelers are great at creating cap space, but would you go after someone like Melvin Gordon or one of the TEs (Hooper or Hunter), or just look for upgrades in the draft instead? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: To me, RB is definitely a position you can and should upgrade in the draft. The TE market will be very interesting. From what I've read, it's more likely that Hunter Henry will be back with his original team. I'm just not sure the Steelers would be able to afford someone like Austin Hooper.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: Your best guess at who starts at TE for the Steelers in week one ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'll still say Vance McDonald unless the tea leaves start saying otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph LA</strong>: I was surprised when Matakevich was sometimes playing defensive snaps. Was he just a backup or were there situations when they wanted him in there? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He only played 16 defensive snaps last year, his lowest in his Steelers career. They don't want him for that.</p>
<p><strong>Timmy Colorado</strong>: Will the Steelers be on Hard Knocks this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I can't see why they wouldn't be, Timmy.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmy</strong>: Do you really think the current group of wr's are adequate ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They need to be with how much draft capital has been invested in them. Two 2s and a high 3. But this incoming draft class is supposedly so talented that maybe the Steelers will have a guy available to them and just can't say no.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I’m vacationing in Fla and get no news on Steelers. Is duck Hodges back to delivering Mail <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Be nice, Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>Watson</strong>: Will the Steelers draft a RB in the 3rd round or wait to the later rounds. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well Watson, they technically don't have a third round pick yet. But assuming they get one as a compensatory selection, I still think they'd be better off grabbing other positions. Tight end, OL, WR and maybe even a defensive depth spot or two is more of a need than RB to me.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: A lot of talk about the Steelers going WR in the second round due to depth. But do you really need Juju, Diontae, Washington and a second rounder? Or is the ship close to sailing on Washington? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I wouldn't say that about James Washington. He took a step forward last year. Not a leap, but a step. Needs to take another one in 2020 with only two years left on his rookie deal.</p>
<p><strong>Brian in CA</strong>: Hoping that Pitt improves through the draft, but they only have 1 pick in the first 100 and the other teams have 3 on average. Isn’t the rest of the league going to get a lot more help and Steelers will be at the bottom in this regard? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure, but the Steelers believe they have more help returning than a lot of those teams, too. Right now, in late February, I'd say I don't expect a ton of rookies to contribute to this team in 2020. Not as many as this past season.</p>
<p><strong>livinthedream</strong>: Brian, Very concerned the steelers are going to move in the wrong direction on D. With Heyward, Hargraves and Tuitt they have one of the best front seven and with TJ one of the best edge rushers. I think they would be better off signing Hargraves (under 10 mil) and start using their base package. Instead they are going top pay Bud apx 17 mil and allow their front to get weaker. This in a league that is moving back to power running. I vote for a real 3-4.......not a 2-4-5. What say you? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: So you'd rather spend maybe a little less on Javon Hargrave and let Bud Dupree walk? That's risky given the gap between how much those guys played on defense last year. I see your point on the trend of running games, though. But Bud is good against the run, too.</p>
<p><strong>Zeusdog</strong>: Hi Brian. How optimistic should we be about Big Ben skipping throwing a tennis ball and going right to the football? I seem to remember that Bradshaw rushed his recovery and we know how that went. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'm quite certain the medical team he's assembled wouldn't rush him past that step if they didn't think it was safe to do.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: Hi Brian, most of the talk surrounding Conner is that he won't be offered 2nd contract. However, if Conner has a great year (stays healthy, over 1000 rushing yards, Pro Bowler, etc.), does he get that 2nd contract? Or is he gone no matter what due to his injury history? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He'll still be gone, I think, to a bigger pay day than the Steelers would be willing to give him. That's often how it goes with running backs anymore because it's the financially prudent thing to do, unless you're in the elite of the elite like a Zeke Elliott or Todd Gurley, and even those deals aren't exactly looking great right now.</p>
<p><strong>double stuff</strong>: Looks like Ben has put down the Snickers bars and looked good throwing, so far. There may be a Super Bowl on the horizon after all!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: How do you know he likes Snickers?</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Will duck be on the roster at the beginning of camp ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As promised, I asked Gerry this one: "Depends on Ben's health. But no."</p>
<p><strong>Bats for Prez</strong>: A drive with Gerry, huh. What's the over under on the number of times he tell you - don't make me come back there! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey man, I'm in the passenger seat. Big upgrade for me with no Ray Fittipaldo on this trip.</p>
<p><strong>NC Steel</strong>: Brian, Did you see that brief video of Ben throwing the ball? No comment on his motion or technique, but his physique looks 20-25 lbs heavier than when he was injured. This cannot bode well for his recovery which must include regaining his mobility and agility and timing. Comments? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Again, I'm not too good at looking at someone and guessing their weight, especially on photo/video. Might want to ask one of those folks from Kennywood who will also guess your age.</p>
<p><strong>Chaz</strong>: Is ILB an under the radar area of need? After Bush they have Williams and Barron. They don't seem comfortable with Williams on the field in an every-down role, and it looks like Barron will be cut. For a team that plays 4 LB's, it seems they need another one. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It MIGHT be, if they really want to try to find another younger, hybrid type of every-down player to pair with Devin Bush. But they could also decide to tweak some things schematically and play more sub-package stuff, bringing in a dime linebacker kind of guy.</p>
<p><strong>Hi</strong>: Hi Brian, since Gerry is with you right now. He feels Steelers should draft RB as long as he's #1 every down back. What say you? Or do you think Steelers should draft RB even for depth purposes? Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I agree with Gerry that you definitely don't want to reach for one, and with the big names who elected to return to school, I'd be more willing to wait until next year anyway to find that true No. 1.</p>
<p><strong>John D</strong>: The XFL uses a Sky Judge and no coach’s challenges. At the LA game yesterday, the Sky Judge was used quite a bit. It is my opinion that this made the game move quicker and eliminated a lot of controversy having someone make the decisions at the stadium. Someone who is only focusing on the game at hand. Your thought on Sky Judges for the NFL? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: But don't you think there might be a conflict of interest between the Sky Judge and new Giants coach Joe Judge?<br> <br> And with that, I'll leave you all to the rest of your Monday afternoon. Time to eat my snacks that I put off until the end of the chat. Thanks for participating and be sure to follow our combine coverage all week on post-gazette.com.</p>
