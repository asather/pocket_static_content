<p>Two more Pittsburgh police officers and an academy recruit have tested positive for the COVID-19 virus, according to an email sent to the force Wednesday night by Chief Scott Schubert.</p>
<p>Earlier this week the city announced the first positive result from a police officer, who was identified only as a male firearms instructor at the firing range in Highland Park.</p>

<p>The three additional positive results were officially announced by the city Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>They include another firearms instructor, one of the recruits in the 28-member academy class that continued operating until last week, and an officer in the administrative branch.</p>
<p>All are in self-isolation at home, none has required hospitalization and all are being checked on regularly by police officials, according to a news release.</p>
<p>A firefighter also has tested positive, and the city announced Thursday that two Environmental Services employees have tested positive.</p>
<p>"Other Environmental Services employees who may have been in contact with the two are in self-quarantine as a precaution," the city said, providing no further details.</p>
<p>Police officials have refused to answer questions from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about the scope of how the highly contagious disease is affecting the bureau. They have not stated how many officers and recruits are in self-isolation because of possible exposure, how contact tracing is being handled, and how many officers and recruits have been tested.</p>
<p>"Police officials are in the process of identifying and notifying anyone who may have had contact with these individuals and placing them in self-quarantine.</p>
<p>Officers have been outfitted with surgical masks and N95 masks as well as gloves.</p>
<p>Additionally, their temperatures are being checked when they report for work.</p>
<p>“All front-line employees from police to refuse workers are being checked daily by health professionals to screen for the virus,” said Timothy McNulty, spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto. "The mayor is pleased the three officers are doing well in self-isolation, and urges all members of the public to stay inside as often as possible. "</p>
<p>Last Thursday the police bureau announced that the first firearms instructor to test positive at the police academy had begun exhibiting flu-like symptoms April 1 and was sent home. He underwent a COVID-19 test the next day, and a positive result was returned Saturday.</p>
<p>As far as continuing the operation of the training class, the police bureau has previously said, “We suspended the training of a new recruit class, but continued the training of this class because they were close to satisfying their training requirements. The class was isolated from other officers and was instructed to maintain social distancing.”</p>
<p>City Council members are receiving a briefing Thursday from public safety officials about COVID-19.</p>
