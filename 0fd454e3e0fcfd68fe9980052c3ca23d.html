<h1>Pittsburgh boutiques try to adapt to crisis by getting creative</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>March is typically the time of year when retailers see an uptick in shopping, usually for the first time since the holiday season. The spread of COVID-19, however, has brought foot traffic in stores of all sorts across Pittsburgh to a halt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On March 15, all non-essential businesses were asked to close to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. Five days later, Gov. Tom Wolf ordered&nbsp;“non-life-sustaining” businesses in Pennsylvania to temporarily shut down their physical locations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These edicts are meant to save lives, but for small businesses a mandated closure can be a death threat. That’s prompted several local clothing retailers to get creative to try to keep merchandise going out and cash flow coming in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We depend on people walking in our door everyday to keep our business alive,” says Kristi West, owner of Kristi Boutique in Aspinwall.&nbsp;“We are lucky we have a great deal of repeat clients that we are kind of leaning on during this time.”</p>
<p>She’s been packing boxes with apparel that clients can try on at home. What they don’t want, they can ship back to her. She also launched on social media&nbsp;“The 14 Days of Quarantine Chic” with Soothe the Sole, a footwear store in Aspinwall. They post on Instagram photos that feature selections from each shop that are for sale.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to get clothes in front of [shoppers] and hoping they will make a purchase,” Ms. West says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some boutiques are relying on social media to not only stimulate sales but also to keep customers engaged.</p>
<p>Personal stylist Audrey Rockett-Collins, who owns Shift in Verona, has created, with her team of employees, the daily #StyleInIsolation social media challenge. The month-long activity tasks people with completing daily activities, such as wearing a lipstick for no reason, organizing a dresser drawer and setting up an outbox for unwanted clothes.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to take photos of their progress and share them on social media with the challenge’s hashtag. Shift will be awarding prizes to participants, like $5 in store credit for those who complete five tasks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When we can be open again, this is our way for saying&nbsp;‘thank you’ for supporting us,” Ms. Rockett-Collins says.&nbsp;“So much of my team does thrive on interaction. It means a lot to see our friends and followers playing along.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Shift’s brick-and-mortar location is closed, people can shop its inventory of new and pre-loved women’s fashions on Poshmark.com. Plus, the store is offering virtual closet consultations and will be piloting Shift Style Boxes, curated boxes of clothes people can try on at home. People also can donate clothes in their outbox to Shift’s inventory or request a Shift employee to pick them up and give them to a local charity, like Dress for Success Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Anna Bencivenga, owner of Urbana in Oakmont, has teamed with wellness coach Tera Geishauser to spearhead the Healthy Homebody social media challenge, a month of virtual workouts, easy recipes, journal prompts and other self-care tips to help ease the stress of social distancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Clothing is my conduit for helping women and helping people feel good about themselves,” Ms. Bencivenga says. The Healthy Homebody initiative is another way she is striving to do that while her store is closed. She’ll be sharing style inspiration on Instagram @shop.urbana, and people can shop her spring arrivals on the e-commerce site shop-urbana.com.</p>
<p>For stores without an e-commerce website or a robust social media following, closures sparked by the spread of COVID-19 can seem even scarier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As a very new, small business with a single owner and operator, it is not easy to close our door for the foreseeable future,” Ryan Crisman wrote in an Instagram post.</p>
<p>He owns the men’s store Franklin &amp; Mercer Co., in Lawrenceville, which turned a year old in November. He was exploring the option of private shopping appointments and curated outfit packages. Plus, he’s selling discounted gift cards that can be redeemed at any time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a somber time for veteran retailers, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s always fun in here. People miss the camaraderie, the conversations and the friendships,” says&nbsp;Marta Minich, co-owner of Maxalto in Shadyside. The boutique has been in business for 36 years.&nbsp;“That’s the hardest part, I think.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>She and her sister, co-owner Michele Lyons, have been posting clothing photos on Instagram @maxalto_fashion and calling longtime customers to let them know they’re still here to set aside pieces for them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re fully stocked. The entire spring season is here. I just look around the store and see all these wonderful things we have to sell,” Ms. Minich says.&nbsp;“It’s just a shame. We’ll see how it goes.”</p>
<p>Larrimor’s, a fine men’s and women’s retailer in Downtown Pittsburgh, has seen its share of economic ups and downs during its 80-plus year history. This time, it had set up a system offering curb-side pick-up and private style appointments, in addition to selling items via larrimors.com.</p>
<p>“We’ve had to get through it, and we’ve done it,” says co-owner and general merchandise manager Lisa Slesinger, whose father Carl Slesinger led Larrimor’s for three decades.&nbsp;“The most important thing now is we’re all trying to take care of each other.”&nbsp;</p>
