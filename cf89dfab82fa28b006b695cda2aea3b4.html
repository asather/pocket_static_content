<h1>Golden Globes rewards war drama, Tarantino; Billy Porter settles for red-carpet win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Billy Porter, the arbiter of pizzazz for a brave new world, knows how to make an entrance. He roared into the 2020s Sunday as a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/2020/01/05/Your-2020-Golden-Globes-viewing-guide/stories/202001050150" target="_blank">Golden Globe Awards nominee</a> for best actor in a TV drama, with all the razzle-dazzle we’ve come to expect from the Pittsburgh native.</p>
<p>The 90 members of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, who vote on the awards, chose “Succession’s” Brian Cox as the winner, for his role as a conniving media mogul and patriarch on the HBO show. The category also included Kit Harrington (“Game of Thrones”), Rami Malek (“Mr. Robot”) and Tobias Menzes (“The Crown”).</p>
<p>Porter, however, was the style story of the night, as he has been for the past year of red-carpet wows. He has topped most year-end lists for his gender-bending fashion-forward style and arrived Sunday hand in hand with husband Adam Smith. He was dressed all in white, in a custom fitted tuxedo-style suit with a zipped-on feathered train that went on for yards and yards, by Alex Vinash (shoes by Jimmy Choo, jewels by Tiffany). It was a black tuxedo gown at the 2019 Oscars that announced Porter as the one to watch in the world of fashion.</p>
<p>The outfit took three months to make, which Porter told E!&nbsp;“Live From the Red Carpet” host Ryan Seacrest was a hopeful start, because it was started before nominations were announced.</p>
<p>Earlier on E!’s preshow, the style commentators named Porter the No. 1 Showstopper of the night, before he had stepped foot onto the red carpet.</p>
<p>Porter’s stylist, Sam Ratelle, texted E!’s Zanna Roberts Rassi while she was on the air and previewed the “regal” outfit by saying it “signifies peace, hope and new beginnings,” and, “It ain’t small,” said Rassi, who added, “This guy is a fashion mic drop.”</p>
<p>Already an Emmy Award winner for his role on the FX series “Pose,” Porter attended as a second-time Globes nominee for his role as drag ball emcee Pray Tell.</p>
<p>The 77th annual mingling of television and movie luminaries gathered for the ceremony, airing on NBC live from Beverly Hills, Calif. The show went more than three hours, with Sandra Bullock announcing the World War I drama “1917” as the top movie drama.&nbsp;“The Irishman,” which has been a critical darling this awards season and had five nominations, was shut out on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Hollywood Foreign Press gave out awards in 25 categories (14 in film and 11 in TV), with irreverent comedian Ricky Gervais returning as host. Gervais, a three-time Globes winner himself, was hosting for the fifth time.</p>
<p>Four-time Golden Globe winner Tom Hanks, a best supporting actor nominee for his portrayal of Fred Rogers in the theatrical release “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood,” received the Cecil B. DeMille Award for Lifetime Achievement in movies. Comedian and daytime television host Ellen DeGeneres, a three-time Globes nominee, received the Carol Burnett Award for her work on the small screen.</p>
<p>Charlize Theron, who had one of her first movie roles in the Tom Hanks-directed “That Thing You Do,” presented him with the DeMille Award, leading up to an impressive video of the actor’s credits, from “Big” to “Saving Private Ryan,” and including him as Fred Rogers in “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.” “How many people in this room have a clip that includes ‘The Love Boat’?” he said, then started to tear up as he looked at his wife, Rita Wilson, and five children, seated at the foot of the stage.</p>
<p>The emotional actor, fighting a cold, said every director he’d ever worked with, and he named some great ones, had said at some point, “Tomorrow, if you don’t do your job really well, we don’t have a movie.” And then he explained how an actor does his job, including showing up on time.</p>
<p>Gervais had no jokes about Hanks’ long and winding speech — all he said was, “Amazing.” The host did, however, make a joke about the lack of women among the nominated movie directors. The winner in that packed category was Sam Mendes, for “1917.”</p>
<p>“There is not one director in this room, not one director in the world, who is not in the shadow of Martin Scorsese,” Mendes said of his fellow nominee, for “The Irishman.”</p>
<p>Beating out Hanks — as well as Al Pacino and Joe Pesci of “The Irishman” and Anthony Hopkins of “The Two Popes” — for best supporting actor in a movie was Brad Pitt, as a veteran stuntman and pal to Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood.” Tarantino took home the award for best screenplay, and the film won as best musical or comedy.</p>
<p>In honoring DeGeneres, “Saturday Night Live” star Kate McKinnon said seeing DeGeneres come out as gay paved the way for her own career.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t seen her on TV, I would have thought, ‘I could never be on TV. They don’t let LGBTQ people be on TV,’” McKinnon said. “And more than that, I would have gone on thinking that I was an alien and that I maybe didn’t have a right to be here.”</p>
<p>Among the surprises of the night was the win for “Missing Link” as best animated movie, ahead of “Frozen II,” the new “Lion King,” “How to Train Your Dragon: The Hidden World” and “Toy Story 4.” Another shock was the reveal by Elton John when he and Bernie Taupin won best song for “I’m Gonna Love Me Again” from “Rocketman.” Sir Elton noted it was their first award of any kind together, and that lyricist Taupin has never won a Grammy.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Taron Egerton won the Globe as best actor in a movie musical or comedy for playing Elton John in “Rocketman,” while Awkwafina won best actress for&nbsp;“The Farewell.” An emotional and contrite Joaquin Phoenix kept the censors busy in accepting best actor in a movie drama for his searing performance in&nbsp;“Joker,” and Renee Zellweger took home her fourth Golden Globe for her portrayal of Judy Garland as&nbsp;“Judy.”</p>
<p>“Y’all look good 17 years later,” said Zelleweger, whose previous win was in 2004 for&nbsp;“Cold Mountain.”</p>
<p>Another winner for playing a real-life icon was Olivia Colman for&nbsp;“The Crown” on Netflix. Phoebe Waller-Bridge and&nbsp;“Fleabag” also were winners for the streaming service, and HBO took home wins for TV drama&nbsp;“Succession” and “Chernobyl” as the top TV movie or miniseries.</p>
<p>Australian actress Cate Blanchett, a stylish nominee for “Where’d You Go Bernadette?,” which filmed partly in Western Pennsylvania, was among the night’s presenters, introducing clips of the Globe-nominated movie&nbsp;“Joker.”&nbsp;Amid the glamour and the fun, two of the stories of the night were the lack of women director nominees and, with the many Aussies in attendance, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-06/golden-globes-2020-red-carpet/11843180" target="_blank">the wildfires that have devastated that country</a>.</p>
<p>The awards show opened with Gervais drawing gasps for purposefully offensive jokes about Felicity Huffman and her family, the lack of racial diversity among the nominees and the “perverts” and opportunists in Hollywood, ending each remark with “I don’t care,” because this is his fifth and self-proclaimed final time as host of the Globes ceremony.</p>
<p>The first award went to Ramy Youssef, creator and star of the Hulu comedy “Ramy,” about an Egyptian American millennial. He acknowledged that not many people had seen his show.</p>
<p>Next was the award for best actor in a TV movie or miniseries, which went to Russell Crowe as Roger Ailes in “The Loudest Voice.” Crowe was back in Australia, “protecting his family from the deadly bushfires,” said presenter Jennifer Aniston, bur the actor sent a statement about combatting climate change.</p>
<p>Despite Gervais’ urging to keep politics out of the awards ceremony, Michelle Williams, accepting the award for&nbsp;“Fosse/Verdon” on FX, spoke passionately about a woman’s right to choose. She and Patricia Arquette each used their time in the spotlight to urge watchers to vote.</p>
<p>Bong Joon-ho, director of the acclaimed South Korean movie "Parasite," accepted the award for best foreign film and summed up one thing that unites everyone in the room.</p>
<p>"We speak one language: cinema," he said.</p>
