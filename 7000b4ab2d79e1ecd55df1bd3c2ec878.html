<h1>No longer golden: Strip District McDonald's to be razed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Call it the Big Whack.</p>
<p>Two months after closing, the McDonald’s restaurant at 1630 Penn Ave. in the Strip District is coming down.</p>
<p>The fast-food chain has decided to raze the restaurant, which occupied a prominent patch of space at the entrance to the Strip for decades.</p>
<p>“Based on the age of the structure, the decision was made to demolish the building,” said Anne Christensen, director, field brand reputation, for McDonald’s.</p>
<p>Dan Kamin, the owner of the McDonald’s property in the Strip, said the fast-food chain had the option under its lease to leave the restaurant standing or to tear it down. It will have until July 8, the end of its lease, to remove the structure.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the property was fenced off, although it did not look as if any demolition had started. Graffiti had been scrawled on the front of the old restaurant. McDonald’s has removed its name from the sign post towering above the restaurant.</p>
<p>City records show that McDonald’s filed for a demolition permit on Dec. 30. The application was accepted Jan. 15 after revisions were requested and received. It does not appear that the permit has been issued yet. On Feb. 25, the city’s department of permits, licenses, and inspections requested revisions, according to the buildingeye.com website.</p>
<p>Mr. Kamin said McDonald’s asked him whether he wanted to keep the restaurant at the site or have it removed. “My response was that I don’t have a preference. Do what you want,” he said.</p>
<p>Before getting into the demolition, McDonald’s may have to remove asbestos from the restaurant, Mr. Kamin said.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the decision to tear down the structure could end up working to his advantage.</p>
<p>It gives him a clean slate to work with in trying to find a new tenant for the space, which is located on the fringe of the Penn Avenue retail corridor featuring generations-old merchants like Robert Wholey &amp; Co., Pennsylvania Macaroni Co., Stamoolis Brothers Co., DeLuca’s, Jimmy &amp; Nino Sunseri Co., and Primanti Brothers.</p>
<p>Most of the prospective tenants he has talked to “wanted [the McDonald’s] down,” he said. “I think it works out nicely, regardless. The building was kind of dated.”</p>
<p>There has been no lack of interest in the site since the news broke in January that the McDonald’s had closed. Mr. Kamin said he has heard from financial institutions, restaurants and others that are pining to set up shop at the site on heavily trafficked Penn Avenue.</p>
<p>“I’ve probably had more activity at this site than any others I have nationwide,” he said.</p>
<p>One thing he vowed not to do is turn the property into a parking lot. But he did not rule out the possibility of some type of tiered parking above whatever business, retailer or restaurant eventually lands there.</p>
<p>McDonald’s gave no reason for closing the restaurant. It was the second location to call it quits in recent months. A McDonald’s on Smithfield Street in Downtown closed last year.</p>
<p>In finding a new tenant for the Strip space, the goal is to not upset the vibe of the neighborhood and its famous retail corridor, Mr. Kamin said.</p>
<p>“We would like a use or a tenant that would be harmonious for the neighborhood, something that is complementary to the neighborhood,” he said.</p>
