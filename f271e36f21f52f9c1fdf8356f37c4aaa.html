<h1>A true global celebration, if not a traditional commencement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>University of Pittsburgh senior Veronica Murray won’t be at the Petersen Events Center Sunday as the school confers degrees on almost 8,000 members of the Class of 2020.</p>
<p>Then again, neither will any of them.</p>
<p>Instead, she will flip open a laptop in the living room of her South Oakland apartment and —&nbsp;with two roommates beside her who also are due to graduate —&nbsp;join classmates logging in from dozens of states and countries, as well as others just off campus like her. All will be participating in a kind of commencement Pitt has never before had to attempt.</p>
<p>University leaders say they recognize that Pitt’s first virtual degree celebration is no substitute for the real thing, and they have vowed to bring students back for an in-person commencement when health officials deem large gatherings are again safe.</p>
<p>But pandemic or not, the school wanted to mark commencement day, and it’s doing so with an intricately planned event —&nbsp;part livestream and part recorded, one that its organizers hope will move students to spontaneously share images of how they are celebrating anywhere around the globe using special hashtags, including #PittGrad20.</p>
<p>“I was looking forward to walking across the stage and celebrating with friends, but I think this virtual ceremony is a nice way to recognize the time and hard work we put in here,” said Ms. Murray, 22, from suburban Boston and a marketing and business information systems student, who after receiving her degree will be starting a job at BNY Mellon in August.</p>
<p>On Sunday, she just may don a Pitt business shirt, share breakfast with her roommates and perhaps take part in a Zoom video chat with other graduates after the ceremony, set for 11:30 a.m. Eastern time. Her mom back home and others will be watching her graduation, too.</p>
<p>In the coming weeks, a number of campuses across Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/05/Some-colleges-universities-planning-virtual-ceremonies-others-delaying-them-until-fall-covid-19/stories/202004010130" target="_blank">and beyond</a> hope to pull off virtual ceremonies of their own, and administrators at some of those schools may be looking in to see how smoothly Pitt’s attempt goes.</p>
<p>There’s no denying that it’s a less-than-optimal commencement lawn experience. But there are advantages over an actual schlep to a large venue like the 12,500-seat Petersen Events Center, where the main ceremony usually is held.</p>
<p>Parking and traffic won’t be an issue. Finding a good seat will be no problem, either (check your living room’s furniture configuration, just to be sure.)</p>
<p>Something else about the online experience may resonate with anyone who has stood inside a cavernous hall for a commencement that seemed to drag on for weeks. Pitt plans to pull the whole thing off in 30 minutes.</p>
<p>“It might be 35,” quipped Kathy Humphrey, Pitt’s senior vice chancellor for engagement and secretary of the board of trustees.</p>
<p>The idea, she said, is to weave together the sights, sounds and memories from four years on campus —&nbsp;plus speeches, awards and even a bit of the pomp, recorded fireworks included —&nbsp;all into a condensed,<a href="https://www.commencement.pitt.edu/online-celebration-program" target="_blank"> shared experience.</a></p>
<p>It will begin with Pitt’s alma mater, performed by the Pitt Men’s Glee Club, with images from across the sprawling research campus displayed.</p>
<p>“All of the buildings where our students will have taken classes will be featured,” Ms. Humphrey said. “The places they have been to and the places they have spent their time will be shown.”</p>
<p>Another yearbook-style video will include a picture of the graduating class taken four years earlier inside the Pete, right around freshman convocation. Those new arrivals, seated in the arena bowl, held above their heads squares that collectively displayed “Pitt” in giant letters.</p>
<p>“Hopefully, a lot of them will remember that,” Ms. Humphrey said.</p>
<p>In recent days, streaming&nbsp;equipment was delivered to Chancellor Patrick Gallagher’s residence, so he can deliver remarks live during Sunday’s ceremony, Ms. Humphrey said. Also speaking live from home will be University Senate President Chris Bonneau.</p>
<p>Recorded messages and remarks will be delivered by graduate and undergraduate representatives. Student awards will be announced.</p>
<p>Then, Provost Ann Cudd, seen live from her home, will present the Class of 2020. Mr. Gallagher will confer degrees to undergraduate, graduate, doctoral and professional degree candidates.</p>
<p>“We’re going to do that, even though we’re going to do the same thing again in person,” Ms. Humphrey said. “The students wanted some reminder of their time at Pitt.”</p>
<p>So the university obliged.</p>
<p>Planners built in what they are calling a special surprise —&nbsp;video messages to the class from prominent leaders.The event will close with a rendition of “Sweet Caroline,” performed by members of Pitt’s Marching Band, most of them seniors, recorded from their homes.</p>
<p>Throughout the day, planners hope to supplement the event itself with social media posts, linking graduates and families through Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, including the hashtag #PittGrad20. From Bangladesh to Belgium and from Uruguay to the United Kingdom, nations represented might make for an interesting cultural collage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“We’ll be keeping an eye on this hashtag and sharing content from our Panthers all day long,” Pitt said in advance material for the event. “These photos will also be included in our virtual recreation of the 1920 Living Panther — so be sure to post all your favorite Pitt photos.”</p>
<p>Every state except South Dakota is represented in the graduating class, plus 35 countries, so the time chosen was intended to keep all of the mainland U.S. in the morning and to make it reasonably viewable elsewhere.</p>
<p>For those logging in live on the West Coast, it will be early morning; for classmates in France or Germany, it will be late afternoon, and in parts of China it will be shortly before midnight.</p>
<p>“We’re also recording it, so if they’re in a part of the world where they don’t want to wake up that early” they can watch it later, Ms. Humphrey said</p>
<p>If this were a normal year, Ms. Murray would be close enough to walk to the Petersen Center and pick up her degree.</p>
<p>She said she downloaded a sign, “I did it! Pitt Class of 2020,” one of several provided by the university for the virtual event.</p>
<p>Ms. Murray reflected Thursday on her personal growth since arriving as a freshman, still deciding what she wanted to do as an adult and figuring out a new city. Like her peers at Pitt and elsewhere, she did not get to say adequate goodbyes to those on campus as her senior year shifted abruptly to online courses at home in March.</p>
<p>But in time, she said, it may serve a purpose.</p>
<p>“I feel that every member of the Class of 2020, we’re all kind of bonded in a way, that we’ve all gone through this together,” she said. “It’s hard to believe that it’s been four years already.”</p>
