<h1>'Unique' drive-thru delivers food, smiles amid COVID-19 outbreak</h1>

<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Dozens of cars lined Art Rooney Avenue and West General Robinson Street outside of Heinz Field around 9:45 on Saturday morning. Once the parking lot opened a little before 10, workers wearing neon-yellow vests and waving orange flags instructed people where to park. Around 60,000 pounds of food brought everyone together.</span></p>
<p><span>On many weekends, this description might apply to tailgate parties held in this same space before Steelers, Pitt football or Pirates games. But amid the coronavirus pandemic that has confined the majority of people to their homes, dragged down the economy and caused considerable food-related consternation, Gold Lot 1 was the site of a food-distribution event put together by the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and the Pirates.</span></p>

<p><span data-mce-mark="1">A tremendously unique, and innovative, one at that.</span></p>
<p>More than 100 people — employees and volunteers affiliated with both organizations — took turns loading pre-packaged boxes into back-seats and trunks, as patrons received a number, pulled into the lot, put their cars into park, then drove off, all while maintaining proper social distancing and receiving around 75 pounds of dry, fresh and frozen food.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We kind of had to take our normal model and throw it out the window,” said Dana Launius, special distributions coordinator for the Food Bank. “But also think how we can still get folks these products and do it in a way that’s safe while adhering to our public health regulations.”</span></p>
<p>This event, as well as others in the future, was funded in part by the Pirates $50,000 donation to the Food Bank made earlier this week. The Food Bank planned for a heavy turnout by packing 2,400 boxes (weighing roughly 25 pounds apiece) or enough to service 800 cars and wound up distributing roughly 1,500 boxes to 500 cars.</p>
<p>Swisshelm Park’s Bob Malys was one of the flag-waving faithful, walking up and down the rows of parking spaces, instructing cars to full forward and pop the trunk. After cart-wielding volunteers brought over the necessary boxes and loaded them in cars, Mr. Malys — a product flow coordinator for the Food Bank who earned his master’s degree in social work from Pitt — waved them one-by-one toward the exit.</p>
<p><span>“I’m pretty excited to be out here in the field,” he said. “Usually I build a lot of orders from behind a desk, but I really like this a lot. Handing people food makes me feel good.”</span></p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>The same can be said for Rachel Hoskins and her 9-year daughter, Alaina. Normally they volunteer at one of the Food Bank’s 18 Produce to People events every month, the closest one to the North Shore occurring at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School about a mile away.</p>
<p>Rachel Hoskins called this setup “absolutely unique” and said it was a great learning experience for Alaina.</p>
<p>“We’re willing to adjust and do whatever is needed to help out,” Ms. Hoskins said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">That’s been a popular theme for the Food Bank, according to vice president of marketing and communications Brian Gulish. On a normal day at the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank’s Duquesne warehouse, Mr. Gulish said they’ll service around a dozen families with emergency food support. On Friday, they had 100.</span></p>
<p>“If you take that number and put it into the community as a whole, we know the demand is there,” Gulish said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Which is why, at the start of the week, Ms. Launius, Jordan Hartman and other members of the special distributions team put their heads together and tried to figure out a solution. Treating this like an assembly line would not work, they figured. Too much physical contact.</span></p>
<p><span>So they started tinkering with ideas in larger, outdoor spaces such as parking lots. A partner of the Pirates, ALCO parking was more than willing to donate the space, as the distribution took on a couple different looks.&nbsp;“Trial by error,” Ms. Launius joked.</span></p>
<p>At first, cars parked in random spaces, though backing out complicated matters. Then they tried to distribute on the fly, with cars staying in the aisle, but that was a little too dangerous with the amount of people lifting and pulling around boxes.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The winner turned out to be three different clusters of spaces, where cars were admitted on a rotating basis. While one group pulled out, another got their food and a third parked. Rinse, wash, repeat.</span></p>
<p>“It’s definitely presenting a unique challenge for us,” said Mr. Hartman, 26, of Whitehall. “Generally we have a very efficient model for our distributions, but that’s all based on having people gathering in large groups. We can’t do that right now, so we’re piloting this new model, and we’re going to be piloting new models in the upcoming weeks to ensure food still gets to our neighbors in need.”</p>
<p>Timothy Nesmith appreciated the extra effort. The McKeesport resident recently had his food stamp allowance cut from $200 to $80. He doesn’t understand why, but he was less worried about that and more concerned about having enough to eat during this difficult time.</p>
<p>“We usually have to stand in line,” Mr. Nesmith said. “I have a bad leg, so I definitely appreciate this.”</p>
<p>Marie Marks, a Crafton resident, echoed those thoughts, “I’m actually picking up for my neighbors. They’re elderly and don’t want to go out, but this is really helpful.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">As Ms. Marks spoke, her engine running and volunteers packing her trunk with food, a simple-yet-stark reminder of why we’re here sat alone on the seat next to her: a small container of hand sanitizer — extra in case the bigger bottle she had in the glove compartment ran out.</span></p>
<p>“Obviously these are difficult times right now, not only in the city of Pittsburgh but throughout the country,” said Pirates president Travis Williams, who was among those carrying and loading boxes. “Just to be able to do our small part for Pittsburgh and the families in need makes me feel good. I think it’s a good reflection on the city of Pittsburgh in terms of coming together in times of need.”</p>
