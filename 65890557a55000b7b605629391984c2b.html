<h1>Review: 'Hamilton' stage-to-screen is yet another triumph</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How could there possibly be room for improvement in “Hamilton”? Not in the production itself, of course, which won 11 Tony Awards as well as a Pulitzer Prize and the passion of millions.</p>
<p>Yet a filmed version of the cultural phenomenon-slash-Broadway musical opens up fresh viewpoints simply by embracing an age-old Hollywood trope: It was ready for its close-ups.</p>
<p>Until now, generally speaking, the transfer of musicals from stage to screen has been unsatisfactory. “Hamilton” has set a new standard for others to follow, as you can see for yourself when it begins streaming July 3 on Disney+.</p>
<p>Lin-Manuel Miranda’s opus to life, liberty and the pursuit of power in America’s infancy is his take on author Ron Chernow’s best-selling Alexander Hamilton biography.</p>
<p>The drama orbits around the “bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a Scotsman” who arrived on these shores as a penniless teen from the Caribbean. Miranda is not only the creator of this hip-hop musical, he is its star. He plays Hamilton as what we would today call a Type-A personality, hungry to lead men into battle. He is, as one song puts it, “Non-Stop.”</p>
<p>He’s also abrasive, talented and an insufferable know-it-all. The combination of these traits will lead him to do wonderful things, such as help defeat the British and later, mastermind our federal financial system.</p>
<p>But Hamilton will also suffer great sorrows in his drive to prove himself better than those who ascended through privilege. He’s a man of principles, to a point. He will use cunning to get his way and his priorities are skewed when it comes to family.</p>
<p>“Hamilton” also could not be more timely. In a brief introduction to the film, Thomas Kail&nbsp;— director of both stage and this excellent screen version — notes “we’re all talking about what it means to be Americans.”</p>
<p>To wit: What is America, or what should it be? Is revolution the solution? What does violence get you? These are among the important themes in the first half of this roughly 2 hour, 45-minute PG-13 production.</p>
<p>“Hamilton” is also wildly entertaining, funny, educational and, ultimately, gut-wrenching. Miranda has structured his work to be two very different books. In the first, there is the struggle and excitement of being at the center of the Revolutionary War, where the groundwork is set for an historic showdown between Hamilton and his friend/nemesis Aaron Burr.</p>
<p>Act 2 is about the work of building a new nation and balancing it all with family values. In perhaps the production’s best number, “The Room Where It Happens,” Hamilton, as George Washington’s Secretary of State notes “God help and forgive me, I wanna build something that’s gonna outlive me.”</p>
<p>He isn’t referring to his kids.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the original cast is non-Caucasian; the notable exception is Jonathan Groff as the foppish King George III.</p>
<p>Including Miranda, all of the original main actors are on screen, including Carnegie Mellon University grads and Tony winners Leslie Odom Jr. (Burr) and Renee Elise Goldsberry (Angelica Schuyler). A third Tony-winner, Daveed Diggs, scampers happily in the second of his dual roles as Thomas Jefferson (he’s the Marquis de Lafayette in Act 1).</p>
<p>Christopher Jackson is the stalwart general turned older statesman, George Washington, who reminds Hamilton that the retelling of history is a fluid thing. Also excellent are Anthony Ramos (John Laurens/Philip Hamilton) and Okieriete Onaodowan (Hercules Mulligan/James Madison).</p>
<p>Miranda, Goldsberry, Odom, Jackson, Diggs&nbsp;… none may ever have roles as demanding and career-defining and live up to the task. Not only did Miranda put more than 20,000 words on paper in a variety of musical genres, orchestrated by Alex Lacamoire. Andy Blankenbuehler’s exacting choreography is carried out on multiple levels and turntables.</p>
<p>The production was shot over two live performances at the Richard Rodgers Theatre in 2016, using six main cameras from various angles, including one that gives the viewer the feeling they are in the front row.</p>
<p>Close-ups were culled from live performances without an audience for about a dozen songs, and here is where this “Hamilton” takes on a new, stunning facet.</p>
<p>Stage actors are versatile creatures. They play to a broader audience, knowing that only a fortunate fracture of it will be able to actually see their facial expressions.</p>
<p>But this “Hamilton” reveals the anguish on Eliza’s face when she sings about being “Helpless.” It frames Angelica as she turns away from Burr in disgust as Burr tells her “I’m a trust fund baby, you can trust me” in “The Schuyler Sisters.”</p>
<p>Diggs’ glee at needling Hamilton in numerous ways is eminently watchable, and his big Act 2 opening number “What’d I Miss?” is a delight. Miranda’s performance seems at once bigger, yet more nuanced than it was from afar.</p>
<p>Numbers such as “It’s Quiet Uptown” and “Burn” benefit from the intimacy of this approach. Declan Quinn’s cinematography captures so many details, the film will no doubt hold up to multiple viewings this weekend. The music captures a wide swath of styles, from hip-hop to jazz to Broadway (Miranda knows his standards songbook).</p>
<p>Although some of Blankenbuehler’s muscular choreography get a bit diced, there are enough great numbers, including Odom’s tour de force “The Room Where it Happens” and “Yorktown” to satisfy.</p>

<p>“Hamilton” wasn’t just a Broadway musical. It spawned a chart-topping soundtrack, then a star-studded mixtape version and six touring companies (now at ease due to the pandemic). Miranda and Jeremy McCarter wrote an excellent book about creating the show: “Hamilton: The Revolution.” The filmed version was to be released in theaters in October 2021, but Disney paid big bucks to literally bring it home this summer.</p>
<p>And now, here is something new, its own special stage-screen Hamil-hybrid. Really, where else are you going to see rolling end credits that acknowledge samplings from Gilbert and Sullivan’s “The Pirates of Penzance” and Biggie Smalls and DJ Premier’s “The Ten Crack Commandments”?</p>
