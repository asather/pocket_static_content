<h1>Port Authority moving ahead after 'very productive' meeting with federal officials on BRT project</h1>

<p>Port Authority said Monday that staff had a&nbsp;“very productive” meeting with federal officials about its proposed Bus Rapid Transit system between Oakland and Downtown Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The meeting was a follow-up to President Donald Trump’s announcement Thursday on Twitter that the authority would receive a $99.95 million grant to support the $225 million project. The grant will come from $25 billion in federal stimulus money approved by Congress for transportation projects to help grow the economy after the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The agency said last week that it wanted to meet with the Federal Transit Administration about details since it had applied for funding under the agency’s Small Grants program.</p>
<p>“Port Authority [Monday] had a very productive call with federal officials about the recent announcement of funding for our Downtown-Uptown-Oakland-East End Bus Rapid Transit project,” spokesman Adam Brandolph said in a statement. “We will be taking some time to discuss with our project partners the next steps before commenting any further publicly.”</p>
<p>The project is in its final design and CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said last week she expected construction to begin early next year. The system should begin operation in 2023.</p>
<p>The concept is to improve the efficiency of buses between Oakland and Downtown Pittsburgh, two of the state’s busiest business corridors, by using exclusive lanes inbound on Fifth Avenue and outbound on Forbes Avenue. Fifth Avenue also will have bike lanes and the Uptown neighborhood will get new sidewalks, street lights and street paving.</p>
<p>Fifteen electric buses will be used to supplement the diesel fleet and reduce air pollution.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, the system will have branches to Wilkinsburg on the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway and Highland Park and Greenfield using lanes at intersections that give buses priority at traffic lights. Buses from the eastern suburbs and Monongahela Valley also will use the exclusive lanes and priority at traffic lights.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman said previously the agency’s next step likely will be acquiring small pieces of property along the route for expanded bus stops. Consultants also are expected to tweak the design of stations and stops to allow more social distancing as a result of the virus.</p>
