<h1>PPG takes hit from COVID-19 and expects decline to continue  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PPG took a significant hit in the first quarter and expects sales to decline by one-third in the second quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic ravages the global economy.</p>
<p>The Downtown-based coatings maker has been forced to&nbsp;close paint stores in some countries while major customers like automakers and aircraft builders have shuttered their factories.</p>
<p>First-quarter sales were about $3.4 billion, 7% below the year-ago quarter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Net income fell to $243 million, or $1.02 per share, down from $312 million or $1.31 per share in the first quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>The results “reflect a sudden and wide-ranging deterioration in global demand during the month of March and the impacts of the economic shutdown in China during February,” said Michael McGarry, PPG’s chairman and chief executive.</p>
<p>PPG operates a coatings factory in Wuhan, China, the city where the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 is believed to have originated.</p>
<p>That factory was among the operations PPG closed temporarily as the virus spread, but it has since reopened.</p>
<p>PPG expects second-quarter sales volumes to fall by 30% to 35% and it has withdrawn previous sales and earnings guidance for the full year.</p>
<p>In response to the decline in business from the pandemic, the company has taken “immediate and broad steps,” said Mr. McGarry, including salary cuts for senior executives, employee furloughs, closure of some factories and distribution sites, cost reductions and deferred capital expenditures.</p>
<p>In March, it borrowed $800 million from its existing credit line and this month, entered a new credit facility of $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Some of the new credit line was used to pay off the money borrowed in March, PPG said.</p>
<p>It generated $20 million in savings during the first quarter from a previously announced restructuring plan and “will determine if further cost or restructuring actions are warranted,” Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>He expects “significant declines” in demand to continue especially from automotive and aerospace customers.</p>
<p>Demand for some other PPG products including house paints and packaging coatings have been “only modestly impacted” by the pandemic, Mr. McGarry said.</p>
<p>He is scheduled to discuss the results Tuesday morning in a conference call with Wall Street analysts.</p>
<p>Shares in PPG closed Monday at $96, up $3.26 or 3.5%.&nbsp;But the stock fell 2% after hours when the earnings results were released.</p>
