<h1>Poll: Most Penguins fans prepared to move on from Matt Murray</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many Penguins fans appear ready for some change after their team was eliminated in the qualifying round of the playoffs earlier this month.</p>
<p>Polling of Post-Gazette readers by CivicScience found that, with a few weeks to process the series loss to Montreal, support for many key figures remains stable, but confidence for others has eroded.</p>
<p>Goalie Matt Murray tops the latter list. The 26-year-old has won two Stanley Cups with the Penguins in 2016 and ’17. But most fans are prepared to see him depart in the coming offseason. An overwhelming majority of 76% said they’d prefer to see Tristan Jarry and Casey DeSmith as the team’s goalie combination next season.</p>
<p>Just 17% of readers voted for a combo that includes Murray.</p>
<p>Defenseman Kris Letang, likewise, seems to be the target of some ire. When asked which of the Penguins’ core players they’d like to see traded, a 42% plurality of readers voted to keep them together.</p>
<p>But those who made a choice strongly preferred to see Letang go. He received a little more than a third of the vote at 34%. Evgeni Malkin was the second choice at 18% while just 4% preferred dealing captain Sidney Crosby.</p>
<p>On the coaching front, few seem moved by the news last week that Sergei Gonchar, Mark Recchi and Jaques Martin were being let go. Just 18% of readers said they disagreed with the decision, while 47% said they fully or somewhat agreed and 35% had no opinion.</p>
<p>As for their former boss, reviews of his performance in 2019-20 are lukewarm. A 39% plurality gave Mike Sullivan a “C” grade. Twenty percent gave him an “A” or “B,” likely an acknowledgement of the team’s steady performance amid injuries during the regular season, but 40% gave a “D” or “F” grade amid the playoff disappointment.</p>
<p>General manager Jim Rutherford finds himself with similar standing among readers. A 45% plurality gave him a “C” grade, with 19% voting for something better and 35% for something worse.</p>
<p>Looking forward, legitimate doubt exists about the team’s ability to return to its championship-winning form. When asked how much longer its Stanley Cup window will remain open, a 43% plurality said that it’s already closed.</p>
<p>An additional 12% saw just one more season of potential, 31% were optimistic enough to see two more seasons, but just 14% saw potential for three or more.</p>
