<p>Human remains were found Tuesday in an area near the home of a 21-year-old Fox Chapel man, who last month was charged with homicide in the shooting death of a Baldwin Borough man.</p>
<p>As part of an “ongoing investigation,” Allegheny County police said detectives, along with Fox Chapel police and a Pennsylvania State Police K-9 unit discovered the remains around 11 a.m. to the 900 block of Settler’s Ridge Road. According to Allegheny County police Lt. Venerando Costa, the remains were discovered on public property in a wooded area across the street from a home belonging to the parents of Adam Rosenberg.</p>
<p>Lt. Costa said the remains were not buried, but were not visible from the road.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">In a separate case last month, police alleged Mr. Rosenberg shot and killed&nbsp;Jeremy Dentel, 28.&nbsp;</span><a style="font-size: 10pt;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/20/Adam-Scott-Rosenberg-Fox-Chapel-homicide-shooting-death-Jeremy-Dentel-Baldwin/stories/202002200127" target="_blank">He was charged with criminal homicide</a><span style="font-size: 10pt;">, as well as&nbsp;robbery, carrying a firearm without a license and tampering with/fabricating physical evidence.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Mr. Rosenberg is currently being held without bond at the Allegheny County Jail pending a March 13 preliminary hearing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County police are investigating. No other information about the remains has been released.</p>
<p>Police contend that Mr. Rosenberg and Mr. Dentel met through the online dating app “Find Men.” Using Mr. Dentel's iPad, which was mirrored to his iPhone, police said they discovered that the two had begun talking on Feb. 12. Three days later, the two agreed to meet. Police said the last contact Mr. Dentel received was from a number belonging to Mr. Rosenberg.</p>
<p>Mr. Dental was found dead in his home on Vernon Avenue after being shot in the head, a criminal complaint said.</p>
