<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh Public Schools teacher resigned Saturday after a kindergarten student was burned during a science project.</p>
<p>The incident <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/01/09/Kindergarten-student-burned-science-experiment-North-Side-todd-hollis-pittsburgh-king-prek-8/stories/202001090135" target="_blank">happened in early January</a> at&nbsp;Pittsburgh King PreK-8 on the North Side, where the 5-year-old girl was injured after spilling a liquid while participating in some sort of science project.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh confirmed the teacher’s resignation.</p>
<p>The teacher initially had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation by the school district. The name of the teacher has not been disclosed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Photos of the injuries show the student visibly blistered.</p>
<p>The girl has “severe trauma” and will likely have lasting injuries from the incident, Todd Hollis, the attorney for the girl’s family, told the Post-Gazette earlier this month.</p>
<p>Ms. Pugh said school officials could not comment further because it is a personnel matter.&nbsp;</p>
