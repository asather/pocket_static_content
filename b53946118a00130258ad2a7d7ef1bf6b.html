<h1>Analysis: Steelers receivers are just young, not 'money' quite yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Fourth in a 2020 offseason series breaking down the Steelers position by position:</em></p>
<p>About a decade ago now, the Steelers receiving corps dubbed themselves “Young Money.” A more accurate moniker for the current crop at the position might be “Young 401k” — plenty of players on their first NFL contracts, but as a whole, they’ve been more of an investment so far than a productive collection of pass-catchers.</p>
<p>The Steelers tried to inject a bit of experience last year in the post-Antonio Brown world by adding Donte Moncrief in free agency, but Moncrief turned out to be one of the team’s worst signings in recent memory. He played in just five games, dropped as many passes as he caught (four) <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/11/02/Steelers-Donte-Moncrief-released-contract-Tony-James-Brooks/stories/201911020057" target="_blank">and was cut Nov. 2</a>.</p>
<p>So, the youth movement that carried the Steelers through 2019 will be back in 2020, presumably with at least one addition to the receiving room. But mostly, it will be up to JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Washington and Diontae Johnson to take steps forward, enough to prove they’re both the future of the position as well as the present. If Ben Roethlisberger is back and fully healthy, they’ll have no excuse not to yield bigger returns in this offense.</p>
<p>The No. 1 question is Smith-Schuster’s ability to be a true No. 1 target. His ascent in the absence of Brown took an unfortunate detour last season, due to external factors — injuries and poor quarterback play — but also his own inability to adjust. Without an established threat opposite him, Smith-Schuster faced bracket coverage week in and week out, which limited his big-play potential and scoring opportunities. He had just three touchdowns, all 25 yards or longer but none in the second half of the season. Now he enters a contract year.</p>
<p>“In terms of production, in terms of the receiver position, a lot of those things are defined by variables that, at times, are out of your control,” Mike Tomlin said at his season-ending news conference.&nbsp;“We are not going to worry too much about that.”</p>
<p>Between Washington and Johnson, both of whom are actually older than Smith-Schuster, do the Steelers have a clear-cut No. 2 receiver or two No. 3s? Thanks to Smith-Schuster’s down year, Washington led the team in receiving yards (735) and Johnson in receptions (59) but consistency eluded both. Washington followed his career-high 111 yards against Cleveland with a four-catch, 33-yard outing against Arizona. After Johnson caught five passes for 84 yards against Miami, he had just one reception for 3 yards against Indianapolis.</p>
<p>Going forward, Washington figures to be the best bet to fulfill the role as a deep threat. His 16.7 yards per reception ranked ninth in the league among qualified receivers, and that was his specialty coming out of Oklahoma State as a second-round pick two years ago.</p>
<p>If Washington is able to continue stretching the field, that will allow Johnson to keep doing what he does best. He’s a slippery route-runner who makes defenders miss after the catch, traits of a slot receiver. But Johnson scored all five of his touchdowns as a rookie playing outside receiver, which can allow Smith-Schuster to operate from anywhere in a formation once Roethlisberger returns.</p>
<p>“They kind of want me to learn the inside,” <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/4dCWEfFWF4bsicoeuHRNIH" target="_blank">Johnson told the Post-Gazette</a> in January.&nbsp;“I know&nbsp;‘X’ and&nbsp;‘Z’ [receiver] and they kind of want me to learn every position. That could help me out, and that’s going to help the team out, as well.”</p>
<p>Beyond the Steelers’ top three, it’s anyone’s guess how the depth chart shakes out this year. After making the team over Eli Rogers, Ryan Switzer failed to carve out a niche for himself even before a season-ending back injury in November. Switzer was developing chemistry with Roethlisberger during training camp and played a career-high 69% snap share in the season-opening loss at New England. From there, he rarely saw the field on offense and caught just two passes.</p>
<p>If Switzer was little more than a close-quarters option in the passing game, Johnny Holton was the opposite. A career special teamer, that’s how Holton made this squad out initially, but then he turned into a Darrius Heyward-Bey type of deep-ball specialist. That didn’t work out well for Holton or the Steelers, considering he caught just three of his 15 targets.</p>
<p>Enter Deon Cain, a 2018 sixth-round pick of Indianapolis who ended up getting demoted to the Colts practice squad last season. That’s where the Steelers found him and signed him in the wake of injuries to Smith-Schuster, Johnson and Switzer. The 6-foot-2 Cain caught at least one pass in four of six games with the Steelers, playing at least a quarter of the offensive snaps in half of those.</p>
<p>All of the above will have a new position coach guiding them, with former New York Giants standout <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/18/Steelers-name-Ike-Hillard-receivers-coach-tomlin-giants-Buccaneers-redskins/stories/202002180112" target="_blank">Ike Hilliard being hired Feb. 18</a> to replace interim receivers coach Ray Sherman. Hilliard was looking for work when the staff Jay Gruden assembled in Washington was let go following the hiring of new Redskins coach Ron Rivera.</p>
<p>Kevin Colbert and Mike Tomlin could choose to bolster the group, but if they do so in free agency, they can’t afford to make another Moncrief mistake. When it comes to receivers, the Steelers have done much better finding them in the draft, then developing them, and doing it outside of the first round. The current corps is young, but not money just yet.</p>
