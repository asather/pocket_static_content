<h1>With waning days of winter in short supply, ice anglers long for hard water</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During the February doldrums, many Pennsylvanians tweak their home thermostats to make their home’s interior more comfortable and cozy.</p>
<p>While outside, hardy anglers in boots and overcoats sit on upturned pails, and pop-up communities of nylon shanties appear in clusters on ice-covered lakes.</p>
<p>This year, however, the mercury threw cold water on most ice fishing opportunities, freezing out hope among members of a little understood hard-water culture.</p>
<p>“There hasn’t been enough ice to talk about, just the absence of it,” said Jay Ruska, a self-described “die hard” ice fisherman from Wexford.</p>
<p>At Pennsylvania latitudes, typical January weather hovers around 28 degrees. This year the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh reported January’s average temperature was 35.2 degrees, peaking with a record-setting 70 degrees Jan. 11.&nbsp;It was the warmest January since 2006, nearly 7 degrees higher than historical averages.</p>
<p>Fortunately for ice anglers, the heat wave isn’t part of a new weather pattern. During a two-week deep freeze in early February 2019, fish were pulled through the ice from Erie County’s Presque Isle Bay to Somerset County’s High Point Lake near Mount Davis, the highest point in Pennsylvania. Ice has been formed to fish through somewhere in the region every February for at least the last 10 years.</p>
<p>But so far in 2020, rollercoaster temperatures have dropped into the low 20s but quickly rebounded. Ice on some lakes grew thick enough to tease hopeful anglers, but stayed too thin to support their weight.</p>
<p>Mr. Ruska said his Jeep Wrangler has been loaded with ice fishing gear since Christmas, “just in case I drive past North Park Lake and see ice that was there long enough to give it a try.”</p>
<p>Most of the region’s major amateur ice fishing tournaments were canceled, postponed or remain in limbo. In Crawford County, the popular tournament at Pymatuning Reservoir was scrubbed. The Western Pennsylvania Hardwater Tournament Series canceled events planned at Lake Wilhelm (Mercer County) and Lake Arthur (Butler), while its Erie County contests at Presque Isle Bay (Feb. 22) and Edinboro Lake (Feb. 23) remain on schedule pending ice conditions.</p>
<p>Ice fishing constitutes a small percentage of overall Pennsylvania angling, but it is sorely missed this year by hard water veterans like Mr. Ruska, opportunistic cabin fever sufferers and families that might have given it a try on a bright crisp winter day.</p>
<p>Ice fishing can be technological and expensive. A digital fish finder, GPS locator, underwater camera system, gas-powered ice auger, collapsible ice fishing hut, 26-inch graphic rods with ball-bearing spinning reels and several spring-loaded ice fishing tip-ups are packed in the back of Mr. Ruska’s Jeep. Ice fishing can be as affordable as the cost of a hook, a handline and a hatchet to whack through the ice. Cheap Cinderella and Superman spincast rods for kids, or an angler’s existing tackle, can work very well. When there’s ice.</p>
<p>The state Fish and Boat Commission doesn’t monitor ice conditions but devotes pages of its website (https://www.fishandboat.com) to ice safety. A minimum of 4 inches of “good ice” is recommended for a single angler, 7 inches for group activities.</p>
<p>“In ice fishing we don’t say ‘safe ice,’ we say ‘good ice,’” said Mandy Smith, the agency’s Southwest Region education specialist. “Clear ice that formed after a long hard freeze —&nbsp;maybe translucent depending on the color of the water —&nbsp;is typically the strongest. Frazil ice is just a thin film. The most dangerous is rotten ice with a honeycomb appearance with water percolating through.”</p>
<p>Ice is always dangerous over moving water and is weak surrounding protruding dock poles, branches and rocks. Persistent wind stirs surface water and prevents freezing. When water is blown over ice and covered with snow it creates deceptively weak ‘milk ice.’ Snow-covered ice is good and bad. The snow insulates the ice from warming air temperatures but can hide partially frozen holes left by other anglers.</p>
<p>“There are just a few regulations specific to ice fishing,” said Ms. Smith, who has taught ice fishing safety and tactics at Fish and Boat’s free family clinics. “One is, holes cannot be bigger than 10 inches in diameter so someone can’t step on a frozen-over hole and fall through.”</p>
<p>Funded through the sale of fishing licenses, Pennsylvania’s trout stocking program cultures and raises the fish in state hatcheries then stocks them specifically for harvest —&nbsp;they’re not expected to survive more than a few months. Dave Nihart, the agency’s cold-water unit leader, said trout stocked in December, 2019, will probably not be caught by the ice fishing crowd, but the presence of the fish will not impact spring stocking numbers.</p>
<p>Fish behavior under the ice is species specific. Tom Haluska, a veteran ice fisherman and ranger at Prince Gallitzin State Park in Cambria County, said experienced anglers know where to sink their augers when the park’s Glendale Lake is frozen over.</p>
<p>“People think the fish are all slow and sluggish because of the cold, but in ice fishing it’s all about oxygen,” he said. “When underwater vegetation is still green, panfish [such as bluegills, sunfish and crappies] stay around because it’s still giving off oxygen. If ice cover persists, the vegetation dies and the decay process takes up oxygen. So the fish look for inflows of creek water or underwater springs that bring in more oxygen. The bigger fish follow the smaller fish.”</p>
<p>Predators such as muskellunge, northern pike, pickerel and walleye are typically targeted through ice by jigging, jerking up and down on a line baited with an artificial lure or live sucker or chub as large as 3 inches or more. But a 42-inch muskie Mr. Haluska pulled through the ice several years ago at Canoe Creek Lake in Blair County was an “incidental catch,” he said, taken on a 1-inch minnow.</p>
<p>The culture on the ice is generally warm, more than cordial, he said, maybe because the number of ice anglers are so few.</p>
<p>“Most of them are friendly. They want to help out,” said Mr. Haluska. “You get guys walking over to talk with their neighbors at the next hole, passing the time, asking how it’s going. It’s a pretty friendly atmosphere. Some guys bring barbeque grills on the ice and cook up deer steaks and make a day of it.”</p>
<p>But not this year.</p>
<p>“Personally I know guys who just couldn’t wait [for ice],” he said. “They’ll travel, head up to New York for the weekend where the lakes are frozen.”</p>
