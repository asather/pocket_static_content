<h1>Bloomberg campaign will open Pittsburgh office on Sunday</h1>

<p>Continuing its focus on flooding the later Democratic primary states with advertising and on-the-ground staffing, Mike Bloomberg’s presidential campaign will open a field office in Pittsburgh on Sunday.</p>
<p>The opening of the office on Broad Street in East Liberty comes about two months before Pennsylvania’s April 28 primary, and serves as the latest local investment from a campaign that’s said it’s building an organizing infrastructure “the likes of which have never been seen in a PA primary.”</p>
<p>“Until Mike got into the race, [President Donald] Trump was running unopposed in Pennsylvania and the other battleground states,” wrote Pennsylvania State Director Kevin Kinross in a strategy memo this past week. “We are on the ground in Pennsylvania, building the infrastructure, building the capacity, and beginning to compete now.”</p>
<p>Joining Bloomberg officials at the unveiling of the field office will be Aliquippa Mayor Dwan Walker, who endorsed the former New York City mayor earlier this month and was touted by the campaign among its more than 100 “Mayors for Mike” endorsements.</p>
<p>In a statement, Mr. Walker, who has served as mayor since 2012, said he supports Mr. Bloomberg because of his fight for gun reform and his proposed Greenwood Initiative, an economic justice platform that works to create 100,000 new black-owned small businesses and 1 million new black homeowners, among other things.</p>
<p>The office will be the campaign’s first in Western Pennsylvania. Its other four offices are in the counties surrounding Philadelphia, and it plans to open two more in Scranton and Harrisburg after Super Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Kinross, a Pittsburgh native with a long political history that included serving as chief of staff to former Allegheny County Executive Dan Onorato, said the campaign has hired more than 70 staffers in Pennsylvania, and that voters in Philadelphia and its surrounding suburbs are “starting to notice” that Mr. Bloomberg is best positioned to beat Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>His memo also pointed to internal polling, reported by Politico, that warned Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders —&nbsp;a frequent target of Mr. Bloomberg —&nbsp;would jeopardize the Democrats’ House majority if nominated.</p>
<p>A Muhlenberg College/Morning Call poll released last week found that Mr. Sanders is the only Democratic contender who beats Mr. Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup. Mr Bloomberg trailed Mr. Trump 48% to 45% in the poll, conducted between Feb. 12 and Feb. 20.</p>
