<h1>Ron Cook: Starling Marte is gone. Now who's next?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Will Josh Bell be the next to go?</p>
<p>Hey, I’m all for it.</p>
<p>Why just stop with Starling Marte?</p>
<p>The Pirates are in full rebuild mode, or at least should be after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/01/27/pittsburgh-pirates-starling-marte-trade-arizona-diamondbacks/stories/202001270090" target="_blank">they traded Starling Marte</a> to the Arizona Diamondbacks on Monday for a young pitching prospect and a young shortstop. They won’t tell you they are rebuilding because they think you are fools. But it’s true. Not that there’s anything wrong with rebuilding, in the Pirates’ case. It beats constant mediocrity or worse, which is what the franchise always gives you. The team lost 93 games last season and was looking at another rotten season in 2020 even before Marte was traded.</p>
<p>Have you noticed how bad the pitching staff is?</p>
<p>Have you noticed the catching options?</p>
<p>The Marte trade reminds me of what former Pirates general manager Branch Rickey told Hall of Famer-to-be Ralph Kiner a lifetime ago during a contract dispute: “We finished last with you, we can finish last without you.”</p>
<p>New general manager Ben Cherington could say the same thing to Bell when he trades him for prospects who might actually develop and help the Pirates win again at some point down the road.</p>
<p>Would you really be against that?</p>
<p>Short-term pain for long-term gain, right?</p>
<p>Certainly, it made sense to trade Marte, 31. Yes, he’s coming off a strong season, but, no, we’re not talking about Mike Trout. He was a good player here, not a great player. It’s also easy to think Marte’s trade value never will be higher. It’s likely his career will start to decline, sooner rather than later. He has a history of injuries, not to mention an 80-game suspension for performance-enhancing drugs in 2017.</p>
<p>Most of the reports are saying the Pirates did OK with their return for Marte.</p>
<p>Pitcher Brennan Malone, 19, was a No. 1 draft pick last season. Dominican shortstop Liover Peguero, 19, played well in rookie ball. Each figures to be at least three or four or five years from making it to Pittsburgh, if they make it here at all.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ new trio at the top — Travis Williams, Cherington and Derek Shelton — have talked repeatedly of the organization doing a better job of scouting, drafting and developing players. I have no idea how that will go with Malone and Peguero. We’ll see.</p>
<p>What I do know is the Pirates won’t be competitive again — if they ever are — before Bell becomes too expensive for Bob Nutting. It’s not as if the team, with Nutting squeezing the franchise’s wallet, will be able to sign Bell to a long-term extension before he can become a free agent after the 2022 season. Bell’s agent is Scott Boras. Enough said about that.</p>
<p>As it is, Bell will make $4.8 million in 2020 and have two years of salary arbitration after that. The time could come as early as next offseason that Nutting feels the need to get such a big salary off his books. Check that, it could come as early as next week, knowing how cheap Nutting is. He’s the worst owner in sports for a reason. The proof is the Pirates’ payroll every season.</p>
<p>We are to the point now where it’s hard to say what will be more costly with Marte and his $11.5 million salary off to the desert — the Pirates’ 2020 payroll or the cost of two burgers, fries and a shake. You might have to throw in an apple turnover to break the tie.</p>
<p>Nutting will insist the Pirates aren’t rebuilding, of course. He will ask you to give Williams, Cherington and Shelton a chance, as if you have some other choice. In a way, it’s not an outrageous request by Nutting. Pirates fans certainly have had plenty of experience watching losing teams. They must be used to it by now. What is it? A total of 23 losing seasons in the past 27 years? Just three playoff appearances since 1992?</p>
<p>Cleveland Browns fans might be the only fans with more experience following a laughable, losing franchise.</p>
<p>Don’t you just love being associated with Cleveland fans?</p>
<p>Don’t you love living in Nutting’s baseball world?</p>
