<h1>PPS sees high student login percentage during first month of virtual learning</h1>

<p>The vast majority of Pittsburgh Public Schools students logged into the district’s web-based learning platform during the first month of remote instruction, administrators said.</p>
<p>David May-Stein, the district’s chief of school performance, said during a board education committee meeting Tuesday that as of Oct. 5 about 98% of students had logged into the Schoology platform.</p>
<p>“We are keeping a close eye on student attendance as it relates to students actually logging into the system,” Mr. May-Stein said.</p>

<p>The district will be completely virtual through at least Nov. 9 as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. Even if students can return to class in person in November, it would only be a couple of days per week in a blended model, which would also include some remote instruction.</p>
<p>Students who typically attend the district’s brick-and-mortar schools have accessed classes and assignments through the learning management system Schoology since the start of the 2020-21 school year.</p>
<p>According to the district, 523 out of 21,676 students in pre-K-12 have not logged into Schoology. Removing pre-kindergarten students, 429 out of 20,544 students have not logged into the system.</p>
<p>“The 523 and 429 students continue to be a great concern to us,” Mr. May-Stein said.&nbsp;“We are working very hard to locate these students.”</p>
<p>It is likely, Mr. May-Stein said, that many of the students who have not logged into Schoology transferred into another district or charter school. It is up to the student’s new school to inform the old district about the transfer, a process that has been slower than usual this year.</p>
<p>Technology should not be an issue because all students are either using a personal device or have received one through the district, administrators said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district has placed the students who have not logged into Schoology as well as those with three or more unexcused absences since the first day of school — groups that overlap —&nbsp;in a category called&nbsp;“hard to reach students.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. May-Stein said the district has teachers, counselors, social workers and principals working in tandem to contact the hard-to-reach students. That includes calling and sending text messages to students and their families, as well as home visits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district is also utilizing the “Focus on Attendance” initiative — a collaboration between the district and the Allegheny County Department of Human Services —&nbsp;to locate the hard-to-reach students and determine what additional supports they may need.</p>
<p>“We continue to work nonstop to identify who these children are so that we can either get them in school or identify that they are in [a different] school. It’s either one or the other,” Mr. May-Stein said.&nbsp;“We won’t be finished until that number is zero.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
