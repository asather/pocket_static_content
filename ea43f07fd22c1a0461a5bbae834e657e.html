<h1>Pet Tales: Flamingos squawk and pigeons take 'royal stroll' in new aviary exhibit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On a cold Thursday morning, the wetlands habitat inside the National Aviary was a welcome respite. It was pleasantly warm and slightly steamy, sort of like a mild sauna. &nbsp;Birds and visitors surrounded by beautiful plants, flowers and trees participated in an interactive new program called&nbsp;“Escape to the Islands.”</p>
<p>Also highlighted are Victoria crowned pigeons, little African penguins and giant fruit-eating bats with 5-foot wing spans.&nbsp;The scene-stealers are 10 beautiful American flamingos. Though they all look exactly alike, their trainer says she can tell them apart&nbsp;“because each has a distinctive personality.”</p>
<p>They each have a name, too — nine of them are Muppet monikers. The outlier is Marilyn, so named&nbsp;“because she is just so feminine,” said Cathy Schlott, curator of behavioral management and animal programs at the North Side bird zoo.</p>
<p>Bean, Fozzie, Scooter, Animal, Piggy, Beaker, Bunsen, Rizzo, Sweetums and Marilyn put on quite a show for media reporters and photographers.&nbsp;I’ve never seen the flamingos so active.&nbsp; All 10 of them jumped around and spread their wings.</p>
<p>“They talk and dance and communicate with each other. It’s part of the flamingo dynamic,” Ms. Schlott said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They usually stand quietly in their wetlands pool. On Thursday, the flamingos&nbsp; made so much noise it was sometimes hard to hear the interesting patter and commentary of Ms. Schlott. She trains the flamingos and all the other birds, including hawks, owls, eagles and vultures.</p>
<p>The flamingos squawked, screeched and flapped because they were excited to see their trainer and visitors. They have learned that Ms. Schlott and visitors will feed them every day at 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Into the water we threw small brown things that look like dry dog food but smell kind of fishy. The flamingos and ducks really enjoyed that, rushing around the pool picking up the pieces.&nbsp;Ms. Schlott stood in the water with the birds, holding a big bowl of treats. One of the flamingos leaned up against her like a loyal and loving dog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s Fozzie. We are good friends,” Ms. Schlott said with a smile as Fozzie helped himself to the treats in her bowl.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh flamingos range in age from 2 to 20 years old. In zoos they live 40-50 years. In their native island habitats in the islands of the Caribbean and Galapagos, they generally live 20-30 years, the aviary staff said.</p>
<p>In the Tropical Rainforest, the Victoria crowned pigeons are fan favorites, because they stay on the walkways and mix and mingle with visitors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They have an adventurous and inquisitive nature” and enjoy close-up observations of people, Ms. Schlott said. She has trained them to take a “royal stroll”&nbsp; through the rainforest into the Canary’s Call exhibit. They’ll do that every day at 11 a.m. and 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>“We use positive reinforcement,” rewarding birds with treats, Ms. Schlott said.&nbsp;“We ask them to do something, but if they don’t want to, they don’t have to.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the first day the program was presented to the public, the pigeons thrilled the children and babies in strollers who followed them. On Thursday, Ferdinand and Fran walked the walk in perfect fashion.</p>
<p>Victoria crowned pigeons are the world’s biggest pigeons. They’re about the size of good-sized chickens, they have lovely blue and grey feathers and their heads are topped with feathery crowns.</p>
<p>The species is named for England’s Queen Victoria. Ferdinand and his mate, Isabella, are named for Spanish royalty. They hatched Fran in September, and the chick is already almost as big as they are. DNA testing to determine the sex has not been done yet.</p>
<p>The big pigeons are native to New Guinea. The aviary has had breeding pairs since 1952.</p>
<p>Also in the rainforest are Wookie, the sloth, and my favorite bird, Benito, a hyacinth macaw with his female friend, Sapphira.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The always popular African penguins, who breed on the islands off the coast of South Africa, have public feedings at 1 and 4 p.m.</p>
<p>“Hang with Bats” every day at 3 p.m. The four Malayan Flying Foxes sleep most of the day with leathery wings folded tight against their bodies. They’ve been trained to show visitors their 5-foot wing spans. They have big eyes and adorable furry faces that look like Chihuahua dogs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Escape to the Islands runs until May 22. There’s no extra charge — it’s covered by the admission, which is $17 for adults, $16 for children ages 2-12, $16 for seniors 60+ and $2 for Access card holders. Kids under 2 get in for free. Hours are 10 a.m.-5 p.m. every day.</p>
