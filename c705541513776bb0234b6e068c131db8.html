<h1>Construction company sues for $1 million over new Thomas Jefferson H.S.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Carnegie construction company is suing West Jefferson Hills School District for breach of contract for failing to pay it nearly $1 million as part of the new high school project.</p>
<p>Gito Inc., which operates as Nello Construction Company, filed the complaint in Allegheny County Common Pleas Court on Monday.</p>
<p>It seeks $936,926.80.</p>
<p>Nello said in its complaint that it entered into a contract with the district on Feb. 16, 2016, to perform general contracting work in the construction of the new Thomas Jefferson High School, which opened to students in August.</p>
<p>The contracted amount was $44.2 million, the lawsuit said, but changes over the course of construction increased the amount to $48.3 million.</p>
<p>On Dec. 11, 2019, Nello sought $857,000, which represented a reduction in the $1.5 million retention fund to cover any reasonable and remaining work on the project, said Nello attorney Dean Falavolito.</p>
<p>The district did not challenge that payment within 15 days, the complaint said, so therefore its failure to pay violates the Prompt Pay Act.</p>
<p>On Feb. 21, Nello issued an additional bill for nearly $80,000 for a change order that had previously been approved by the district. That change order, Mr. Falavolito said, was to upgrade security doors.</p>
<p>Again, the complaint said, the district didn’t pay or challenge the bill.</p>
<p>Mr. Falavolito said he has repeatedly told the district if the bills weren’t paid that a civil complaint would be filed.</p>
<p>“We haven’t been able to get the school board to move on it,” he said. “I’ve been telling them every day for the past 30 days.”</p>
<p>A message with the district solicitor was not immediately returned.</p>
<p>Although the new high school opened to students in August, some work is still ongoing, the attorney said, including landscaping changes, addressing sound panels in the auditorium and roof work.</p>
