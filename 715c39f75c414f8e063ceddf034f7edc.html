<h1>Gaining steam -- old locomotive roundhouse could be next Hazelwood Green redevelopment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An old locomotive roundhouse dating back to the late 1800s could represent the next stage of development at the former LTV Coke Works in Hazelwood.</p>
<p>Almono LLC, the owner of the sprawling 178-acre site on the Monongahela River, is proposing to convert the structure for a business use, with a small addition to be built as part of the project.</p>
<p>It will brief Pittsburgh Planning Commission members on the proposal Tuesday.</p>
<p>The project would represent the second major undertaking at the site, now known as Hazelwood Green, following the redevelopment of Mill 19 by the Regional Industrial Development Corp.</p>
<p>According to planning commission documents, the addition would be built at the rear of the roundhouse to house “vertical circulation serving a new partial second floor within the existing building.”</p>
<p>Almono LLC — a partnership made up of The Heinz Endowments, the Richard King Mellon Foundation and the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation — plans to reuse some of the roundhouse’s existing brick, concrete and steel as part of the redevelopment.</p>
<p>The project also would include public open space and landscape improvements. There also would be eight outside and 10 inside bicycle parking spaces and three accessible parking spaces for vehicles.</p>
<p>Other amenities include a rain garden and outside seating areas. Almono LLC is seeking an environmentally friendly LEED Gold certification for the complex.</p>
<p>No other details were available Thursday.</p>
<p>The roundhouse project could signal a new phase of development at the site. Beyond the RIDC’s work at Mill 19, a 265,000-square-foot complex built from the bones of an old coke works structure, there has not been much activity at Hazelwood Green.</p>
<p>Uber Technologies leases 50 acres for a test track for its self-driving cars. But that lease expires in 2023 and Uber does not intend to renew it.</p>
<p>At Mill 19, the first building erected by RIDC houses Carnegie Mellon University’s Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute and its Manufacturing Futures Initiative. Catalyst Connection also has moved into the building.</p>
<p>This spring, autonomous vehicle startup Aptiv will be moving into a second building, about 70,000 square feet in size, within the Mill 19 complex. A third building is being designed, but construction probably won’t start until RIDC has a signed tenant.</p>
<p>The Almono partnership recently hired U3 Advisors, a consultant based in New York and Philadelphia, to advise it “on matters relating to Hazelwood Green site management, tenanting, and site-wide development strategies.”</p>
<p>U3 Advisors will take over from the Remake Group, which took charge of the overall development in 2016 from RIDC.</p>
