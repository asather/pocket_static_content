<h1>Inspired by Bethel Park family, Congress moves to shed light on unexplained deaths in children </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON —&nbsp;More than three years ago, Stephanie Zarecky of Bethel Park faced every parent's worst nightmare: The death of her daughter,&nbsp;Scarlett Lillian Pauley, at 16 months old.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Medical Examiner could not determine the cause of Scarlett's death, placing her in a confounding category of death called Sudden Unexplained Death in Childhood, or SUDC.&nbsp;Ms. Zarecky, while still grappling at this mystery, turned to advocacy to raise awareness of the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, new legislation moving through Congress would require more research into such childhood deaths and standardize death investigations to glean more information. The bill — introduced by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and supported by Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills — carries her daughter’s name:&nbsp;Scarlett’s Sunshine on Unexpected Death Act.</p>
<p>“We’ve done far too little for far too long to really move the needle on what’s happening with these kids,” Ms. Zarecky said in an interview Monday.&nbsp;“We can’t just accept that sometimes healthy kids just die. We can’t accept that notion.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why this happened to Scarlett, so I don’t know why it won’t happen to my other daughter or other children I may have someday,” she said. “And I don’t know why it won’t happen to my family or my friends and their kids.”</p>
<p>SUDC is defined as a sudden or unexpected death in children who are at least 1 year of age that remains unexplained after a thorough investigation,&nbsp;including an autopsy.&nbsp;These&nbsp;unexplained deaths occur in about 400 American children each year,&nbsp;according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, making it&nbsp;the fifth leading category of death in young children.</p>
<p>An additional 3,600 infants are lost each year to Sudden Unexpected Infant Death, or SUID, which is the sudden death of an infant under 1 year of age that, when first discovered, did not have an obvious cause.</p>
<p>Because of the lack of a standardized way to attribute deaths related to those two unexplained categories, it is impossible to know how widespread the problem&nbsp;is, said Ms. Zarecky, who is currently the ambassador program and public relations manager for the SUDC Foundation, a New Jersey-based nonprofit.</p>
<p>“We need good data,” Ms. Zarecky said,&nbsp;“that will&nbsp;hopefully eventually lead us to a point where we can have more research and figure out why these deaths are happening and figure out how to prevent them in the future.”</p>
<p>Last April, Mr. Casey introduced legislation aimed at&nbsp;strengthening efforts to better understand the deaths by encouraging data collection and analysis to improve prevention efforts.</p>
<p>The bill, among other things,&nbsp;directs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to assess whether a death investigation reporting form needs to be updated. And it requires the department to submit&nbsp;annual reports to Congress including a count of deaths and actions taken to prevent them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bill passed the Senate unanimously in May. Last week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously advanced the bill to the House floor.</p>
<p>In January, three years to the day since she lost her daughter,&nbsp;Ms. Zarecky testified before the health care panel of the House Energy and Commerce Committee. She recounted for lawmakers the memories of Scarlett’s death:&nbsp;“Three years and 10 hours ago, a doctor told us there was nothing more they could do and my Scarlett, the very reason for every beat of my heart and every breath I took, was gone.”</p>
<p>The autopsy results, after five months of waiting, revealed no cause.&nbsp;Ms. Zarecky then went to New York University to seek another review of Scarlett's death. That, too, turned up no answers.</p>
<p>She said she felt honored the bill was named in Scarlett’s honor. Any parent who has lost a child, she said, fears their child’s memory will be forgotten.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I feel like as long as I can keep speaking her name and keep sharing her story, that in some way it keeps her alive,” she said.&nbsp;“So we really need to keep pushing.”</p>
