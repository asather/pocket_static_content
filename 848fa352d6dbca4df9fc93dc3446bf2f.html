<h1>Pirates commit to baseball operations, while higher-ups may take less</h1>

<p>As Major League Baseball grapples with lost revenue during the coronavirus pandemic, the Pirates are doing their best to weather the storm.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, that included a couple steps taken to offer certainty and also protect against potential future losses while games are missed because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The Pirates have committed to paying their non-playing baseball operations employees through the end of May, becoming the 20th MLB club to offer some sliver of certainty after commissioner Rob Manfred recently told teams he intended to suspend Uniform Employee Contracts on May 1.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pirates are also exploring possible salary reductions for “highly compensated” employees. Any changes would be made on a tiered basis, where those at the top would have a larger percentage reduced.</p>
<p>"There is obviously a lot of uncertainty and speculation around the 2020 season," Pirates president Travis Williams said in a statement. "While the league is looking at multiple scenarios, each represents a significant negative impact to our operations. As has been the case throughout this rapidly-changing crisis, we are working hard to minimize its effect on our employees."</p>
<p>Those with UECs include major and minor league managers, coaches, scouts and front-office personnel. The move would allow teams to furlough or reduce the pay of those on them to save money and mitigate losses.</p>
<p>However, Williams and general manager Ben Cherington informed those in baseball operations on Tuesday morning that their pay, through at least May, would not be affected.</p>
<p>The other MLB teams to take this step include the Diamondbacks, Braves, Red Sox, Cubs, White Sox, Reds, Rockies, Tigers, Astros, Royals, Marlins, Brewers, Twins, Phillies, Padres, Giants, Mariners, Cardinals and Blue Jays.</p>
<p>Curiously, big-market teams such as the Yankees and Dodgers have not yet made the commitment to pay baseball operations employees through the end of May.</p>
<p>“Part of what makes this situation so difficult is that nobody truly knows with absolute certainty what the short-term and long-term outlook will be moving forward," Williams added. "The coronavirus and its impact on our community and our sport evolves by the day."</p>
<p>The Padres have promised their employees they would be paid through the end of the regular season, while others have taken pay cuts. That group includes Marlins CEO Derek Jeter, who’s forgoing his $5 million salary, and several higher-ups with the Texas Rangers, who agreed to take less.</p>
<p>Senior staff with MLB will also be taking a 35 percent pay cut, Manfred announced a week ago.</p>
<p>"We wish that we didn’t have to have these conversations, but they have become necessary as this crisis continues to impact our operations," Williams said. "We will always keep the best interests of our employees and the organization in mind, and continue doing everything we can to support our community."</p>
