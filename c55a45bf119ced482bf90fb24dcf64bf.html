<h1>Shutting down potent Montreal top line especially important for Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With Game 1 of the NHL's qualifying round just days away, Penguins forward Zach Aston-Reese was asked Monday about the matchup with Montreal. Specifically, what makes that potent Canadiens top line go?</p>
<p>Well, about that ...</p>
<p>“I’m not sure who exactly is on their top line,” Aston-Reese admitted.</p>
<p>Give him some credit for the honesty. He probably deserves a pass, too. The quote wasn't nearly as inflammatory as some made it seem on social media. It’s not like players are scrolling Twitter for line combinations every day.</p>
<p>But when the puck drops on the postseason on Saturday, Montreal’s top line will certainly be one the Penguins will need to have an eye on. And depending how coach Mike Sullivan chooses to game plan this matchup, Aston-Reese in particular might get familiar with this trio.</p>
<p>The combo of Tomas Tatar (61 points), Phillip Danault (47) and Brendan Gallagher (43) has combined for nearly 44% of the 346 points tallied by Habs forwards. Obviously, it’s common for the top line to have the most firepower.</p>
<p>But for a Canadiens team that sold at the trade deadline and entered&nbsp;the postseason as the 12th and final seed, depth is not a strength. A top-heavy lineup means the production drops off quickly thereafter.</p>
<p>Here are how the other three shake out (percentages based on productions from forwards alone):</p>
<p>• Jonathan Drouin (15 points) — Nick Suzuki (41) — Joel Armia (30) = 86 (24.8%)</p>
<p>• Paul Byron (10) — Jesperi Kotkaniemi (8) — Artturi Lehkonen (27) = 45 (13%)</p>
<p>• Dale Weise (5) — Max Domi (44) — Jordan Weal (15) = 64 (18%)</p>
<p>There are only a handful of ways the Canadiens can upset the Penguins in the qualifying round. Goalie Carey Price stealing a couple games would be at the top of the list. A leaky Penguins goalie is probably next.</p>
<p>But if the Penguins can keep Tatar, Danault and Gallagher off the scoreboard — or at least in check — their odds of extending their stay in the Toronto bubble would be even higher.</p>
<p>This is where Aston-Reese and his buddies come in.</p>
<p>This season, the Penguins’ don’t-call-it-a-fourth-line of Teddy Blueger, Brandon Tanev and Aston-Reese came together almost out of necessity during an early injury-ravaged stretch. They forged chemistry and a clear identity as a tight-checking, pesky unit. Aston-Reese thinks maybe the fact that they’re all college guys had something to do with it, as they’re used to the muck-and-grind style.</p>
<p>No matter where it came from, Sullivan liked the group enough that he kept them together when the Penguins got healthier. He also trusted them enough to play them in disadvantageous situations.</p>
<p>By far, the Blueger line racked up the most defensive zone starts (about 70%). And — this is the key here — they frequently started the game against an opponent’s top line or soon found themselves on the ice for a key faceoff against the opposing team’s firepower.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We embrace the challenge of trying to play against other teams’ top lines,” Tanev said. “Teddy, Zach and I, we like that challenge. We want it every night if that’s the case.”</p>
<p>Only Sullivan knows exactly how he plans to dictate matchups. With newfound health and a lineup bolstered by deadline-day acquisitions, he may simply want to go strength vs. strength and throw the Sidney Crosby or Evgeni Malkin line against the Canadiens’ top unit.</p>
<p>But there’s a decent chance if the Blueger line isn’t staring down Tatar, Danault and Gallagher for the opening faceoff, they’ll be seeing them soon after.</p>
<p>“They’re an important line for our hockey team,” Sullivan said. “We play them in difficult situations and they embrace that challenge.</p>
<p>“If we ask them on a given night to play against an opponent’s top line, they welcome that challenge. Depending on how we choose to deploy our top six sometimes has an influence on how those guys are being utilized. They understand what they bring to this team, and they play the game extremely well.”</p>
<p>On a team with Crosby and Malkin, it’s easy to overlook the contributions of the players lower on the depth chart. But whether it’s this series or the next one, Aston-Reese, Blueger and Tanev are likely to find themselves against players whose names you just might know.</p>
<p>“Any team that you go against their superstars, it’s going to be the same thing,” Aston-Reese said. “They’re all skilled players. To play against those guys, you just have to play a gritty game and a hard game and make it tough on them.”</p>
