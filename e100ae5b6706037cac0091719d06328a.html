<h1>Is CDC recommending you shave your beard to protect against coronavirus?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention graphic from 2017 has resurfaced in the wake of coronavirus panic, showing which facial hair styles could render respirators useless. Media outlets and some on social media are spreading the graphic with the claim that the CDC is telling people to shave their beards to protect against the virus.</p>
<p>But is the CDC actually telling people this? No, it’s not.</p>
<p>The CDC guidelines and the graphic were originally posted as part No-Shave November in 2017 as advice to those wanting to grow beards during that month. It specifically points out the difficulties beards could pose with tight-fitting respirators used in certain industries and not looser-fitting surgical masks. (Masks and respirators are being utilized around the world to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus, which has reached more than 80,000 cases globally.)</p>
<p>According to 3M, surgical masks are not designed to protect your lungs from airborne hazards and do not fit tightly to the face to begin with. They are designed to reduce the amount of spit and mucus the wearer expels.</p>
<p>By contrast, respirators — which cover at least the nose and mouth — actually filter particles from the air when properly fitted and are secured tightly to the face. These particulate and surgical respirators are what the CDC guidelines specifically address.</p>
<p>“Facial hair that lies along the sealing area of a respirator, such as beards, sideburns, or some mustaches, will interfere with respirators that rely on a tight facepiece seal to achieve maximum protection,” the CDC said in its blog entry.</p>
<p>More specifically,&nbsp;facial hair may keep the respirator's exhalation valve from working properly if the two come into contact, the CDC infographic said. No matter the style choice, the hair should not cross the respirator sealing surface.</p>
<p>A goatee, horseshoe and villain mustache are OK, with caution, the infographic noted.</p>
<p>In an updated FAQ as of a couple weeks ago, the CDC stated it does not recommend the use of respirators outside of work. It also does not recommend the use of face masks to protect yourself against the coronavirus unless recommended by your doctor.</p>
<p>“A facemask should be used by people who have COVID-19 and are showing symptoms,” the CDC wrote. “This is to protect others from the risk of getting infected. The use of facemasks also is crucial for health workers and other people who are taking care of someone infected with COVID-19 in close settings.”</p>
<p>And nowhere in the CDC’s current information on the coronavirus does it advise you to shave your beard.</p>
