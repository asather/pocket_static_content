<h1>Gov. Pritzker lays out five-phase, regional plan for reopening Illinois</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday laid out a regional, five-phase plan to reopen the state based on public health data and health care availability in different parts of the state.</p>
<p>The plan divides the state into four regions, which could enter different phases of reopening at different times.</p>
<p>The fifth and final phase -- “Illinois restored” -- won’t come until a vaccine or highly effective treatment becomes widely available. Festivals, conventions, and all businesses and schools would reopen.</p>

<p>“Until we have a vaccine or an effective treatment or enough widespread immunity that new cases fail to materialize, the option of returning to normalcy doesn’t exist,” Pritzker said at his briefing Tuesday.</p>
<p>To varying degrees, the entire state is already in Phase 2 of the plan, labeled “flattening,” which allows for nonessential retail businesses to reopen for curbside pickup and delivery and for additional outdoor activities like golf and boating to resume under social distancing guidelines. These new rules took effect Friday.</p>
<p>The earliest a region can move to the third phase is May 29, Pritzker said.</p>
<p>The state Department of Public Health will be tracking the four regions based on a number of metrics, which will be available online so the public can track it, Pritzker said.</p>
<p>“Just as public health indicators will tell us when to move forward at any time, they could also signal that we need to move backwards,” Pritzker said.</p>
<p>The third phase, called “recovery,” would come when the number of COVID-19 patients being admitted to hospitals and the number needing intensive-care unit beds is stable or declining. In this phase, manufacturing, offices, retailers, and barbershops and salons could reopen, with capacity limits and other restrictions. Face coverings would still be required.</p>
<p>In the fourth phase -- “revitalization” -- gatherings of 50 or more would be allowed to resume, restaurants, bars, child care centers and schools would reopen under guidance from state public health officials. Face coverings would still be required, as would social distancing measures. Reaching this phase would require a continued decline in the rate of new infections and hospitalizations.</p>
<p>To move forward from the current phase that took effect Friday, the share of people testing positive for the coronavirus would have to be at or under 20% and increase no more than 10 percentage points over a 14-day period. There would have to be no overall increase in hospital admissions for COVID-19-like illness for 28 days and enough hospital and ICU capacity to handle a 14% surge.</p>
<p>The requirements would be the same for a wider range of businesses to open under Phase 4 of the plan. But moving to that stage also would require widespread testing to be available, regardless of symptoms or risk factors. Contact tracing also would have to be available within 24 hours of diagnosis for 90% of cases in the region.</p>
<p>State officials on Tuesday reported the highest number of COVID-19 fatalities in a 24-hour period yet, announcing 176 additional deaths on Tuesday. The statewide death toll now stands at 2,838. Officials also announced 2,122 new known cases, bringing the total number of known infections in Illinois to 65,962.</p>
