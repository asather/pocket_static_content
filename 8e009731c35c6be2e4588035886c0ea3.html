<h1>Ex-city school official sues district on retaliation claim</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former top official with the Pittsburgh Public Schools has sued the district, saying he was a victim of retaliation after he supported an executive secretary in her own discrimination claim.</p>
<p>Anthony Anderson, who had been a deputy superintendent, filed the complaint Friday in U.S. District Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson, who worked for the district from 2016 to 2019, had been the direct supervisor of Kristen Frankovich, the chief executive secretary.</p>
<p>In March 2019, she filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission claiming discrimination based on her race, which is white.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson supported her claim, according to the suit, and told other officials about his encouragement. Sometime later, the communications director, Mercedes Williams, told Mr. Anderson to "be careful" because the district was "looking into" Ms. Frankovich, according to the suit.</p>
<p>On June 19, 2019, the school board determined that Mr. Anderson's contract would not be renewed after its completion in October of that year.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson and his lawyer, Joel Sansone, who also represents Ms. Frankovich, said in the complaint that his employment was not renewed "in retaliation of and/or support for Ms. Frankovich's protected activity in filing a charge of discrimination" with the EEOC.</p>
<p>Mr. Anderson said the district also refused to pay him $59,500 that he felt was owed him for supplementary work he had done for the district. The suit said that refusal was also retaliation for supporting Ms. Frankovich.</p>
<p>The suit is asking for that money as well as unspecified lost wages and benefits stemming from the loss of his position as deputy superintendent.</p>
