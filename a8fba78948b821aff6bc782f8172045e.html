<h1>Myles Garrett doubles down on racial slur allegation against Mason Rudolph</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One day after being <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/12/myles-garrett-reinstatement-browns-mason-rudolph-helmet/stories/202002120109" target="_blank">reinstated by the NFL</a>, Browns defensive end Myles Garrett is already talking about the Nov. 14 brawl with Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph that got him suspended in the first place.</p>
<p>Garrett did an interview with ESPN’s Mina Kimes airing on&nbsp;“SportsCenter” Thursday night in which he doubled down on his previous allegation that the fight with Rudolph started because the Steelers QB called him a racial slur.</p>
<p>“He called me the N-word,” <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28697201/myles-garrett-again-alleges-mason-rudolph-called-racial-slur-sparking-brawl" target="_blank">Garrett told Kimes</a>. “He called me a ‘stupid N-word.’ ”</p>
<p>That allegation first surfaced days after the fight on “Thursday Night Football” where Garrett hit Rudolph with his own helmet. The incident got Garrett suspended “indefinitely” and Steelers center Maurkice Pouncey — who rushed to Rudolph’s defense — suspended for three games, a punishment that was eventually reduced to two.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, Rudolph&nbsp;adamantly denied calling Garrett a racial slur and his teammates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/11/21/mason-rudolph-racial-slur-allegations-myles-garrett-appeal-browns-steelers-fight/stories/201911210165" target="_blank">had his back</a> after Garrett fired off the initial accusation. But Garrett is sticking by his story.</p>
<p>“When he said it, it kind of sparked something, but I still tried to let it go and still walk away,” Garrett told Kimes. “But once he came back, it kind of reignited the situation. And not only have you escalated things past what they needed to be with such little time in the game left, now you’re trying to re-engage and start a fight again. It’s definitely not entirely his fault, it’s definitely both parties doing something that we shouldn’t have been doing.</p>
<p>“I don’t say the N-word, whether it’s with ‘a’ [or] ‘er.’ To me personally, just shouldn’t be said, and whether it’s by family, friends, anyone. I don’t want to use it because I don’t want [people to] find that appropriate around me for anyone to use.”</p>
<p>ESPN reached out to the Steelers about Garrett’s comments Thursday, and the team pointed the worldwide leader to its initial statement on the matter.</p>
<p>Part of that statement read: “Mason vehemently denies the report of being accused of using a racial slur during the incident.”</p>
