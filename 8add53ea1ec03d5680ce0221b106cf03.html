<h1>Where there's a Will... Shakespeare celebration goes digital</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Happy 456th birthday to that timeless wordmaster, William Shakespeare. The Bard, born in April 1564, would totally get social distancing — he lived through several waves of the Black Plague that ravaged London and closed all of the city’s theaters.</p>
<p>During this pandemic, Pittsburgh Shakespeare in the Parks' sixth annual Week of Will goes online with events starting Monday, including helping hands from local theaters.</p>
<p>The Week of Will begins with the Bard's Birthday Bash, via Zoom, at 7-8 p.m. Monday. Local actors will present favorite monologues, scenes and sonnets, led by Jennifer Tober, PSIP founder and artistic director, and Yvonne Hudson, Pittsburgh’s Mrs. Shakespeare and founder of Week of Will.</p>
<p>Daily events will be announced on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PittsburghShakespeare" target="_blank">Shakespeare in the Parks’ Facebook page,</a> and include artistic leaders from other local companies.&nbsp;Participants include artistic directors Marya Sea Kaminski (Pittsburgh Public Theater); Alan Stanford (PICT Classic Theatre); Mark Clayton Southers (Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company); Karla Boos (Quantum Theatre), April May Ohms (Fluidity Theatre); Alan Irvine (Brawling Bard and PSIP) and Jeffrey Chips (Steel City Shakespeare Centre and director of PSIP's “Cymbeline”).</p>
<p>“It’s wonderfully comforting that Shakespeare’s timeless words can bring us together and speak to our pain, our isolation, our fear during this incredibly difficult time,” Ms. Tober says. “We can share the joy of experiencing each other’s company, talent, and laughter in our online artistic community.”</p>
<p>The BBC Radio and the British Museum, in the series “Shakespeare’s Restless World,” trace how the bubonic plague that swept through London in three waves in the 1500s and 1600s affected the Bard and theaters of the day.</p>
<p>Shakespeare was born into “the first great Elizabethan outbreak in 1563-4, when the plague wiped out a quarter of the population of Stratford,” according to the radio series. In 1603, when he was working in London, the plague returned “and changed the shape of his career ... forcing theaters to close for almost a year and leaving Shakespeare’s company little choice but to head out on the road to tour the provinces.”</p>
<p>The Black Plague swept through London once more before his death in 1616, and continued to ravage the city until the Great Fire of London in 1666.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shakespeare in the Parks, a traveling troupe for 16 years, hopes to bring the Bard’s work back to Pittsburgh’s open spaces in the fall.</p>
