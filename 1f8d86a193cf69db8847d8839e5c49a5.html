<h1>Backyard camping is a hit with young families</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Experiencing &nbsp;the great outdoors may be as easy as pitching a tent in the backyard. &nbsp;Sarah Hanna White and Andrew White of Fox Chapel and Dr. Nicole Velez and Alec Templeton of Shadyside are among the parents setting up camp with their families just beyond the back door.</p>
<p>“The whole coronavirus has allowed for some nice quality family time without all the distractions of kids activities and extracurricular obligations,”&nbsp;said Dr. Velez.&nbsp;“So this has been something that otherwise maybe we wouldn’t have done.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tents are popping up in backyards in Point Breeze, Shadyside, Fox Chapel, Mt. Lebanon and other communities, with smoke signals where fire pits are allowed. Families spending more quality time together is certainly a silver lining for this pandemic summer.</p>
<p>“We are definitly seeing a trend toward oudoor family activities,” said Paul Calandrella, <a href="https://www.rei.com/" target="_blank">REI’</a>s general merchandising manager.&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have been blown away by the creativity of our member community and their passion for getting out even when we are hunkered down. It is a wonderful low-risk way to get the little ones outside.”</p>
<p>Mrs. White, a holistic lifestyle health coach, agreed.</p>
<p>“The laughter, conversation, storytelling and songs that fill our yard — as parents we feel a truly deep connection with our children during these wonderful moments around the campfire,” she said.</p>
<p>It was her husband’s love of nature that got the fire going. He wanted to share it with his family.</p>
<p>“Camping is important to me because it brings me closer to nature, which creates a sense of peace and rejuvenates my soul,” Mr. White said.</p>
<p>“I did not grow up camping at all,” Mrs. White admitted. “It’s all because of my husband that I can now enjoy the connection with nature.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;The family, which includes Watkins, 7, Devlin, 5, and Jennings, 2, camps every summer at Lake Muskoka in Ontario, Canada, with no running water and no electricity. They take baths in the lake, their mother said.</p>
<p>“So camping in our backyard seems modern and civilized compared to that!”</p>
<p>The children are always up for camping, any time of year.</p>
<p>“The backyard transforms into the wilderness for the kids where they forage for sticks to roast the perfect marshmallows for s’mores,” Mrs. White said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>REI, which offers curbside pickup in Pittsburgh, is seeing a strong demand for outdoor chairs, tables, hammocks, larger tents and camp kitchens, noted Mr. Calandrella. Luxury camp beds are another popular item.</p>
<p>“They are super comfortable. You will get as good a night’s sleep on one of those as your own bed,” he insisted.</p>
<p>In the city, Dr. Velez and her husband use their grill as a makeshift campfire for their boys —&nbsp;Oliver, 5, and Sebastian, 3 — to roast marshmallows.</p>
<p>“We have such a small backyard we weren’t comfortable with an open flame like a real fire pit,” Mr. Templeton said. “The grill is great. We flip some burgers and make hot dogs and s’mores.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>The couple have noticed some real benefits to backyard camping. “The bathroom is nearby, and so are their beds if they get scared,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Templeton&nbsp;grew up camping, especially in high school and college. After he met his wife in Boston, they used to camp in Maine, New Hampshire and Massachusetts.</p>
<p>“The kids have kind of got us thinking about doing it again,” he said, noting that family photos of their backyard camp have inspired friends to want to do the same with their children.</p>
<p>In both families, the children help to set up the tent, filling it with pillows, blankets, toys and more. Oliver and Sebastian Templeton have become pros.</p>
<p>“They have been asking to do it again and again,” Mr. Templeton said.&nbsp;“They love it!”</p>
<p>Dad sleeps in the tent with them but says it’s not necessary.&nbsp;“They actually weren’t scared.”</p>
<p>The family is thinking about going on a real camping trip this summer.
