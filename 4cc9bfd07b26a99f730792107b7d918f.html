<h1>Deutschtown Music Festival canceled due to pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Deutschtown Music Festival, the biggest summer event for the Pittsburgh music scene, has been canceled due to the Covid-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The eighth annual North Side festival was scheduled for July 17-19.</p>
<p>“It is our responsibility to assure public health -- for the safety of our fans, musicians and venue&nbsp;operators. We feel that having the festival go on with thousands of people gathering for three&nbsp;days would be irresponsible and reckless at this unprecedented time,” said Cody Walters, co-founder of the festival. “As DIY organizers, we have always had the well-being of our&nbsp;participating musicians and attendees at the forefront of everything we do.”</p>
<p>According to the organizers, the 2019 festival, which featured more than 400 acts in 40 indoor and outdoor venues, drew more than 40,000 people.</p>
<p>“Please stay safe and thank the heroes who deliver the goods, stock the shelves, check out&nbsp;your groceries, and especially the first responders and medical professionals who keep us&nbsp;healthy and safe during these trying times,” Walters said.</p>
