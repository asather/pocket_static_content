<h1>Can Pitt's pass rush repeat 2019 performance against Syracuse?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Syracuse native SirVocea Dennis missed out on Pitt’s trip to the Carrier Dome last year. The Panthers’ linebacker played in eight games as a true freshman but was injured that week, couldn’t travel and had to watch from afar in Pittsburgh. At least he liked what he saw against the Orange.</p>
<p>“To see my team beat up on the hometown team,” Dennis said smiling, “it was very exciting.”</p>
<p>“Beat up” is kind of an understatement. The score was tight, with Pitt needing a four-minute drill to kill the clock and close out a 27-20 win last October. But on the other side of the ball, Pitt’s front-seven KO’d the Orange’s overmatched offensive line.</p>
<p>The Panthers logged nine sacks in last year’s win. It was — and still is — the most by Pitt in a single game since 2001. Eleven players were involved in the nine sacks. Syracuse backup Clayton Welch was taken down three times, while starter Tommy DeVito felt the brunt of the other six. And it’s not out of the realm of possibility that DeVito feels the brunt of it again this Saturday at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>Syracuse’s protection is once again woeful. The Orange were forced to start a 6-foot, 288-pound former fullback at left guard against North Carolina in their opener, a game in which Syracuse allowed seven sacks — the most of any Football Bowl Subdivision team this year. The Orange lost by 25 as DeVito completed only 13 of 31 passes for 112 yards.</p>

<p>Add to the equation that Syracuse’s top two rushers, Abdul Adams and Jarveon Howard, opted out of the 2020 season in August, and Dino Babers’ offense is in bad shape. It’s early in the season, but the Orange don’t have a running game to lean on and don’t have a reliable offensive line. It’s pretty much just DeVito back there.</p>
<p>Pitt assistant coach Rob Harley insists his linebackers aren’t talking about Syracuse’s turnstile performance against North Carolina or getting ahead of themselves in any way. Harley said the Panthers’ goal is “to get after the quarterback whether we’re playing the Dallas Cowboys, the L.A. Rams or the Syracuse Orange.”</p>
<p>Pitt head coach Pat Narduzzi took a similar approach Monday, reiterating like he normally does that previous meetings don’t affect upcoming matchups. He contends that this Pitt team is different than its 2019 version, same with Syracuse.</p>
<p>“Our kids played relentless up there. We had a good rush. But you know, we had a lot of good rushes last year. So I’m moving on,” Narduzzi added when asked about the 2019 showing at the Carrier Dome. “The pressure we had last year doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>But coach speak aside, the commonalities between 2019 and 2020 are undeniable.</p>

<p>Six of the 11 Pitt players who contributed to those nine sacks last year will be on the field Saturday. Defensive ends Patrick Jones II and Deslin Alexandre should start, and John Morgan ought to contribute with Rashad Weaver’s COVID-related status up in the air and Habakkuk Baldonado considered day-to-day with an injury. Outside linebackers Phil Campbell and Cam Bright, meanwhile, will roll with the first team as Chase Pine provides cover in the middle.</p>
<p>As for the other five, Jaylen Twyman won’t be there after opting out. Neither will outside linebacker Kylan Johnson, inside linebacker Saleem Brightwell, defensive tackle Amir Watts or safety Jazzee Stocker after running out of eligibility.</p>
<p>But even in the absence of Twyman and Keyshon Camp, Pitt’s defensive tackles — Devin Danielson, Tyler Bentley, David Green and Calijah Kancey — played well in the Panthers’ opener against Austin Peay. Paris Ford, Damar Hamlin and Pitt’s secondary could pressure DeVito if given the chance. And the linebackers, as important as they were in last year’s win, return with the same speed and quickness.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen these guys at practice and we know their potential and what they’re capable of. But this week is going to be another opportunity to show what they can do,” Harley said of his linebackers. “Their talent level and their attributes lend itself to getting after the quarterback. But consistency and execution is going to be what it’s about.”</p>
<p>Maybe DeVito’s legs can slow down Pitt’s pass rush. Maybe the Orange’s running game comes alive to keep the front seven honest. Maybe, just maybe, Syracuse’s offensive line can generate some consistency of its own and execute better than anyone expects.</p>
<p>Or perhaps Saturday will be another beatdown up front.</p>
<p>“What happened last year doesn’t matter,” Narduzzi said. “It’s, ‘What are you going to do this year?’ And they’ll be prepared.”</p>
<p><strong>Fan cutouts</strong></p>
<p>Pitt is now offering fans the opportunity to purchase photo cutouts for games at Heinz Field, Fitzgerald Field House and the Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Heinz Field cutouts cost $100 each, or $150 for Narduzzi to autograph it. The Fitzgerald Field House and Petersen Events Center cutouts cost $50.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are restrictions as to what can be included in the cutout photos. Pitt is prohibiting political statements, logos and slogans, as well as commercial advertising and any “lewd, inappropriate or offensive photos.”</p>
