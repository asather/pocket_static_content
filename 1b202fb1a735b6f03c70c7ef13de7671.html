<h1>Pa. Republicans question Trump trade representative on logic of tariffs</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer defended the Trump administration’s use of import tariffs as a way to put pressure on China and grow American manufacturing during his annual report to Congress on Wednesday, even as two Pennsylvania Republicans questioned the results.</p>
<p>Mr. Lighthizer also painted a rosy picture of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/15/Farmers-farming-agriculture-trade-US-China-deal-tariffs-intellectual-property/stories/202001150140" target="_blank">U.S.-China trade agreement</a> signed in January, saying he believed China could still meet its commitments to purchase $200 billion more in U.S. farming, energy, manufactured goods and services. He called a recent analysis that showed China <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/21/COVID-19-pandemic-US-China-trade-deal-agriculture-farming-energy-Trump/stories/202005210034" target="_blank">far behind on purchases</a> “totally unfair.”</p>
<p>“China is — for the most part — doing what they said they were going to do,” Mr. Lighthizer told the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
<p>Broadly, Mr. Lighthizer’s testimony before the Senate panel and the House Ways and Means Committee was spent mostly defending the use of tariffs and assuring lawmakers China would not escape scrutiny.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the House, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, passed along a complaint from a global flatware producer that has paid millions in tariffs to import products from China into its U.S. headquarters in New Castle. The company,&nbsp;Steelite International America, has put off an expansion because they’re paying tariffs, Mr. Kelly said.</p>
<p>“It’s very hard to find people to make forks and knives and spoons now in the United States,” Mr. Kelly said.&nbsp;“If there’s no American producer, what can I tell them because they have no other option and yet they’re getting burdened with these tariffs.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lighthizer responded that the tariffs were a necessary policy to tackle bigger issues with China. The U.S. Department of Commerce, he pointed out, has offered one-year tariff exemptions to companies that could prove they could not find any U.S. source of goods they were importing.</p>
<p>“If you have a year or two years to make a change, then you should have made a change,” Mr. Lighthizer said.&nbsp;“People have had a substantial period of time to find another source.”</p>
<p>In the Senate,&nbsp;Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., reiterated his long-standing&nbsp;criticism of U.S. tariffs on imports of aluminum and steel. Mr. Trump imposed those tariffs in March 2018 at the behest of producers like Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel, but Mr. Toomey argued the broader economy had been damaged.</p>
<p>“It was the steel and aluminum tariffs and trade war with china that began the deceleration of what had been extremely strong growth,” Mr. Toomey said, noting Pennsylvania had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2019/10/10/Manufacturing-recession-Trump-trade-tensions-tariffs-China-NLMK-Navarro/stories/201909250005" target="_blank">lost manufacturing jobs</a>&nbsp;during Trump’s time in office, even before the pandemic struck.</p>
<p>“Far more people in the business of using steel and aluminum to produce things than [there are] people who actually make steel and aluminum,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Lighthizer responded that he agreed to disagree.</p>
<p>The hearings came weeks before the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade pact is set to take effect. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, expressed concern over reports that the Trump administration is considering another round of steel and aluminum tariffs on Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>Mr. Lighthizer said U.S. officials are concerned about surges in imports from the two countries, and tariffs are “something we are looking at.”</p>
