<p>The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority announced Friday that it will expand its moratorium on water shut-offs for all income levels until the end of May in response to COVID-19 risk.</p>
<p>“Public health and safety is PWSA’s highest priority” PWSA Board Chairman Paul Leger said in a press release. “Given the critical importance of personal hygiene to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and the potential for economic disruptions that may present our customers with unique financial hardships that may affect their ability to pay on time, we feel this action is necessary and appropriate to ensure that no one is without water service at this critical time.”</p>
<p>PWSA already bans winter shutoffs for low-income customers.</p>
<p>The waiver will remain in place until May 31.</p>
<p>The authority will still bill for any water and wastewater services, but termination will not occur for unpaid bills until the moratorium is lifted, PWSA spokesman Will Pickering said.</p>
<p>The agency will also institute several personnel changes, including closing its in-person billing and permit counters&nbsp;“until further notice,” and suspending any work that would involve PWSA staff entering a customer’s home, according to the agency.</p>
<p>Local activists and elected officials are urging other utilities to expand similar measures.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Deb Gross said she plans to issue a will of council Tuesday, asking for utilities and the courts “to explore temporary moratoriums on evictions, residential foreclosures, tax liens on residential properties, and utility shut-offs in response to the COVID-19 global health emergency,” according to draft language she posted online.</p>
<p>“It serves no good to send people who may or may not be sick to shelter systems,” she said by phone Friday.&nbsp;“If we’re looking to flatten the curve and make sure we don't spread virus or slow it down as much as we can, these are proactive measures we can be taking.”</p>
<p>A will of council is not legally binding.</p>
<p>While in-person operations are suspended, PWSA advises that bills can still be paid online, by mail, by phone, through the payment drop box at 1200 Penn Ave., or at remote payment locations at 7 Eleven or Family Dollar stores using the PayNearMe service. Permit applications will be accepted by email at PermitInfo@pgh2o.com. More information on permit submissions can be found at pgh2o.com.</p>
