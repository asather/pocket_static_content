<h1>No new COVID-19 deaths in Western Pa.; Allegheny County reports 9 new cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County reported nine new positive cases of COVID-19, the county health department announced Thursday.</p>
<p>The news comes a day after the county reported no new cases, the first time that’s occurred since its first case was announced on March 14. Since that time, the county has had 2,122 cases — 1,987 confirmed and 135 probable —&nbsp;of the viral disease.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania also recorded no new deaths from the virus. Allegheny County’s death toll, which is the highest totals in the region, held at 177.&nbsp;Of those, 165 were confirmed and 12 were probable.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald noted during a video press conference Wednesday that the county has not seen a spike in cases as a result of the primary election or demonstrations that took place in early June, as reflected in the case numbers over the last two weeks.</p>
<p>State and county health officials warned that just because the numbers statewide are on a downward trend, it does not mean it is time to relax on the guidelines put in place by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They urged Pennsylvania residents to be aware of complacency.</p>
<p>“We are not through this pandemic,” said Dr. Debra Bogen, head of the county health department. “We are making good progress, but we are in the early stages.”</p>
<p>She estimates that no more than 3% of the county has been exposed, leaving 97% still at risk for the respiratory virus.</p>
<p>“(Wednesday’s) report of no new cases does not reflect the real time spread of the virus over Allegheny County,” Dr. Bogen added. “We still have a long way to go.”</p>
<p>The total number of hospitalizations reported by Allegheny County throughout the pandemic is 361. Of them, 144 required intensive care and 70 needed a mechanical ventilator. The county has tested 45,408 people since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The state health department on Thursday reported 42 new deaths and 418 new positive cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>With these new numbers, the state’s total number of cases is 80,236 and the total number of deaths are 6,361.</p>
