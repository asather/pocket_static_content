<h1>Senate acquits Trump of abuse of power and obstruction; impeachment trial ends</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The U.S. Senate voted to acquit President Donald Trump of abuse of power and obstruction charges and allow him to remain in office, ending the third impeachment trial in American history.</p>
<p>The vote — which was 52-48 on the abuse of power charge and 53-47 on the obstruction of Congress charge — was split almost evenly&nbsp;between the parties. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, was the only Republican who broke with his party to joined all&nbsp;45 Democrats and two Independents in voting to convict on the abuse of power charge, while voting to acquit on the obstruction of Congress charge.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s senators were split on the verdict, with Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., voting to convict and Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., voting to acquit on both charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. — who had earlier in the week proposed the Senate censure the president instead of removing him from office —voted to convict on both charges.&nbsp;West Virginia voted for Mr. Trump in 2016 by 42 percentage points.</p>
<p>The acquittal, coming hours after Mr. Trump delivered a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/04/Donald-Trump-State-of-the-union-address-House-impeachment/stories/202002040063?cid=search" target="_blank">defiant State of the Union Address</a>,&nbsp;brings to a close a four-month investigation and trial that paralyzed much of Capitol Hill and exposed deep partisan divides.</p>
<p>In its verdict, the Senate ultimately sided with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/28/trump-impeachment-trial-white-house-wraps-defense-support-grows-for-witnesses/stories/202001280147?cid=search" target="_blank">White House defense lawyers who argued</a> Mr. Trump’s actions to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation into a political rival did not meet the Constitutional standard for removing a president from office.</p>
<p>The chamber rejected the arguments and evidence presented by a team of six House Democrats who prosecuted the case against Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The House Democrats accused <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/02/03/house-democrats-trump-likely-acquittal-impeachment-trial-2020-election-interference/stories/202002030077?cid=search" target="_blank">Mr. Trump of abusing his power</a> by freezing nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine and delaying a White House meeting with its new president to extort the American ally into helping his prospects in this November’s election.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, the Democrats asserted, demanded Ukraine to announce a probe into a Ukrainian energy firm, Burisma, on whose board sat Hunter Biden, son of former Vice President Joe Biden.</p>
<p>In December, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/12/18/Donald-Trump-impeachment-House-Congress-debate/stories/201912180102?cid=search" target="_blank">House voted 228-187</a> to impeach Mr. Trump, setting the stage for the trial.</p>
<p>The result of Wednesday’s verdict was not a surprise: From the outset, it was highly unlikely the Republican-controlled Senate would get to the 67 votes required for Mr. Trump’s removal. The previous two impeachment trials resulted in acquittals for President Andrew Johnson in 1868 and President Bill Clinton in 1999.</p>
<p>Much of Mr. Trump’s trial was consumed in a furious debate, mostly behind the scenes, over whether to call witnesses who refused to testify or issue subpoenas for documents the White House refused to turn over.</p>
<p>Senators voted at the start of the trial to reject calling witnesses and documents. And, last Friday, after hearing 36 hours of arguments and questioning the prosecution and defense, senators voted again to reject the move. That vote effectively brought the trial to a close.</p>
<p>The rejection of witnesses was unprecedented in Senate impeachment trials of both presidents and federal judges. The Senate called 41 witnesses in Mr. Johnson’s trial and called three witnesses for private depositions in Mr. Clinton’s trial.</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump’s acquittal, coming about nine months before the presidential election, is unlikely to put to rest the underlying accusations of the case.</p>
<p>New revelations are expected to leak out from witnesses that the Senate declined to call and, eventually, from documents the White House refused to provide.</p>
<p>In particular, House Democrats asked unsuccessfully to hear from John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, who resigned last September shortly before the impeachment inquiry started.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton’s upcoming book, called “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” reportedly details a direct demand by Mr. Trump that Mr. Bolton work to freeze the military aid to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.</p>
<p>In recent days, The New York Times an Oval Office conversation occurred in early May and was attended by White House Counsel Pat Cipollone, who led Mr. Trump's defense in the impeachment trial.</p>
<p>Mr. Romney, in a floor speech Wednesday, said he wanted to hear from Mr. Bolton “not only because I believed he could add context to the charges, but also because I hoped that what he might say could raise reasonable doubt and thus remove from me the awful obligation to vote for impeachment.”</p>
<p>It is unclear the House’s next steps to get more answers from Mr. Bolton.&nbsp;Mr. Schiff told Meet The Press on Sunday “Whether it’s in testimony before the House or it’s in his book, the truth will continue to come out.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., another House impeachment manager, promied that “whatever happens in this impeachment trial, we will remain vigilant in the House.”</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell, in his floor speech, acknowledged the political fighting over Mr. Trump’s case will continue.</p>
<p>“This episode is one of a symptom of something much deeper,” Mr. McConnell said. “In the last three years, the opposition to this president has come to relvove around a turly dangerous concept. … One side has decided that defeat simply means the whole system is broken.”</p>
<p>“There is no sign the attacks on our institution will end here,” Mr. McConnell said.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., for her remarks that she would not recognize the verdict.</p>
<p>“Perhaps she’ll tear up the verdict like she tore up the State of the Union address,” Mr. McConnell said, referring to Ms. Pelosi ripping Mr. Trump’s speech in half on national television. “Is this really where you want to go?”</p>
<p>American public opinion was split almost exactly down the middle on impeachment.</p>
<p>A Pew Research Center survey <a href="https://www.people-press.org/2020/01/22/by-a-narrow-margin-americans-say-senate-trial-should-result-in-trumps-removal/" target="_blank">published last week </a>&nbsp;found 51% of Americans believe Mr. Trump should be removed from office. The research organization conducted that survey among 12,638 U.S. adults over two weeks ending Jan. 19.</p>
<p>As he has for the entire trial, Chief Justice John Roberts presided over the final phase. He directing a clerk to read the full text of the two articles then asked senators,&nbsp;“how say you?” in response to the charges. One by one, senators rose from their desks to state&nbsp;“guilty” or&nbsp;“not guilty.”</p>
<p>After the votes were tallied, Mr. Roberts declared the president “is hereby acquitted of said charges.”</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts thanked the Senate staff for their unfailing patience and keen insight” in helping him preside.</p>
