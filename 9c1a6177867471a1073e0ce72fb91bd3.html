<h1>COVID-19 Update: Allegheny County reports 43 new cases, 2 more deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the third time this week, Pennsylvania has reported an increase of over 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 in a single day.</p>
<p>With the additional 1,153 cases for Wednesday, the state has had a total of 158,967 people test positive for the virus. Within the new cases for Wednesday, 132 were reported in Western Pennsylvania. Allegheny County had the highest daily increase with 43 new cases, followed by Beaver County with 19.</p>
<p>Including Wednesday’s new cases, a total of 12,348 people in the Allegheny County have now tested positive for the virus since the pandemic began in mid-March.</p>
<p>The new Allegheny cases came from 516 tests conducted between Sept. 9 and Sept. 29, with “most” of the tests being collected within the last week, health officials said.&nbsp;Those recently testing positive range in age from 4 to 80 years old, with a median age of 27.&nbsp;Among Wednesday’s cases, 15 are confirmed and 28 are probable. Of the probable cases, 17 come from positive antigen tests rather than PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests.</p>
<p>Statewide there was an increase of 19 new COVID-19 related deaths, four of which were in the Pittsburgh region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two of the deaths occurred in Allegheny County, among two individuals in their 80s who lived in long-term care facilities, health officials said. The deaths occurred on Sept. 17 and Sept. 25. The latest deaths bring the county death toll to 382.</p>
<p>The other two deaths in the area were in Mercer County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a press conference Wednesday morning, Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine discussed the new phenomenon of the “COVID-19 long haulers.”</p>
<p>The long haulers, as she called them, refer to people who are considered to be recovered from the virus, meaning they are no longer contagious, but are still experiencing symptoms or dealing with effects of the virus.</p>
<p>A CDC report that studied 18-to-34-year-olds who contracted the virus, but had no other chronic medical conditions, found that 20% of them had not returned to their usual state of health 14 to 21 days after they were confirmed positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“This data and report gives a glimpse to how significant the illness is for those who were younger and previously healthy,” Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>The long-term effects of COVID-19 are more likely to affect women than men, according to Dr. Levine, and based on a study from France, the average age of a long hauler is 40 years old, many of whom are health care workers.</p>
<p>Of Pennsylvania’s total number of cases 10,765 or about 7% are among healthcare workers.</p>
<p>As far as a vaccine is concerned, Dr. Levine reminded people that “you can’t set a date on science.”</p>
<p>“There should be no political influence on when a vaccine is ready, on its distribution and administration,” Dr. Levine said. “I think we remain hopeful that there could be the beginnings of a distribution before the end of the year.”</p>
<p>She went on to explain that a vaccine distribution is likely to happen in three waves, the first being a limited distribution to priority groups like health care workers, then a wider distribution and finally a widespread population distribution.</p>
