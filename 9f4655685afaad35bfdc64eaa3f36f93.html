<h1>Peduto names nominating committee to expand PWSA board</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Thursday announced the formation of a nominating committee that will be tasked with expanding the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority board.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto named five individuals to the committee to be chaired by Mark Nordenberg, University of Pittsburgh chancellor emeritus and chair of the Institute of Politics. The other members will include&nbsp;Community College of Allegheny County President Quintin Bullock, former Regional Asset District Executive Director David Donahoe,&nbsp;Women for a Healthy Environment Executive Director Michelle Naccarati-Chapkis and Heinz Endowments President Grant Oliphant.</p>
<p>Plans to expand the PWSA board from seven to nine members arose from a December 2017 recommendation by Mr. Peduto’s PWSA blue ribbon panel, according to the Thursday announcement.</p>
<p>The newly expanded board will&nbsp;“bring more leadership and oversight to the publicly owned authority,” according to the press release.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto will nominate new board members upon the committee’s recommendation. City Council must grant final approval of nominees.</p>
<p>On Feb. 4, Mr. Peduto nominated City Councilwoman Erika Strassburger to replace Councilwoman Deb Gross on the board.</p>
<p>The current PWSA board meets Friday.</p>
