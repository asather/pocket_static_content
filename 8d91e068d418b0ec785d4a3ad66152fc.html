<h1>Volunteers pitch in to clean up Downtown following Saturday night’s violence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This was one awful, sparkling mess.</p>
<p>As Sunday morning sunshine lit piles of broken glass&nbsp;— on Downtown sidewalks and storefronts and inside banks and drugstores&nbsp;— volunteers went to work, cleaning.</p>
<p>Russell Ruffolo stood holding a broom and dustpan near a Chipotle eatery in Market Square. His white T-shirt read “Justice for George Floyd” on the front and “The Protest Was Hijacked” on the back.</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd died after an encounter with Minneapolis police last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some said this distinctly Pittsburgh “redd up” was almost therapeutic, after the violence of the previous night, when windows were smashed and vehicles damaged. According to a Pittsburgh Public Safety tweet, 60 businesses and properties were affected.</p>
<p>“I was not here for the riots afterward, but I was here when 2,000 or more Pittsburghers stood strong and unified,” said Mr. Ruffolo, who lives in the North Hills.&nbsp;“And I want to make sure that message does not get lost in the actions of those idiots who did the rioting and hurt the people they should have been standing with.”</p>
<p>He and perhaps 60 to 70 others responded to social media posts by Jon Potter, who with his wife, Rachel Adler, runs Pittsburgh Good Deeds. Others joined as impromptu sweepers.</p>
<p>“Around 10 o’clock at night, we were just watching live streams of what was going on, and just thought, ‘Hey, this would be a good thing to do,’” said Mr. Potter, of Green Tree.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Good Deeds has a membership of 1,200 volunteers. People post to the site to request help — from babysitting to car repair — at <a href="https://pghgooddeeds.org/" target="_blank">PghGoodDeeds.org</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Potter said that after he posted a request on social media, he made arrangements to bring his truck to Downtown before 9 a.m. Sunday. He was joined by a second truck. Many volunteers brought their own cleaning supplies, and Pittsburgh Good Deeds was distributing gloves, brooms, dustpans and contractor bags as well.</p>
<p>He said they had tweeted an offer of help to the mayor but received no response, “so right now it is sort of a guerrilla effort.”</p>
<p>Although there were many from the group spread across the area, others just stopped by and asked if they could help.</p>
<p>Near the Sixth Avenue Rite Aid drugstore’s glass cleanup, Kristin Bruno, of Bellevue, was scrubbing Goo Gone over red graffiti on an elevator entrance to the Duquesne Club.</p>
<p>“We just need to do some healing, and I think the best way to do that now is to get the city restored,” she said.</p>
<p>Several streets over on Forbes Avenue, the Headgear cap shop was a mess of broken glass and damaged merchandise. Its windows were laced with spider webs of cracks.</p>
<p>A couple walking by stopped and asked the woman inside if they could help.</p>
<p>Sure, she replied, but added that the door frame was warped. They would have to crawl through. A man, who declined to give his name other than “Adam,” got right to it.</p>
<p>Heard in the background to all of this were the whirr of drills, the buzz of bandsaws. Huge pieces of brown plywood were being affixed to cover broken glass on some of the larger buildings on Wood Street. At the Dollar Bank on Smithfield, a pattern of breaks across the windows was not as startling as the sight of the lobby double doors completely smashed in.</p>
<p>A group of five people, mostly strangers, were carefully sweeping up the considerable amounts of glass inside.</p>
<p>Nekay Ball of the North Side was not at the protests Saturday, but “I did see it all over social media. I saw the ruckus that was happening and I feel like us living here, you have to LIVE here,” she said.&nbsp;“I thought, ‘It’s going to be a whole mess in the morning,’ so I decided to come down here.”</p>
<p>Ms. Ball brought her daughter, Gemia, 7, to help. Also on the scene were Rose Mizerak and her husband, Tom, of Penn Hills.</p>
<p>Wearing a black “Pittsburgh Strong” T-shirt and Harry Potter-verse face mask, Ms. Mizerak worked side by side with Stephanie King of the North Side. The latter’s mask said it all: black, with the initials of “Black Lives Matter” printed in white.</p>
<p>In case a second night of protests evolved, Mr. Potter said, his group would be ready: “We are going to adhere to the curfew, we’re not going to be here after dark.</p>
<p>“But if this happens again, we would love a more coordinated effort with the city.”</p>
