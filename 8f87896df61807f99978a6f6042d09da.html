<h1>Sources: Pirates to pay minor leaguers through June</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates will pay their minor league players at least through the end of June, sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Saturday.</p>
<p>This includes every player in their minor league system, more than 300 in all, though the sources said roster moves are still being contemplated.</p>
<p>Saturday’s move does not involve players who are on the club’s 40-man roster.</p>
<p>If the Pirates do release a player, he would be paid through the end of June while receiving full medical benefits.</p>
<p>This sort of thing has been a hot-button topic in baseball, as a previous agreement that pays minor leaguers $400/week expires on Sunday.</p>
<p>The Athletics aren’t paying minor leaguers through May 31, while several others have offered to pay those players for the entire season, even if it’s canceled.</p>
<p>The largest group of teams is mirroring the Pirates — paying through June, with the plan to make decisions or revaluate at a future date.</p>
<p>Unlike many teams, who have released minor leaguers en masse recently, the Pirates have not released any minor league players since spring training.</p>
