<p>The two political sides will debate over whether to call witnesses who previously refused to testify and subpoena documents blocked by Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>It is the third presidential impeachment trial in the Senate’s history.</p>
<p>Here’s a look at <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/16/donald-trump-impeachment-updates/stories/202001160145" target="_blank">some things you may want to know</a> and what’s happening today:</p>
<p><em><strong>12:45 p.m.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>All 100 senators are on site as trial is set to begin</strong></p>
<p>Amid a heavy police presence on Capitol Hill, all 100 senators have convened for the impeachment trial of President Donald J. Trump. The trial was expected to begin at approximately 1 p.m., with John Roberts, chief justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, presiding over the historic proceeding.</p>
<p>The senators are expected to debate the rules of the upcoming trial together. There has been sharp disagreement over the issue of whether to call witnesses and subpoena documents.</p>
<p>Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has proposed a resolution that calls for speedy trial. The resolution would schedule 24 hours of opening arguments from both sides and allow senators to submit written questions — all before considering whether to call witnesses.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell, addressing the Senate, said his resolution “already has the support of a majority of the Senate.”</p>
<p>“Today we will consider and pass an organizing resolution that will structure the first phase of the trial,” he said. "The eyes are on the Senate."</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell criticized the impeachment investigation led by House Democrats last year. “The president’s lawyers will finally receive a level playing field with the Democrats,” he added. “Finally, some fairness.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, journalists covering the trial are facing restrictions imposed by the Senate that limit access to senators as they come and go to the chamber. Journalists are prohibited from bringing electronic devices into the chamber.</p>
<p>The restrictions “fail to acknowledge what currently works on Capitol Hill,” read a statement from the Standing Committee of Correspondents, which supervises operations in the Senate Press Gallery.</p>
<p>The Regional Reporters Association, which represents Washington correspondents working for news organizations, including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, said the rules “serve no purpose but to hinder the public from learning about their public officials and journalists from doing their job to provide that information.”</p>
