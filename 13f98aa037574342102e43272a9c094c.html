<h1>Watch flamingos dance and go to events that help animals and people</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bird lovers can flock to the tropics and escape winter weather in February without leaving Pittsburgh. Flamingos and other exotic island birds can be viewed indoors at the National Aviary on the North Side.</p>
<p>Flamingo Island Adventure is 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Feb. 22-23. Some visitors will be able to feed the bright pink birds, and all visitors will learn about them.</p>
<p>Learn how the American flamingos build nests out of sand and how they get bright pink or orange plumage from the food that they eat.&nbsp;A flock of flamingos hang out in their Wetlands habitat, and they do a wing-flapping dance when their trainer brings visitors to see them and feed them.</p>
<p>The family friendly fest includes making a flamingo craft to take home, a story time with&nbsp;“Sylvie the Colorful Flamingo” and stretching out long like a flamingo during a yoga game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Aviary staff will explain how the National Aviary saved thousands of flamingo chicks in South Africa last year.</p>
<p>There is no extra charge for this activity. It’s included in the price of admission.</p>
<p><strong>Basket Bashe</strong></p>
<p>Lunch and the chance to win raffle baskets are the main attractions at this weekend’s Paws Across Pittsburgh Basket Bash, from&nbsp;11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Saturday at the Jacob Woll Pavilion in Renzie Park, McKeesport, 2300 Eden Park Blvd.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tickets can be purchased at pawsacrosspittsburgh.com for $10. That covers pasta, salad and drinks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 50 baskets will be raffled, and there will be door prizes and raffles. Winners will be picked at 2 p.m.</p>
<p><strong>Rescue Dog Show</strong></p>
<p>On the heels of the Westminster Kennel Club show for purebred dogs comes the 2020 American Rescue Dog Show, televised on Hallmark Channel. It’s Sunday and Monday at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The show&nbsp;“will once again highlight the heartfelt traits and benefits of mixed breeds and rescued purebreds, including beagles, great Danes, pugs, West Highland white terriers and many more,” according to the news release.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A winner will be crowned in each of 10 categories: belly rubs, couch potato, ears, senior, snoring, special needs, talking, underbite, wiggling and wrinkles. Then, an overall Best in Rescue will be crowned.</p>
<p>PEDIGREE, the presenting sponsor, will award $100,000 to the shelters and rescues that took in the winning dogs.</p>
<p>Go to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hallmarkchannel.com/american-rescue-dog-show" target="_blank">www.hallmarkchannel.com/american-rescue-dog-show</a>&nbsp;to see winsome photos and videos of some of the rescue dogs.</p>
<p><strong>Karaoke for the shelter</strong></p>
<p>Wings, Suds &amp; Songs is the Saturday, Feb. 22 fundraiser for the Beaver County Humane Society. Dance the night away with entertainment by the Casanova Band and karaoke with DJ Hawk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The party is 6:30 to 10 p.m. at Center Stage, 1495 Old Brodhead Road, Monaca.&nbsp;A ticket ($40 in advance, $50 at the door) gets you Bowser’s Restaurant food, including wings, sandwich rings, fries, salad, desserts with access to the cookie table, draft beer and soft drinks.</p>
<p>The $75 VIP package includes guaranteed parking and seating, early arrival, coupon for a free drink and VIP raffle.</p>
<p>Go to beavercountyhumanesociety.org to get tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Healthy Walk</strong></p>
<p>Pets on leashes are welcome to walk in The Highmark Walk for a Healthy Community. Since 2003, more than $15 million has been raised for 273 local health and human service organizations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh walk isn’t until Saturday, May 9 at Heinz Field on the North Side, but online registrations for nonprofit organizations opened on Jan. 31. Nonprofits keep 100 percent of the funds raised by their walkers.</p>
<p>The event has a 3.1-mile route and a 1-mile route. Both are accessible for individuals with disabilities. There will also be entertainment, refreshments and prizes.</p>
