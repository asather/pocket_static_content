<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Parent and guardian visitation to Shuman Juvenile Detention Center has been stopped, effective immediately, according to a Tuesday announcement by Allegheny County officials in response to the growing COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The order comes on the same day that health officials announced the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/24/Second-county-COVID-19-death-is-a-surprise/stories/202003240078" target="_blank">second death in the county due to the virus</a>; the county’s total active cases now stand at 58.</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday, county Treasurer John Weinstein announced a temporary closure of his office&nbsp;“in accordance with Gov. Tom Wolf’s recommendation” days after he announced a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/03/19/County-treasurer-John-Weinstein-extends-real-estate-tax-discount-suspends-court-enforcement-drink-hotel-rental-car/stories/202003190105" target="_blank">discount extension on real estate taxes</a>&nbsp;payments in response to abrupt economic changes. The deadline to pay at the discounted rate is now April 30.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf issued a stay-at-home order Monday.</p>
<p>“We all share a responsibility to do our parts to minimize the effects of this virus, and my&nbsp;part is to help reduce spread by temporarily keeping my team home and encouraging our neighbors&nbsp;throughout Allegheny County to stay home when possible,” Mr. Weintstein said in a release.</p>
<p>Tax payments can be made online at <a href="http://www.AlleghenyCountyTreasurer.us" target="_blank">www.AlleghenyCountyTreasurer.us</a>&nbsp;without fees.</p>
<p>In addition to the changes at Shuman, the county Elections Division has canceled poll worker training until April 6, the Fire Training Academy has suspended all field and classroom operations, and the deadline for Health Department administrative appeals required to be filed between March 19 and April 3 has been extended to April 6, according to an emailed news release attributed to County Manager William D. McKain.</p>
<p>The additional changes in operations come days after the county <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/03/24/Second-county-COVID-19-death-is-a-surprise/stories/202003240078" target="_blank">reduced some Health Department clinic operations</a>.</p>
