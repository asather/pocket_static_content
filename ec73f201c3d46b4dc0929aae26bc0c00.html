<h1>Pirates, other MLB clubs donating $1 million each to ballpark employees</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Each Major League Baseball team will donate $1 million to ballpark employees losing wages because of the COVID-19 pandemic that has postponed the 2020 season, commissioner Rob Manfred announced on Tuesday.</p>
<p>That obviously includes the Pirates and PNC Park, as the total given will be $30 million.</p>
<p>In a statement, Manfred also said individual clubs will be announcing more details soon, as they look to offer support in local communities.</p>
<p>â€œThe timing of these announcements will vary because of the need to coordinate with state and local laws as well as collective-bargaining obligations in an effort to maximize the benefits realized by each group of employees," Manfred said. "I am proud that our clubs came together so quickly and uniformly to support these individuals who provide so much to the game we love."</p>
