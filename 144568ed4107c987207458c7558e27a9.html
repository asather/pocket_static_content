<p>Local shoppers got quite the surprise Tuesday morning when they tried to check out at two Giant Eagle locations and were told to put their wallets away.</p>
<p>The cashiers said that some guy named Sullivan was picking up the tab.</p>
<p>The Penguins announced Tuesday that Mike Sullivan surprised shoppers with free groceries during designated senior hours at the Waterfront and South Hills Market District stores. Shoppers were told at the checkout that no payment was necessary and that all costs were paid in advance by Sullivan.</p>
<p>“We have been so proud to see the generosity of the Pittsburgh community throughout this challenging time,” Sullivan said. “My wife, Kate, and I wanted to do something for those at higher risk for the illness. We know that most seniors live on fixed incomes and have to worry more about getting out in general.”</p>
<p>Added the Cup-winning coach, who was not present at the stores: “It is our hope that we were able to give them a little relief during a stressful time.”</p>
<p>Giant Eagle offers a shopping hour for seniors aged 60 and older at participating locations. That hour is 6 to 7 a.m. on Monday through Wednesday.</p>
<p>In their press release, the Penguins said the Sullivans asked Giant Eagle to choose two stores that had higher foot traffic during these designated hours.</p>
<p>“We are amazed by the generosity displayed by Mike and Kate Sullivan as they helped provide groceries to some of the most vulnerable members of our community this morning,” Giant Eagle spokesperson Jannah Jablonowski said.</p>
