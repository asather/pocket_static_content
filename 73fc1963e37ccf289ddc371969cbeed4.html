<p>CHICAGO — An Illinois man arrested in Chicago over the weekend had homemade bombs in his car and had been seen on videos posted on the internet participating in the looting and rioting in Minneapolis and Chicago, according to federal charges filed Monday.</p>
<p>Matthew Rupert, 28, of Galesburg was charged in U.S. District Court in Minnesota with inciting a riot and possession of an explosive device, court records show.</p>
<p>Rupert was arrested by Chicago police early Sunday after allegedly violating the mayor’s emergency curfew order. Police found several homemade explosive devices in his car, according to a seven-page criminal complaint. Officers also found a hammer, a “heavy-duty” flashlight and cash, the complaint alleged.</p>
<p>In a telephonic hearing for Rupert at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse, U.S. District Chief Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer granted prosecutors’ request to have him taken in custody to Minnesota to face the charges.</p>
<p>Rupert’s attorney said that while Rupert had no current objection to being detained, he will likely ask for bond once he appears before a judge in Minnesota.</p>
<p>According to the complaint, Rupert posted a message on his Facebook account Thursday saying he was going to Minneapolis to protest the police-involved death of George Floyd and wanted “goons” to join him.</p>
<p>The next day, he posted a two-hour livestreamed video of himself participating in the protests and violence that erupted in Minneapolis. During the video, Rupert could be heard and seen encouraging others on video to throw bombs at the police, appearing to light a building on fire, and actively damaging property and looting businesses, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>“Light that bitch and throw it at them,” Rupert said at one point to another person, who lit a device and threw it in the direction of police, according to the charges. Moments later, an explosion is heard in the video and Rupert repeatedly yells, “Good shot, my boy!” as well as “F --- 12,” a derogatory reference to law enforcement, the complaint alleged.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Rupert posted a message saying he was on his way to Chicago. Two hours later, he began posting multiple videos of himself participating in violent acts downtown, including saying things like, “Let’s start a riot” and “I’m gonna start doing some damage,” the complaint alleged.</p>
<p>On one video, Rupert could be seen walking with other people at Dearborn and Van Buren streets — directly across from the Dirksen building. He later could be seen entering a store and searching the empty cash register and going into a convenience store that had been broken into and putting cigarettes and other merchandise in his backpack, according to the charges.</p>
<p>Several associates were with Rupert when he was arrested, including his live-in girlfriend, who confirmed that he had traveled to Minneapolis “in order to riot,” the complaint alleged.</p>
<p>Also arrested was his brother, Christopher Rupert, 29, authorities said. He was charged with reckless conduct and disorderly conduct and appeared in bond court at 26th Street and California Avenue on Monday. A judge released him on his own recognizance.</p>
