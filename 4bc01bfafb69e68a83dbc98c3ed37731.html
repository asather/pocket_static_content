<p>Kennywood and its sister park, Sandcastle Waterpark, will begin reopening Friday after postponing the start of their summer season.</p>
<p>The parks will open to season pass-holders on Friday, with a full opening planned for Monday. The announcement follows <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2020/07/02/COVID-coronavirus-Kennywood-Sandcastle-Idlewild-reopening-postponed/stories/202007020168" target="_blank">a postponement</a> of the parks’ reopening, which was set for July 6. That postponement came amid rising COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County.</p>

<p>The season’s start was already delayed for than two months to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;Planned <a href="https://www.kennywood.com/summer2020" target="_blank">safety measures</a> include limiting the parks’ capacity, requiring masks (except for children under 3 years old) and temperature checks at the park entrance. Anyone with a temperature of 100.4 degrees or higher or who shows COVID-19 symptoms will be denied entry.</p>
<p>Other changes include requiring visitors to register for their visit after buying a ticket. Tickets will not be available at the gates. Regular sanitation and social distancing guidelines are also in place.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our guests and team members continues to be our top priority as we work to reopen in this new environment,” Kennywood’s assistant general manager Rob Henninger wrote in a statement. “We strongly believe our plan and its new health and safety measures will allow people to come and enjoy the fun, safe experience we’ve been proud to provide since 1898.”</p>
