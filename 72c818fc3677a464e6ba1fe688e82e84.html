<h1>Jarrod Dyson signing furthers offseason theme for Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The move the Pirates made Wednesday, signing free-agent outfielder Jarrod Dyson to a one-year, $2 million contract (assuming he passes his physical) was not overly sexy. It didn’t set the baseball world abuzz, nor did it change the narrative about the Pirates’ payroll.</p>
<p>But it did track with many of their offseason moves to this point, which have been to prioritize defense. Dyson, who’s expected to succeed Starling Marte in center field (allowing Bryan Reynolds to stay in left), is a solid defensive outfielder with speed, someone who should give them a dose of respectability in that spot.</p>
<p>“He’s a great veteran to have,” said catcher John Ryan Murphy, who played alongside Dyson with the Arizona Diamondbacks. “He brings a looseness about him that’s contagious. He doesn’t give away a pitch during an at-bat. He’s the ultimate competitor. He plays incredible defense. Obviously everybody knows about his speed. He’s an incredible teammate. I’m excited that he’s coming.”</p>
<p>The signing of Dyson is a low-risk move that could actually pay off for the Pirates, as there’s a good chance Dyson will contribute more offensively than catcher Luke Maile or fellow outfielder Guillermo Heredia, Pittsburgh’s other offseason additions to the major league club.</p>
<p>Dyson, 35, isn’t a power hitter by any stretch, as evidenced by his .247/.319/.338 career slash line, but he has plenty of speed (averaging 25 steals per season throughout his career) and should provide at least a reasonable facsimile to Marte in center.</p>
<p>Dyson (5-foot-10, 165 pounds) was a free agent after completing a two-year, $7.5 million contract with Arizona, where he slashed .230/.313/.320 a season ago. That helped to produce a mark of 1.3 WAR, while Dyson slugged a career-high seven home runs, stole 30 bases and totaled 27 RBIs.</p>
<p>Dyson has accumulated 97 Defensive Runs Saved Above Average in his career, per BaseballReference.com, compared to 71 for Marte, who has played two fewer seasons.</p>
<p>“He can go get it, simple as that,” Murphy said.</p>
<p>Over his 10-year career, Dyson has 250 stolen bases, 170 RBIs and 361 runs scored, hitting just 21 home runs. Dyson’s best season came in 2016, when he slashed .278/.340/.388 in his last year with the Royals, stole 30 bases and accounted for a 3.2 WAR.</p>
<p>Dyson, who has also played for the Seattle Mariners, has career splits that are more favorable toward right-handed pitching, although he did fare extremely well against lefties last season.</p>
<p>Facing southpaws, Dyson produced a .326/.380/.326 slash line compared to a .218/.304/.319 against righties. In his career, Dyson has hit .250 against right-handed pitchers compared to .233 vs. lefties.</p>
<p>If the Dyson signing works out, the Pirates could conceivably flip Dyson, a 50th-round draft pick, at the trade deadline, turning a low-cost move into potential future talent. If it doesn’t work out, the Pirates also aren’t out much.</p>
<p>Murphy cited Dyson’s personality as another benefit for the Pirates.</p>
<p>“He’s just a character, man,” Murphy said. “He’s very funny. He’s always got the music going in the clubhouse. He’s a great guy to have around.”</p>
<p>Secondarily, the one-year deal doesn’t handcuff the Pirates when it comes to their center field prospects, guys such as Jason Martin and Jared Oliva. Martin is coming off shoulder surgery — this move means he’ll likely start the year in Class AAA — while Oliva spent 2019 with Class AA Altoona. Both have shown promising signs, which is why the Pirates wanted something of a stopgap here.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how many games Dyson plays. In five of his 10 big league seasons, he’s played under 100, though that number was a career-high 130 in 2019. If the Pirates want to keep Dyson fresh and get the most out of him, it might be smart to rotate outfielders and be mindful of how many miles they put on the tires.</p>
<p>At minimum, the Pirates should feel confident they got themselves a solid outfielder, continuing their offseason trend of seeking defensive improvements.</p>
<p>“It feels good to have a focus on defense,” Keone Kela said. “Getting Dyson out there is great. We’re going to have some deers out there that can go get it. I’m not going to feel any sorrow if the ball goes in the air as long as it doesn’t go over the fence. We already have Reynolds, and he’s so fun to watch. [Gregory] Polanco is going to be back. It’s going to be good for us as a team."</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton had a slightly more succinct way of describing the Pirates' push for defensive improvement, something that's absolutely necessary after they finished with the most errors (121) and the second-worst fielding percentage (.980) in Major League Baseball last season.</p>
<p>“You want to catch the ball, whether it’s behind the plate or in front of it," Shelton said. "When you identify guys who can catch the ball, I think that helps."</p>
