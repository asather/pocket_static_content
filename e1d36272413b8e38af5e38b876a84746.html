<h1>Ron Cook: Maurkice Pouncey adds to his Hall of Fame resume with all-decade recognition </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Give Antonio Brown credit even if it makes you sick to do so. Despite the ugly ending to his Steelers career, he absolutely deserves to be on the NFL’s all-decade team of the 2010s that was announced Monday. He was the best receiver in the league during that 10-year period. He is the best receiver in Steelers history — yes, better than Hall of Famers Lynn Swann and John Stallworth.</p>
<p>Also give credit to the four former Pitt players who made the team and added to the university’s strong football legacy. LeSean McCoy, Larry Fitzgerald, Darrelle Revis and Aaron Donald are more than deserving. Special congratulations to Donald for being one of eight unanimous choices. He could quit the game tomorrow and go straight to Canton.</p>
<p>Just make sure you save a little credit for Maurkice Pouncey, one of two centers picked to the team along with Atlanta’s Alex Mack, formerly of the Cleveland Browns. I have been saying for years that Pouncey is headed to the Hall of Fame along with his quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger. Some have ridiculed me for it, but that’s my story and I’m sticking to it.</p>
<p>It’s always amazed me that Pouncey hasn’t received nearly the love he deserves from the analytics people who continue to go out of their way to find flaws in his game. I watch him play every week and I can’t understand it. But I do know this all-decade honor will look good on his resume along with his eight Pro Bowls, his two first-team All-Pro honors and his three second-team selections.</p>
<p>I’m guessing there is no one at Steelers headquarters who will tell you there is a more deserving player than Pouncey for this all-decade tribute.</p>
<p>I think of what Mike Tomlin said about Pouncey late last season: “Not enough is said about the leader that he is. If you ask any of those men in that locker room, he’s the unquestioned leader. He’s the type of leader that gives them what they need, not necessarily what they want. His actions speak louder than his words. You want to know how to be a pro, you want to know how to prepare, you want to know how to play, just watch him.”</p>
<p>I think of what David DeCastro — a guard who should have received votes for the all-decade team — said about Pouncey a few years ago: “I can’t put it into words what he means to us. I really can’t. He’s a one-of-a-kind player. He brings everybody up. His energy, the intensity he brings, he’s one of those guys you follow. He’s the leader, no question, of this group. You don’t want to let him down. You just want to follow him and be like him.”</p>
<p>Most of all, I think of what Roethlisberger has said about Pouncey again and again: “I wouldn’t want to play with anyone else. He is, for me, my comfort blanket. The man in the middle. He is the best in the business. I would bet the farm on that. His mental football is unparalleled to anyone else. It’s unbelievable. Awesome. I feel so blessed to have him in my life, not just as a football player, but as a friend.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger and Pouncey are so close that both have said that when one retires the other will do the same. Sadly, that day is coming sooner rather than later. Roethlisberger is 38, coming off major elbow surgery. Pouncey will be 31 on July 24 and takes and gives a beating every game as an offensive lineman.</p>
<p>But eternity is a lot longer than a football career.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger and Pouncey will spend it together in Canton.</p>
