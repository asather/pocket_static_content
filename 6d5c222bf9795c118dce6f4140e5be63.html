<h1>Supreme Court rules in favor of health insurers on ACA risk corridor payments</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday ruled 8-1 that the U.S. government must pay health insurers who absorbed excessive early losses from their Affordable Care Act marketplace plan offerings.</p>
<p>For Pittsburgh-based Highmark, that could mean a payout exceeding $500,000.</p>
<p>Under the ACA’s risk corridors program, insurers were promised that the federal government would help cover the excessive costs from the individual plan claims for three years as a way to encourage insurers to offer plans.</p>
<p>Highmark in particular got hit hard, as enrollees — some of whom may have foregone medical care for years —&nbsp;flocked to the plans. At one point, Highmark officials estimated they were incurring $1.20 in costs for every $1 in revenue from those plans.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh-based UPMC had less exposure as it had sold fewer ACA plans in those first years although it has since expanded its offerings. A UPMC spokesman could not immediately be reached on Monday.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Highmark filed suit in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims to recover risk corridor payments. Other insurers also filed suit, with the cases eventually going to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
