<h1> Iran leader: U.S. ‘superpower image’ took a hit </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ISTANBUL — Iran’s supreme leader used a rare public sermon Friday to rally Iranians and reclaim the official narrative after an unprecedented confrontation with the United States and the downing of a passenger plane, which sparked days of anti-government protests.</p>
<p>Addressing tens of thousands of worshippers at the Grand Mosalla mosque in Tehran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran’s top political and religious authority, said the country had passed through an extraordinary two weeks, beginning with the U.S. drone strike that killed Iranian commander Gen. Qassem Soleimani.</p>
<p>“These are turning points, historical days. The Iranian people are resilient,”Ayatollah Khamenei said amid anti-American chants, as the 80-year-old cleric delivered his first public sermon in eight years.</p>
<p>His appearance was a sign of how much recent events have rocked Iran and the government’s determination to reassert its role as a steady steward for a powerful nation, which is under fire at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The death of Soleimani, the country’s most powerful military figure, prompted a massive outpouring of grief among Iranians, followed by an Iranian ballistic missile strike on two bases in Iraq hosting U.S. forces. But in the immediate wake of that missile attack, Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps accidentally shot down a Ukrainian passenger plane near Tehran, killing all 176 aboard, and the Iranian public turned swiftly against the government, accusing it of egregious incompetence and covering up its guilt.</p>
<p>At the mosque, worshippers filled the interior and surrounding courtyard, and banners with Soleimani’s image were draped from its balconies, according to images shown on state television. Ayatollah Khameini’s appearance had been heavily promoted in advance in Iranian media, and many of those attending were transported to Tehran from outer provinces.</p>
<p>“For a nation to have the ability to slap the face of the world’s bully, this shows the power of God,” Ayatollah Khamenei said, referring to the missile attack. “It was a blow to the United States militarily,” he added. “But what matters more is that it was a blow to America’s superpower image. This blow was the strongest of all.”</p>
<p>He also had harsh words for European countries, after Britain, France and Germany formally launched a process this week that could trigger new European sanctions on Iran and lead to the eventual collapse of the nuclear deal Iran signed with world powers. The 2015 agreement had curbed Iran’s atomic energy activities in exchange for major sanctions relief.</p>
<p>Ayatollah Khamenei criticized Britain, France and Germany as “U.S. puppets” and warned against trusting European negotiators.</p>
<p>“We are not against negotiations with others — except for the United States — but not from a point of weakness, but instead from a point of strength,” he said.</p>
<p>“Thank God we are strong and will get even stronger,” he declared. “The people of Iran should remain united and resilient and work hard. Then, the Iranians will become a nation where enemies won’t even dare to threaten us.”</p>
