<h1>Free meals — and smiles — in Rochester during 'teacher parade'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Eugene Alderidge and Adam Longwell watched their children’s eyes light up when the white school van pulled up.</p>
<p>Most days, the vans would be there at the intersection of Bedford Avenue and Monroe Street in Rochester to pick up the kids for school. On Tuesday, the van — followed by a parade of honking cars —&nbsp;pulled up to dish out free meals, as teachers,&nbsp;cafeteria workers and volunteers try to find ways to engage and feed the students who rely on the Rochester Area School District’s free food program.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, the line of cars was an added bonus, as dozens of teachers in their cars followed the delivery vans in the hopes of spreading cheer for students cooped up in their houses.</p>
<p>Kindergarten teacher Lori Anthony organized the teachers for the event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We left them (the students) kind of abruptly,” Ms. Anthony said.&nbsp;“We didn’t know our last day was our last day, so we’re trying to communicate with them the best we can. But you know the little ones, they miss our teachers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Teachers brought their dogs, balloons, and cheerful attitudes to keep the morale up for their students and families.</p>
<p>“Be safe!” was the common refrain as they drove past the children. Colorful posters with the words “#Rochypride” and “We Miss You!!” were attached prominently on the teachers’ car doors. Children — and their parents — giggled as the teachers sped past, beeping their horns in excitement.</p>
<p>Across town, families stood outside their doors in jeans or sweatpants to wave at the teachers. Some children even painted the phrase&nbsp;“We Love You” on posters to hold up to their favorite instructors.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a nice thing that the school is doing, with everything that is going on,” Mr. Alderidge said. “A lot of families struggle, especially during a time like this. I know my daughter has been missing school and missing her teacher, so she was pretty happy to come out here.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Longwell said he heard about the free school lunches on Monday when he received a call. It was his kids’ teachers phoning to check up on his children and coordinate a way to provide the kids with iPads for them to continue their studies.</p>
<p>“They wanted to go see their teachers anyways and get out of the house,” Mr. Longwell said. “I figured it was a great opportunity.”</p>
<p>Mr. Longwell’s son, Elijah, was happy because he was looking forward to seeing some of his teachers.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s just nice to see people. It’s nice to know they still care about their students,” Mr. Longwell said. “It’s definitely helpful, especially with the shortages going around and people are scared to go to the store.”</p>
<p>Kathy Onuska, the business manager of RASD, said last week they provided over 1,000 meals to children around the area. On Friday, they delivered 267 meals to children. According to Ms. Onuska, RASD is a Community Eligibility Provision (CEP) school district, where 100 percent of students in kindergarten through 12th grade are eligible for free breakfast, lunch and dinner. According to the district’s website, which cited data from the 2000 Census, about&nbsp;7.2% of Rochester’s families and 12.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 14.4% of those under age 18.</p>
<p>Knowing that a majority of students rely on the free meals, Ms. Onuska and school faculty members are making sure every student has the opportunity to be fed — by going straight to their homes. On Fridays, the school’s cafeteria staff prepare an extra two days worth of food to help keep students fed through the weekend.</p>
<p>On mornings during the work week, volunteers, school faculty members and cafeteria staff prepare bag lunches and pack them in large ice box containers to load onto school vans. By 11 a.m., vans are sent out across town to reach the doorsteps of those in need. Throughout the days, the free meal delivery program has picked up in popularity, with teachers calling parents to spread the word.</p>
<p>At the end of the delivery route, teachers drove by houses near the school like a parade to wave at the students living close by.</p>
<p>And while Ms. Onuska is too busy at the school organizing the free meals to go out and deliver the meals, she’s received a lot of positive feedback through Facebook comments and letters children write to the school thanking the school for their efforts.</p>
<p>“We just want them to know that their teachers miss them and love them and we want to make sure they’re taken care of and fed, within our ability,” Ms. Onuska said.</p>
<p>While driving towards the school on Virginia Avenue, one can quickly see Sharmane Campisi’s large wooden sign with the phrase “We&nbsp;(Heart) Our Teachers” and red balloons. Ms. Campisi, a secretary for guidance and special education at the school district for 32 years, wanted to show her support for the teachers.</p>
<p>As the instructors drove past honking, Ms. Campisi watched her grandson, Xander, who is in kindergarten, cheerfully wave back.</p>
<p>“To see him and the teacher’s face, I was just watching their eyes connect, and I can just tell that they definitely are missing each other,” Ms. Campisi said.</p>
<p>Seeing each other makes a huge difference for both teachers and students, Ms. Campisi said.</p>
<p>“They’re used to direct instruction,” she said. “They’re used to seeing a physical teacher right there. Some kid’s parents are still working, so they kind of get bounced around from grandparent to grandparent or whoever can watch them.&nbsp;So to see some sort of normalcy by seeing their teachers is important to the children.”</p>
<p>Ms. Campisi was grateful for the district’s efforts.</p>
<p>“They don’t have to do any of this. They’re emailing parents and posting on Facebook,” she said. “They took time out of their day to set this up and do it. I think it’s mentally good for adults and the kids. Even just a simple wave.”</p>
<p>School administrators cleaned iPads for children in kindergarten through third grade and then personally dropped off the iPads at the students’ houses, Ms. Campisi said.</p>
<p>Debbie Carr, a first-grade teacher, sat in the first van on Tuesday’s route to help deliver sandwiches to her students. “I had this one little kid, who his mom videotaped him at the playground, and he said, ‘Hi, Mrs. Carr. I miss you!’ And I cried for 20 minutes.”</p>
<p>Ms. Carr said she also received an email from a parent explaining why her children miss their teachers.</p>
<p>“Just knowing the parents appreciate the teachers, too,” Ms. Carr said. “It’s been a nice sense of community. And that’s the most amazing thing about Rochester, is the community — just really truly good people.”</p>
<p><strong>WEST ALLEGHENY SCHOOL DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p>Rochester is not the only local district where teachers have made efforts to stay in touch with their students during the prolonged school shutdown.</p>
<p>On Sunday, more than 150 staff members from the West Allegheny School District got into their vehicles and paraded through the community as students and parents held signs and waved.</p>
<p>The idea for the caravan was sparked Friday when Erica Conoscuito, a second-grade teacher at McKee Elementary School, was online and saw a teacher in Texas drive past students’ homes with a big sign that read, “I miss you.”</p>
<p>Ms. Conoscuito said she wanted to reach out to students because the news that the schools would close for an extended period came after classes were dismissed Friday, and she never had a chance to say goodbye to them.</p>
<p>She began talking to other teachers about the idea, and eventually took it to district administrators and the school board members, who supported the plan.</p>
<p>It all came together on Sunday.</p>
<p>“It was so rewarding in a way that I couldn’t explain,” Ms. Conoscuito said. “Getting to see them and the smiles on their faces, and then anywhere from teary reactions from kids to just happy excitement to show off the signs they made.”</p>
<p>Students made signs that had specific shout-outs, messages about projects they were working on, or simply stated that they missed their teachers.</p>
<p>Ms. Conoscuito said the motto in the West Allegheny School District this year has been “We Stand Together.” The fact that the community and school district supported the parade, she said, proved that the motto is true.</p>
<p>“I know some people were sending a warm air-hug,” she said. “We can’t actually hug, but it’s kind of like our way of wrapping our arms around the community and getting to see one another.”</p>
<p>While the parade was done for the benefit of the students, Ms. Conoscuito said, parents, older students who had graduated from the district and elderly people in the community seemed to enjoy it, too.</p>
<p>And the teachers did as well.</p>
<p>“While it was 100% for the kids,” she said, “I think we got just as much — if not more —&nbsp;out of it.”</p>
<p>Ms. Conoscuito said she has been surprised about how much she misses the “little day-to-day things,” like singing the chorus of the song “Unstoppable” with her student every morning to get their minds set right. She said she has been able to talk to some of her students using the Zoom communications platform, which has helped maintain some sense of community.</p>
<p>Still, being away from the kids has been a challenge, and Ms. Conoscuito said she and other teachers have been thinking of ways to reach out to the students again in the future.</p>
<p>“They’re our kids, we love them,” she said. “We have grown with them, and we’ve seen them grow just as much, and I think that’s a big piece that we’re missing.</p>
<p>“Right now we’re just trying to find all those ways to stay connected and talk as best as we can.”</p>
