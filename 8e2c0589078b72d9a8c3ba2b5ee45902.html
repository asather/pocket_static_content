<h1>Italy likely to begin easing lockdown on May 4</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte of Italy said on Tuesday that the country was likely to begin easing lockdown measures from May 4, but added that the measures would be cautious and calculated.</p>
<p>Italy has been one of the countries hit hardest by the virus, and was the first in Europe to experience an influx in cases that overwhelmed its health care system. Its lockdown has been among the most restrictive in the world.</p>
<p>The announcement comes a day after the Italian authorities reported the country’s first decline in current positive cases. The number of recoveries reported on Monday outpaced the number of new cases; the overall total fell by 20, to 108,237 from Sunday’s 108,257.</p>

<p>Angelo Borrelli, who heads Italy’s Civil Protection Department, called the numbers “a further positive figure” that showed the success of the country’s six-week lockdown.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post on Tuesday morning, Conte said he would reveal the government’s plans to loosen restrictions and reopen the economy by the weekend, adding that caution must prevail in any decision.</p>
<p>“It’s too easy to say, ‘let’s open everything,’” he wrote.</p>
<p>Conte promised “a serious, scientific plan,” including measures to check whether the loosening was leading to an uptick in cases.</p>
<p>Social distancing measures would continue in workplaces and changes to public transportation and workday hours are expected. The measures are likely to vary from region to region, he wrote, adding that a “reasonable expectation” for when measures could be loosened would be May 4.</p>
<p>Concerns that loosening the lockdown measures could spark new outbreaks, especially in areas of the country that have remained mostly untouched, have weighed heavily on the government’s decisions. The current lockdown measures are officially in force until May 3, and experts say the restrictions have been key in tamping down the outbreak that ravaged the country’s north.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations and the number of patients in intensive care from the virus continue to decline in Italy, while the number of people being recovering has risen, the authorities said at a news conference on Monday. That said, the number of deaths remained at more than 450 a day.</p>
<p>“The battle has certainly not been won,” said Luca Richeldi, a government adviser. “It’s not time yet to lower our guard.”</p>
<p>Southern officials fear that easing travel restrictions will expose their region to the full wrath of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The south was already suffering from poverty and corruption before the epidemic struck, leaving many people with little to fall back on. Unemployment was at 18 percent, and many workers were ineligible for benefits if they lost their jobs because they worked off the books.</p>
<p>In such conditions, the lockdown has left people unable to buy food or pay rent.</p>
<p>Meorina Mazza, who lives in the southern region of Calabria, said she now relies on donations of flour to feed her two daughters, but cannot pay her electricity bills.</p>
<p>“We are really headed toward total desperation,” she said.</p>
