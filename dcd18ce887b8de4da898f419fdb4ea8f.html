<p>After about a year of testing, GetGo is launching checkout-free shopping at its Waterworks convenience store in Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>“We’re excited to bring checkout-free technology to our Pittsburgh-area shoppers,” said Laura Karet, president and CEO of Giant Eagle Inc., GetGo’s parent company, in a statement. The O’Hara-based grocer is working with a Berkeley, California-based startup founded in 2016 by Will Glaser, the former chief technology officer and co-founder of Pandora Radio.</p>
<p>The tech, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2019/07/16/giant-eagle-grabango-grocery-app-checkout-line-tech-app-amazon/stories/201907160124" target="_blank">first announced as a test last summer</a>, comes at a time when consumers are embracing more technology, especially ones that limit interactions, as they shop during the coronavirus pandemic</p>
<p>“With Grabango, our GetGo guests are able to get in, get out and get going even faster with a more convenient, contactless shopping experience,” Ms. Karet said. “We look forward to rolling out more Grabango-powered convenience and grocery stores in the near future.”</p>
<p>In the store, shoppers can skip the line by downloading the Grabango app and connecting their account to their Giant Eagle Advantage Card, the company’s loyalty card program. Then, they can shop as usual.</p>
<p>The system automatically keeps track of all the items a customer selects. Shoppers can bypass waiting to get rung up at checkout counter and scan the code in their app on the way out.</p>
<p>The use of the technology in the Fox Chapel GetGo marks the industry’s “first true retrofit of an existing store,” the companies said, and “the system prioritizes guest privacy as Grabango does not use facial recognition.”</p>
<p>E-commerce giant Amazon first launched checkout-free stores in Seattle in 2016 based around the Amazon Go app.</p>
<p>Amazon describes its checkout-free technology as similar to systems used in self-driving cars: “Computer vision, sensor fusion, and deep learning.”</p>
<p>Cameras and sensors detect when products are taken from or returned to the shelves, and track them in a virtual cart. After customers leave, Amazon sends a receipt and charges their Amazon account.</p>
