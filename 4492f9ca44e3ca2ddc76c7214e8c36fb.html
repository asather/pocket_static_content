<h1>PNC profits slide as Pittsburgh bank prepares for COVID-19 hit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PNC Financial Services Group saw profits skid 29% in the first quarter as Pittsburgh’s biggest bank began bulking up its loan loss reserves amid the global coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Bank officials said they’ve modeled how the institution would respond if economic conditions in the U.S. continue to deteriorate and are confident that PNC is well-positioned to handle it.</p>
<p>“Our results for the first quarter were good, but the extraordinary changes in the economic backdrop occurring in March and the implications of the broad-based response to the COVID-19 outbreak&nbsp;had a material impact on our provision for credit losses,” CEO Bill Demchak said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Net income was $839 million, or $1.95 per share, down from $1.19 billion, or $2.61 in the same quarter a year ago. The provision for credit losses shot up to $914 million from $221 million in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Revenue rose 5% to $4.5 billion from $4.3 billion in the same quarter last year. Revenue was down 2% when compared to the fourth quarter of 2019.</p>
<p>"In these unprecedented times ... PNC remains&nbsp;squarely focused on meeting the needs of our customers and addressing the specific&nbsp;challenges of those facing hardship due to the coronavirus pandemic, Mr. Demchak said, adding that the Pittsburgh company had committed $30 million to community relief programs.</p>
<p>In a conference call with analysts, Mr. Demchak said the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis had worsened since the bank closed the books on the first quarter. But he said he was confident that PNC was in good shape to weather even the most severe economic downturn this year, and that the company’s dividend was safe.</p>
<p>The most “horrific” economic model — which officials stressed they did not expect — assumes that the U.S. Gross Domestic Product would plunge by 30% on an annual basis in the second quarter and another 20% in the third quarter.</p>
<p>“In that instance, we would still be well capitalized, highly liquid and be able to maintain our dividend while complying with capital requirements [set by regulators],” Mr. Demchak said.</p>
<p>That model is “as ugly as we can make it,” he said. “We can operate in this environment.”</p>
<p>Since mid-March, regulators have been urging the nation’s big banks to offer breaks to customers struggling to stay afloat financially amid unprecedented shutdowns and job losses.</p>
<p>For consumers, PNC said it has been modifying loans (mostly mortgages), extending grace periods and waiving fees. It also has halted all foreclosures.&nbsp;As of April 13, the bank had completed some 41,000 consumer loan modifications (postponing or reducing loan payments as interest accrues), primarily related to COVID-19.</p>
<p>For commercial customers in a cash-flow crunch, the bank has been deferring interest charges and/or payments on a case-by-case basis, officials said.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this pandemic is having a profound impact on the global economy and on people’s lives and the challenges we face as a country are unprecedented,” Mr. Demchak said in the conference call.</p>
<p>He said most of PNC’s employees are working remotely, including call center employees, “who are managing a very high call volume from the safety of their homes.”</p>
<p>The bank has received some 75,000 applications from businesses seeking money under the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection Program. The program launched on April 3 and is available through June 30.</p>
