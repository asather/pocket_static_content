<h1>Mike Sullivan not revealing his starting goalie for Game 1 — or maybe he already has</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tristan Jarry said Wednesday that the Penguins’ coaching staff hasn’t told the goalies “anything” about their plan for Game 1.</p>
<p>Maybe that's true. Maybe not. But one thing has become quite certain through training camp and into the first couple days in the NHL's bubble: If coach Mike Sullivan has made up his mind, he's sure not planning to tell us.</p>
<p>The Matt Murray vs. Jarry debate has kept sports-talk radio in business this hockey season, and especially during the four-month pause. Now with the qualifying round matchup against Montreal days away, finding new, creative ways to dance around the subject has become almost a sport itself for reporters. And shutting down those questions is an art form Sullivan has perfected.</p>
<p>“My main responsibility is to make the best decisions for the hockey team, regardless of what position it is,” Sullivan said on Wednesday, reciting a variation of the same answer that’s appeared in this publication dozens of times this season.</p>
<p>But what goes into that decision-making process?</p>
<p>“I’d rather not divulge the process that we go through,” Sullivan said. “That’s just part of the coaching staff’s philosophy and the way we’ve gone about our business.”</p>
<p>Fair enough. Still, even if Sullivan isn’t technically saying out loud or in front of a microphone whom his goalie will be for Game 1, maybe he already told us.</p>
<p>During Tuesday’s exhibition, the goalie with two Stanley Cup rings and the one who became a first-time All-Star this season each earned an opportunity. And ... Murray started.</p>
<p>Maybe it was nothing. But it sure felt like something. Murray has always seemed like the more-likely option, given his track record of postseason success. Even though he got off to a rough start at camp, allowing seven goals in the first scrimmage, he did nothing that sounded alarms against the Flyers.</p>
<p>It’s hard to pin either of the two goals he allowed on Murray. The first one deflected off of Marcus Pettersson, a fluky goal more than anything. The second was about 98% on Evgeni Malkin for blindly throwing a pass into his own goalie’s crease. That’s about as well as a goalie who gave up two goals can play.</p>
<p>At the same time, Jarry would have pitched a shutout had Bryan Rust converted on a 3-on-1 in overtime, or if he hadn’t been beaten by a breakaway during a fast and loose extra period.</p>
<p>So one more time, who starts?</p>
<p>“That type of decision is never an easy decision,” Sullivan said. “These players are both good players and they’re both very capable players. … These guys want the net. They’re competitive guys. I understand that. The coaching staff will make the best decision on what we think is best for the team.”</p>
<p>One way or another, we’ll have our answer on Saturday — then we can start asking about Game 2.</p>
<p><strong>Just like old times?</strong></p>
<p>The so-called “Sid and the Kids” line didn’t have much time to establish chemistry during an abbreviated training camp, especially with Sidney Crosby missing three of the four scrimmages and several practices. However, even though the line was “Evan Rodrigues and the Kids” through the majority of camp, there have been some positive signs that the sequel might be like the original.</p>
<p>That trio scored a quick-strike goal early in the first period on Tuesday. In Sullivan’s words, it was a “terrific shot” from Conor Sheary. A “great” pass from Jake Guentzel.</p>
<p>And Crosby?</p>
<p>“I think the part that went unnoticed by most was the net drive that Sid had coming out of the deep ice,” Sullivan said. “I thought his burst of speed through the neutral zone to back the D off to open up that lane for Jake to move the puck dot-width to Conor was how the whole play evolved.”</p>
<p>After all the questions about Crosby’s health recently, the speed he showed on the play may have been the most-encouraging sign. Sulilvan said that all of the Penguins practice on Wednesday, including Crosby.</p>
<p><strong>Still ‘sloppy’</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan used the term “sloppy” to describe the way the Penguins played during early parts of Tuesday’s exhibition. After watching the film?</p>
<p>“That’s just more affirmation that what I saw was correct,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>While Sullivan was happy with the intensity, he felt they were lacking in execution. In particular, Sullivan wasn’t happy with the way the Penguins handled the pressure of the Flyers’ forecheck. That element of the game could be tested early against a speedy Montreal team.</p>
<p><strong>That was awkward</strong></p>
<p>NHL players are doing their best to stay socially distanced inside the Toronto bubble. But, at the same time, they’re in much closer proximity to opponents who are trying to make their stay in the hub city a brief one.</p>
<p>“The first day, we were trying to look around,” Penguins defenseman Kris Letang said. “I ran into the entire Philly team. That was a little awkward.”</p>
<p>Letang joked that he knows “Mr. Voracek” —&nbsp;Flyers assistant captain Jakub — and he helped diffuse any tensions.</p>
