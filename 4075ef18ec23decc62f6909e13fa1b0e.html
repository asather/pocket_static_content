<p>Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer GNC has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization, hoping to restructure some $750 million of debt.</p>
<p>The company, which employed about 600 people at its corporate headquarters Downtown as of last fall, says it will continue to operate but plans to close 800 to 1,200 stores as it tries to find a buyer.</p>
<p>GNC officials said they expect to have a confirmed restructuring plan, or complete a sale, this fall.</p>
<p>While GNC is a leading, globally-recognized brand in a vitamin and health supplements sector, whose sales exceeded $31 billion in the U.S. in 2018-19, the company has faced growing competition in recent years.&nbsp;Today, consumers can find supplements at local retail grocery chains or, most notably, online where companies such as Amazon began selling its own supplements in 2017.</p>
<p>In a release issued late Tuesday, GNC said it has agreed to a sale to partner Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Holding Co., Ltd. for $760 million, which will serve as a baseline price for an eventual court-supervised auction.</p>
<p>GNC and Harbin announced a strategic partnership in February 2018 in which the Chinese pharmaceutical firm agreed to invest $300 million in the financially-ailing health supplements retailer, becoming its largest shareholder. I</p>
<p>In return, the GNC board was expanded to 11 members, with five each from GNC and Harbin plus GNC CEO Ken Martindale.</p>
<p>The bankruptcy process will take awhile to work through and it’s not clear what will happen in the restructuring. But if GNC ends up with a new owner inclined to move the business out of town, it could mean the loss of another Pittsburgh legacy company.</p>
<p>Founder David B. Shakarian opened Lackzoom Health Store on Wood Street in 1936 selling honey, whole grains and other healthy foods. Its first year in business produced $25,000 in sales.</p>
<p>The name was changed to General Nutrition Centers in 1959 by which time it had expanded to six locations. It was in the 1980s and 1990s, after a private equity group bought the company and took it public, that GNC’s growth took off, with thousands of stores opening in the U.S., Canada and internationally.</p>
<p>GNC changed hands again in 1999 and 2003. In 2007 it was purchased by the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan and a Los Angeles-based private investment partnership.</p>
<p>The company went public again in 2011, with shares opening at $16.60. A year later, those shares nearly doubled in value en route to peaking above $60 two years later before starting to slide,&nbsp;with additional store closures this spring due to the COVID-19 pandemic dealing another blow.</p>
<p>In October, Bloomberg News reported that Harbin might make a bid to buy GNC and take it private.</p>
<p>The partnership with Harbin, as well as other overseas agreements in Australia and Brazil, did not solve GNC’s long-standing debt problems, as the company’s shares continued to fall to less than $1 this year. Shares closed at 87 cents on Tuesday.</p>
<p>In April, officials at the New York Stock Exchange warned GNC that it could be delisted based on its share average falling below $1 as well as its declining market capitalization.</p>
<p>Earlier that month, GNC announced it was furloughing “a significant portion” of its store and corporate associates not long after revealing it did not have the cash to pay nearly $700 million in debt that would come due in May.</p>
<p>The company later received an extension on the payment to June 30 before Tuesday’s Chapter 11 filing in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware. GNC says it will make a filing in a Canadian court, asking it to recognize the Chapter 11 filing.</p>
<p>Last month, GNC reported a $200.1 million net loss for the first quarter of 2020, compared with a $15.3 million loss the year prior, with consolidated revenue of $472.6 million.</p>
<p>As of March 31, GNC had about 7,300 locations — 5,200 in the U.S., including 1,600 store-within-a-store sites inside Rite Aid locations. At the end of 2019, the company has a total of 12,400 employees, including 4,400 full-time and 8,000 part-time.</p>
