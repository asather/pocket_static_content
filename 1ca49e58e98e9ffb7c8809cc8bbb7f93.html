<h1>Miss Manners: Guests can't invite other guests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> I went to visit friends out of town, staying at their home to enjoy a weekend festival. One of the friends I was staying with was also performing in the festival, and by Sunday evening, was exhausted and went to bed around 8 p.m.</p>
<p>I remained at the festival and met a new friend, enjoying conversation and a meal. Later, my new friend offered to drop me off where I was staying, which I accepted. On the way, he mentioned that he needed to use the facilities, if possible.</p>
<p>Now, I don't want to inconvenience a person when nature calls, but as a guest, I also don't feel right allowing a complete stranger into my host's home.</p>
<p>In this case, my new friend politely changed course and said that he would find a restroom on the way to his own home after he dropped me off. So I was spared having to provide a response. But how should I respond in the future when this kind of thing happens? What prerogatives are allowed to a guest?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> They are not allowed to invite additional guests, no matter what kind of intentions nature has in mind.</p>
<p>Not only because it was not your home, but also because you had just met the gentleman, Miss Manners is worried about your safety. No doubt, he assumed that you were having similar concerns. But then, there may be some doubt that he really had to go to the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> Is it rude to photograph people when they are sleeping?</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> It is, if the subject is over the age of 5.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> A good friend does something which bothers me. When we are with other people and she is talking, she looks exclusively at the other person as she talks, almost as if I am not there.</p>
<p>It really annoys me, and I don't know how to point this out to her without sounding peevish. Rather than politely addressing this, I have just been leaving.</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> What then, Miss Manners wonders, is your definition of peevish? This habit of your friend's may be annoying, but perhaps your friend considers that since you are close, you already have the information she is conveying.</p>
<p>If that is not the case, ask her questions. She will be forced to address you — and likely be grateful for the attentiveness.</p>
<p><strong>DEAR MISS MANNERS:</strong> My generous mother-in-law loves to shower my three children with presents — at every holiday and other "just because" times during the year.</p>
<p>My kids love it, of course, and I don't want to deprive her of the joy of giving gifts. However, we live in a small house and cannot keep everything she gives.</p>
<p>Would you please give me a gracious response to her question, "Are the children using what I gave them?" Sometimes the answer is "yes," but other times we have given those items away. I'm not sure how to respond in these cases.</p>
<p><strong>GENTLE READER:</strong> "I can assure you that they are well loved" — omitting the true ending of that sentence, "... by someone else."</p>
