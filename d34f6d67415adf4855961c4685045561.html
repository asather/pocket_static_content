<h1>Tristan Jarry gets first start after the All-Star break; plus, what's up with Nick Bjugstad?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tristan Jarry will be between the pipes Friday at PPG Paints Arena as the Penguins host the Philadelphia Flyers in their first game after the NHL’s All-Star break.</p>
<p>There was intrigue over which goalie Mike Sullivan would turn to coming out of the break. Matt Murray has won five starts in a row and was given back-to-back games two weekends ago. Jarry then got their last one before the break, a 3-0 loss to these Flyers on Jan. 21, before making his All-Star debut in St. Louis.</p>
<p>Sullivan opted to stick with Jarry, who, despite a bit of statistical dip in January, still ranked in the top two in the league entering Friday’s action with both a 2.16 goals-against average and a .929 save percentage. But the coach made it clear the Penguins intend to keep both goalies busy the next couple of months.</p>
<p>“It’s not an instance where if you win, you’re in,” Sullivan said of the decision to start Jarry on Friday. “We look at in much more detail than that. We think both goaltenders right now are playing extremely well and we’re going to try to utilize both goaltenders as best we can to keep them sharp and help us win games.”</p>
<p>Murray started 18 of their first 21 games. But for the second straight season he struggled in November, creating an opening for Jarry. He took advantage.</p>
<p>From Nov. 16 through Jan. 16, Jarry went 15-4-1 with a .929 save percentage. Murray averaged about one start per week during that two-month span and saw Jarry, who at 24 is a year younger than him, earn an All-Star invite.</p>
<p>Coming out of the break, it may be closer to a 50-50 split. But Sullivan indicated Friday that the plan could change should Jarry or Murray seize the reins.</p>
<p>“Performance ultimately will always be the dictator,” he said. “That’s the nature of the world [in which we live] in pro sports, pro hockey. But we feel comfortable right now that we’ve got a really strong tandem. We think it’s a competitive advantage for our team and we’re going to try to utilize it as best we can.”</p>
<p><strong>What’s up with Bjugstad?</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins, coming off an eight-day layoff for the players, practiced in Cranberry on Thursday then held a morning skate at PPG Paints Arena on Friday.</p>
<p>Nick Bjugstad, who underwent surgery to repair a core muscle injury more than 10 weeks ago, was not spotted on the ice before either of those practices. That was noteworthy because he traveled with the team on its West Coast road trip earlier this month and skated on an individual basis most of those days.</p>
<p>So Sullivan was asked Friday if the big center had experienced a setback.</p>
<p>“He hasn’t had a setback, per se,” he said. “I’d rather not get into the details of his progress or his rehab process. … There are always, I think, improvements and plateaus as part of the rehab process, especially when it involves a longer-term injury like Nick’s. And so they’re just going through that process together.”</p>
<p>He continued: “Our medical staff is making the decisions accordingly to make sure that we can continue making progress when it comes to the rehab process for Nick. So it’s going to involve sometimes being on the ice. It’s going to involve sometimes being off the ice. And we’ll make those decisions accordingly.”</p>
<p>Bjugstad, who has one point in 10 games, last played in a game Nov. 15.</p>
<p><strong>Schultz looks ready to go</strong></p>
<p>Justin Schultz is on track to return to the Penguins lineup Friday against the Flyers. The defenseman has been out since Dec. 17 with a lower-body injury.</p>
<p>Based on the morning skate, Juuso Riikola would be the odd man out. Chad Ruhwedel, a righty, would move to the left side and partner with Schultz.</p>
<p>“I’ve played a little bit on the left,” he said. “Obviously, the right side is more natural because of the amount of reps I’ve taken. But the game is the same.”</p>
<p>Sullivan explained why the Penguins would trust Ruhwedel to play on his off side even though it’s not something they’ve asked the 29-year-old to do often.</p>
<p>“Chad’s a good player,” he said. “One of the things that we like about Chad’s game is his mobility, for one. I think his skating is one of his assets, which will allow him to play his off side, but his simplicity as well. He understands what he is and plays the game within himself. He’s a real, safe, reliable player for us.”</p>
<p><strong>Angello to make NHL debut</strong></p>
<p>Dominik Kahun, who suffered a concussion Jan. 19, skated Friday on an individual basis for a second straight day. The winger is still not cleared to play.</p>
<p>That means Anthony Angello will make his NHL debut Friday and bring something to the lineup that these Penguins don’t have a lot of up front — size.</p>
<p>Angello, a 2014 fifth-round pick, is listed at 6-foot-5 and 210 pounds. Among Penguins players, only Bjugstad and blue-liner Jack Johnson are heavier.</p>
<p>“I just think it adds another dimension to our group of forwards,” Sullivan said. “He’s a physical player. He can help us on the forecheck. I think he can lean on people, which makes us more difficult to play against. And he’s got a pretty simple, straight-ahead game. … We’re excited to get him in the lineup.”</p>
