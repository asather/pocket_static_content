<p>A task force investigating the protest that turned violent near PPG Paints Arena on May 30 is asking for the public’s help in identifying two individuals it says vandalized a police vehicle.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday said one of the suspects was wearing a ski mask that covered their hair and face, a black T-shirt, dark-colored backpack with grey pants rolled at the ankle, and white sneakers.</p>
<p>The other suspect had bright pink, shoulder-length hair under a black beanie hat. The suspect was wearing a yellow bandana, black jeans, light-colored shirt and a blue jean jacket. He also was carrying a large green bag.</p>
<p>The two were seen together a number of times while vandalizing the police vehicle, police said.</p>
<p>The public safety department said the Damage Assessment and Accountability Task Force, which is made up of local, state and federal agencies, continues to analyze video and photos to identify individuals “who committed criminal acts during the primarily peaceful demonstrations.”</p>
<p>Anyone with information is asked to contact the task force at DAAT@Pittsburghpa.gov, or call (412) 323-7800. Contributors will remain anonymous.</p>
