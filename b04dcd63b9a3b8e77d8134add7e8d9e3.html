<h1>Pitt cancels spring break study abroad programs; calls students home from three more countries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh is canceling all university-sponsored spring break study abroad and study-away trips that require air travel and is telling students now in France, Germany and Spain to return home.</p>
<p>Pitt’s decision, announced late Tuesday, comes amid a growing number of similar moves by universities and colleges in this state and beyond, given the global spread of COVID-19 (the novel coronavirus) and potential for travel complications and difficulty re-entering the U.S. depending on the virus’s spread.</p>
<p>Pitt’s decision, an expansion of earlier restrictions, was shared with affected students and faculty on Tuesday afternoon, spokesman David Seldin said. The university’s spring break is next week.</p>
<p>In making their decisions, officials at some universities pointed to the latest <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html" target="_blank">guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, issued Sunday. It said institutions of higher education should consider canceling or postponing all international travel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edinboro University is among them. Citing the CDC guidance, the state-owned university issued a statement Tuesday afternoon that read:</p>
<p>“Based on this recommendation and after careful consideration regarding the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff, university officials have decided to cancel ALL university-affiliated travel programs through the end of May 2020. This decision was made out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>Beyond travel considerations, colleges and universities have been working with state, CDC and other officials to prepare should the virus’s spread require modification of regular campus activities, including how campus instruction is delivered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At Pitt, the region’s largest university, campus presidents, deans, associate deans and vice presidents received a message this week from Provost Ann Cudd pointing to efforts by the University Center for Teaching and Learning to&nbsp;develop various options, including web-based instruction.</p>
<p>“While we have every intention of continuing with our courses as normal, we ask that you work with your faculty to help them consider how they might move their courses — including final exams — to a format other than in-person delivery,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Pitt officials Tuesday cited an abundance of caution in what they described as a difficult decision to cancel trips and call students home.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of everyone in the University of Pittsburgh community is our top priority,” read a statement added to its <a href="https://www.emergency.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">emergency.pitt.edu</a> web page.</p>
<p>The university has 191 students in spring-term study abroad programming. The 27 students being told to return from France, Germany and Spain are in addition to 42 told last week to leave Italy, Japan and Korea, according to Pitt data.</p>
<p>In total, 162 students enrolled in spring break programming.</p>
<p>More than 90,000 cases of COVID-19 have been reported and 3,168 deaths. Nine deaths have been reported in the U.S.</p>
<p>The CDC guidance posted to its website Sunday reads in part:&nbsp;</p>
<p>“IHEs should consider asking students participating in study abroad programs to return&nbsp;to the United States. IHEs should work with state and local public health officials to&nbsp;determine the best approach for when and how (e.g., chartered transportation for&nbsp;countries or areas assessed as high-risk for exposure) their study-abroad students&nbsp;might return. All plans for returning study-abroad students should be designed to&nbsp;protect participants from stigma and discrimination.”</p>
<p>It also recommended the postponing or canceling international student exchange programs.</p>
<p>Pitt officials said they were being proactive, given a rise in COVID-19 cases in France, Germany and Spain. The university’s statement asked students who return from those nations to practice social-distancing, as students <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/02/28/University-of-Pittsburgh-coronavirus-study-abroad-Italy-Japan-South-Korea-social-distancing/stories/202002280173" target="_blank">called back from other affected areas last week</a> were asked to do.</p>
