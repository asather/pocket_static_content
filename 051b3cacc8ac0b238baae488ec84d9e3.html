<html><head><title>Joe Starkey: Bud Dupree is the perfect candidate for a one-year tag</title></head><body><p>We rip ’em when they’re wrong, so let’s give the Steelers credit on linebacker Bud Dupree. They were right.</p><p>It took a while, but they were right.</p><p>Mike Tomlin, Kevin Colbert, Keith Butler and Art Rooney II kept telling us they were pleased with Dupree. We wondered why.</p><p>They kept telling us Dupree would continue to improve and eventually become the player the Steelers projected him to be. We wondered when.</p><p>In his 30s?</p><p>In his 40s?</p><p>Would a gray-haired, balding Bud Dupree set the league aflame at age 53?</p><p>I mean, we were four years into the man’s career (though he did miss most of 2016), and he wasn’t exactly doing a Lawrence Taylor remake. He wasn’t even doing a Lawrence <em>Timmons</em> remake.</p><p>Nobody thought of Timmons as a premier pass rusher, yet as an inside linebacker in his third NFL season he recorded seven sacks. Dupree, going into year five as an outside backer, still hadn’t topped six sacks and had forced all of two fumbles in his entire career.</p><p>So yeah, plenty of us wondered what Rooney was talking about when he said of Dupree after last season, “There was some progress.”</p><p>Plenty of us rolled our eyes when Dupree kept saying he was <em>that close</em> to a bunch more sacks. All we saw was a guy who kept running past quarterbacks like he was looking for screen passes in reverse.</p><p>Plenty of us laughed when Butler said, “Everyone is questioning Bud, but I think Bud is going to be a good football player.”</p><p>Again, when?</p><p>The Steelers put their money where their mouths were. They picked up the expensive fifth-year option ($9.232 million) on Dupree. That meant he suddenly had the largest base salary and fourth-largest cap hit on the team.</p><p>Colbert claimed there was “no hesitation” in making that move. Tomlin said, “We’re comfortable he’s going to meet the challenge.”</p><p>Seemed questionable at the time.</p><p>Seems brilliant now.</p><p>The Steelers were right, and then some. They turned Dupree loose more often. He responded like a champion. He had 11.5 sacks, matching his total from the previous two years combined. According to Pro Football Focus, only four players who rushed predominantly from the right side were more effective than Dupree.</p><p>He doubled his career total in forced fumbles, with four, and doubled his career total in recovered fumbles with two. PFF numbers show Dupree was asked to rush the passer 73 more times this season than last and was put in coverage 52 fewer times.</p><p>There’s another big question surrounding Dupree this offseason, and it is not one we’ve heard until now: Will the Steelers do everything they can to keep him?</p><p>After waiting this long for him to break out?</p><p>How could the answer be anything but yes?</p><p>They finally have a new version of James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley. It would be a shame to break it up after one great year — and there is no need. As the Post-Gazette’s Ray Fittipaldo wrote Thursday, “It won’t be all that difficult for the Steelers to get the cap space that’s needed to sign Dupree, who would account for more than $16 million on the one-year franchise tag.”</p><p>The Steelers can create cap space by cutting various veterans whose time is up. They could start with a couple of linebackers in Anthony Chickillo and Mark Barron and go from there.</p><p>Dupree is actually a perfect candidate for a tag. The Steelers are operating in small windows here. Watt is due a mega extension after next season, and you probably can’t pay two outside linebackers huge money on long-term deals. But you can pay Dupree next season.</p><p>Ben Roethlisberger is expected back, as well, and if he is anything close to his normal self — hardly guaranteed — the Steelers will have a chance to win it all.</p><p>It sure sounded like Tomlin’s all in, when at his season=-ending news conference he said, “Make no mistake: Bud Dupree is a priority for us.”</p><p>I’m not sure what held Dupree back for so long. Maybe he was playing the wrong side for too long. Maybe he was playing injured a lot. And he did miss most of the 2016 season.</p><p>All I know is this: Lots of us were wrong.</p><p>And the Steelers were right.</p><p><em>Joe Star­key: jstar­key@post-ga­zette.com and Twit­ter @jo­e­star­key1.
