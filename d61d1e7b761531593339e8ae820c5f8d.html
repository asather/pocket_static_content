<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 03.23.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What’s up, quaranchatters? You could be ... well, pretty much nowhere in the world other than your house right now, but you’re here with me, so I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Does the Ebron signing mean they will use both he and Vance at the same time, is it insurance because both have injury history or will they dump the Egg McMuffin? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: McDonald’s, you still have plenty of time to sponsor this chat. Anyway, I think signing Eric Ebron can signal a lot of things. Declining confidence in Vance McDonald, both in terms of his health or productivity. Or maybe a lack of faith in Zach Gentry’s development. But, probably most conservatively, like you said, a renewed commitment to using two tight ends and having both of them actually be dangerous pass-catchers. Nick Vannett is a nice guy and was always helpful in the locker room, but clearly he wasn’t much of a threat downfield. Ebron should be. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: One idea I think we can safely rule out is bringing in a player of Ebron’s caliber as “insurance.”</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: With the addition of Watt, do you think the OC will incorporate the fullback into most of the running plays for this season blocking for Conner? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: “Most” is a long shot, but signing Derek Watt does tell me they intend on using a fullback more than they did with Roosevelt Nix last year (when healthy) and the season before. Art Rooney II and Kevin Colbert have been clear about needing to improve the running game, so they’re leaving no stone unturned there ... pending what they do with the actual running backs themselves.</p>
<p><strong>keith</strong>: After free agency the draft needs: Wide receiver. All other positions are for depth. I can see 1st pick being on defense - a safety or cornerback <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You could argue any positions added will be for depth at this point. Even a wide receiver would come in here behind JuJu, James Washington and Diontae Johnson. But I still think that’s the most likely target for the Steelers a month from now, mostly because that’s where the best value will be, one would think. They don’t need a cornerback, and on defense, inside linebacker is more of an issue than safety.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: If the season doesn’t happen, will the players still be paid? Would that come from teams and/or insurance companies? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Probably some of both, but as fluid as the situation has been, the latest rhetoric out of the White House regarding coronavirus makes me think the season will be played.</p>
<p><strong>Tomlin’s Heroes</strong>: What do you think of the Ebron signing. Ladarius Green maybe, but possibly dangerous weapon. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You’re right, injury history is a bit of a concern, as are drops and blocking ability. Ray Fittipaldo and I discussed him at length on a podcast we just recorded, so keep an eye out for that a little later today wherever you get your podcasts or right here <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-...</a></p>
<p><strong>Jessica</strong>: Hi Brian, Sooner or Later the Brownies will get it right.. Yes I Know it’s always the same with them but this time I think they Will Give a though fight in the División, they have a scary team top tô bottom This time.. Agree? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jessica, you’re talking to a guy who thought the Browns had it right last year. Predicted them to win the division, even. I have the receipts right here, unfortunately. The Internet is forever: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/05/2019-NFL-predictions-100th-season-pittsburgh-post-gazette-saints-super-bowl-odds/stories/201909080010" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/05/2019-NFL-predi...</a></p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Brian - Which in division team plugged the most holes to date? Which FA signing will be most impactful in 20 season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That said, I do like what the Browns did once again. But there’s a lot working against them in terms of hiring a new coaching staff and a new front office to deal with the already toxic situation there. The Ravens haven’t done a ton, but did fortify their defensive line in the middle. Franchise tagging Matt Judon helps them a lot, too.</p>
<p><strong>SOMD Panther</strong>: Assuming that all things are equal, and each position group has an equally rated “best available player” on the Kevin Colbert Big Board, which position to do you see the Steelers targeting in the second round? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Receiver, but not necessarily another possession-type guy between 5-10 and 6-1. Give me someone with some legitimate size to diversify this current group, or someone with blazing speed to make plays in space. Diontae Johnson is slippery, but not really the type to take the top off a defense or break a huge play.</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: Hey Brian...with the signing of Derek Watt and Mr. Rooney’s saying he wants the Steelers to emphasize the running game, do you think those factors increase the odds of a running back being drafted (assuming a quality back is available) at #49? Thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not really. I won’t rule it out because of the possibility of one of the big 3 (Jonathan Taylor, D’Andre Swift, J.K. Dobbins) dropping to the mid-second, but if I were running the show, I’d wait until next year to draft my running back of the future.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Brian, appreciate the chats! Would like to get your thoughts/reaction on each of external FA signings - Wisniewski, Ebron and Watt. Thanks! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No problem, Nate. <br> Wisniewski - new BJ Finney more than the new Ramon Foster<br> Ebron - highest upside, lowest floor<br> Watt - nice story/player and should be useful, but spent too much</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Ben said “I’m throwing without pain for the first time in years.” He also said “I normally don’t work out in the offseason.” So, no word to any Steeler doctors about the pain in his elbow until he couldn’t throw anymore and surgery was required? No offseason rehab at the first sign of pain? We all love his spirit/moxie/competitiveness, etc, but this is the kind of attitude and work habits that gets you three playoff wins in ten years, talent be damned. A guy Like Lebron, with all the talent in the world, still words hard to get BETTER at his game every offseason. Ben, well... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I hear you, Jacque. There’s always going to be a microscope on the franchise QB. But I think the difference there is not putting extra wear and tear on your arm in the offseason. Not that that helped matters last year, obviously.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Brian - is Wormley intended to replace Hargrave as the starting NT or is he just added into the DL rotation? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: More so the latter, in my view. He played five-technique in Baltimore, so the end in their 4-3, but the Ravens have used him at “nose.” In an odd-man front, though, he’s probably more likely Stephon Tuitt/Cam Heyward insurance, not to mention someone who’s in between Tyson Alualu and Isaiah Buggs when it comes to NFL experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: Brian - thanks for taking the time during these strange days. Now that the Steelers have filled a bunch of gaps, what are your thoughts on their first 2 picks? I think RB/WR or vice versa <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My pleasure, Jakester. I’ve already said my piece on why receiver, why not running back, but the other dark horse for that second-round pick would be an inside linebacker. Vince Williams is in line to play a lot of snaps as we sit here March 23. Problem is, the clear-cut top three in this draft of Isaiah Simmons, Kenneth Murray and Patrick Queen are all expected to be gone by then.</p>
<p><strong>sixfingerfame</strong>: Long term solution for QB given that Ben is closing out his career soon.....what do you think about Winston from TB, I think he would flourish in a system like the Steelers given that they wouldn’t have to rely on his arm as much. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hard pass. Jameis Winston might yet have a long career ahead of him, but he and the Steelers seem like an awful fit right now. Ben has bristled at drafting rookies in the third/fourth round, and now you want them to sign a guy like Winston? That’d probably send a strange message to the locker room.</p>
<p><strong>Steelers2020</strong>: GM Brian. Reports have surfaced that Diontae Johnson is training with Antonio Brown. Do you think Mike Tomlin will have a Father to Son talk with Diontae, tell him to be cautious with the company he keeps? If you recall, they tried to warn Martavis Bryant, we all know how that turned out. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I hesitate to make too much of this “story.” These guys are all adults who can decide who they want to interact with off the field. Are the (cliche alert) optics bad? Sure. But we’re in an era of sports where as soon as the game is over, opponents are pressing palms at the 50, players are instagramming their highlights win or lose. I’m not saying that’s right or wrong, just that NFL football players look at their jobs and lives a lot differently than fans do.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: don’t you think its way past time steelers just release ben, 3 playoff wins in 11 years, 2 of the last 2 years no playoffs, and hits the cap real hard!!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Other than that it would cost them like $20 million to do so, yeah, they should do that and sign LeBron.</p>
<p><strong>Manny</strong>: Ok Mr. BB With the current signings it must be BPA @49. With the exception being TE QB CB DL. So if BPA is OLB or ILB pick must be in Right? Even if Safety Winfield Jr (Heck of a player) is BPA we must take him, With a 3 great safety tandem we could do great things and by míddle season Minkah and Winfield could be playing Back There and Edmunds moving into kind of Barron Place.. Are you in BB? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: BPAWHYWN - Best Player Available Who Helps You Win Now. Doesn’t exactly roll off the tongue, I know, but rules out edge rushers and safeties.</p>
<p><strong>YinzerinVA</strong>: We should bring back more sports like the Ocho! ESPN is showing us we can create our own sports! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I wanna watch people play Jenga for sport, but not regular Jenga, the life-sized one. PUT IT ON MY TELEVISION ALREADY</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: Watt’s contract is back loaded. Any insight into Ebron’s. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure, but I’d assume the same</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Hey BB,<br> Not sure about you, but I was very pleased with the signing of Wormley and Ebron.<br> We are so much better prepared for the Draft and are now able to truly choose BPA instead of force filling Needs.<br> Thoughts on these additions? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ebron makes me think of Hebron Fangupo, which makes me think of this Joe Starkey decade-in-review project that just earned the silver medal in a national sports writing contest <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/sports-decade-2010-19/" target="_blank">https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/sports-decade-2010-19/</a></p>
<p><strong>jake</strong>: ESPN is all for the Steelers signing Winston, do they not look at our cap situation?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, that’s another thing. What gives people the idea Jameis would be willing to sign for what the Steelers would (realistically) be able to give him? I think his best landing spot would be Jacksonville, where the Gardner Minshew Experiment is fun but doesn’t seem sustainable to me from the outside. Of course, Jags fans love him.</p>
<p><strong>574Fan</strong>: Thanks again for chatting, Brian. With OL, DL depth, and TE addressed via trade or FA late last week, is there now a decent chance that their pick at #49 will truly be best player available, even if it’s a defensive player? I understand people want a workhorse RB and another receiver wouldn’t hurt, but there’s no need to reach at either, right? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The additions of Ebron, Wisniewski and Wormley SHOULD mean that you don’t have to reach for anything. Kind of like the way they set themselves up last year with Steve Nelson, Mark Barron and Donte Moncrief. Of course, they ended up moving up for Devin Bush despite the presence of Barron, then drafted Diontae Johnson with their next pick, but even that all makes sense in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>fLORIDA STEELERS</strong>: Brian, greatly appreciate the chats. I’m not jumping for joy yet with the recent FA signings especially the deal with Ebron. I was hoping they would get some help in FA with the linebacker group that is very thin. Your thoughts on the recent FA signings? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, the linebacker situation is still less than thrilling. At this point, your backups are looking like Ola Adeniyi and Tuzar Skipper on the edge, then Robert Spillane and Ulysees Gilbert on the inside. That’s three UDFAs and a sixth-round pick. Have to imagine the Steelers will want to fortify that position rather than hope two or three of those take great leaps forward.</p>
<p><strong>SOMD Panther</strong>: In a fit of nostalgia, I re-watched that ESPN 30-for-30 on the Big East. Re-felt the disappointment of Pitt’s early exit to Cuse in the final 2013 Big East Tournament. What do you miss most about the old Big East? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The familiarity that bred hatred. Also didn’t hurt that Jim Boeheim and Jim Calhoun were helming two of the best programs in that league when I was a whippersnapper.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: What do you think they will do to replace Barron? Vince Williams isn’t the answer!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Could go several directions. More Vince in the base defense seems ... iffy at best. There’s still time to find a rookie or free agent who can do what Barron did. The other options would be getting more creative with your defensive packages. More nickel, more dime, three safeties, etc. Let’s get crazy and run three pass-rushers out there with Bud playing the “inside” position every once in a while, hey?</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: How long will Brady last playing for the Quarterback Crippler? I say 3-4 games. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Oh please, Bruce Arians isn’t going to expect (or want) 42-year-old Tom Brady to play the same brand of football as 30-year-old Ben Roethlisberger. I actually think Brady is going to light it up in Tampa. Very nice supporting cast down there.</p>
<p><strong>Jim From Shaler</strong>: Now that the Steelers have addressed some of their needs via free agent signings, I’m thinking it makes sense to choose a running back at number 49 in the draft. Any thought on who would be available at that spot and whether they would be worth drafting at 49? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Jim, you could’ve just driven to my house and knocked on my door to ask this question. It’s tough to project where RBs are gonna go. You could see anywhere from none to three of them gone in the first, depending on how much teams like this group.</p>
<p><strong>CJ from his living room</strong>: Your thoughts on going through with the nfl draft? I welcome the diversion! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I welcome the chance to have the draft to write about. There’d be quite the void in the NFL if they postponed it, and to be honest, I’m fine that they aren’t doing that. Does it help both prospects and teams to make in-person visits and have pro days? Absolutely. But can you still get this thing done by watching film from the season, making good use of the combine and conducting interviews by phone? Most definitely.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: I’m sure no one knows (and hopes not)....But I wonder what would happen to next years draft if there was no 2020 NFL season. Any thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah, I have no idea. But if there’s no NFL season, that would mean there was no college football season, so conceivably, all those players would have the option of taking a COVID-induced redshirt year. OK, that’s enough speculation on that.</p>
<p><strong>Barb</strong>: What grade do you give for the Steelers free agent signings and trade? Thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don’t love grading free-agent signings just because there’s so much involved once you factor in money, years on the deal, cap hit, a lot of stuff we don’t actually know for sure until much later. It’s different than grading a draft, where you’re basically just going on player/fit/who else was available. As for the trade, I give it a solid B. Basically moved down two rounds in next year’s draft for a guy who could become a starter.</p>
<p><strong>Krugerrand</strong>: Which WR is mostly likely to be cut by the Steelers? And, what can we expect the Raiders to give up for him? 3rd, 4th, or 5th round pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ha, I see what you did there. There are a whole bunch of wideouts on the practice squad right now, but outside of them (and Amara Darboh) I’d say Ryan Switzer is more likely to stick around than Deon Cain.</p>
<p><strong>Bored teacher</strong>: Brian, it is a shame exactly what the Steelers need smoked his way out of the NFL. (Martavis) If the speedster from Penn State is not there do you see the Steelers possibly using one of their fourth picks on someone like Bryant who is not a complete package but who is also not a candidate for “High Times Man of the Year?” <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Gotta give some love to the teachers out there as we finish up the chat. Drugs are bad, kids, stay in school!<br> <br> OK, we’ve got a ton of people in here and a bunch more questions, but unfortunately I can’t chat all day. Have some other work things to tend to, but also while I’m home I might as well help my wife. Which reminds me, I have a diaper genie to empty. I might file away some of the better leftover stuff from you all for a mailbag, so keep an eye out for that.
