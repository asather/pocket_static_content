<p>Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra recordings have won a Grammy Award, multiple Grammy nominations and other national and international accolades in recent years. On Friday, the orchestra will release “Tchaikovsky Symphony No. 4 &amp; Leshnoff Double concerto for Clarinet and Bassoon.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The album,&nbsp;recorded under the baton of music director Manfred Honeck on the Reference Recordings label, is part of the “Pittsburgh Live!” series, which uses live concert recordings and a patch session to capture the energy and spontaneity of a live performance.</p>
<p>Tchaikovsky’s fourth symphony is part of the classical canon and is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/music/2019/05/31/Review-Pittsburgh-Symphony-Orchestra-concert-Tchaikovsky-Prokofiev-Rana/stories/201905310151" target="_blank">performed often</a>.

Jonathan Leshnoff, an acclaimed Baltimore-based composer, introduces juxtapositions of tonality and key to give his music a bright, colorful feel.</p>
