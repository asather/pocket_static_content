<h1>Masses resume at some Catholic parishes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since mid-March, worshippers attended Masses at several but not all Roman Catholic parishes in the region Monday as the Diocese of Pittsburgh eased restrictions it had implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It was great to see people in church again,” said the Rev.&nbsp;Anthony Gargotta, pastor of Christ Our Savior Parish on the North Side. He conducted a morning Mass at St. Cyril Church in Brighton Heights, one of the parish’s churches.</p>

<p>As the state of Pennsylvania gradually eased pandemic-related restrictions, Bishop David Zubik last month authorized the resumption of weekday Masses at the start of June and of weekend Masses on June 6 and 7.</p>
<p>To reopen, churches had to take numerous precautionary measures, such as thoroughly cleaning sanctuaries and arranging seating to ensure social distancing. Some parishes chose not to reopen this weekday as they continued to work on logistics.</p>
<p>“The local timeline for opening up is left to the pastors, within the guidelines we have released and respecting the different indications that are given by the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] and at the local level,” said Ellen Mady, chancellor for the diocese. “The pastors are facing very different situations and possibilities at the ground level, and the diocese is therefore supportive of them developing different timelines that meet their local circumstances.”</p>
<p>The diocese has also limited weekday Mass attendance to 25 for this week, and then to 25 percent of church capacity beginning this weekend.</p>
<p>Some of the procedures in Mass also have changed. Communion is given in the form of bread only, with no sharing of a common cup.</p>
<p>Father&nbsp;Gargotta said about 20 people attended Mass at St. Cyril and another dozen or so at the parish’s St. Peter Church in Allegheny Center. The latter church typically draws attendees who work in the North Side, but with many workplaces still closed or minimally staffed, the attendees were mainly neighborhood residents, he said.</p>
<p>But for those who could make it,&nbsp;“everybody was very happy,” Father Gargotta said.</p>
