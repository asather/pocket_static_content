<p><strong>House fails to override&nbsp;veto of loans policy</strong></p>
<p>House Democrats on Friday failed to override President Donald Trump’s veto of a measure that would have reversed the Education Department’s tough policy on loan forgiveness for students misled by for-profit colleges.</p>
<p>The House voted 238-173 in support of the override measure, coming up short of the two-thirds majority needed to send it to the Senate.</p>
<p>It marks a victory for Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, whose policy on student loan forgiveness was in jeopardy after Congress voted to reverse it in March. It now remains in place and will take effect July 1.</p>
<p>The measure Congress approved in March would have restored a 2016 rule created by the Obama administration. It was approved using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to overturn federal rules with a simple majority of both chambers and approval of the president.</p>
<p>While the original measure had bipartisan support, just six Republicans voted in favor of overriding the veto, while 172 opposed it.</p>
<p><strong>Ga. governor signs hate crimes law</strong></p>
<p>Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp on Friday signed legislation allowing additional penalties to be imposed for crimes motivated by a victim’s race, religion, sexual orientation or other factors, removing Georgia from the dwindling list of U.S. states without a hate crimes law.</p>
<p>State lawmakers acted with haste to pass the legislation, which had previously been stalled, following the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, as well as recent nationwide protests against racial injustice and police brutality. Arbery was a 25-year-old Black man pursued and fatally shot while running near Brunswick, Ga., in February. Three white men, including a father and son, were charged with murder after video of the killing was made public.</p>
<p>The law, which takes effect July 1, will allow additional penalties to be imposed for certain crimes when motivated by a victim’s race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender or disability. It also mandates the collection and reporting of data on hate crimes investigated by law enforcement.</p>
