<h1>4 firefighters injured while battling 4-alarm blaze in South Side Slopes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four firefighters were injured and multiple people were displaced in a four-alarm fire at an apartment building in the South Side Slopes on Sunday night.</p>
<p>First responders arrived at the scene of 38 Mount Oliver St. around 8 p.m., according to Allegheny County dispatch.</p>
<p>Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said during the course of the fire there was one mayday call for a firefighter trapped in the structure and there were two collapses in the rear of the building. Mr. Hissrich said four firefighters were injured battling the fires. Two sustained shoulder injuries, one had a laceration injury and one received a minor burn injury, according to Mr. Hissrich. All four were transported to a hospital.</p>
<p>“Firefighters did a superb job,” Mr. Hissrich said.&nbsp;“Most of the fire was contained to the center structure; however, the two adjoining structures maintained sustained major damage as far as water and smoke.”</p>
<p>Brian Kokkila, assistant of chief operations for the Pittsburgh fire department, said there were several difficulties while battling the blaze.&nbsp;Mr. Kokkila said firefighters had to transition the strategy from an&nbsp;“offensive interior attack” to a defensive operation after interior collapses trapped a couple of firefighters.</p>
<p>“Anytime we have a firefighter injury — especially inside the building — that’s going to cause us to hit the reset button for a second to make sure our crews are safe,” Mr. Kokkila said.</p>
<p>Mr. Kokkila said the main building and side buildings were occupied at the time of the fire.</p>
<p>“Everybody did what they were supposed to do,” Mr. Kokkila said. “Despite the injuries that we have, everybody came out all right.”</p>
<p>At 10 p.m., Mr. Kokkila said the scene was still active and was unsure how long crews will battle the fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Hissrich said the Red Cross was notified to assist displaced victims living in the two structures adjoining the center building. At least two people have been displaced.</p>
<p>Investigators were on the scene to determine the cause of the fire.</p>
<p>“It will be some time before they are able to determine the cause of the fire,” Mr. Hissrich said.</p>
