<h1>Could local manufacturers solve the ventilator shortage?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There is an international race to manufacture ventilators, but by the time major corporations have ramped up production, the peak of the virus will likely have passed. In Pittsburgh, at least two companies are positioned to assist, but both say they have been stymied by supply chain issues and the Food and Drug Administration approval process.</p>
<p>Intervala, a contract manufacturing company with locations in Pittsburgh and Hudson, N.H., doesn’t currently produce ventilators, but it does make other respiratory products and surgical equipment. CEO Teresa Huber said the company is capable of “turning on a dime.”</p>
<p>“We have the capability to build [ventilators],” she said. “It just comes down to the supply chain and FDA approval.”</p>
<p>ALung Technologies Inc., a medical technology startup on the South Side, has been waiting more than seven years for the FDA to approve a device that reduces a patient’s need for a ventilator. The device has been approved in more than 35 other countries since 2013.</p>
<p>The FDA has created an expedited approval process amid the COVID-19 pandemic, but&nbsp;it has yet to approve a ventilator design that smaller manufacturers could build to tide the U.S. over until larger companies have ramped up production.</p>
<p>In response to a request for comment, an FDA spokesperson responded by email saying: “DIY ventilator developers should seek an Emergency Use Authorization for ventilators that are not currently legally marketed in the U.S. ... [The] FDA will work interactively with these manufacturers.”</p>
<p><strong>Life support</strong></p>
<p>Ventilators previously approved by the FDA are monstrously complicated to make, requiring more than 600 components — some of which are in scarce supply — and a million lines of code to program. Manufacturers are estimating they’ll be able to produce tens of thousands of ventilators by summer, but more are needed sooner to help people with COVID-19 who cannot breathe on their own.</p>
<p>Estimations of how many ventilators the U.S. will need vary wildly, from <a href="https://covid19.healthdata.org/united-states-of-america" target="_blank">as low as only around 10,000</a> to several hundred thousand. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington has&nbsp;said the virus’s peak will be mid-April in some parts of the U.S.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006141" target="_blank">study</a> in the New England Journal of Medicine estimates there are between 60,000 and 160,000 ventilators in the U.S. It might be enough, but apportioning the equipment to areas of need is difficult. Some of the country’s hardest hit locales have cried out for assistance. In New York City, Gov. Andrew Cuomo made a passionate plea for 30,000 ventilators in March. On April 6, he revised that request and said the city has enough for current needs, citing creative reuse of certain equipment and donations from China and other states.</p>
<p>According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, the state has approximately 4,000 ventilators in its system; about 2,800 are still available for use. Pennsylvania has requested 1,000 ventilators from the Strategic National Stockpile, but it’s unclear whether it will receive them. The Wolf administration has also worked to procure 400 additional ventilators, which are on their way, according to state Department of Health spokesperson Nate Wardle.</p>
<p><strong>Local muscle</strong></p>
<p>To build ventilators faster, companies would need a simpler design that uses readily available parts approved by the FDA.&nbsp;Numerous researchers and universities have launched formidable efforts to concoct such a design, and several are under review at the FDA for emergency use.</p>
<p>“We’ve reached out to a lot of people to say we can make [ventilators], and we’re in contact with a number of different people trying to find a solution,” Ms. Huber said.</p>
<p>Without seeing a design, she said she couldn’t speculate on how many the company could make. But Pittsburgh is home to a number of contract medical equipment manufacturers that could potentially adapt supply lines and manufacture these devices as well.</p>
<p>Additionally, a group of Pennsylvania organizations and agencies have combined forces to create an <a href="https://spportal.dot.pa.gov/ppeinventory/pages/mschain.aspx" target="_blank">online portal</a>&nbsp;to match manufacturers with specific supply chain needs as demand for medical equipment increases. The group includes&nbsp;the Pennsylvania Manufacturers’ Association, Life Sciences PA, and the state Department of Community and Economic Development.</p>
<p><strong>Hindsight</strong></p>
<p>ALung developed a respiratory device called the Hemolung catheter in 2006 that could be used instead of, or in conjunction with, ventilators.</p>
<p>The Hemolung, designed by William Federspiel of the University of Pittsburgh’s McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine, removes carbon dioxide from the bloodstream externally. It’s similar in some ways to an extracorporeal membrane oxygenation machine, which oxygenates a patient’s blood outside the body, but the Hemolung is more efficient and less invasive.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, physicians at hospitals around the state, including those in the Allegheny Health Network and UPMC health systems, have endorsed and disseminated guidelines on using ECMO machines to aid the severely ill, according to a recent Allegheny County release.</p>
<p>“Here we are in 2020 and still not approved in the U.S.,” said Peter DeComo, CEO of ALung.</p>
<p>Mr. DeComo started his career as a respiratory therapist and has served as director or respiratory services at Shadyside Hospital.</p>
<p>ALung’s device is in the middle of two significant clinical trials in the U.K. and the U.S., and Mr. DeComo said he has submitted an application for emergency use application to the FDA. He said he believes the FDA is working to accelerate its processes during the crisis.</p>
<p>“I tend to be apolitical, but the FDA has become much more reasonable to work with under President [Donald] Trump compared to previous years,” he said. “And I’m not a big fan of Trump.”</p>
<p>Still, even if the device were approved today, it would take time to create a supply chain to build a significant number of Hemolung devices and to train medical professionals in their use.</p>
<p><strong>Adapting to scale</strong></p>
<p>While the goodwill and resourcefulness is encouraging, the reality on the ground is still sobering. According to several studies from the U.S., China and Europe, most patients sick enough to need a ventilator due to the new coronavirus&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/04/02/826105278/ventilators-are-no-panacea-for-critically-ill-covid-19-patients" target="_blank">die</a> even if they receive treatment with a ventilator.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Massachusetts Institute for Technology has submitted a design to the FDA, as has the University of Minnesota. A group of scientists in the U.S., Canada and Europe have submitted a design that they claim uses easily available parts.</p>
<p>The FDA has approved adapting existing devices to be used as ventilators, including Philips Respironics BiPAP and anesthesia machines made in Murrysville, as well as a splitter that allows a single ventilator to be used by multiple patients. Mr. Cuomo, the New York governor, is ordering thousands of such machines.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A fuel cell engineer in California has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/04/02/Can-you-fix-ventilators-A-fuel-cell-engineer-figures-it-out/stories/202004020109" target="_blank">repaired</a> more than 500 ventilators. Some designers are experimenting with 3D&nbsp;<a href="https://builtin.com/hardware/3d-printing-coronavirus-equipment" target="_blank">printing</a> certain components of emergency ventilators that are difficult to source. The medical equipment company <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/03/30/medtronic-is-sharing-its-portable-ventilator-design-specifications-and-code-for-free-to-all/" target="_blank">Medtronic</a> has published one of its simpler ventilator designs for free under a special permissive license in hopes of inspiring innovation.</p>
<p>Around the world, people are hastening to come up with a viable solution.</p>
<p>“We can build a ventilator regardless of FDA approval,” Ms. Huber said. “The designer would need to handle that part. Because of the pandemic, the federal government has done a lot to speed this process up. They’ll find a way to push it through.”</p>
<p>“I think we’re a very innovative country,” said Mr. DeComo of Alung. “It’s certainly possible that manufacturers could jump into make basic ventilators to help. I’m keeping the faith as we rally all these things will come together and work.”</p>
