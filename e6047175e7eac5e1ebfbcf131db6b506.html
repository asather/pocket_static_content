<h1>How Pat Narduzzi, Pitt staff are handling 2020 prep, recruiting amid pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On March 17, the day Pitt was originally scheduled to resume spring camp, Pat Narduzzi walked downstairs from his office at the UPMC Rooney Sports Complex to the Panthers' weight room. He thought of a few local stragglers hitting the bench press — and a spotter within close quarters — and realized none of it was worth the risk. None of it made any sense.</p>
<p>“It's time to go home,” Narduzzi said at the time. “With what's transpired, we just can't keep doing this.”</p>
<p>Pitt closed its doors on the South Side on the 17th, five days after the ACC officially suspended all organized athletic activities amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The Panthers were on spring break while coronavirus concerns canceled college basketball tournaments and suspended professional sports indefinitely across the country. And in conjunction with the ACC's decision on March 12, Narduzzi instructed his players on spring break to stay home for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Four weeks later, Narduzzi still has no idea when he'll see his team again in person.</p>
<p>However, the coach confirmed his team and staff are healthy amid this pandemic, and they're using Zoom to stay prepared for the 2020 football season — regardless of when that might begin.</p>
<p>“We really haven't lost a step in any phase of our football program right now,” Narduzzi said Friday afternoon on a video conference call with reporters, his first media appearance since Pitt's third (and unknowingly final) spring practice on March 6. “We were really prepared before we walked out of those offices. ... And ever since, we've really been doing our job from home.”</p>
<p>Now, “haven't lost a step” might be a stretch. Narduzzi conceded that the thing he and his staff miss most is interacting with players personally and having control over what they're doing, developmentally and strength wise. Some players are pouring cement in buckets, attaching ropes and squatting them. Others are curling backpacks filled with textbooks. Points should be awarded for creativity, sure. But it's not the same as preparing for a season with strength coach Mike Stacchiotti and under the watchful eye of the staff.</p>
<p>“I could tell you I did 100 of them today, but I haven't done my pushups yet,” Narduzzi added. “You just don't know what everyone's doing, how distracted they are back at home. It's just a different world.”</p>
<p>With that in mind, Pitt is just trying its best to adapt to the circumstances.</p>
<p>Each morning, the coaching staff holds a 7:30 a.m. staff meeting over Zoom, an hour later than it would normally be on the South Side. Players, when they're not taking online classes, are frequently involved in virtual positional meetings and workouts. At the end of the day, Narduzzi receives recap emails from Stacchiotti, offensive coordinator Mark Whipple, defensive coordinator Randy Bates, recruiting coordinator Rob Harley and associate athletic director Chris LaSala to stay abreast of everything that went down.</p>
<p>Still, Narduzzi is a high-strung guy, as are most college football coaches. And a time like this — a time of uncertainty — tests those who preach “control the controllables.”</p>
<p>“It's going to be about how we social distance and take care of our business. That's why it's so important for really everyone to do their job,” Narduzzi said. “You talk about a team, right now the USA is a big team, and we're all in this thing together. ... We all want the same thing. We want the economy back up. We want football, and we want basketball and hockey to finish their seasons. But the only way to do it is to stick together as a team and make this thing happen.”</p>
<p><strong>What will the 2020 season (and its buildup) look like?</strong></p>
<p>Narduzzi considers himself and his program fortunate to have three spring practices worth of tape to overanalyze during this time of self-quarantine. Some schools, like ACC foe Syracuse, didn't get any practice time in March — and no one's really sure if that time will be awarded at a later date.</p>
<p>Count Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke among those who are skeptical. She told reporters last week that there's “probably not a lot of potential to recapture” those lost practices. When asked about the possibility of getting back that practice time — Pitt had 12 more sessions, including the spring game originally scheduled for Saturday — Narduzzi didn't sound hopeful. He called it “an unfair advantage” that schools like Clemson completed nine practices, but not one anyone could control.</p>
<p>“If the NCAA and the conferences and the Power Five can get together and say, 'Hey, we have to do something,' great. But it's not Clemson's fault they got nine in. ... It's not Syracuse's fault they got zero in,” Narduzzi added. “If we would've known this would take place, we would have started spring ball the week school started in January. Come out of bowl practice and get right into it before this whole thing comes down.</p>
<p>“So nothing we can do about spring ball. It's water under the bridge. The big concern is where we're going to be in the future.”</p>
<p>That's exactly what Narduzzi discussed with his peers on Thursday. The ACC hosted a coaches conference call on Zoom, the second in as many weeks. Narduzzi expects the call to be a regular occurrence, and this week, necessary preparation time was a primary topic of discussion.</p>
<p>Say social distancing is lifted in late August: How much time does a football team need to ramp up to a season? While he'd prefer six weeks of prep, Narduzzi said a month was the minimum required. Seconds later, though, he said he could even live with three weeks if necessary.</p>
<p>“No one wants to miss college football this fall,”&nbsp;Pitt's coach said, adding that anything other than a 12-game slate would only add to the weirdness that's been 2020 so far. “Having to play eight games wouldn't be what we <em>want</em>. But we'll adjust and modify and do what we have to do if that's the case.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Narduzzi and his peers <em>need</em> contingency plans. They need scenarios. They need to know that every avenue, every path to football in an unpredictable landscape is being considered.</p>
<p>“Zero scenarios will drive us all bananas,” Narduzzi said. “We'll get nowhere.”</p>
<p><strong>How is recruiting affected?</strong></p>
<p>Narduzzi doesn't want to give away any trade secrets, not a surprise for someone so closely guarded about injuries. But Pitt's coach did offer a tidbit on how his staff is connecting with recruits without hosting them or visiting for dinner during an extended dead period: Online Madden.</p>
<p>Yep, at least one Pitt coach has pitched a prospect while presumably running “four verticals” and chatting about facilities. And it's not Narduzzi.</p>
<p>“I'm not set up with that myself at my house,” Narduzzi laughed. “But I talked to my son about it. Maybe I'll go on and play a little ball.”</p>
<p>Even if he doesn't, it seems Pitt is doing alright for itself on the recruiting *trail*.</p>
<p>Pitt announced Friday afternoon that its recruiting camps in June are canceled, but the staff is still preparing to host 2021 prospects at some point this summer. In the meantime, Narduzzi said recruiting has actually “sped up” with more FaceTime conversations and phone calls than ever before with, frankly, not much else to do.</p>
<p>Narduzzi feels good about Pitt's 2021 recruiting class, led by West Mifflin's Nahki Johnson, and the remaining prospects in his own backyard, guys who might stay home longer than just this quarantine period. Four-star Gateway safety Derrick Davis, four-star Central Catholic defensive tackle Elliot Donald, three-star Baldwin pass-rusher Dorien Ford and three-star Peters Township safety Donovan McMillon remain uncommitted.</p>
<p>“This is as good of a class that has been intact in this state of Pennsylvania since I've been here,” Narduzzi said. “This year is a heck of a year in the state of Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p><strong>Staying sane?</strong></p>
<p>Coaching duties aside, Narduzzi is trying to avoid going stir-crazy in quarantine much like the rest of the country. He's watching movies with his wife and kids, taking his dog for a walk whenever the weather permits and checking out what Netflix has to offer.</p>
<p>When asked for a recommendation, Narduzzi had one: Not to watch <em>Tiger King</em>, the viral documentary miniseries about the life of zookeeper Joe Exotic.</p>
<p>“That stupid <em>Tiger King</em> thing, what is anyone getting out of that stupid thing?” Narduzzi said of the show that was watched by 34.3 million people over its first 10 days of release, according to Nielsen. “Man, I watched one episode of that and guys, I'm out of here. Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>“Just people trying to make money and say stupid things. ... What a mess.”</p>
