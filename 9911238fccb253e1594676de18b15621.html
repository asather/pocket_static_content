<h1>Paul Zeise: Mike Sullivan needs to settle on Penguins' goalie for stretch run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I’m not sure who first said&nbsp;“if you have two quarterbacks, you really have none,” but it is one of those old school thoughts that still holds water to this day. It is true, nobody has two excellent quarterbacks, so if you are trying to choose and can’t, you probably have two that are mediocre.</p>
<p>I often wonder if this adage also applies to goalies in the NHL. It seems some teams have had two excellent goalies to choose from, but in almost every case, the head coach has picked one and settled on him as the starter.</p>
<p>A few years back, when the Penguins had Marc-Andre Fleury and Matt Murray, it was clear by the end of the season that Murray was the starter. He got hurt, Fleury played the early part of the playoffs and Mike Sullivan rode him while he was hot. The minute he faltered, though, he was benched in favor of Murray and he was the goalie that got them to the finish line of a Stanley Cup championship.</p>
<p>And that brings me to this year’s Penguins, who seem to have the same dilemma at goalie. Murray and Tristan Jarry have both played extremely well this season. The Penguins have had a chance pretty much every night regardless of which player is in the net.</p>
<p>Statistically speaking, Jarry has outplayed Murray. Jarry has a superior save percentage (.927 to .901), a better goals against (2.23 to 2.84), more shutouts (3 to 1) and, despite playing three fewer games, has more wins (20 to 17).&nbsp;I would think in a different situation, Jarry would already have been named the starter, but it is clear Sullivan has a lot of loyalty and comfort with Murray — and rightfully so, given his two Stanley Cups.</p>
<p>It isn’t an easy decision to make and Sullivan knows it, but it is a decision that needs to be made and sooner rather than later. He has to pick one of the two goalies soon and let him be the starter to get ready for the playoffs. That doesn’t mean he picks one and lets the other rot on the bench, but it is a mistake to continue alternating them.</p>
<p>It has been good for Sullivan to be able to use both goalies. They have been able to push each other. They both should be well-rested and fresh come playoff time. There are 21 games left, which means even if Sullivan played the same goalie in every single game, neither would even have 55 games played.</p>
<p>There is something to be said for having a fresh goalie going into the playoffs, but there is also something to be said about a goalie being sharp. A goalie that only plays once a week is not likely to be ready for the grind of the playoffs. That’s not to say it is impossible for a goalie to get ready for the playoffs with less than a full work load, but at this point, I wouldn’t test that theory if I were Sullivan.</p>
<p>He needs to pick one goalie and ride him for the next eight to 10 games to see what kind of production he gets. Obviously if he doesn’t perform, Sullivan would still have enough of a season left to make the change. The division of labor, though, should be something like 15 games for whomever Sullivan is going to pick for the playoffs and six for the backup.</p>
<p>Goalies want to know their role. And goalies, like quarterbacks, also don’t like to split time. They don’t like to have to play with one eye looking over their shoulder. Sullivan can go a long way toward getting his team ready for the playoffs by picking the goalie the team is going to be playing in front of now.</p>
<p>I don’t know what the right answer is, and only Sullivan has an idea of which direction he wants to go come the playoffs. I don’t necessarily buy the idea that it has to be Murray just because he has won two Stanley Cups, either. Jarry has clearly been better this season and while experience counts for something, let’s not forget Murray won a Stanley Cup as a rookie, so playoff experience is a little overrated.</p>
<p>Sullivan has the luxury of having two goalies who are both capable, and the fact that he needs to choose one is a good problem to have. It is still a problem, though, and one that is easily solved. Sullivan needs to quit alternating goalies and name a starter and stick with him until he proves he isn’t up to the job.</p>
<p>It is in the best interest of the team in the long run and it is in the best interest of the goalies. The two-goalie system has worked wonderfully to this point in the season, but the stretch run and playoffs are different and the Penguins are a team that can win the Stanley Cup. They need a goalie who isn’t looking over his shoulder to lead them there, and that will only happen if Sullivan picks one or the other.</p>
