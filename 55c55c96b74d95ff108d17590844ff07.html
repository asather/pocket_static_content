<h1>New WPIAL basketball section alignments: Central Catholic moves to east</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Central Catholic High School boys basketball team has spent most of the past decade in a section with teams from the northern suburbs. But for the next two seasons, Central Catholic will be traveling mostly to the east.</p>
<p>The WPIAL released its new section alignments Tuesday morning for boys and girls teams. The alignments will hold for the next two seasons. In one of the most notable changes, Central Catholic will move from Section 1 to Section 3 and will play in a section with Greensburg Salem, Hempfield, Norwin, Penn-Trafford and Fox Chapel.</p>
<p>Since the 2008-09 season, Central Catholic played in the northern section, with the exception of two years (2012-14). With Central Catholic’s exit, Section 1 will have only five teams while the other two Class 6A sections will have six. Central Catholic made it to the WPIAL Class 6A semifinals this past season.</p>
<p>In the past, four teams from each section have qualified for the WPIAL playoffs. But WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said playoff qualifiers will be discussed at a WPIAL board of directors meeting next week.</p>
<p>In other notable moves in boys basketball:</p>
<p>• New Castle will play in Class 5A Section 2 along with Chartiers Valley, Moon, South Fayette, Trinity and West Allegheny. New Castle’s enrollment bumped the team up from Class 4A to 5A. New Castle had won three of the past four WPIAL 4A titles.</p>
<p>• Lincoln Park will play in Class 4A Section 2, unless it wins an appeal with the PIAA next week. Lincoln Park’s enrollment would place the team in Class 3A. But under the PIAA’s new “competition formula” rule, Lincoln Park was bumped up to Class 4A. The formula moves teams up in classification if they go far in the PIAA tournaments in two seasons and have at least one transfer in two years. Mike Bariski, Lincoln Park’s coach and athletic director, is appealing his team’s move up in classification, claiming the new competition formula should not be used because the PIAA playoffs were not completed this season, due to COVID-19. Lincoln Park qualified for the PIAA quarterfinals when the tournament was stopped.</p>
<p>If Lincoln Park wins appeal, which is highly unlikely, the Leopards would stay in Class 3A. In its new Class 4A section, Lincoln Park would play Ambridge, Beaver, Blackhawk, Central Valley, Hopewell, Montour and Quaker Valley. Lincoln Park is the only WPIAL team affected by the new competition formula.</p>
<p>• North Catholic, the WPIAL Class 3A champ this season, moves up to Class 4A and will play in a section with Burrell, Deer Lakes, Derry, Freeport, Keystone Oaks and Knoch.</p>
<p>• Latrobe, which has always played in the largest classification, dropped down to Class 5A and will play in the same section against, among others, McKeesport, Penn Hills and Woodland Hills.</p>
<p>In girls basketball:</p>
<p>• The WPIAL will continue to have only two sections in Class 6A, with eight teams in one section and seven in the other. This is different than Class 6A boys, which splits 17 teams into three sections. Class 6A girls had 16 teams the past two seasons, but Connellsville and Fox Chapel moved down to Class 5A while Penn-Trafford moved up to Class 6A. Penn-Trafford will play in a section with mostly northern suburban teams, but also Norwin.</p>
<p>• North Catholic, the four-time WPIAL Class 4A champion, moved down to Class 3A because of its enrollment, and the Trojanettes will play in a section with Beaver Falls, Ellwood City, Freedom, Laurel, Mohawk and Riverside. Laurel was a WPIAL Class 2A finalist last year, but moved up to 3A. Mohawk won the WPIAL Class 3A championship this season.</p>
<p>• Beaver, a Class 3A finalist this season, moved to Class 4A and will play in a section with, among others, Blackhawk, Central Valley and Quaker Valley.</p>
