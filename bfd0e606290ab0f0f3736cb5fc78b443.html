<h1>Criminal investigations target shale gas industry  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro said he is expending significant investigative resources in pursuit of more than a dozen criminal cases involving the shale gas industry.</p>
<p>In a phone interview Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Shapiro cited the protections for clean air and pure water in the state Constitution as justifications for pursuing the criminal cases.</p>
<p>“I can confirm that my office has more than a dozen ongoing criminal investigations into fracking and pipeline companies,” Mr. Shapiro said. “You can expect some will result in criminal charges in the near future.”</p>
<p>He said Pennsylvania is one of two states to have protections for environmental values in its Constitution, and he takes enforcement of those values seriously.</p>
<p>As an example he noted the criminal charges filed in November against Inflection Energy, a Denver gas drilling company, and Double D Construction of Montoursville, Lycoming County, for the 2017 discharge of 63,000 gallons of treated brine water into a tributary of Loyalsock Creek.</p>
<p>“We are putting enormous resources of the attorney general’s office into these investigations,” he said. “I am deeply concerned with protecting our constitutional rights to clean air and pure water, and anything that harms that gets our attention.”</p>
<p>David Spigelmyer, president of the Marcellus Shale Coalition, a Moon-based trade organization representing the shale gas industry, said he couldn't comment on the "broad, ongoing investigations," but added that "protecting and enhancing public health, safety and our shared environment comes first."</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro’s investigative focus on the shale gas industry and its operations in the Marcellus Shale fields of Pennsylvania comes at a time when climate change, fracking and the nation’s natural gas-fueled energy independence has become an issue in the presidential campaign issue.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro declined to talk about or even confirm the existence of a criminal grand jury focused on environmental crimes that the attorney general’s office has operated.&nbsp;However the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette reported in January 2019 that based on information from multiple independent sources a state investigative grand jury was taking testimony in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Two Washington County residents, June Chappel of Hopewell, and Stephanie Hallowich, a one-time vocal critic of the shale gas drilling around her then home in Mount Pleasant, testified at the grand jury early in 2019.</p>
<p>Also in January, the newspaper reported that in August 2018 the attorney general’s office had contacted attorneys in a Washington County civil case involving alleged problems at a shale gas operation that it had "assumed jurisdiction over several criminal investigations involving environmental crimes in Washington County," and one of those investigations "involves your respective clients."</p>
<p>In that civil case, Stacey Haney and her neighbors in Amwell claimed toxic spills, leaks and air pollutants at Range Resources Appalachia LLC's Yeager shale gas well had damaged their health, and that the state Department of Environmental Protection faked and reported incomplete air test results that under-reported pollution levels at the well site and nearby homes.</p>
<p>Range Resources and 10 other companies that worked on the Yeager well settled the case in August 2018, paying Ms. Haney and her neighbors $3 million. But, in an unusual move, the attorney general's office asked attorneys representing both sides to preserve the case's documents and physical evidence or face penalties.</p>
<p>Scott Perry, DEP deputy secretary for the Office of Oil and Gas Management, confirmed in November 2019 that he had appeared before the grand jury in Pittsburgh and that a ”couple dozen” other DEP employees had testified there before he did.</p>
<p>Mr. Perry did not provide any details of his testimony and Elizabeth Rementer, a DEP spokeswoman, declined comment.</p>
<p>The DEP did confirm in November that it had hired four law firms to represent it and its employees in the criminal investigation by the attorney general's office.</p>
<p>Representing employees are Dilworth Paxson, with offices in Harrisburg and Philadelphia, as well as Delaware, New Jersey and New York; Schnader Harrison Segal &amp;Lewis, with offices in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, New Jersey, Delaware, New York and California; and Ballard Spahr, headquartered in Philadelphia and with offices in a dozen states and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p>The DEP has also hired the law firm of Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick &amp; Raspanti to represent it in the wide-ranging probe. That firm has offices in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia and Sharon and in Ohio and West Virginia.</p>
