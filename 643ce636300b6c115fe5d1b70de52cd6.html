<p>As Gov. Tom Wolf grapples with the decision <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/04/20/Pennsylvania-Tom-Wolf-extends-stay-at-home-order-May-8-curbside-liquor-pick-up/stories/202004200096" target="_blank">to relax stay-at-home restrictions</a> after his state-mandated May 8 extension, local towns and boroughs have already decided to cancel some of their biggest summer festivities to comply with social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>Brentwood will not be hosting any Fourth of July celebrations this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>

<p>Brentwood announced a moratorium on all Independence Day-related events on its Facebook page Monday evening, saying there were&nbsp;“many factors” that contributed to the decision, but safety was the main reason.</p>
<p>“We always appreciate everyone’s support and look forward to an amazing comeback parade in 2021,” the announcement read.</p>
<p>Brentwood Mayor Dennis Troy declared a state of emergency at the peak of the pandemic on March 16. At a March 23 meeting, Brentwood Borough council voted to extend the state of emergency another 30 days.</p>
<p>The borough has been known for its annual Fourth of July festivities. Brentwood’s first parade in 1919 has grown into a three-day celebration that includes a community day, a street fair, a 5K race, parade and fireworks display that draw tens of thousands of people, according to the <a href="https://www.brentwoodboro.com/ourcommunity/fourth-of-july-celebration-2.html" target="_blank">borough’s website</a>.</p>

<p>Tuesday morning, Cranberry announced its annual Cranberry Township Community Chest Community Days have been canceled. The three-day event that draws nearly 30,000 people in mid-July was called off due to&nbsp;“uncertainty caused by the coronavirus pandemic,” a release from township spokesperson Tina Fedko said.</p>
<p>“Canceling the event allows the Township to concentrate on the challenges the coronavirus presents to the community,” the announcement read.</p>
<p>CTCC Community Days, which date back 44 years, will return in 2021 on July 8-10.</p>
<p>The City of Pittsburgh is still holding on to hope that parks and pools will be able to operate as usual in the event that social distancing restrictions are lifted by Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p>Although Citicamp registration has been postponed, Citiparks has opened up applications for lifeguards in the event that pools are able to open so that lifeguards can be trained as quickly as possible.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Citiparks said in a release Monday that it has not yet been determined if and when its 18 outdoor locations will open.</p>
<p>“We are continuing to plan the opening of our pools around current restrictions,” Citiparks Director Ross Chapman said in a statement. “This way, we can begin training our lifeguard recruits as soon as any timelines are given. No dates yet, just planning.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Boys and Girls Club of Western Pennsylvania is looking into online or blending learning approaches to some of its summer programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa Abel-Palmieri,&nbsp;President and CEO of Boys and Girls Club Western Pennsylvania, told the Post-Gazette that the organization is also&nbsp;partnering with various school districts to conducts wellness check-ins and be a community liaison to families.</p>
<p>The Girl Scouts of Western Pennsylvania also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/20/Girl-Scouts-cancel-summer-camps-western-pa-pittsburgh/stories/202004200097" target="_blank">made an announcement Monday</a> that it was canceling all summer day camps and sleep away camps.</p>
