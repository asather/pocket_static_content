<h1>Penguins, FNB partnership deal builds on bank's presence at former Civic Arena site</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the way things are going, First National Bank’s Vincent Delie Jr. soon might be anchoring the first line for the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
<p>FNB and Mr. Delie, its president and CEO, have reached a partnership deal with the Penguins that includes naming rights to one of the gates at PPG Paints Arena and other sponsorships.</p>
<p>The agreement comes nearly a year after the North Shore-based bank decided to move its headquarters to a 26-story office tower being built at the former Civic Arena site in the lower Hill District, which the Penguins are redeveloping.</p>
<p>“The Penguins are a premier sports organization and are part of the spirit of our headquarters city,” Mr. Delie said in a statement. “We are proud to support such a valuable cultural asset and to add this partnership to our extensive commitment to Pittsburgh and the organizations, projects and experiences that make it so unique.”</p>
<p>As part of the multi-partnership deal, the PPG Paints entrance on Centre Avenue across from Logan Street will become the “F.N.B. Gate”, replacing Verizon, which had held the naming rights.</p>
<p>With its future presence at the old arena site itself, the bank will become the first company to bridge that development and PPG Paints Arena itself.</p>
<p>In addition, a premium seating section inside the new arena will be renamed the “F.N.B Club,” replacing KeyBank, whose sponsorship had ended.</p>
<p>FNB also will join a dozen other companies like UPMC, FedEx and 84 Lumber in becoming a Penguins’ founding partner. It will become the official retail banking partner and official digital banking partner of the team.</p>
<p>The latter includes the placement of bank ATMs throughout the arena and the creation of a new digital center that incorporates banking services with promotions.</p>
<p>No terms of the partnership agreement were released.</p>
<p>Deals for naming rights to gates and other sections inside sports venues typically are shorter in length than traditional naming rights agreements and usually don't pay as much money individually, experts have said.</p>
<p>While each in itself may generate six to seven figures for a sports team, collectively they can produce more each year than the building's naming rights.</p>
<p>“Our partnership with F.N.B. unites two organizations that share a dedication to excellence and to improving the quality of life in the city we both call home,” Penguins CEO and president David Morehouse said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We are excited to work together to continue building a transformational partnership to show our appreciation, give back to our fans and invest in the local community.”</p>
<p>As part of the deal, FNB also will have a presence at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex in Cranberry.</p>
<p>The bank will join Peoples and Highmark with high-profile naming rights to gates at the arena. PPG holds the naming rights to the facility itself.</p>
<p>The change in signage at the arena will begin immediately and will be in place for the start of the Penguins’ preseason.</p>
<p>The Penguins and FNB recently partnered to provide $100,000 toward the creation of a technology-driven learning center at Ammon Recreation Center in the Hill District.</p>
<p>The bank also has agreed to advance $11 million in investment to the middle and upper Hill District that will be produced through tax revenue generated by the former arena redevelopment. The money will be paid when it closes on the land needed for the office tower.</p>
