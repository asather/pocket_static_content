<h1>Pirates on pause: Which prospects are poised for big years in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>It is unclear right now whether there will be a minor league baseball season in 2020.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has put every sport in the country on hold, and while there is growing optimism that MLB will play, the equation is different for the minor leagues, where TV contracts essentially don’t exist and the money flow is a separate animal from that of MLB teams.</p>
<p>That possibility hurts organizations like the Pirates, who aren’t expected to compete for a World Series this year and could use any games available for their minor league prospects to develop and take steps to get closer to helping the major league squad.</p>
<p>With that being said, it’s still worth taking a look at the Pirates’ farm system to see who is — or would have been — poised for a big season.</p>
<p>We’ll start with a bit of a silver lining. Discussions around MLB for restarting the 2020 season have included roster expansion. The intent would be to guard against injuries during a schedule that may include less off-days and more doubleheaders. Plus, if there is no minor league season, there would need to be more players either on the roster or at the ready to fill in if need be.</p>
<p>The positive for the Pirates is that some of their top prospects are knocking on the door of the big leagues and could get a promotion with any roster expansion.</p>
<p>It seems strange to throw shortstop Cole Tucker in the mix here, since he played 56 games with the Pirates last season, so we won’t dawdle here long. But he at least deserves a mention as a young player who could get more shine with more roster spots.</p>
<p>More in line with the thinking of this article is right-hander Mitch Keller, the Pirates’ third-best prospect, according to Fangraphs. He started 11 games for the Pirates in 2019, and while he struggled by some numbers, with a 7.13 ERA, he did tally a strikeout-to-walk ratio of 4.06. For context, that would have been near the tops of the league if maintained over a full season.</p>
<p>With the high hopes the Pirates have for the 24-year-old, and with the year-plus he’s already spent in Class AAA Indianapolis, Keller likely would have pushed for a spot in the starting rotation anyway. Even if he didn’t, this year would have been a big one for Keller to show if the solid numbers he had in the minors — a sub-4.00 ERA and more than a strikeout per inning — could be repeated on the big stage.</p>
<p>Ke’Bryan Hayes is another candidate for a spot on an expanded roster. The 23-year-old third-baseman, who is No. 1 in Fangraphs’ Pirates prospect rankings, spent last year in Indianapolis. He may have been given more time in the minors under normal circumstances, but as is obvious, these aren’t normal circumstances.</p>
<p>Regardless, Hayes also had strong numbers with Indianapolis, finishing third on the team in RBIs and hits, and tied for second in doubles and home runs. He and Keller seem to be the next-in-line players for whom the Pirates have high hopes, no matter what happens this season.</p>
<p>Other candidates for expanded roster spots, in terms of young prospects, include first baseman Will Craig, who showed impressive power on the 2019 Indians, and reliever Blake Cederlind, who was mostly in Class AA last year but has shown big strides since adding a power sinker into his pitching arsenal.</p>
<p>An optimist might throw No. 2 prospect, shortstop Oneil Cruz, in the mix, too. There’s still some question about whether or not the 6-foot-7, 21-year-old can stick at the shortstop position. What isn’t a question is how impressive he is at the plate. The kid hits bombs. He only had 10 last season, but he can hit them a mile.</p>
<p>In spring training, Cruz said he wanted to make the big league roster in 2020. Whether or not that will or would have happened, this season could provide some more sample size to see how well that power translates as he moves up the organizational ladder. Plus, the nature of his size is that he’ll have to continue to prove his fielding prowess at shortstop if he wants to stay there.</p>
<p>For now, Cruz will still be one of the more exciting players in the system, no matter where he ends up.</p>
<p>The other players filling out Fangraphs’ top five rankings are the Pirates’ 2018 first-round pick, outfielder Travis Swaggerty, and 20-year-old right-hander Tahnaj Thomas.</p>
<p>Swaggerty played well last season in Class A Bradenton, but there are some steps he could take in his game. Ideally, the Pirates would like him to rediscover some of the power that made him such an enticing draft choice coming out of South Alabama. There, his slugging percentage was over .500 in two different seasons, and his on-base percentage was over .400 in his career.</p>
<p>Those numbers may not be attainable long-term for Swaggerty, but he finished below league average in Bradenton for slugging percentage last year. This year could have been an opportunity to rekindle some of his power numbers as he inches toward the big leagues.</p>
<p>Thomas could build off a strong 2019. After struggling with his original organization, the Cleveland Indians, Thomas flourished once he was traded to the Pirates, striking out 59 batters over 48.1 innings in rookie ball last year.</p>
<p>This year also could provide the Pirates with a look at what they received in the Starling Marte trade. Shortstop Liover Peguero and pitcher Brennan Malone are both 19 years old, and both are currently top-10 Pirates prospects. Peguero hit .300 in 60 games last year, and Malone’s fastball reaches 97 mph, but both have extremely small sample sizes.</p>
<p>2019 first-round-pick Quinn Priester is in a similar situation, showing some promise last year in just 32 2/3 innings pitched.</p>
<p>If they all put together good 2020 seasons, the Pirates could point to more quality talent down the line.</p>
<p>Pretty much everyone mentioned here is the cream of the crop for the Pirates’ farm system, but 2020 could qualify as a big year for just about any prospect. Any chance they can get to show flashes of promise helps bolster them in the eyes of the Pirates.</p>
<p>With the current situation, maybe some of them will get a sooner-than-expected promotion to the big leagues. A vast majority may not get any chance to play baseball this year.&nbsp;Nonetheless, all can build excitement with a year of good play, whether that be in 2020 or years down the road.</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:</strong> Will Craig’s 23 home runs in Class AAA last year were the most in a season for the Indianapolis Indians since Graham Koonce hit 23 in 2005.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:</strong> MLB Pipeline has the Pirates’ farm system ranked No. 15 in MLB.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:</strong> “I really worked on my hitting this offseason, and I’m just continuing to work on that approach. Being able to hit 95-96 mph and adjust to the off-speed, I feel like that’s the only thing holding me back from really flourishing with my hitting. Other than that, I’ve just been getting faster and stronger, those types of things.” — Ke’Bryan Hayes</p>
