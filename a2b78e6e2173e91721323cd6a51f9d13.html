<h1>Us: If you ever got drunk at Froggy's, you probably met these guys</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nearly everyone of a certain age has a Froggy’s story —&nbsp;a drunken, often ribald tale revolving around Downtown’s most notorious hot spot in the 1980s and ’90s. J. Mac McCafferty and Rory McCoy were probably characters in every single one —&nbsp;even if you don’t remember them.</p>
<p>They were front-door bouncers almost from the day Steve “Froggy” Morris opened the tavern’s double doors in 1979 to its closing in 2003, followed by Froggy’s death five years later. Now the owners of the 1890s building at the intersection of Market Street and First Avenue <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/06/26/Troiani-Development-wins-emergency-appeal-to-raze-209-First-Avenue-Froggys/stories/202006270030" target="_blank">want to tear it down</a> to make way for another office tower with no tales worth telling, and no need for bouncers to manage its occupants.</p>
<p>After Mac wrote a book about his adventures —&nbsp;“Life Lessons Learned Down at the Pub,” $19.99 paperback —&nbsp;he and Rory did a reading at the Duquesne Club. They asked for a show of hands of Froggy’s regulars.</p>
<p>“Did you ever throw up there, fall down the steps or get picked up by the police?” Rory asked as hands fell. “Then you’re not a Froggy’s regular.”</p>
<p>Froggy, a fixture at the front table with a glass of Dewar’s scotch and a Winston cigarette, liked to visit drinkers sprawled across the sidewalk at the end of the night.</p>
<p>“ ‘Another satisfied Froggy’s customer,’ he would always say,” according to Mac.</p>
<p>Mac, 61, now co-owns Hooples in his native Carrick, breaking Life Lesson 1 in the first line of his book: “I don’t now or ever want to own a bar!”</p>
<p>So why did he do it, knowing the long hours, volatile clientele and many sacrifices? The answer is Froggy’s, or rather, Froggy himself. Mac, a retired Pittsburgh Public Schools history teacher, learned nearly everything he knows about running a bar from the gravelly voiced barman. Mostly, he does the opposite of Froggy.</p>
<p>Friday nights, the bar’s busiest, usually started with a dozen kegs and 275 cases of beer in the cavernous cooler. One ended with nothing but a six-pack of Beck’s Dark.</p>
<p>“The cooler was empty, like walking in a library,” Mac says. “I said, ‘Steve, you should have ordered more beer.’ And he said, ‘Kid, you just don’t understand the business.’ ”</p>
<p>Froggy made millions of dollars and spent most of it. Mac and Rory love to tell the story of the night Steve’s house caught fire on Mount Washington, and how he tried to salvage his prized possessions.&nbsp;It’s a great story but not as funny as the ones Mac tells in his book, the same ones he and Rory told during a three-hour interview at Hooples on Tuesday. My favorite is the lawn ball theft.</p>
<p>The thief was small but easy to spot —&nbsp;he wore a fishing hat and a tuxedo —&nbsp;and Mac couldn’t miss the shiny trinket he tried to hide under his coat.&nbsp;When the bouncer stopped him, the drunk said he wasn’t stealing it; he had paid a bartender $50, a substantial markup on a lawn ornament that probably cost less than $20. But Froggy’s manager was insistent: Get the lawn ball back.</p>
<p>Mac and Rory cornered the thief, who defended himself with the only item at hand.</p>
<p>‘“Everybody get back!’ he yelled. ‘I got a lawn ball!’ He was brandishing it like it was a hatchet,” Rory says.</p>
<p>When they disarmed him, the thief began taunting them: “Look at the two big bouncers, beating up a midget for a lawn ball!” The crowd began to jeer.</p>
<p>“I felt guilt, shame and embarrassment at my actions,” Mac says.</p>
<p>But they saved the lawn ball.</p>
<p>My Froggy’s story isn’t nearly as good. In the early 1990s, when I was working for The Pittsburgh Press, I sometimes joined my colleagues for happy hour on the rooftop deck. One evening, we climbed the stairs as usual and found no one else there but the bartender. I ordered at the bar, reached for my wallet to buy the first round and the most amazing thing happened: No charge. We clinked our beer bottles and toasted our good fortune. Then other people started to filter in.</p>
<p>You’ve probably figured out by now that we had landed in the middle of a private party —&nbsp;PNC or Mellon Bank, we guessed. The bankers spent the next half-hour trying to figure out what department we worked in. We left a big tip and headed home in good spirits.</p>
<p>Years later, I learned that the young executive trainee from The Press’ parent company, Scripps Howard, who joined us that day felt so guilty that he returned and paid for our drinks. Today he runs a newspaper and I, well, I work at one that pays me enough to buy craft beer.</p>
<p>I don’t want to see Froggy’s torn down. Not because it’s historic or architecturally significant, but because of all the stories. “This Is Us” set a TV episode at Froggy’s because it’s an unforgettable part of Pittsburgh’s cultural identity. Did Rory and Mac agree with me?</p>
<p>“I’d like to see it preserved,” says Rory, 64, who lives in South Heights, Beaver County, and runs Sewickley Hauling.</p>
<p>But his fellow bouncer threw me.</p>
<p>“My memories aren’t in the building,” says Mac, the former history teacher. “Take the sandstone piece with the name, give it to me and tear down the rest.”</p>
<p>The Troianis, the building’s owners, have a long history in hospitality that predates Papa J’s. They have a right to build an office building in this historic district, he says, adding,&nbsp;“You don’t buy a building to build a Froggy’s museum.”</p>
<p>But where will we tell our stories?</p>
