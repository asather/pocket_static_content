<h1>Steelers will face Cowboys in 2020 Hall of Fame game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers fans will be headed to Canton, Ohio, in droves this summer for the Hall of Fame enshrinement ceremonies for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/01/Troy-Polamalu-joins-Steelers-greats-Pro-Football-Hall-of-Fame/stories/202002010049" target="_blank">Troy Polamalu</a>, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/15/donnie-shell-hall-of-fame-centennial-class-2020-steelers/stories/202001150114" target="_blank">Donnie Shell and Bill Cowher</a>. Now they can stop off and watch some football while they’re at it.</p>
<p>The Steelers will play the first game of the NFL season on Aug. 6 when they take on the Dallas Cowboys in the Hall of Fame game at Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium. It’s their seventh appearance in the Hall of Fame game and their second in the past five years.</p>
<p>The Steelers last played in the Hall of Fame game in 2015 when they lost to the Minnesota Vikings, 17-3. They also played in the game in 2007, 1998, 1983, 1964 and 1963.</p>
<p>The Steelers and Cowboys have a longstanding rivalry dating to the 1970s when the Steelers beat the Cowboys in Super Bowls X and XIII. It will be the first game for first-year Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy, a Greenfield native and former Packers coach who beat the Steelers in Super Bowl XLV.</p>
<p>The Steelers also are set to play the Cowboys during the regular season in Dallas. The NFL will release its full regular-season schedule next month.</p>
<p>The Steelers and Cowboys are 3-3 in Hall of Fame games.</p>
<p>The collective bargaining agreement allows teams to report to training camp 15 days before the first preseason game, so July 22 is the earliest the Steelers can begin camp at Saint Vincent College.</p>
