<h1>Paul Zeise: The Pirates' building process is going to take longer than anticipated</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A few weeks ago I laid out the fact that former GM Neal Huntington <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/paul-zeise/2020/07/28/Neal-Huntington-Ben-Cherington-David-Littlefield-pittsburgh-pirates/stories/202007280130" target="_blank">did not leave the Pirates organization</a> better than he found it. I highlighted how barren the organization is and how few prospects and trade pieces there are.</p>
<p>Amazingly, some wanted to argue with this point. I was puzzled by that then and am even more puzzled by it now that we have watched the Pirates let the trade deadline come and go without any major moves.</p>
<p>Yes, I know the company line from Ben Cherington and Co. will be something about how they just couldn’t find the right deals and they value their players. But if Cherington could have found takers for any of his players at reasonable prices, I think he would have certainly dealt them.</p>
<p>The problem the Pirates have is that they don’t have many good players. The few players that <em>might</em> be classified as good are not playing very well. And some of the players they signed with the hope of perhaps flipping into some small return — like Derek Holland —&nbsp;made it impossible to trade by their performance.</p>
<p>The process of rebuilding this organization and team is going to be a lot longer than even the most pessimistic projections have suggested.&nbsp;With no real legitimate major league capital to deal, very little in the way of promising prospects and a thin draft this year, the Pirates just don’t have an easy path back to true playoff contention.</p>
<p>I hate to bring it up again, but it needs to be stated: Huntington had Andrew McCutchen, Neil Walker, Tony Watson, Starling Marte and Jared Hughes handed to him from the previous regime. They also had trade pieces such as Jason Bay, Nate McClouth and Jose Bautista.</p>
<p>Cherington didn’t have any of that to work with, and the rest of the league knows it. Maybe there is some value in Bryan Reynolds and Josh Bell, but I can’t imagine there were many teams willing to fork over much of anything for either. Chad Kuhl has a great arm, but I’m not sure that his body of work merits much of anything at this point, especially given his arm history.</p>
<p>I keep hearing people use the Astros and Brewers as teams the Pirates can model themselves after, but I don’t think that is accurate. Those two organizations stripped down and traded some key players to acquire young talent that grew into some of their key players once they got good.&nbsp;I just don’t see that with the Pirates.</p>
<p>Cherington earlier this year said he didn’t believe this was a rebuild situation as much as it was a build situation. He said he didn’t feel like he was tearing anything down; he was just going to build from the ground up.</p>
<p>I don’t know that I agreed with him then because I thought there was some young talent to build around. I’m now starting to see that he wasn’t lying back then. He has an enormous job ahead of him, and it isn’t going to be easy.</p>
<p>I believe Cherington is an excellent baseball man and combined with team president Travis Williams, the Pirates are in great hands. But they are&nbsp;going to have to be really good at their job in order to make this happen for the Pirates.</p>
<p>It’s not all hopeless, but it seems&nbsp;pretty clear to me that the Pirates’ building process is going to take years. Patience is a virtue, and it’s also going to have the be Pirates fans’ best friend.</p>
