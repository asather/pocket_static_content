<h1> Jailed Saudi Princess posts online plea for freedom </h1>

<p>BEIRUT — For years, she was a rare princess from Saudi Arabia who spoke her mind to the world, criticizing the kingdom’s treatment of women, calling its religious teachings “extremely dangerous” and voicing support for a constitutional monarchy.</p>
<p>And she got away with it — until she disappeared in March 2019.</p>
<p>This week, the princess, Basmah bint Saud, a daughter of Saudi Arabia’s second king, confirmed what had been suspected: A statement on Twitter said she was being held in a prison in the kingdom without charge, and that she was in urgent need of medical care.</p>
<p>“I was abducted without explanation together with one of my daughters and thrown into prison,” she wrote. She begged Saudi Arabia’s king and the crown prince “to release me as I have done no wrong.”</p>
<p>By Friday, that plea had been deleted.</p>
<p>The reason for her arrest was not clear, but it appeared to fit a pattern of Saudi Arabia’s government punishing prominent citizens who had publicly deviated from the government’s line.</p>
<p>Her detention was one of two new cases of Saudi royals locked up during the rise of the kingdom’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</p>
<p>Last month, Prince Faisal bin Abdullah, also a child of a Saudi king, was detained, leaving his family with no idea why he was taken or where he is being held, according to three associates of his family.</p>
<p>Since his father, King Salman, took the throne in 2015, Crown Prince Mohammed has repeatedly jailed members of the royal family while consolidating his position.</p>
<p>He has also gone after prominent critics. Activists were imprisoned after campaigning for women to have the right to drive, and the dissident Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi was killed by Saudi agents in Istanbul in 2018 after publishing columns critical of the crown prince in The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Officials at the Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment.</p>
<p>At least 11 princes were locked in the Riyadh Ritz-Carlton in 2017 and accused of corruption. At least one, Turki bin Abdullah, is still detained. The former crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef, a cousin whom Crown Prince Mohammed elbowed aside to seize power, was placed under house arrest before being detained last month, along with one of Crown Prince Mohammed’s uncles.</p>
<p>Many of these princes had held powerful positions as the heads of security bodies or as provincial governors, leading analysts to conclude that the crown prince had detained them to neutralize potential threats to his standing.</p>
<p>But Princess Basmah and Prince Faisal, the two newest cases, had never held significant power or influence. And two associates of Princess Basmah said she was being held with her daughter in Al Ha’ir Prison, a well-known lockup for criminals and jihadis near the capital, Riyadh, a move that appeared to have no precedent, said Ms. al-Rasheed, the Saudi scholar.</p>
<p>“Historically, they just put them in their villas and didn’t let them out,” she said of previous detentions of female royals. “To put her in Al Ha’ir Prison is really extreme.”</p>
<p>Princess Basmah, 57, is the youngest daughter of King Saud, Saudi Arabia’s second king.</p>
