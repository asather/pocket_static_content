<h1>Girl Scouts release new lemon cookie for 2020 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Attention, cookie lovers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Girl Scout Cookies season kicks off on Friday, and brings with it a brand-new treat for the citrus&nbsp;aficionados.</p>
<p>Called Lemon-Ups, it’s a crispy lemon-flavored cookie with a light glaze on the bottom for added sweetness. It replaces Savannah Smiles, a powdered sugar-dusted lemon wedge introduced in 2012 to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Girl Scouting. (The name was inspired by the Georgia home of Girl Scout founder, Juliette Gordon Low.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Meant to empower as well as satisfy a girl (or boy’s) sweet tooth, they come imprinted with eight inspirational “girl power” messages such as “I am Strong” and&nbsp;“I am a&nbsp; Go-Getter,” highlighting what it means to be a Girl Scout.</p>
<p>What makes Lemon-Ups even more special is that they’re available only in select council markets, including Western Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the Lemon-Ups, other cookies on this year’s roster are the ever-popular Thin Mints, Trefoils, Do-Si-Dos, Samoas, Tagalongs, Girl Scout S’mores and the gluten-free Toffee-Tastic, introduced in 2014. All will feature new packaging displaying images of real Girl Scouts taking part in the many activities available to members.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The cookies are $5 per box and 100 percent of the proceeds stay local. Last year alone, according to public relations and marketing manager Stefanie Marshall, almost $2.1 million went into Girl Scout troop coffers throughout Western Pennsylvania to fund activities and adventures for nearly 20,000 girls.</p>
<p>Girl Scout cookies can only be purchased from registered Girl Scouts, but the 108-year-old organization makes it easy. Visit <a href="http://www.girlscoutcookie.org" target="_blank">www.girlscoutcookie.org</a>&nbsp;to find a local group, or use the official Girl Scout Cookie Finder app, free on IOS and Android devices. Scouts also will sell them at cookie booths across the region beginning Feb. 28.</p>
