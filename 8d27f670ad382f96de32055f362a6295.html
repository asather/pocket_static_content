<h1>Allegheny County’s preliminary primary-vote count shows 42% turnout</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than 4 out of 10 registered Democrats and Republicans in Allegheny County turned out to vote in the 2020 primary election, preliminary results revealed.</p>
<p>The county elections division finished counting the remaining provisional ballots on Wednesday, arriving at a final tally of 101,546 in-person ballots, 218,146 by mail and 5,806 provisional — a final turnout of about 42%.</p>
<p>The elections board will meet Monday at 10 a.m. to certify the results.</p>
<p>The final count follows several days of work by the county’s return board, brought together June 5 and staffed by election division personnel to scan the remaining absentees, mail-ins and in-person ballots that weren’t scanned at the warehouse following the election — including those that were damaged.</p>
<p>The board also counted overseas and military ballots, and those that arrived in the mail under&nbsp;Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s mail-ballot deadline extension.</p>
<p>Under Mr. Wolf’s executive order, ballots postmarked by June 2 and received by 5 p.m. June 9 were to be counted in Allegheny County. More than 6,800 ballots that complied with the order were tallied, according to the county. At least 1,700 were denied, having been postmarked after June 2.</p>
<p>On final count, two state legislative candidates received enough write-in votes to win their respective nominations.</p>
<p>Republican Linda Book, pursuing the nomination in the 38th legislative district to face Democratic nominee Nick Pisciottano, garnered 414 write-in votes. A first-time candidate for a state post, Ms. Book is an Army veteran and five-term Whitehall councilwoman. The winner will succeed outgoing Rep. Bill Kortz, who will retire at the end of the current legislative session.</p>
<p>Also winning a spot on the November ballot was Republican Kurt Korinko in the 42nd legislative district. Mr. Korinko, who — according to his LinkedIn page — is a customer development manager with H+H System Inc., will face Democratic incumbent Dan Miller, who has been in office since winning a special election in 2013.&nbsp;</p>
