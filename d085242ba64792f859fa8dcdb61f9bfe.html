<h1>Pirates reliever Edgar Santana suspended for 80 games</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If/when the 2020 baseball season starts, the Pirates won’t have reliever Edgar Santana, who has been suspended by Major League Baseball for 80 games without pay after testing positive for Boldenone, a performance-enhancing substance.</p>
<p>Santana, 28, missed all of 2019 while recovering from Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>He was one of their best and most reliable relievers in 2018, pitching to a 3.26 ERA in 69 games, with 54 strikeouts and 66 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>“The Pirates are disappointed to learn of today’s news that Edgar Santana has received an 80-game suspension as a result of a violation of Major League Baseball’s Joint Drug Prevention and Treatment Program,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said in a statement. “Because of the confidentiality requirements of [the program], we will not have further comment on this matter.”</p>
