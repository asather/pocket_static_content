<h1>Gene Therapy: The Hunker Games: What does "hunker" even mean?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As usual, it’s probably just me, but among the expanding spectrum of things I’m growing weary of as we continue to hunker down against the virus is the ubiquitous use of “hunker down,” mostly because “hunker” is a stupid, inelegant, vapid word of dubious origin.</p>
<p>Yeah, I said it.</p>
<p>But it was only in this, the fourth week of The Hunker Games hereabouts, that I decided to do a little research that would confirm my suspicions.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Hunker is a verb primarily, although few of its definitions from the standard sources seem to capture whatever the hell this is we’ve been doing since the middle of March.</p>
<p>In the Oxford English Dictionary, hunker is “To squat, with the haunches, knees, and ankles acutely bent, so as to bring the hams near the heels and throw the whole weight upon the fore part of the feet.”</p>
<p>In other words, to assume the position of the catcher in baseball, something I’ve not done officially (meaning in full equipment) since 1969. I’m sure I could still get down there, but it would take a minimum of two people to get me back up. As there is currently only one other person at my particular hunkerfest, there shall be none of that.</p>
<p>Dictionary.com offers a slang definition of hunker contending it means “to lumber along; walk or move slowly or aimlessly.” OK, but I do that virus or no virus, at least when I’m not falling down.</p>
<p>The same source provides hunker this shade of meaning as well: “To hold resolutely or stubbornly to a policy, opinion, etc., when confronted by criticism, opposition or unfavorable circumstances.”</p>
<p>Again, as ever.</p>
<p>There is a definition of hunker that says it means “to hide, hide out or take shelter.”</p>
<p>I guess that comes closest to our current predicament, but the presumed original usage from the Scotch apparently held that “hunker” could be a noun as well. This noun, according to the online etymologists at etymonline.com (so clever) identified a “conservative fogey,” from mid-19th century American English, especially and originally “one of the conservative Democrats of New York of the 1840s (opposed to the Barnburners). Supposedly from New York dialect <em>hunk</em> ‘post, station, home,’ hence ‘those who stay safe on base’ (see hunky-dory), but it also has been said to be from a local word for a curmudgeon, and <em>hunks</em> is recorded from c. 1600 as a name for a surly, crusty old person or miser.”</p>
<p>This latter definition proved moderately useful this week as a raft of notable surly/crusties signaled their growing fatigue with the whole notion of “hunkering down,” not just for themselves but for all the hunkering being done to slow the spread of a deadly disease.</p>
<p>Attorney General and leading Trump toady William Barr went on state TV, aka Fox News, to illustrate his discomfort with the advice of leading medical professionals.</p>
<p>The restrictions imposed by the nation’s leading immunologists and epidemiologists Mr. Barr called “draconian measures” and said that at the end of the month he thinks we should “allow people to adapt more than we have and not just tell people to go home and hide under their bed."</p>
<p>I don’t think I can hunker under the bed, Bill.</p>
<p>Perhaps the AG is oversimplifying, much in the way that, well, how did Robert Mueller put it? He “did not fully capture the context, nature, and substance,” of this situation.</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, the head hunkerer in charge of getting the stimulus package into your pocket but so far a hunkerer closer to the lumbering along slowly or aimlessly definition, got asked by CNBC’s Jim Cramer if he thought the country could be “open for business” in the month of May. He said, “I do.”</p>
<p>And then he said, “I think as soon as the president feels comfortable with the medical issues, we are making everything necessary that American companies and American workers can be open for business and that they have the liquidity to operate their business in the interim.”</p>
<p>Would it be impertinent to point out that the president felt comfortable enough with the medical issues almost four weeks ago that he suggested Easter for a grand opening? Easter as in tomorrow?</p>
<p>But the president looks like a tower of responsible leadership next to riotously reluctant hunkerer Tony Spell, the Louisiana pastor who’s been sending buses to drive his flock away from their hunkering and toward the collection plate. That must be why he insists that worship can’t work on Zoom.</p>
<p>“The Bible teaches us to be absent from our bodies is to be present with the Lord,” Pastor Spell told an interviewer this week. “So like any revolutionary, like any zealot, like any pure religious person, death looks to them like a welcome friend. True Christians do not mind dying. They fear living in fear.”</p>
<p>Thus the pastor fears not the six misdemeanor counts that could put him behind bars for three years for violating the Louisiana governor’s life-saving stay-at-home order. Three years. Now that’s some serious hunkerin’.</p>
<p>Look, we’re all eager to get out and about and back about our business but not if it means being stupid or worse. Much, much worse. We’ll get out. Our time will come. The day will come when we can go back to using “hunker down” almost exclusively for the nutballs who refuse to leave any of several beach front communities where the hurricane is expected to make landfall.</p>
<p>Tired of hunkering down?</p>
<p>Try hunkering up for a while.</p>
