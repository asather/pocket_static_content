<h1>Three shot in Manchester in stable condition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three people were hospitalized Saturday evening after a shooting in Pittsburgh’s Manchester neighborhood.</p>
<p>The shooting occurred in the 1500 block of Sedgwick Street around 7:10 p.m. A woman and juvenile girl were transported to hospitals in stable condition, and a man walked into Allegheny General Hospital in stable condition.</p>
<p>The woman had a gunshot wound in the arm, while the man and girl were both grazed in the head, according to police spokesman Maurice Matthews.&nbsp;Police received a ShotSpotter alert indicating 20 rounds were fired in the area.</p>
<p>There was no information available on a suspect. All of the victims were at a party in a backyard, but officials were unsure what the party was for. Dozens of officers responded to the scene.</p>
<p>Caleb Webb, who lives down the street, said he and his mother were sitting on his porch when he heard the gunfire.</p>
<p>“I’m surprised it happened right here,” he said, especially “in broad daylight. This is just random.”</p>
<p>The back of a nearby home was struck with a few rounds, and some cars along Liverpool Street were also hit with gunfire.</p>
