<h1>Pa. Turnpike will reopen all food service plazas, bathrooms on a limited basis Friday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike will reopen all 17 of its service plazas on a limited basis at 7 a.m. Friday, the agency announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Restrooms at the facilities will be open 24 hours a day but there will be limited options and hours for food service at most sites. The North Midway and Valley Forge plazas will have food 24 hours a day but the other sites only will have food from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m. after Friday, when food won’t be available until 8 a.m.</p>
<p>The turnpike had closed bathrooms and restaurants at all of its plazas on Tuesday to limit social contact among motorists and service workers, but convenience stores and fuel service continued. The agency placed portable toilets and two hand-washing stations at each plaza, and those will stay in place.</p>

<p>Turnpike spokeswoman Rosanne Placey said the closure was necessary while restaurant operators HMS Host and 7-Eleven devised a system to staff the facilities with limited employees and maintain sanitary conditions. Trucking organizations and elected officials had objected to decisions by the turnpike and Pennsylvania Department of Transportation to close facilities that truckers need, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/03/18/PennDOT-rest-stops-COVID-19-coronavirus-truckers-Owner-Operator-Independent-Drivers-Association/stories/202003180130" target="_blank">PennDOT relented Wednesday and opened some of its rest stops</a>.</p>
<p>“We realize how vital [truckers’] service is so we’re happy we can reopen even on a limited basis,” Ms. Placey said.&nbsp;“Even with this change, the food service will be open on a limited basis. We can’t have a lot of people there and they can’t eat inside.”</p>
