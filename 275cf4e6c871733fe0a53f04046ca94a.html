<h1>Jason Mackey: Baseball in 2020 offers reminder to appreciate what we have</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nick Pelescak held a baseball glove over his eyes Monday afternoon, squinting and trying to shield the summer sun, a Pirates mask protecting his nose and mouth. Standing on the North Shore riverwalk, the Carnegie native did his best to peer into PNC Park, waiting for a batting practice home run to bounce on the cement, over the hill and into his mitt.</p>
<p>A season ticket holder since 2006, Pelescak would normally be inside, arriving the moment doors opened for batting practice, leather on his left hand, prepared for anything that might come his way. But thanks to the coronavirus pandemic that has Major League Baseball teams across the country playing to empty stadiums, Pelescak knew this would have to do.</p>
<p>“This is all we have,” Pelescak said. “It’s a fun challenge out here, but I miss being inside that place.”</p>
<p>Pelescak is one of several Pittsburghers I encountered during a few laps around the ballpark prior to the Pirates’ home opener Monday night — a game that was delayed by rain.</p>
<p>The original idea was to write about the weirdness of watching a baseball game with no fans, the artificial crowd noise humming, the music cranked and the entire thing feeling like a movie set.</p>
<p>But ask anyone crazy enough to obsess over this sport: Our relationship with baseball is about so much more than hearing the umpire’s strike calls or the pop of a glove reverberating off empty banks of seats.</p>
<p>It’s about more than exercise equipment that now occupies the main concourse at PNC Park — your previous mid-game meetup spot converted into a workout area for the visiting team.</p>
<p>All of it is strange, sure, but the routines and rhythms that make baseball so special aren’t confined to the building that houses it. The stuff on the outside matters, too.</p>
<p>Take Jamie Svitek and Jen Dayton, longtime friends and South Side residents. Every year they have a “treegate” party for the home opener. Along with a few dozen friends, they meet at the tree outside First National Bank on Federal Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Iron City, Jagermeister, water and ice fill their coolers, which featured the logo “PGH vs. All Yinz.”</p>
<p>Being unable to gain entrance into PNC Park seemed to matter little to this particular group.</p>
<p>“I’m not letting the coronavirus ruin my fun,” Svitek said.</p>
<p>The same for Bill Battistone, who biked to the Roberto Clemente Bridge from his home in Troy Hill. Originally from Chicago, Battistone has adopted the Pirates, and he usually attends between 20-25 home games a year.</p>
<p>Minutes before first pitch, Battistone sat on the bridge, a Bluetooth speaker cranking the radio broadcast and a smile plastered across his face.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely Battistone will get any closer to the action this summer, although that’s why he’s here with&nbsp;Pirates play-by-play man Greg Brown’s voice in the background. Battistone is doing his best to soak in a summer tradition.</p>
<p>“I’ve definitely missed baseball,” Battistone said. “It’s nice to have something to look forward to every day.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Battistone worries about the 2020 season after Monday’s news of a COVID-19 outbreak within the Florida Marlins organization.</p>
<p>“It’s sort of a reality check to enjoy it while you can,” he said.</p>
<p>Monday marked my seventh game in an empty stadium. It does not feel normal. Entering the ballpark includes temperature checks and symptom screenings. Access is limited, we’re all wearing masks, and the off-record interactions that make baseball unique are on hold.</p>
<p>But the new normal has allowed me to appreciate the audible joy of baseball: the perfect thwack of a wood bat squaring up a baseball, the stillness of a quiet summer night, the sound of instructions being shouted or players screaming in frustration when something goes awry.</p>
<p>The Pirates have done their part to help. On Monday, they played prerecorded well-wishes from players’ families during batting practice. Pictures of fans remain plastered on the wall next to the home clubhouse. They’re also pushing a second-screen experience through their team website.</p>
<p>But Pete Schell, 58, of Brighton Heights, still sees no possible way anyone will get closer than that.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how you can do it,” said Schell, who was shagging flies next to Pelescak. “We’re not going to church. I don’t know if we’re going to be opening schools. I just don’t see how you can do it safely.”</p>
<p>Kevin Meadows doesn’t care, as the East Liberty native maintained his tradition for the past 30 years: selling snacks, water and other goodies on the Clemente Bridge. Business lagged Monday, Meadows said, but he did feel like a hint of normal had returned.</p>
<p>“You hear that?” Meadows said as public-address announcer Tim DeBacco began talking. “You can hear the stadium. That’s always a good feeling.”</p>
<p>Further down the bridge, Juliette Saunders held some flowers as she gazed into PNC Park, trying to catch a glimpse of her mother, Babette, as she prepared to sing the national anthem.</p>
<p>Babette Saunders has been an emergency room clerk at Jefferson Hospital for the past 18 years, and this offseason she won a contest to sing on opening day. It was a dream come true … until the Saunders family could only bring one guest. (Juliette’s sister Josette went.)</p>
<p>“She still wants us to be here,” Juliette said. “We can get pictures after. We’ll still see her singing it. We just won’t be on the field.”</p>
<p>What Saunders said struck a chord with me. It’s the same reason I’ve enjoyed covering baseball games with nobody there, even if the energy or the feel is hardly the same.</p>
<p>It’s what we have right now. There’s no sense crying about it, which was the mentally adopted by Chris Miller of Brackenridge and Rob North of Shadyside.</p>
<p>You might know these two as members of the Renegades of the Rotunda, the guys in full-fledged Pirates regalia, and they were very much here for opening day.</p>
<p>In fact, Miller showed up for the original one back in April. With the season shut down and Miller enjoying a day off from work, he sat by the Roberto Clemente statue and listened to the 2013 NL wild card game on the radio.</p>
<p>Monday was different. As fans further down Federal Street set up lawn chairs around the Willie Stargell statue, Miller and North hung by the banks of the Allegheny. And while it would be the first opening day Miller did not spend inside PNC Park, he was hardly willing to stay home.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t going to miss this one,” Miller said. “This is as close as I’m going to get, but I’ll take what I can get.”</p>
<p>Added North: “Just because we can’t go inside doesn’t mean we’re going to miss opening day.”</p>
<p>And even though baseball might not be normal, it’s still very much needed right now. For all of us, no matter how it looks or sounds.</p>
