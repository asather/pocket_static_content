<h1>‘Parasite’ is a surprise best picture winner at Academy Awards</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As hashtags go, it could have been #OscarsAsExpected. But the South Korean film “Parasite” and its writer-director, Bong Joon Ho, wrote their own surprising script.</p>
<p>The sly-yet-shocking examination of class struggles between two families — haves and have-nots — defied predictions and won best picture at the 92nd Academy Awards on Sunday night.</p>
<p>“Parasite” generated one of the biggest responses from the audience when it was announced as the first winner of the re-named best international feature. Mr. Bong also won for best director and best original screenplay, with co-writer Han Jin-won.</p>

<p>“The most personal is the most creative,” Mr. Bong said via a translator. He then said he was a lifelong admirer of fellow nominee Martin Scorsese (“The Irishman”), which itself earned another standing ovation.</p>
<p>It is the first best picture winner whose language is not English.</p>
<p>But there were some categories that stayed the course.</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, Renee Zellweger (“Judy”) and Joaquin Phoenix (“Joker”) took best actress and actor, with Laura Dern (“Marriage Story”) and Brad Pitt (“Once Upon a Time … in Hollywood”) winning the supporting awards.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Phoenix and Ms. Zellweger spoke of our “commonality” and what unites humanity despite our challenges. “I believe we have become very disconnected from the natural world,” said Mr. Phoenix, a champion for animal rights who said he is an opponent of “isms” such as racism.</p>
<p>Ms. Zellweger, whose parents came from Europe, won previously as supporting actress in “Cold Mountain.” She thanked the usual colleagues and collaborators, including “my immigrant folks, who came here with nothin’ but each other and the American dream. How about this!” She also thanked a long list of people she admired, including Fred Rogers, first responders —&nbsp;“our heroes.” She said that although Judy Garland, the screen icon Ms. Zellweger portrays in the film, never won an adult Oscar, she considered this award “certainly for you.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt took home the supporting actor award, ahead of Tom Hanks, who portrayed Mr. Rogers in the Pittsburgh-filmed “A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood.”</p>
<p>The festivities were held at the Dolby Theatre at the Hollywood &amp; Highland Center, where the “Joker” entered the Oscars ceremony with 11 nominations. It was followed by “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood,” “The Irishman” and “1917” with 10 each. “Jojo Rabbit,” “Little Women” and “Parasite” each had six. All were best picture contenders, and “Parasite” took home the most, with four.</p>
<p>It took more than halfway into the ABC broadcast for “1917” to win its first Oscar, for sound mixing. It was quickly followed by Roger Deakins’ win for cinematography. The film, which artfully weaves a long series of point-of-view scenes, also won for visual effects.</p>
<p>It was a first Oscar for Ms. Dern, who grew up in Hollywood with actor parents. She honored them in her speech: “Some say, ‘Never meet your heroes,’ but I say, ‘if you’re really blessed, you get them as your parents.’</p>
<p>“I share this with my acting heroes, my legends, Diane Ladd and Bruce Dern… this is the best birthday present ever.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pitt plays a stuntman, driver and confidante in the Quentin Tarantino epic “Once Upon a Time… in Hollywood.” After thanking Mr. Tarantino and others, including co-star Leonardo DiCaprio (“Leo, I’ll ride on your coattails any day, man; the view is fantastic”), Mr. Pitt talked about his love of films growing up, when his family took him to the movies.</p>
<p>“Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” he said. “Ain’t it the truth.”</p>
<p>Thelma Schoonmaker, a former film editor for a Bicentennial series at WQED, had been vying for her fourth Oscar with Martin Scorsese’s “The Irishman.” But the award went to Michael McCusker and Andrew Buckland for “Ford V Ferrari.”</p>
<p>“Parasite,” South Korea’s first entry in the Oscars race, made a splash into the American film consciousness this year although Mr. Bong’s 2013 “Snowpiercer” (a studio film that starred Chris Evans and was in English) had made inroads.</p>
<p>There was dismay on several fronts after the nominations were announced last month. Only one of the acting nominees —&nbsp;Cynthia Erivo —&nbsp;was non-Caucasian. Best actress nominee Erivo also lost for best song (“Stand Up” from “Harriet”).</p>
<p>Five years ago, #OscarsSoWhite became a hashtag over similar concerns. And while ersatz hosts such as Chris Rock and Steve Martin awkwardly alluded to this at the start of the show (and others kept at it all evening long), the nominee list was what it was.</p>
<p>None of the women lauded for directing movies such as Greta Gerwig for best picture nominee “Little Women,” as well as Lulu Wang (“The Farewell”), Lorene Scafaria (“Hustlers”) and Marielle Heller (“A Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood”) got Oscars nods. Natalie Portman made a red carpet statement Sunday when she wore a cape embroidered with the names of some of these women.</p>
<p>Two years ago at the Golden Globes, Ms. Portman presented the award for direction noting, “and here are the all-male nominees…”</p>
<p>Besides Mr. Phoenix as best actor, “Joker” scored a second victory, winning best original score for Hildur Gudnadottir.</p>
