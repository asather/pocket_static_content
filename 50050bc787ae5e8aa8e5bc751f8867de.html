<h1>Mayor Peduto declares state of emergency for Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Friday declared a state of emergency in the city of Pittsburgh and issued an executive order, effective Monday, banning gatherings of more than 250 people, to curb the risk of the global pandemic COVID-19.</p>
<p>“I am making this announcement now so our residents can further plan for the impacts of COVID-19 will have on them and their families, most likely for weeks to come,” he said.</p>
<p>The state of emergency, a power granted under state law, allows the city to cancel or limit large gatherings, limit city permits, cancel or limit some city services, and cancel or limit public and private activities that could increase exposure or transmission of disease.</p>
<p>The city is also working with UPMC and Allegheny Health Network to expedite testing capabilities within the city “hopefully as soon as next week,” Mr. Peduto said.</p>
<p>Friday’s&nbsp;announcement came as the state Health Department announced the first presumptive positive case in Western Pennsylvania, a person in Washington County.</p>
<p>The announcement was in part prompted by Gov. Tom Wolf’s order to close all K-12 schools for the next two weeks, though preparations for various scenarios have been ongoing for several weeks, the administration said.</p>
<p>While enforcement on large crowds will not begin until Monday morning, bar and restaurant owners can expect&nbsp;“strict enforcement” this St. Patrick’s Day weekend regarding occupancy,&nbsp;said Public Safety Directory Wendell Hissrich.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We ask that if possible if bar owners or restaurant owners would voluntarily cut down the occupancy and ensure that there’s equal distance or social distancing throughout the establishment,” he said, adding that if limits are exceeded by&nbsp;“even one person,” the establishment will be shut down for the remainder of the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said his executive order to prohibit gatherings of 250 or more will not go into effect until after the weekend because the city needs 60 hours to prepare resources for proper enforcement and wants “to be fair across the board,” with respect to already scheduled events.</p>
<p>Dan Gilman, mayoral chief of staff, said he is unsure if the city has ever enforced such an executive order.</p>
<p>“We’re learning from the rest of world that taking bold action early can not only stem the growth of this virus, but save untold numbers of lives. You may ask why we’re not enforcing this earlier,” he said.&nbsp;“I know that declarations like this can be a shock and they can cause a panic. I want residents of Pittsburgh to be able to plan, especially as many with school-aged children are looking at child care needs going into Monday. Others may have events this weekend. ... We don’t want to have to cancel a wedding or a bar mitzvah or Mass or temple services.”</p>
<p>The ban will affect hotel ballrooms, restaurants, movie theaters or other such locations within city limits. Establishments may have more than one occupancy permit, and the rule will be enforced per each permit, the administration said.</p>
<p>The city said it is working with religious leaders to ensure that emergency powers do not overstep First Amendment rights.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto, however, said that he has been working with Allegheny County officials to close one of the remaining large events in the city: the Home and Garden Show.</p>
<p>“We are working to have the ... lease ended by tomorrow,” he said. Home and Garden Show management on Friday night announced the show was closing immediately. It was originally set to end on Sunday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rivers Casino will close Sunday for at least two weeks to "promote the social distancing recommended by health officials," a release from the casino said.</p>
<p>The closure goes into effect after 11:59 p.m. Saturday night.</p>
<p>Life for those employed by the city will also change beginning Monday, with some workers granted permission to work from home. Reporting city workers with school-age children will have the option to bring children to the office or use an emergency day care that will be established at the City-County Building and 200 Ross St.</p>
<p>The emergency declaration grants a&nbsp;“wide range” of powers to the mayor, from adjusting purchasing and procurement to establishing a strict citywide quarantine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Suspended city services include court cases by the city’s Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections, Public Works, and Mobility and Infrastructure, “except for life-safety circumstances.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the city’s recreation centers will remain open, and the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh has suspended all evictions except for those with “serious public safety implications.” The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy is closing some of its facilities in city parks.</p>
<p>“I was here during the Snowmageddon, and that was the last time we had to declare a state of emergency,” Mr. Peduto said, referring to the 2010 snowstorm. “It’s a far different situation that we’re doing it [for] today than back then.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The emergency declaration is immediately in effect. City Council has the power to ratify and extend the declaration in 7-day increments.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s executive order will remain in effect until amended or rescinded.</p>
