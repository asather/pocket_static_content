<h1>Buying Here: Lake Erie house offers cozy charm and views for $695,000</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you’re feeling isolated and housebound during the pandemic, a house with a lake view may be just what the doctor ordered.</p>
<p>This&nbsp;stately, 3,841-square-foot house at <strong>3862 Montrose Ave.</strong> in Millcreek, Erie County, has six bedrooms, three bathrooms, three powder rooms and sits on 2½ acres overlooking Lake Erie. It’s listed for $695,000 with agent Nancy Placidi of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services (814-882-1303 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/3862-MONTROSE-Avenue-Erie-PA-16505/EriePA/152334" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>).</p>
<p>“It’s really been an&nbsp;amazing 24 years here,” said Dr. Lauren Mozdy, the owner.&nbsp;“It’s nearly 100 years old.”</p>
<p>Built in 1929, the center hall Colonial (MLS No. 152334) retains its original charm and architectural details.</p>
<p>“She has done numerous updates&nbsp;throughout&nbsp;while keeping&nbsp;the&nbsp;original character of the&nbsp;home&nbsp;intact,” said Ms. Placidi.</p>
<p>Dr. Mozdy,&nbsp;an anesthesiologist,&nbsp;noted that she is only the second owner of the property.</p>
<p>“The original owner, Ted Nagle, owned a boiler company and used it as a summer house,” she said. “He must have done very well since he built the home during the Depression.”</p>
<p>The property has a panoramic view of the lake because shrubs and trees have been regularly pruned and kept low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When you are in the house, you get a view of the lake from all the back rooms,” said Dr. Mozdy. “You can’t find that anymore on the lake. Most homes now have a narrow view.”</p>
<p>A path leads to the large beach.</p>
<p>“It’s a very stable property because the slope to the lake is gradual and it is not being eroded,” she said.</p>
<p>Hand-cast plaster molding,&nbsp;wood paneling&nbsp;and tall baseboards are just a few of the indicators of the attention to detail. Dr. Mozdy, who lived here year-round, said she enjoyed spending time in the enclosed back porch. With so many full-length windows, “the views really are just gorgeous,” she said.</p>
<p>There is a curved staircase off the entry and a back staircase used by servants.</p>
<p>“Mr. Nagle had a maid and a butler,” said Dr. Mozdy.</p>
<p>An original&nbsp;stone fireplace dominates the paneled living room, which has built-in shelves and a coffered ceiling.</p>
<p>“The fireplace works perfectly and the way the mason built it was&nbsp;symmetrical,” Dr, Mozdy said.</p>
<p>“The built-ins and the stone fireplace are fabulous,” Ms. Placidi said.&nbsp;“I love the charm of this entire home.”</p>
<p>The dining room features built-in curio cabinets on either side of a large bay window that overlooks the back lawn and lake.</p>
<p>“The previous owner loved the ship room,” Dr. Mozdy said, adding that it’s now used as an office.&nbsp;She kept the original nautical wallpaper.</p>
<p>“There are two narrow — like a ship — entrances to the room and there is a 1920s map of the tri-state area on one wall.”</p>
<p>The house has a long driveway and sits back from the road, giving it a large front lawn and lots of privacy.</p>
<p>“You can’t see the house from the road,” Dr. Mozdy noted.</p>
<p>A garage that blocked part of the lake view was taken down and turned into a brick patio. There is also a smaller patio off the living room.</p>
<p>Annual property taxes are $14,959.</p>
<p>Dr. Mozdy said her twins, a boy and a girl, grew up here. &nbsp;The children have&nbsp;left for college and she has remarried. Though she’s ready to move, she hates to sell her beautiful lake house.</p>
<p>“We are going to move to my husband’s house, but it is breaking my heart,” she said.</p>
