<h1>GOING LIVE: A list of concerts and performances in the virtual world</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While we cope with the social distancing due to the coronavirus, performers near and far are stepping into the virtual realm to entertain us and bring us closer together.</p>
<p>Here’s a selection of performances you can find streaming online. We’re just starting, so this list will be updated regularly:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.stageit.com/zach_schmidt/quarantine_show/70046?fbclid=IwAR0pPvjROQi3RE1npD_koypRQmFDV4cKZtu35baOTWYULOiR_bqIo-4SNiA" target="_blank"><strong>Zach Schmidt</strong></a> (5 p.m.): Baldwin native and Americana singer-songwriter Zach Schmidt, now based in Nashville, will go live with his Quarantine Show tonight with fiance band member Jackie Berkley. He writes: “Since SXSW was canceled and we were not able to attend, we thought a streaming show in our living room seemed like a good idea. We are taking the suggestion to stay socially distanced during COVID-19 very seriously but still want to be able to provide music for people. Pay what you want to get in to the show but there is a tip jar if you are inclined and able… We will play some old songs, some new and some very very new.”&nbsp;</p>
