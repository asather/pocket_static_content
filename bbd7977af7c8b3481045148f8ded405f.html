<h1>Ray Fittipaldo's Steelers chat transcript: 02.11.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Welcome and let's go!</p>
<p><strong>574 Fan</strong>: Thanks again for chatting, Ray. Lots of talk about cutting Barron to save cap space. Does Edmunds have the body tupe/skill set to play Barron’s role? And could Hilton and Sutton expand their roles on defense to play Edmunds’ position? Or is this wishful thinking? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, Edmunds does have the body type sand skill set to someday become a nickel linebacker. Barron, in fact, entered the league as a safety in 2012. Like Edmunds, he was a first-round pick. You mention Hilton and Sutton. They are versatile enough to drop back to safety if the Steelers wanted to do this. Hilton played some safety this year when Edmunds was subbed out in a few games. I'm not discounting this as a possibility, but I don't get the sense they want to do it yet.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Do you know how much the "part time" NFL officials make ? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: According to some quick research (<a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-nfl-refs-paid-super-163028165.html" target="_blank">https://finance.yahoo.com/news/much-nfl-refs-paid-super-163028165.html</a>) referees make $205,000 a year and the other officials make between $4,000 and $10,000 a game.</p>
<p><strong>KissFan48</strong>: Ray, Does the hiring of Matt Canada spell the soon to be end of Randy Fichner? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I don't get that idea. Certainly not in 2020. The Steelers simply thought a QBs coach would be helpful as they try to develop Mason Rudolph and others.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: If the Steelers do take an OT with the first pick is Villanueva a potential cap causality? I don’t think they would keep 5 players that can play tackle even if Feiler moves to G. Could be $5M in cap savings. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, they kept four last season -- Villanueva, Feiler, Chuks and Banner. If Feiler moves to guard full-time they could keep Villanueva, Chuks, Banner and the rookie. And to be honest with you, I don't think they would do that to Villanueva. His play tailed off a bit last season, but he only has one year left on his contract. I think his play can improve simply with Ben Roethlisberger returning. He's a lineman that's at his best in pass pro. Run blocking is not his specialty. And the Steelers figure to pass quite a bit if Ben returns healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Miller </strong>: Hi Ray love reading the chats .what happens if we cant keep Bud and if ben cant go by the start of the season <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, they'll keep Bud if they want to keep Bud. They can franchise him later this month. Once they do that the only way he won't play for them in 2020 is if he sits out the season. And Bud told me in December he was going to sign the tag and play the season if they tagged him. As for Ben, they'll know more later this month when he goes to L.A. and meets with his doctors. If things aren't going in the right direction this summer they'll have to make contingency plans. I still think Rudolph would get a shot to play, but they'd need a more viable alternative than Duck Hodges should things go awry again.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Do you think the 17 regular season schedule will become a reality at some point? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I really don't want to see it, but we all know this is about money. And if the owners throw enough money at the NFLPA during this CBA negotiation they'll sign off on it. I'm not sure why they're not pursuing expanded playoffs as a more viable alternative than 17 regular-season games. I talked to players this summer about that. They're all for it, and the league could make boatloads of money simply by expanding to 14 playoff teams. All they'd have to do is make the No. 2 seed play the 7 seed. The only team that gets a bye is the top seed, which seems fair. Would make the final weekend more exciting in most years.</p>
<p><strong>Robb K</strong>: Will the Steelers make any plays for an OL in Free Agency? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, if BJ Finney leaves in free agency they'll have a hole to fill. He's the top backup at center and guard. The only other guy is JC Hassenauer, who was elevated to the 53-man roster late in the season. He's never played in an NFL game. So either through the draft or free agency they'd have to acquire someone to fill that role. It's a big role to fill, too. The Steelers paid Finney $3 million last year to fill that role.</p>
<p><strong>VAsteelersFan</strong>: Hi Ray . . . you've mentioned the old school, Heath Miller type TE's who hang back and block are not being produced by colleges these days. If so, then what is happening to the these types of players? Becoming linemen? Riding the bench? Or slimming down and practicing as receivers only? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: It all starts with the way the game is being played in high school. I've probably seen 40 high school games the past five years. Most teams operate out of spread offenses. If they have a player with a tight end body the only time they're in-line is short-yardage situations. Many of them are used as fullbacks in the backfield and in the slot as slot receivers in the four-wide sets. So as a result, the colleges aren't getting pro-style tight end types. For the most part, they're bigger slot receivers that are developed as pass catchers first. Blocking is secondary as they come up. It's just the way the game is being played, and it's spilling into all levels. Now there are guys that have body types of pro-style tight ends. Cole Kmet of Notre Dame is 6-5, 250. I watched him play every snap in a few games this week. He has some skills, but you really have to wait sometimes to see him block. He'll have to work at it when he gets to the league. There are others too with similar size and some have the potential(more) <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: to develop into players that can play in-line. But there aren't a ton of them anymore in the college game. (end)</p>
<p><strong>574 Fan</strong>: Let’s say Ben is healthy and has a reasonably good arm in 2020. How many of the needs on O (OL, TE, RB, WR) can be masked By his return? I would argue all of them (short term, I know - but it would free them up some in the draft). <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I agree with you. All of them could be masked in some way by Ben's return. However -- and I write about this at length in a piece I am writing for Sunday -- they have to begin to prepare for life without Ben. He's 38 and coming off elbow surgery. He's not going to play forever. Their line is aging. Four of the five starters are 30 or older. Two are entering the final years of their contracts. It's time to get younger on the line. Of the four positions you mentioned that's the one that has to be addressed the most. I'm not saying it has to be with the second round pick, but they have to get an OL with one of their early picks.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Moore</strong>: If the opportunity presents itself, should the Steelers trade back from the 49th pick? Personally I think the team could use an extra mid round pick to address some depth issues. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: They have five picks right now and will likely get a third-round comp pick so that'd make six. It's not ideal, but I'm not sure I give up No. 49 in a year I don't have a first-round pick just to accumulate more picks later in the draft. In the middle of the second round you should be able to find a future starter. Look at some of the guys they've drafted in the second round over the years -- Marcus Gilbert, Le'Veon Bell, Stephon Tuitt, JuJu Smith-Schuster. Some of those guys have become elite. Why trade that pick away if the opportunity is there to grab a guy like that?</p>
<p><strong>Coop</strong>: Any chance a top tier LB slips in the draft to pair next to Bush or will we be focused on Offense too much? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think they'll focus on offense. Remember, Minkah Fitzpatrick is basically this year's first-round pick. I wouldn't be surprised if three of their first four picks were used on offensive players. As for getting an ILB, I think that might be a bigger issue in 2021 rather than this year. Unless they cut Mark Barron or Vince Williams there isn't a big need to invest a pick in an ILB this year.</p>
<p><strong>Bradley </strong>: do u think duck will be ready next year? Mason slow to process and Duck dich a rookie hard to right him off <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Duck was a nice story, but there is a reason he didn't get drafted.</p>
<p><strong>Guest 6Rings</strong>: Hi, Ray. Vance McDonald was 34th among TE's in receiving yards; his 2020 cap figure would be the 13th highest among TE's. When asked "why don't we cut him" a common response is: who would fill in? My thought is: anyone! Even if BR7 comes back healthu, we can replace his production for millions less and use that $$$ elsewhere. What am I missing? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, Nick Vannett, the backup last season, is an unrestricted free agent and didn't exactly wow when he saw the field. I'm not down on him at all, but he is what he is. He's not going to be your starter. Do you want Zach Gentry as your starter? He only dressed for three or four games because the coaches didn't think he was ready. I'm not saying McDonald is worth the salary they're going to pay him, but you do have to look at the alternatives. And before you bring up Hunter Henry in free agency know the Chargers can tag him and there are no guarantees the Steelers would be able to woo him in free agency. (Plus, he's been injury-prone)</p>
<p><strong>Mark</strong>: Jaylen impressed in college with his diversity and especially his receiving. The past season, with the lack of a standout TE, do you have any ideas why the offence didn't turn more to Jaylen for TE-end type work in the short passing game? Just a function of the inexperienced QB's generally not doing well with the short passing game, or something else? Any such potential increased usage for him in the future that you see? (Thanks for the chats!) <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Jaylen Samuels' decline in playing time and production was a curious development last season, but he's not a guy who can line up and play tight end. He's a RB that can be an H-back or big slot receiver, but not a tight end. But yo your point about his usage I was surprised the Steelers tried so many different running backs and limited Samuels. Maybe they just think he's a third-down back and that's it.</p>
<p><strong>mvandrews7</strong>: Due to the AB and Minkah trades last year I'm not sure what we have left as far as draft picks this year. Can you remind me? Thanks. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Second round, likely third-round comp pick for losing LeVeon Bell, two fourth-round picks (one from Miami), a sixth and a seventh.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: If it is so difficult to find a good blocking TE, why not modify what you do to fit your personnel? Randy doesn't seem to do enough of that. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: They might be forced to do that at some point. When Mark Bruener was a rookie in 1995 the Steelers went to four and five wide sets a lot that season en route to the Super Bowl. Bruener was still developing and was mostly known as a blocker anyway. Perhaps the Steelers will be forced to do something like that again. If they do they better find another receiver or two in the draft. Who else is going to make plays beside 18,19 and 13? It's pretty thin after the top 3.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: Do you think BJ Finney will resign? Doesn’t seem like folks are talking much about him replacing Foster! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I think Finney will go somewhere where he thinks he can be a starter and make starter's money. Not sure that's going to happen with the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Other than Ben, who is your top candidate to be the bounce back Steeler of the year in 2020 like Boswell was this year? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Hmmm, James Conner if he's healthy. JuJu if he's healthy. Vance if he's healthy. They sure have a lot of options after last season. Ha ha.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: I feel Cam Sutton has shown good improvement, do you think the Steelers will resign him? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe but he won't be a priority this year.</p>
<p><strong>TJR</strong>: In Davis a Goner - seems he would be an upgrade at SS? I think FS is where is he struggled. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yeah I think he's gone.</p>
<p><strong>Dick</strong>: Has Ramon Foster become the odd man out? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: He will be come March.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Any idea how many NFL teams have a quarterback coach? How many don't? It seemed illogical that the Steelers would not have one last year with two young quarterbacks on their roster. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Randy Ficthner had been the QBs coach. They're just hiring someone so Randy can concentrate all of his efforts on being the coordinator.</p>
<p><strong>Freddy from the block</strong>: What's the latest info on Ben's recovery? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Doctor's appointment Feb. 21 in L.A. He told Ron Cook he'll start throwing light objects if he gets the green light.</p>
<p><strong>mvandrews7</strong>: Prediction on our starting O-LIne next year: Al, BJ, Pounce, DeCastro, Feiler...with Banner or Chuks next man up? Thoughts? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: C Pouncey RG DeCastro RT Chuks, Banner or a rookie draft pick LG Feiler LT Villanueva.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: any feel for the Steelers possibly grabbing Jonathan Taylor if available in Rd 2? Obviously other skill positions and line are needed as well. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: If he's still on the board I think he'd be in consideration. He's one of the top backs in this draft. For that reason, he might not last until No. 49.</p>
<p><strong>Joe D</strong>: franchise bud? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: The Steelers have been saying he's a top priority.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: It's been written that Ben has influence in keeping his favorites (R Foster, R Switzer) on the team. Do you agree that MT and Colbert need to disregard these preferences? Ben won't be here much longer and the offense needs a serious infusion of youth and speed. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: If that has been the case in the past then yes the Steelers should pick their own roster. Ben is allowed to have preferences. And if it's close the Steelers should consider those preferences. But when guys are clearly finished or not performing then it becomes an obvious move.</p>
<p><strong>schnail</strong>: It seems Miami fans are trying to spin Minkah Fitzpatrick's suggestion that he should move around more as his being a malcontent. I didn't think to take it that way, just that he knows the defense better now. Is there even a kernel of truth in their suggestion, or are they just trying to make themselves feel better? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: None whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Ray, how do you rank AB's apology tour? Seemed like a lot of backhanded compliments and hogwash to me. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I tried to pay as little attention as possible. But kudos to the Fan Morning Show for landing him, even if he was a bit scattered in his responses.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: What is all this nonsense of LB coming back?! He made it VERY clear he didn't want to be here, so I'm not sure how the outside world is trying to sell this as a good idea. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I have no idea where that's coming from. Does anyone think the Steelers would, even if they had the cap sapce, take on his $13 million a year salary? That's just not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Justin H</strong>: Get rid of Pouncey and Foster. Sign Jack Conklin, BJ Finney, and the line is fixed. Feiler at LG, Finney at C, and Conklin at RT or LT. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: They're not getting rid of Pouncey.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Ray, TE has to be in the plans in some way via FA or draft but that position is vital. OL and RB are needs as well. Seems like a tough choice. Maybe they will strike gold in the later rounds. Most pressing need from where you sit? Thank you. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: OL or WR. I think you can get an RB later in the draft or even address the position next year after Conner's contrct expires. Same goes with TE. Now, if a stud RB or TE is there at 49 that they love then they'll take him. I just think the value in this draft will be OL and WR because of the depth of those two positions in this draft.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Hi Ray, do you think we can keep Javon Hargrave ? I for one sure hope so <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I don't think so. He's going to make too much on the open market.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Once the league gets 17 games, they'll start thinking about 18 games. What do you think the cap realistically is on how long the seasons will eventually get? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, they've played 16 games a season since 1978 so in another 42 years maybe they'd go to 18.</p>
<p><strong>Frankenmason</strong>: Duck has a bit of a wonky throwing motion. Is arm strength something that can be improved? I like his leadership and intangibles. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Nah. Can't really improve arm strength all that much.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: I see a lot of cut mark barron is this performance based or money based? performance wise he wasnt GREAT but do you think 1 more yr in the defense will help? and thanks for the chats! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I agree. The only reason I hesitate a bit is Devin Bush will eventually become a three-down linebacker and take some of the reps Barron has been getting. So if that happens in 2020 you're paying a big number to a guy who might be on the field 50 percent of the time. I think they keep him, but I understand the speculation.</p>
<p><strong>FatBuddy</strong>: Ray, I think that we’ll draft a wr with our first pick. This supposed to be a deep year and we have a history of being able to pass on a quality skill podition player. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: You might be right. I'm writing a piece this week about their options in the middle rounds of the draft. Will be published Monday so be sure to check it out.</p>
<p><strong>Robert D</strong>: Do you think Troy finally come back for a home game so the fans can honor him??? Ring of honor? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yes I think that will happen. And it will be quite an ovation when it does happen.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: i hate the idea of flexing MNF. I travel far to get there &amp; that messes up my flights, room reservations &amp; calling out "sick" at work. What say you? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Yeah I don't think it would be fair to out-of-town fans like you. The NFL might not care if the networks throw a bunch of cash at them, but it wouldn't be a nice thing to do to people who buy tickets.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Hi Ray, I hate to admit this but if the Steelers never cut Landry Jones, they would have been in the playoffs the past two seasons. I'm not saying they would've advanced but if they would've had a QB that could complete a five-yard pass without turning it over last year, with that defense, they would've been in. Same with the Raider game the year before. Win that game and they were in. Do you agree? It scares me that they are willing to go into a season with very little experience behind a questionable Ben <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: They cut Landry Jones because Josh Dobbs beat him out. You can argue if they were right, but that was their thought process.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Ray, compared to Kevin Colbert, how much influence does Mike Tomlin have in deciding who the Steelers draft? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Mike and Kevin attend a lot of pro days together. He has quite a bit of input throughout the process.</p>
<p><strong>'Double Divot Dewey</strong>: Hi Ray - thanks for the chats........if the defense can just stay pat (not even improve), I think the return of #7 will improve the OL, TE, WR and RB enough to be competitive with the Ravens in our division again - what say Ray? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: I agree with you although I still think the Ravens would be the preseason favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37 </strong>: Steelers look at Lee ? Too old ? Too costly ? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Probably both.</p>
<p><strong>Max</strong>: Ray can you please help us understand what makes an O-lineman good against the pass but weaker against the run? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Well, for a guy like Villanueva, who is 6-9, it's pretty simple. Leverage is always going to be difficult for him to achieve in the run game. But in pass pro, that long wingspan can be quite effective when he's on top of his game. It's hard to get around someone that big, too.</p>
<p><strong>TXSteeler</strong>: You say theyll fravhise Bud buut also that they shouldn’t cut Barron or Vance. Seems that they cant oossible clear enoygh cap spacce to sign Bud, the restricted FAs, and their draft picks if they dont cut ine of not both. Can you emplain? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Cut Foster and Chickillo and sign heyward to a new deal. That might be enough right there.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Ray, thanks for the chats! I've seen a few mock drafts where TEs aren't being picked until 2nd round. As you have mentioned before, not alot of great talent this year. However, are there any TEs you do like and would be a good pick in 2nd round? Thanks! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe Cole Kmet or Harrison Bryant. And maybe the guy from Missouri. But honestly, I'm not sure I would do it. I've watched all of those guys. I think they can find a better skill player at 49.</p>
<p><strong>Heath Miller Fan</strong>: I understand your suggestion to go with either OL or WR because of depth but can you allow another season to collapse because conner and/or McDonal are hurt AGAIN? Both have to be a priority As well. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Sure, but maybe not in the second round. Maybe you address those a bit later in the draft.</p>
<p><strong>Brian</strong>: Ray, who is the most cooperative interview in your career and the most stand off-ish on the Steelers ? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Cam Heyward has to be at the top of the list. Others like Markice Pouncey and Joe Haden are really good, too. I could name a bunch of the standoffish guys but I won't.</p>
<p><strong>ASIANGOLFERMAN</strong>: when will all the cuts start happening? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: New league year begins March 18 so a week or so before that.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Ray, what type of receiver do you think the Steelers will draft? I'm hoping for a taller one with great hands and can run 4.3-4.4. It feel like they already have too much of the same. Thanks! <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Read my story on Monday. I write all about that.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler_Bee</strong>: Whats your take on these mobile QB/s, is it just a matter of time before they get hurt and find themselves on the shelf. For every Wilson, there are lot more Vince Young and RGIII. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Maybe, but most of them including Lamar Jackson did a nice job of not taking big hits this year. I know that can change anytime, but I think NFL coaches are getting smarter on how to use them. And the players are getting smarter, too. They know when to get down, when to go out of bounds, etc.</p>
<p><strong>sean</strong>: is jericho cotchery really qualified as a WR coach or is he currently holding that position somewhere? Not taking any shots at him I jus dont remember hearing him in that vein until recently <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: He has been an assistant WRs coach in Carolina.</p>
<p><strong>TXSteeler</strong>: Foster and Chik acxoubt for leas than $7mm savibgs. No matter what you did with Heyward thats not enoygh to get Bud, their draft picks, and reayricted FA - let alone alone sign other fillers. Sorry Ray, doesnt add up <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: The Steelers would save $9 million by cutting Foster and Chickillo. Heyward counts $13 million on the cap, but obviously much less with a new deal.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do you see the O-line as good enough or in decline and is there any word on the Pouncey / Decastro injuries? <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Still good, but they have to get younger. <br> <strong>Ray Fittipaldo</strong>: Ok thanks for all the great questions. If I didn't get to any of your questions I'll try to address them Friday when we tape the podcast. Be sure to download and listen.</p>
