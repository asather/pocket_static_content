<h1>Mike Tomlin on Steelers injuries, Al Villanueva and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On the heels of a report from NFL Network that Steelers right tackle Zach Banner will miss the rest of the season with a torn ACL, coach Mike Tomlin would only say that it’s safe to rule out Banner for Week 2 against Denver. But it sounds as if Banner’s injury is indeed severe, given that Tomlin rarely rules out anyone this early in the week.</p>
<p>He’s not ruling out running back James Conner or offensive lineman Stefen Wisniewski. Conner hurt his ankle early in Monday night’s season-opening win at the Giants, while Wisniewski exited in the second half after starting and playing the entire game at right guard in place of David DeCastro.</p>
<p>“Still in the process of getting scans on Wiz and James Conner, but I think their forecast is a more favorable one, so we’ll leave the light on for those two,” Tomlin said during his weekly Tuesday press conference.</p>
<p>Given how bad things looked for Banner in real time, Tomlin went into detail about how the offensive line could take shape in his absence. First up is Chukwuma Okorafor, who battled for the starting right tackle job with Banner throughout camp and took his place Monday at MetLife Stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the Steelers also are signing Jerald Hawkins off Houston’s practice squad, according to the Houston Chronicle. If Hawkins sounds familiar, he was the team’s fourth-round pick in 2016. They traded him after training camp last year to Tampa Bay for a seventh-round pick.</p>
<p>“Like I’ve said repeatedly, I’ve thought both guys were starter-capable and I still feel that way,” Tomlin said of Okorafor replacing Banner. “I’m extremely comfortable with Chuks.”</p>
<p><strong>Villanueva’s demonstration</strong></p>
<p>While 46 Steelers affixed the name&nbsp;“Antwon Rose Jr.” to a decal on the back of their helmets, one honored someone different. Left tackle Alejandro Villanueva, an Army veteran who served in the war in Afghanistan, appeared to tape over Rose’s name and inscribe “Alwyn Cashe” in marker.</p>
<p>Though it may have looked like a last-minute decision, according to Tomlin, Villanueva discussed it with him pregame. And he had his coach’s support.</p>
<p>“It’s in line with everything we’ve said about participating in elements of social justice this offseason,” Tomlin said. “As an organization, and myself as a head coach of an organization, we’re going to support our players in however they choose to participate and express themselves, or to not participate and not express themselves, as long as they do so thoughtfully and with class.”</p>
<p>Rose, 17, was shot and killed in 2018 by an East Pittsburgh police officer who ultimately was found not guilty. Cashe was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his service in Iraq, where he suffered fatal injuries in 2005.</p>
<p>No Steelers took a knee during the national anthem Monday, though Tomlin has said he would support that action. He’s doing the same for Villanueva.</p>
<p>“That’s been a blanket approach we’ve had,” Tomlin said, “so I think it needs no further explanation in terms of our support for Al Villanueva or anyone else in terms of what they do or don’t do in regards to social justice, as long as they adhere to the outline I just outlined for you.”</p>
<p>A request to speak with Villanueva was unreturned by the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>Procedural mea culpa</strong></p>
<p>One new rule for the NFL this year is the ability for teams to expand their gameday rosters by two, meaning two fewer inactive players than past seasons. In 2019, the Steelers could only dress 46 of their 53 players for games. In 2020, they can dress 48, as long as one of the extra two is an offensive lineman to bring the total at that position to eight or more.</p>
<p>But Monday, the Steelers suited up 47, even though the extra man was an offensive lineman in J.C. Hassenauer. They also didn’t call up anyone from the practice squad, which is now allowable and was used by the Giants. Tomlin took the blame for going into the game with one fewer body than permitted and surely won’t give that spot back in future weeks.</p>
<p>“There was some indecision on my part about the rule,” Tomlin said. “We didn’t get clarity on it until extremely late in the process. From an overall preparedness standpoint, we decided to put the helmets on the guys that were prepared to play and had an understanding they knew they were going to play.”</p>
<p>Given Conner’s injury, the Steelers could’ve used rookie fourth-round pick Anthony McFarland to take some carries late, but he was one of the six inactive. Perhaps he’ll make his debut Sunday at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“I take responsibility for that miscommunication. It’s a learning process for us. There’s a lot of memos coming out of New York these days,” Tomlin said with a laugh, referring to the league office, “so it’s tough to keep up with them.”</p>
