<h1>Bad bug: State must continue to fight the spotted lanternfly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An insect that’s only about 1 inch long and half an inch wide is a growing menace.</p>
<p>The spotted lanternfly, an invasive species whose infestations have destroyed trees and vineyards in southeastern Pennsylvania, was recently discovered in Beaver County. The insect already costs the Pennsylvania economy about $50 million and 500 jobs a year, and a Penn State study shows the costs could grow higher if control efforts fail.</p>
<p>State officials should continue a vigorous fight against the bug and devote the resources needed to eradication and control efforts. Fourteen counties are already under quarantine, with strict requirements for moving goods outside the quarantine area.</p>
<p>The Department of Agriculture is requesting $8.6 million in funding from the state and federal government to fight the pest in fiscal year 2020-21. Both governments, as they have in the past, should fully fund the request.</p>
<p>It is expensive to fight the spotted lanternfly, but it would be far more costly to let the insect put people out of work and destroy portions of the state’s agricultural economy.</p>
<p>In Berks County, vineyards have been devastated by the bug in the past few years. The vines are completely killed by the spotted lanternfly, making a comeback difficult for the owners.</p>
<p>The spotted lanternfly also enjoys apples, hops and trees such as walnut, birch and maple. That means the insects are a threat to orchards and the timber industry, where damage is already evident.</p>
<p>The state Agriculture Department plans to expand its efforts against the pest in Western Pennsylvania, said Emily Demsey, communications director. Tactics to fight the bug may be revised based on results of studies currently underway.</p>
<p>Individuals can help, too, by being aware of the insect and contacting the department should they encounter the bug. Outdoor enthusiasts returning from quarantined counties can do their fellow residents a favor by checking their gear, vehicles and clothing for the bugs or their eggs.</p>
<p>People shouldn’t hesitate to kill the bugs or their eggs if found. The spotted lanternfly doesn’t bite. Unfortunately the insects can move quickly, but killing only one female bug can help reduce the population over the course of a year.</p>
<p>The spotted lanternfly is a danger to the economy and jobs. Quarantines already in place should be carefully monitored for compliance.</p>
<p>Controlling this pest is vital to the future of Pennsylvania’s agriculture and timber industries.</p>
