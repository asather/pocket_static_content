<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Is Eric Ebron a worthwhile risk for Steelers?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p>Actually, we begin today with our intergalactically popular Twitter Poll.</p>
<p>Simple request, and people had two hours to vote: Grade the Eric Ebron signing.</p>
<p>Nearly 600 people responded this way ...</p>
<p><strong>A:</strong> 25.9%</p>
<p><strong>B:</strong> 61.5%</p>
<p><strong>C:</strong> 10.9%</p>
<p><strong>Worse:</strong> 1.7%</p>
<p><strong>What we learned:</strong> That people can be smart, although you wouldn’t know it from observing them in other walks of life these days. I would rate this move somewhere between a ‘B’ and ‘C.’</p>
<p>On one hand, you have a tight end coming off double-ankle surgery who drops a ton of balls, doesn’t block, complained about his role in the Colts’ offense and had a major disconnect with the organization regarding his ankle injury (he said it was a season-long issue; they didn’t seem to agree).</p>
<p>On the other hand, you have a 6-foot-4, 245-pound mismatch maker, still just 26, a rare athletic specimen who can inflict maximum damage in the red zone and break a game open (he has at least one catch of 44 yards or more in each of his past five seasons). Just two years ago, Ebron had his one outstanding season — 13 touchdown catches working with Andrew Luck.</p>
<p>Also, the price was right. The Steelers got Ebron at $12 million over two years. You should have seen the reaction in Chicago, where the Bears had just signed a much older Jimmy Graham for more.</p>
<p>This was a worthwhile risk. Does that mean it will work? Not necessarily. I keep seeing visions of Ladarius Green, Donte Moncrief and other recent free agent busts.</p>
<p>Could I also see dynamic double tight end packages of Ebron and Vance McDonald? Sure, so long as both are healthy.</p>
<p>All in all, a worthwhile risk that might satisfy a need.</p>
<p><strong>Peter F., @petefrompitt:</strong> If you could go back in time and change a player’s walk up song to the song that would describe his Pittsburgh career, who’s song would you change, what song would you change it to, and why?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Hello, Peter. That's 'whose' and not 'who's,' but that is also beside the point.</p>
<p>These 12, for obvious reasons …</p>
<p>Lyle Overbay, “Nothing Was Delivered” (The Byrds)</p>
<p>Rod Barajas, “Slow Train Comin’ ” (Bob Dylan)</p>
<p>Neil Walker, “My Hometown” (Bruce Springsteen)</p>
<p>Erik Bedard, “B.M.F. (Blowin’ Money Fast”) (Rick Ross)</p>
<p>Pedro Alvarez, “All or Nothing” (O-Town)</p>
<p>Lonnie Chisenhall, “Invisible” (Alison Moyet)</p>
<p>Adam and Andy LaRoche, “He Ain’t Heavy, He’s My Brother” (Hollies)</p>
<p>David Freese, “Ge Me Out Of Here” (Third Eye Blind)</p>
<p>John Jaso, “California Dreamin’ ” (Beach Boys)</p>
<p>Francisco Cervelli, “I Don’t Wanna Get Hurt” (Donna Summer)</p>
<p>Austin Meadows, “Don’t Go” (Ali Campbell)</p>
<p>Gerrit Cole, “You Think I Ain’t Worth A Dollar" (Queens of the Storm)</p>
<p><strong>Jammy Jam, @davefromdirt:</strong> If you had entrance music what song would it be?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The way I'm feeling these days? “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald” (Gordon Lightfoot). And what’s with all the walkup music questions?</p>
<p><strong>Blake Haskins, @bhaskins16:</strong> Do you think the NFL season will happen this year??? Please god I hope so</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m beginning to wonder, Blake. The Olympics were supposed to start July 24, about the same as NFL training camps, and that isn’t going to happen. The Olympics are a different ballgame, of course, but at this point nothing would surprise me. If you want to track where this all going, Italy is a frightening but realistic example.</p>
<p><strong>Judge, @thesportsjudge:</strong> If you could go back and cover any Pittsburgh sports moment in history that you weren’t here for when it happened what would it be ?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Without question, Game 7 of the 1960 World Series, Judge. I wish I was in that press box with Ron Cook. (Kidding, Ron!)</p>
<p><strong>mgmervosh, @ariba21mgm:</strong> Do you consider Evel Knievel an athlete... Stunt man.. Entertainer.. I vote godfather of X Games... Athlete.. Be safe Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Thank you for the question, Mr. ariba21mgm. Evel Knievel was insane. I know that. An athlete? No. An entertainer? Absolutely. I remember watching one of his jumps at a friend’s house on closed-circuit television. Like a lot of them, it didn’t end well. I also remember coming home from school one day to find an Evel Knievel action figure with my name on it, complete with a motorcycle, courtesy of my Uncle Frank.</p>
<p>Like Evel himself, the action figure never seemed to finish a big jump.</p>
<p>Like a lot of toys I begged for, this one flopped. I’m not even sure it worked once. I would set up pathetic little jumps, like over a twig or something, and the ramp would crack or the cycle would veer sharply off the road. It was horrible.</p>
<p>But I did love Evel Knievel. I even dressed as him for Halloween one year.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Meyer, @CraigMeyerPG:</strong> Starting five of Pitt basketball villains from the program's glory years (2001-2011)? I can only guess who's running the point…</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Good morning (and evening), Craig. Yes, Scottie Reynolds will run the point. I suppose we could do an all-NCAA tournament Pitt Gut-Busters team and include Tony Allen, Dwyane Wade, Patrick O’Bryant, Trevor Huffman and Antonio Gates and call it a day. But that wouldn’t do justice to the real villains, the rivals that made it fun during the long winter months.</p>
<p>Gerry McNamara. Emeka Okafor. Chris Quinn. Luke Harangody. Ben Hansborough. Ben Gordon. Roy Hibbert. Kevin Pittsnogle. And just for the heck of it, we’ll have Buddy Boeheim (who would arrive much later to torture Pitt) be the coach.</p>
<p><strong>Seth, @pfseth:</strong> Batting avg. isn't as valued as it used to be. But, a lineup with high averages is clearly a formidable one. Did money ball just give insight into stats that are cheap, or expose stats that don't help you win games?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Is that a brain tease, Dr. @pfseth? I only know this: “Moneyball” was an entertaining book and an excellent movie, but it probably should have been titled, “Hudson, Zito, Mulder and some other cool stuff that helped the A’s.”</p>
<p>Those three guys (Tim Hudson, Barry Zito, Mark Mulder) went 57-21 when the A’s won 103 games in 2002. The other stuff was interesting and smart and somewhat cutting-edge, but without the three horses at the top of the rotation, it wouldn’t have mattered.</p>
<p><strong>Derek P., @77thMan:</strong> What is one rule change you would do for all major leagues?</p>
<p>MLB — hybrid DH, pull the DH from the batting order when you replace the pitcher with a reliever</p>
<p>NFL— replays at full speed watched by the sky judge</p>
<p>NHL— get rid of fighting</p>
<p>NBA — 4 and 5 point lines</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I like a 4-point line in the NBA. Here’s mine:</p>
<p>MLB — Bring back homeplate collisions. Don’t like ‘em? Swipe tag.</p>
<p>NFL — Each team gets a shot in overtime, no matter what.</p>
<p>NHL — Eliminate the idiotic rule where blood drawn equals an additional minor. Why should sensitive skin help a team win a game?</p>
<p>NBA — Each team automatically reduced to one timeout in final two minutes.</p>
<p><strong>chadgiron, @chadgiron:</strong> Who is/was the best pure in-game X’s &amp; O’s coach of all time (in Pittsburgh)? And best currently? Currently: I go with Andy Toole. All time?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Scotty Bowman was pretty good at that.</p>
<p><strong>4Rodusky, @4Rodusky:</strong> What is the most iconic moment in Pittsburgh sports history for each team (college and pro)? Drafting of Mean Joe for the Steelers? Or the Immaculate Reception? For the Pens is it the drafting of Mario or his saving the club from bankruptcy? Dan Marino or Hugh Green for Pitt?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Interesting question, Mr. @4Rodusky. Let us first get our definitions straight.</p>
<p>“Iconic” is defined as “widely known and acknowledged especially for distinctive excellence.” And “moment” is not a “game” or a “person.” It’s a moment.</p>
<p>So we are looking for iconic moments, which to me means moments that fans everywhere might associate with a given franchise.</p>
<p>The first two are easy:</p>
<p>Steelers — Immaculate Reception.</p>
<p>Pirates — Maz homer.</p>
<p>The next two, not so much.</p>
<p>Penguins — Maybe the moment Mario was drafted? Mario’s first goal? Maybe the moment they won the lottery for Sid? Mario’s goal against the North Stars in the Cup final? (Sorry, Neil Wilkinson.) Fleury’s save on Lidstrom to win the Cup? I’ll let you make the call.</p>
<p>Pitt football — They won the national championship in 1976, but the iconic “moment” might be Marino to Brown in the 1982 Sugar Bowl.</p>
<p>I have a horrible feeling I missed something. Tell me. Tweet me. I’ll change it next week.</p>
<p>But you do understand that a “moment” is not a game or a person, right?</p>
