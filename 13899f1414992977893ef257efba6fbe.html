<h1>Airport using robots, UV light to combat COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh International Airport is shedding light on COVID-19 — ultraviolet light, that is.</p>
<p>Airport officials have teamed with Lawrenceville-based Carnegie Robotics to incorporate ultraviolet light disinfecting technology into two robotic floor-cleaning scrubbers being tested at the terminal.</p>
<p>The system utilizes a UVC fixture to release intense ultraviolet rays onto the floor to sanitize it after the scrubbers have cleaned it.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet light has been used as a disinfectant in hospitals, laboratories, and even in wastewater treatment to kill microbes and other organisms. It works by stopping cells from reproducing.</p>
<p>Last month, Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, had talked about teaming up with local firms to create robots to help disinfect the terminal.</p>
<p>The partnership with Carnegie Robotics is a first step in that direction. The airport eventually hopes to use ultraviolet disinfecting technology to sterilize handrails on escalators and moving walkways, elevator buttons and other high-touch parts of the terminal.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of airport staff and the traveling public are always the top priorities,” Ms. Cassotis said in a statement. “We know that restoring confidence in travel is going to be key to the industry recovery. That’s why we’re partnering with world-leading Pittsburgh technology companies to help develop solutions.”</p>
<p>Delivering the UV technology at the airport is a commercial-grade, fully autonomous, robotic floor-cleaning scrubber developed by Danish firm Nilfisk and Carnegie Robotics.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International is believed to be the first airport to employ the UV technology with the automated system.</p>
<p>The pair of cleaners that are being deployed first use water and chemicals to clean the floors, followed by the UV treatment. As part of the airport testing, researchers will examine the floors after the scrubbers have cleaned them to determine if any microorganisms are still present.</p>
<p>The self-driving cleaners now are being tested in the airport’s landside and airside buildings before being incorporated into daily cleaning routines.</p>
<p>Daniel Beaven, Carnegie Robotics CFO, said the UV technology first was developed to combat infections like C. Diff., MRSA, and other resistant pathogens in medical facilities.</p>
<p>“I can’t overstate the importance of a motivated and competent user-partner to rapidly develop new technology. The airport authority has repeatedly demonstrated leadership in this way and we could not be more pleased to be here,” he said.</p>
<p>The airport is hoping such cutting-edge technology will help to restore confidence in air travel, which has been battered by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, Pittsburgh International has seen the number of travelers drop by as much as 97% on any given day.</p>
