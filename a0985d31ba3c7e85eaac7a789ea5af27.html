<h1>County releases database of restaurants open for takeout and delivery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Treasurer’s Office released on Friday an online database of all restaurants in the county providing takeout, curbside pickup and delivery during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://alleghenycountytreasurer.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Liquor-Roster-Open-Restaurants.pdf" target="_blank">10-page PDF guide is organized by municipality</a> and can be viewed available on&nbsp;the Treasurer’s Office website. It will be updated&nbsp;on a regular basis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“In difficult times the small things can go a long way,” Treasurer John Weinstein said in a release.</p>
<p>“It’s so incredibly important that we all do everything we can to minimize person-to-person interactions and reduce the spread of coronavirus. That kind of disruption to our normal lives isn’t an easy thing, though. Something as simple as a different meal can really help prevent senses of isolation or tedium. At the same time, we can help our neighbors in the food service industry by supporting local business.”</p>
<p>The list was compiled by Treasurer’s Office personnel reaching out to establishments registered with the Special Tax Division, which administers the County’s Alcoholic Beverage Tax.</p>
<p>Businesses not currently listed, or those that would like to update their information, are encouraged to contact the County’s Special Tax Division at 412-350-4196 or webmaster.treasurer@AlleghenyCounty.us.</p>
