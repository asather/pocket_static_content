<h1>National briefs: Avenatti found guilty of extortion </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael Avenatti just did it — He tried to extort Nike, a jury ruled Friday.</p>
<p>The jury found the bulldog lawyer guilty of betraying his client and attempting to shake down the shoe giant.</p>
<p>The verdict virtually assures Mr. Avenatti’s downfall, but he has not yet hit rock bottom. He faces two more trials, in New York and in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>The California lawyer, 48, stared straight ahead and showed no reaction as the verdict was read. He stood at attention as jurors left the courtroom, appearing to steel himself. He faces a maximum of 42 years in prison for two counts of extortion and one count of honest services fraud.</p>
<p>The trial in Manhattan Federal Court revealed that Mr. Avenatti, facing nearly $11 million in debt, tried to take advantage of an elite youth basketball coach’s legal claims against Nike. The coach, Gary Franklin, said Nike execs had ordered him to make secret cash payments to the families of prominent players — a violation of NCAA rules and potentially a federal crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Franklin hired Mr. Avenatti to represent him — and then the lawyer went rogue. Mr. Avenatti is best known for representing adult film star Stormy Daniels in her case against President Donald Trump.</p>
<p><strong>Weinstein ‘an abusive rapist,’ lawyer argues</strong></p>
<p>A prosecutor said Friday that the Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein was “an abusive rapist” and “a predator” who used his power to manipulate and assault several women in the movie business, then stayed in touch with them to ensure their silence and compliance.</p>
<p>“He had a surefire insurance policy: that the witnesses were standing in line to get into his universe,” Joan Illuzzi, an assistant district attorney, told the jury during her closing arguments at Mr. Weinstein’s rape trial.</p>
<p>In her presentation, Ms. Illuzzi returned repeatedly to the difference in power between Mr. Weinstein — “a giant” in the film industry — and his accusers, who were trying to break into the film industry.</p>
<p>“It is a complete dichotomy,” she said. “Here is the defendant with everything using and abusing people who he knows has nothing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Weinstein, 67, has pleaded not guilty to five felony charges in the case — including rape, criminal sexual assault and predatory sexual assault — which carry a maximum penalty of life in prison.</p>
<p><strong>S.C. girl’s death linked to neighbor</strong></p>
<p>The killing of 6-year-old Faye Swetlik, of Cayce, S.C., has been linked with the death of a 30-year-old neighbor whose body was found Thursday in the Churchill Heights neighborhood.</p>
<p>Police found evidence in the man’s trash can that linked him to Faye’s death, said Sgt. Evan Antley of the Cayce Department of Public Safety. The man was identified as Coty Scott Taylor, 30.</p>
<p>Faye was reported missing Monday afternoon. She was last seen about 3:45 playing in the yard of her mother’s house in the Churchill Heights neighborhood. Her body was found Thursday morning.</p>
<p>The evidence that led police to her body was found Thursday morning, after authorities began going through garbage trucks and trash cans in the neighborhood, Sgt. Antley said.</p>
<p>The Lexington County coroner’s office scheduled an autopsy to determine Mr. Taylor’s cause of death for Saturday.</p>
