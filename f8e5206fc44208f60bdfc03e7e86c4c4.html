<p>TOKYO â€” South Korea is reporting 315 more virus cases, bringing its increase for the day to 571 and total number of infections to 2,337.</p>
<p>For the first time, its daily increase surpassed that of China, which reported 327 new cases.</p>
<p>South Korea says the southeastern city of Daegu and surrounding areas accounted for most of its new infections.&nbsp;Officials have been mobilizing public health tools to contain the outbreak to the Daegu area, but the gradual increase of cases elsewhere has raised concern that authorities are losing control of the virus.</p>
<p>The global count of those infected exceeds 83,000, with China still by far the hardest-hit country.</p>
