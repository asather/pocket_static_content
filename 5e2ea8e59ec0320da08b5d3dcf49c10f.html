<h1>Outbreak starts to resemble worldwide economic crisis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK — The coronavirus outbreak began to look more like a worldwide economic crisis Friday as anxiety about the infection emptied shops and amusement parks, canceled events, cut trade and travel, and dragged already slumping financial markets even lower.</p>
<p>More employers told their workers to stay home, and officials locked down neighborhoods and closed schools. The wide-ranging efforts to halt the spread of the illness threatened jobs, paychecks and profits.</p>
<p>“This is a case where in economic terms the cure is almost worse than the disease,‘‘ said Jacob Kirkegaard, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “When you quarantine cities ... you lose economic activity that you’re not going to get back.”</p>
<p>The list of countries touched by the illness climbed to nearly 60 as Mexico, Belarus, Lithuania, New Zealand, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Iceland and the Netherlands reported their first cases. More than 83,000 people worldwide have contracted the illness, with deaths topping 2,800.</p>
<p>China, where the outbreak began in December, has seen a slowdown in new infections and on Saturday morning reported 427 new cases over the past 24 hours along with 47 additional deaths. The city at the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan, accounted for the bulk of both.</p>
<p>New cases in mainland China have held steady at under 500 for the past four days, with almost all of them in Wuhan and its surrounding Hubei province.</p>
<p>With the number of discharged patients now greatly exceeding those of new arrivals, Wuhan has more than 5,000 spare beds in 16 temporary treatment centers, Ma Xiaowei, director of the National Health Commission, told a news conference in Wuhan on Friday.</p>
<p>The head of the World Health Organization on Friday announced that the risk of the virus spreading worldwide was “very high,” citing the “continued increase in the number of cases and the number of affected countries.”</p>
<p>U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged all governments to “do everything possible to contain the disease.”</p>
<p>The economic ripples have already reached around the globe. Stock markets around the world plunged again Friday.</p>
<p>The effects were just as evident in the hush that settled in over places where throngs of people ordinarily work and play and buy and sell.</p>
<p>“There’s almost no one coming here,” said Kim Yun-ok, who sells doughnuts and seaweed rolls at Seoul’s Gwangjang Market, where crowds were thin as South Korea counted 571 new cases — more than in China. “I am just hoping that the outbreak will come under control soon.”</p>
<p>In Asia, Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Japan announced they would close, and events that were expected to attract tens of thousands of people were called off, including a concert series by K-pop megagroup BTS. Japanese officials prepared to shutter all schools until early April.</p>
<p>In Italy — which has reported 888 cases, the most of any country outside of Asia — hotel bookings are falling, and Premier Giuseppe Conte raised the specter of recession.</p>
<p>The Swiss government banned events with more than 1,000 people, while at the Cologne Cathedral in Germany, basins of holy water were emptied for fear of spreading germs.</p>
<p>In a report published Friday in the New England Journal of Medicine, Chinese health officials said the death rate from the illness known as COVID-19 was 1.4%, based on 1,099 patients at more than 500 hospitals throughout China.</p>
<p>Assuming there are many more cases with no or very mild symptoms, the rate “may be considerably less than 1%,” U.S. health officials wrote in an editorial in the journal.</p>
<p>Given the ease of spread, however, the virus could gain footholds around the world, and many could die.</p>
<p>“It’s not cholera or the black plague,” said Simone Venturini, the city councilor for economic development in Venice, Italy, where tourism already hurt by historic flooding last year has sunk with news of virus cases. “The damage that worries us even more is the damage to the economy.”</p>
<p>Europe’s economy is already teetering on the edge of recession. Economists have forecast global growth will slip to 2.4% this year, the slowest since the Great Recession in 2009, and down from earlier expectations closer to 3%. For the U.S., estimates are falling to as low as 1.7% growth, down from 2.3% in 2019.</p>
<p>But if COVID-19 becomes a global pandemic, economists expect the impact could be much worse, with the U.S. and other global economies falling into recession.</p>
