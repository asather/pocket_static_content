<h1>You catch watch two Steelers games during NBC Sports' 'Football Week in America' series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With live sporting events on hold until the COVID-19 pandemic (hopefully) blows over, fans have had to get their sports fixes via watching older games involving their favorite teams.</p>
<p>Pirates fans were treated to a re-airing of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/24/Pirates-Wild-Card-2013-Russell-Martin-Johnny-Cueto-Jason-Mackey-younger-fans/stories/202003240099" target="_blank">2013 NL wild-card game</a> Tuesday night courtesy of AT&amp;T SportsNet, and the Penguins faithful were probably been glued to NHL Network Wednesday&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/24/penguins-marathon-nhl-network-pittsburgh/stories/202003240100" target="_blank">watching 13 consecutive hours</a> of Penguins content.</p>
<p>Now, Steelers fans have something to look forward to next week in the form of two “Sunday Night Football” games from the last decade being re-aired as part of NBC Sports’ “<a href="https://nbcsportsgrouppressbox.com/2020/03/25/nbc-sports-presents-football-week-in-america-featuring-two-nbc-sunday-night-football-games-each-night-on-nbcsn-beginning-monday-march-30/" target="_blank">Football Week in America</a>” series.</p>
<p>NBC Sports announced Wednesday that beginning March 30, the network will air two “Sunday Night Football” games a night through April 5 and then three more games every other Sunday in April.</p>
<p>The Steelers will be featured in two games during this first week of classic pigskin, one most fans will definitely want to tune into and another they may want to ignore.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh fans may or may not want to tune into a 2012&nbsp;“Sunday Night Football” matchup between the Steelers and Broncos at 7 p.m. April 1. It was Peyton Manning’s first game as Denver’s quarterback after leaving the Colts the previous offseason, and he showed he was more than capable of continuing his dominance by leading the Broncos to a 31-19 victory.</p>
<p>This was one of those frustrating games that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/23/ESPN-Ryan-Clark-Steelers-LSU-Joe-Burrow-Ben-Roethlisberger-Mike-Tomlin-Rooney-Rule/stories/202001220081" target="_blank">safety Ryan Clark</a> wasn’t allowed to play in due to the danger of his sickle cell trait being triggered by Denver’s high altitudes. It was actually a more tightly contested game than most folks probably remember given the final score, with the Steelers still in it until the final drive when Ben Roethlisberger through a game-sealing interception.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E3bVi0ceRCE&amp;feature=emb_err_watch_on_yt" target="_blank">Here are the highlights</a> if you would rather relive this game in an abbreviated form.</p>
<p>On a brighter note, NBC Sports will re-air a 2010 contest between the Steelers and Ravens at 7 p.m. April 4.</p>
<p>That game, a 13-10 Steelers win, might have left an indelible mark with Steelers fans because of three plays:</p>
<p>• Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata broke Roethlisberger’s nose with a first-quarter sack.</p>
<p>• Troy Polamalu kept the Steelers in this tight contest by strip-sacking Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>• The Steelers won after running back Isaac Redman caught a pass from Roethlisberger and broke multiple tackles on his way to the end zone.</p>
<p>Here are the highlights from that game to jog your memory:</p>

<p>Other big games on NBC Sports’ docket include a 2013 contest where Tom Brady’s Patriots overcame a 24-0 deficit to beat Manning’s Broncos that will air at 9:30 p.m. March 30; two matchups featuring Packers legend Brett Favre April 2; and the Giants-Cowboys game where Odell Beckham Jr. made that incredible one-handed catch, airing at 7 p.m. April 4.</p>
<p>Also, if you’re feeling particularly vindictive during this trying time, there are two games on the schedule featuring a New England loss: one at the hands of the Colts airing at 7 p.m. April 3, and another defeat against the Seahawks that will be be shown at 8 p.m. April 19.</p>
