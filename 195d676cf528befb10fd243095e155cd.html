<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The organizers of Art All Night won’t be able capture the gritty ambiance of the event, but they’re not willing to let a year go by without it.</p>
<p>The 23-year-old Lawrenceville tradition will move online Saturday, May 16, showcasing unfiltered artwork for 22 hours, along with performances by bands and other performers, activities for children and adults, and live painting.</p>
<p>Artists are asked to submit a photograph of their artwork (5MB maximum) to <a href="https://www.artallnight.org/" target="_blank">https://www.artallnight.org/</a> and fill out the registration form. They can also film themselves painting a piece of artwork over a 22-hour period, condense it to 5 to 10 minutes, upload to YouTube and submit it. Performers can submit a YouTube video up to 10 minutes in length.</p>
<p>Video submission ends Sunday and art submission runs through Tuesday.</p>
<p>The online event takes place from 4 p.m. May 16 until 2 p.m. May 17. Viewers can support artists through the bidding of art displayed in the show as well as through a donation to the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council Emergency Fund for Artists.</p>
<p>Activities for children and families, including a collaborative art project and scavenger hunt, will be held from 4 to 8 p.m. May 16 and 10 a.m. to noon May 17. There is also a free coloring book of the city skyline and Art All Night logo available to download now.</p>
<p>At the end of the 22-hour period, the site will become inactive.</p>
