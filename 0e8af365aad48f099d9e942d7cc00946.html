<h1>Allegheny County Council committee hears arguments on paid leave law</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County Council committee is considering whether all workers in the county should have access to up to five paid sick leave days.</p>
<p>The Health and Human Services Committee chairwoman, Cindy Kirk, D-McCandless, limited a discussion at last week’s meeting to only testimony from advocates and questions from council. No committee vote was held.</p>
<p>Sam Williamson, Western Pennsylvania district director for the Service Employees International Union 32BJ, said workers shouldn’t have to choose between a paycheck or taking care of themselves or a loved while ill. Additionally, the public shouldn’t have to be exposed to workers who show up sick, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The public health rationale for passing an Allegheny County paid sick bill is just as strong, we believe, as the social justice or economic justice rationale,” especially during a global pandemic, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Williamson advocated for the city of Pittsburgh’s paid sick leave through a years-long court battle that the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/07/17/pennsylvania-Supreme-Court-pittsburgh-paid-sick-leave-safety-training-security-guards/stories/201907170085" target="_blank">city eventually won at the Pennsylvania Supreme Court level</a>.</p>
<p>Melissa Bova, vice president of government affairs for the Pennsylvania Restaurant and Lodging Association, one of the parties that sued to stop the city from adopting paid leave, said the hospitality industry is the&nbsp;“most decimated” industry impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“There is no end in sight here, and the last thing this industry or any industry needs right now is a piece of legislation that achieves nothing other than putting another burden on them at a time when, quite frankly, their existing burdens could not be any greater,” Ms. Bova said.</p>
<p>Similar to the city’s law, which went into effect on March 15, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/04/21/Allegheny-County-Council-paid-sick-days-time-legislation-workers-modeled-Pittsburgh/stories/202004210107" target="_blank">county proposal</a>&nbsp;would mandate that at workplaces employing 15 or more, workers would earn one hour of paid sick time for every 35 hours worked, up to 40 hours of paid sick time. At workplaces with fewer than 15 employees, the accrual rate would be the same, but sick time would be capped at 24 hours.</p>
<p>In other council business, at-large member Bethany Hallam, a Democrat, will introduce a bill aiming to restrict “no-knock” search warrants for Allegheny County police and sheriffs. The bill will be introduced at the council’s regular meeting Tuesday.</p>
