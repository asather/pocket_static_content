<h1>No way around balky online system for selling liquor and wine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits online retail store continues to madden many customers who try and fail to buy booze. The good news is there are work-arounds to the balky system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The bad news is some of those work-arounds aren’t working either.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before the COVID-19 crisis caused the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board to shut down all of its stores, independent distributors were getting and selling wines and spirits from small producers and importers not typically offered at PLCB stores via the PLCB’S special-order program.</p>
<p>The distributor would take customers’ order to the PLCB, forward the customers’ payment, box up bottles at its location and then take the order to a PLCB store to have it scanned into the state system. Then the distributor would deliver the order to its customers, which could be an individual or a restaurant, including those with “wine extended permits” allowing them to sell up to three bottles to go. The state periodically paid distributors their percentage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state restarted online wine and liquor sales in a limited way on April 1, but the PLCB did not restart the special-order program. Even longtime customers have been surprised that they can no longer buy from independent distributors.</p>
<p>“We have turned away thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of business,” says Deb Mortillaro, co-owner of&nbsp;Dreadnought Wines in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Many of her customers “had no clue” how Dreadnought — nearing its 40th anniversary&nbsp;—&nbsp;processes orders of the wine and spirits it represents through the PLCB. So on Wednesday she sent customers an email explaining it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is hurting all distributors and vendors to the PLCB,” she wrote. “In my opinion this could be solved easily.”</p>
<p>She wants the state to resume special-order sales by allowing Dreadnought and other independent distributors to take orders to PLCB stores or service centers in the region where employees are still working. Then they could get wine into the hands of individuals as well as restaurants.</p>
<p>This “would be far safer from a health standpoint than opening up the stores,” she says, and provide revenue for the state.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dreadnought still is allowing customers to pick up orders processed before the special-order system shut down in mid-March. Boxes are left on a table by the door for them. Unable to make new sales, she and partner Mike Gonze are doing their best to bring in income by offering online seminars through their Palate Partners.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She says about 70 other distributors are in the same boat, but she’s not expecting the state to change its policy. In fact, she fears that special-orders sales will be the last to resume.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, retailers such as Mary’s Vine, a wine bar and restaurant in Rankin, are running low on some wines that they are allowed to sell to customers to take home.</p>
<p>Daniel Smith says: “We are out of many of the wines that we order on a regular basis, but we can still suggest alternatives with the wines that we have on hand.”</p>
<p>The PLCB, meanwhile, is maintaining that keeping stores and special-order sales closed is necessary to protect the health of its employees and the public and it’s asking people to be patient.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state is continuing to sell to Pennsylvanians online via<a href="https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com" target="_blank"> finewineandgoodspirits.com</a>, but that website gives visitors access to actually buy something in a randomized and limited way. So more often than not, would-be buyers are greeted with a&nbsp;“Thank you for being a valued customer” message, inviting them to try later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the PLCB posted a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lcb.pa.gov/Consumers/Documents/FWGS_FAQ.pdf" target="_blank">“frequently asked questions” page</a> explaining how the site works.&nbsp;It says: “We anticipate demand will continue to exceed capacity for some time. No account or special link is required to access the site or shop the available selection. No one receives priority access to the site.”</p>
<p>Shawn M. Kelly of the PLCB shared statistics for the first two full weeks of online sales, April 1-14, totaling 18,630 transactions and sales of $1.76 million. That equals almost 48% of the number of transactions and over 35 percent of sales dollars for its last fiscal year of online sales. The second week showed an increase of 3,074 orders and $344,700 in sales.</p>
<p>From April 7 to April 14, transaction numbers hovered just above 1,800 a day, with only two transactions on this past Sunday. Meanwhile, over the full two weeks, 3.16 million active users tried to access the site 22.87 million times. Hence the frustration. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“We continue to work to increase fulfillment capacity for e-comm orders, and we plan to bring additional facilities into operation later this week so we may accept more orders each day,”&nbsp;Mr. Kelly said Wednesday evening.&nbsp;“Details on additional fulfillment centers and capacity will be available in coming days.”</p>
<p>The PLCB and Gov. Tom Wolf are taking heat from Pennsylvanians and their elected officials who are unhappy with the limits of online sales and the&nbsp;shutdown of the 600 brick-and-mortar Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores. Many Pennsylvanians traveled out of state to buy booze at stores in Ohio and West Virginia, until those states started requiring resident IDs for purchases in some border counties.</p>
<p>There is a petition that started in Eastern Pennsylvania to allow distributors to deliver special orders of wine and spirits directly to licensed restaurants and retailers, as per 2016’s Act 39.</p>
<p>There’s also a petition circulating to get the PLCB to allow licensees such as bars, restaurants and beer distributors to temporarily sell bottles of spirits, wine, cider and beer to go, as a way to help consumers and to help businesses that otherwise are only allowed to sell food and beer and wine to go.</p>
<p>Many supporters are calling for an overhaul, even the abolishment, of the state-controlled system, but many were doing that before the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Mortillaro, who also has a company (Soiree Partners) that delivers wine and spirits to restaurants, says,&nbsp;“Just open the [special-order] system. That’s all I want.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the meantime, many Pennsylvania supermarkets and groceries are selling wine (which they order from the state in large quantities) and beer, but not spirits. Beer distributors are allowed to be open, too, though not all are.</p>
<p>Distilleries are open and selling spirits to go, shipping and even delivering them. Breweries, too, are selling and delivering directly to customers. Some wine bars, operating as satellite locations of wineries that ship to them, are selling bottles to go, too. And because it sells Pennsylvania-made spirits, Pennsylvania Libations in the Strip District is able to sell bottles for pickup and delivery. Customers have been waiting in line while maintaining physical distance.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It continues to be temporarily impossible to get certain products that aren’t made in Pennsylvania, such as dry vermouth and tequila, or popular commercial brands such as Fireball and Tito’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLCB says it is continuing to monitor this very fluid situation with the Wolf administration and public health officials as it works to serve its various constituencies.&nbsp;</p>
