<p>The number of COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County continues to see an upward, record-setting trend, as the the county health department on Sunday reported 96 new positive cases, a new single-day record, tops the mark of 90 cases set the previous day.</p>
<p>Before Saturday, the&nbsp;previous single-day record total was 76 cases, reported on April 4.</p>
<p>To address the rise in cases, the county said it will be holding a press conference sometime Sunday.</p>
<p>Over the last nine days of being in the green phase, Allegheny County has experienced an increase of 430 new cases as reported by the county health department.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Since March 14, when the county reported its first case, there have been been 2,568 cases in Allegheny County&nbsp;— 2,425 confirmed and 143 probable.</p>
<p>There was no change Sunday in the county’s death toll, which remains at 186, with 174 confirmed and 12 probable.</p>
<p>There was one additional hospitalization as a result of the virus, bringing the total to 382 past or present hospitalizations.</p>
<p>On Sunday, the Pennsylvania Department of Health on Saturday confirmed 505 additional positive cases of COVID-19, bringing the statewide total to 85,496. All 67 counties in Pennsylvania have cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>There are 6,606 total deaths statewide attributed to COVID-19, an increase of three new deaths from Saturday’s report, the state health department said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As nearly the entire state is now in the green phase, we must remain committed to protecting against COVID-19,” Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said. “Pennsylvania has been a model for the country on how to reopen effectively using a careful, measured approach. However, the virus has not gone away. Each of us has a responsibility to continue to protect ourselves, our loved ones and others by wearing a mask, maintaining social distancing and washing our hands frequently. Together we can protect our most vulnerable Pennsylvanians, our essential workers and our healthcare system.”</p>
<p>Mask wearing is required in all businesses in yellow and green phases of reopening. “Consistent mask wearing, even in counties in the green phase, could have lasting benefits as a COVID-19 surge is possible this fall,” according to a state health department release.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration will allow Lebanon County to move from the yellow phase to the less-restrictive green phase by the end of next week. It will be the final county in Pennsylvania to do so.</p>
