<h1>Sidney Crosby's return creates roster crunch on the back half of the lineup</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As his Penguins teammates took the ice for a game day skate on Tuesday morning, Joseph Blandisi strolled through the bowels of PPG Paints Arena. He carried a stack of sticks in one hand and lugged a hockey bag over his other shoulder — the tell-tale signs of a hockey player in transit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The scrappy forward, affectionately nicknamed “Blender” for his propensity to stir stuff up, has been one of the key reinforcements called upon to patch holes in an injury-plagued Pittsburgh lineup. He’s played in 21 games this year (including 14 since Sidney Crosby went down with sports hernia surgery) and tallied a total of five points on the year.</p>
<p>But with Crosby expected to play in his first game since Nov. 9 and center Nick Bjugstad continuing to progress from his core muscle surgery, the Penguins are facing a roster crunch on the back half of their lineup.</p>
<p>Blandisi was the first one to feel the ripple effect of a healthier lineup. However, he might not be the only one.</p>
<p>Judging from the morning skate, Hollidaysburg native Sam Lafferty will be bumped to the press box as a healthy scratch. Meanwhile, the Penguins have opted to plug in the more natural center in Andrew Agozzino on the fourth line, playing between Alex Galchenyuk and Patric Hornqvist.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty obvious there’s a lot of competition now with guys coming back,” Lafferty said. “It’s a healthy competition. It’s good for the team. But at the same time, you want to go out and perform.”</p>
<p>For now, Lafferty and Agozzio appear to be in the most direct competition with one another. The Penguins like Lafferty’s game, especially, his speed. Coach Mike Sullivan has previously said that Lafferty “belongs” in the NHL. However, they much prefer Lafferty on the wing to center, thus the decision to give Agozzino the nod on Tuesday night.</p>
<p>Soon, this competition between Agozzino and Lafferty could be for more than a jersey on game night. When Bjugstad returns, and if no one else goes down — which might be assuming way too much for this injury-ravaged bunch — Lafferty and Agozzino might be fighting for the last roster spot.</p>
<p>Bjugstad was playing a third-line center role. So maybe that bumps the center (Agozzino) back to the American Hockey League. But another factor to consider is that Lafferty’s unique contract structure allows him to go up and down between Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and the NHL without waivers.</p>
<p>Or maybe the Penguins send both down to save some salary cap space and stick with just 12 forwards in the NHL, as they’ve done often this year. Time will tell. But for now, what’s clear is that as long as the Penguins keep getting healthier, the competition on the back half of the roster will only intensify.</p>
<p>Whether players like Blandisi. Lafferty or Agozzino or some of the others who were recalled remain with the team or not, they each had a hand in helping the Penguins thrive with Crosby injured — and helping the team post the best winning percentage since Crosby went down.</p>
<p>“I want these guys to know how appreciative we are as a coaching staff,” Sullivan said. “That’s one of the reasons why we’ve become team that we’ve become. I just think when you’re talking about these role players, they’re just great people.”</p>
<p><strong>Blueger’s line remains intact</strong></p>
<p>While the Penguins shook up their roster a bit with Crosby back, Sullivan chose to keep together the line featuring Teddy Blueger at center, Zach Aston-Reese at left wing and Brandon Tanev at right wing.</p>
<p>“Teddy’s line has brought so much to this team,” Sullivan said. “I don’t think the role of his line will change. That line will continue to do what they do to help us win games.”</p>
<p>With Jake Guentzel out, the Penguins are short on top-six caliber wingers. In theory, Tanev would be the most likely candidate to earn a promotion to one of the top lines, where he could use his speed, aggressive forechecking and tenacity to create opportunities and take up some of the defensive responsibilities.</p>
<p>However, Sullivan loves the way Aston-Reese, Blueger and Tanev play together. He typically gives them the responsibility of shutting down the opponent’s top line and often gives them defensive-zone starts. Even with more healthy bodies in the lineup and some roster flexibility, it sounds like that’s not changing.</p>
<p><strong>McCann to the wing</strong></p>
<p>With Guentzel out, the Penguins needed to find a wingman for Crosby. Jared McCann, who has played center most of the season because of the numerous injuries, will get the nod.</p>
<p>Late last season, McCann skated on the top line with Crosby and Guentzel for several games. Their best one came March 2 in Montreal, when both Crosby and Guentzel had four-point nights. McCann scored and was a plus-4.</p>
<p><strong>Out of the box</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins coaching staff has been pleased with the effort, commitment to playing a 200-foot game and structured approach on a nightly basis. But Sullivan said on Tuesday morning, there is one area he’d like the team to clean up: penalties.</p>
<p>In the last five games alone, the Penguin have racked up a total of 51 penalty minutes.</p>
<p>“Some of them are unavoidable,” Sullivan said. “But some are avoidable. We’ve got to make sure we’re responsible with our sticks. When we pay attention to details and we stay on the right side of the puck and we stay on the right side of people, we don’t put ourselves in positions where we’ve got to reach or hook or hold or things of that nature.</p>
<p>“It really boils down to attention to detail.”</p>
