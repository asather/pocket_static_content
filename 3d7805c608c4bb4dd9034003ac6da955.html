<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In its latest release of data on Friday, Pennsylvania reported 1,706 new cases of COVID-19 and said its deaths rose by 49.</p>
<p>With the new figures, the state’s case total increased to 29,441 cases (from 27,735). With 49 new deaths, the total is at 756 (up from 707 deaths reported Thursday). Of those who tested positive, 2,587 were hospitalized and 653 required ventilators.</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, there are 22 new COVID-19 cases and 5 new deaths.&nbsp;The new figures bring the county’s totals to 947 cases and 43 deaths, up from Thursday’s totals of 925 cases and 38 deaths.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania. Its 5 additional deaths were among 8 new deaths reported across Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In addition to Allegheny, Armstrong County reported another death, the day after reporting its first; Mercer County reported its first death due to the virus; and Indiana County a third death.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County has reported 19 deaths, according to its coroner, although the state was reporting 13.&nbsp;Beaver County’s coroner reported a total of 24 deaths, which is 9 more than what the state reported Friday.&nbsp;There is an unexplained discrepancy in the information coming from some county coroners and official state data.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the region, no new deaths were reported in the following counties: Butler (5 total), Cambria (1), Fayette (3), Lawrence (5) and Washington (1).</p>
<p>Across the state,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the first case in Allegheny County was confirmed on March 14, there have been 176&nbsp;hospitalizations due to COVID-19. Of those, at least 57 were admitted to the Intensive Care Unit and 32 required a mechanical ventilator.&nbsp;The county said it has administered at least 10,872&nbsp;tests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>State health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Thursday that the data shows Pennsylvania is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p>“Our trends show that Pennsylvanians’ sacrifice to stay at home is working,” she said. “We have been able to flatten that curve, and to date, our healthcare system is staying stable.”</p>
<p>She emphasized the need to stay the course on social distancing and mitigation measures.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine did not provide a timeline for when social distancing measures and business closures would end, reiterating that “the virus determines the timetable; we don’t determine the timetable.”</p>
