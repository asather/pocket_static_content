<h1>NCAA proposal for extended college football preseason set</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NCAA football oversight committee has finalized a plan for an extended preseason that would include an additional two weeks for teams to hold walk-throughs.</p>
<p>The proposal goes to the Division I Council, which meets Tuesday, and is expected to be approved.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic wiping out spring practice for most teams — along with the usual required summer activities for players such as weigh training and film study — a plan was needed to make up for the lost preparation time.</p>
<p>A proposed schedule had been circulating among NCAA members during the last week. Oversight committee chairman Shane Lyons, who is athletic director at West Virginia, told the Associated Press a few final tweaks were made Thursday. The final version permits teams to conduct the maximum six hours of unpadded walk-throughs per week while also requiring two days off for the players.</p>
<p>The extra two weeks of walk-throughs, weight training, conditioning and film study will be limited to 20 hours per week total and can begin 14 days prior to the start of normal 29-day preseason practice.</p>
<p>Teams are allowed to begin preseason practice 29 days before their scheduled first game.</p>
<p>Most major college football teams are set to kick off their seasons around Labor Day weekend, with a handful starting as early as Aug. 29.</p>
