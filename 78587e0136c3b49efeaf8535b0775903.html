<h1>Going once, going twice ... former Lawyers Building Downtown is up for auction</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Let the bidding begin.</p>
<p>The former Lawyers Building went up for auction Tuesday, five years after a New York-based private equity real estate fund acquired it and renamed it the Pittsburgher after the famous hotel that once occupied its floors.</p>
<p>It is one of three Downtown buildings that the King Penguin Opportunity Fund is trying to sell — the others being its next door neighbor, the 19-story Allegheny Building, and the 26-story Centre City Tower on Smithfield Street.</p>
<p>The 25-story Pittsburgher is the only one being auctioned, with the owners figuring it was the best way to market the property on a national basis because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The auction started Tuesday on the Ten-X Commercial website and will end Thursday. The minimum bid is $3 million.</p>
<p>But you can bet that King Penguin is looking to get a lot more than that for the building, opened in 1928 as the Pittsburgher Hotel before being converted to office space decades later.</p>
<p>The owner spent $4.25 million to acquire the structure, located at the corner of Forbes Avenue and Cherry Way near the former Kaufmann’s/Macy’s department store.</p>
<p>And according to the offering memorandum, King Penguin has spent more than $9 million on improvements, including facade and roof restorations, signage, new air conditioning, new elevators, an upgraded lobby, and renovations to the restrooms and common areas.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the building is currently only 36% occupied.</p>
<p>Gregg Broujos, regional principal of the Colliers International real estate firm, said the property could attract attention —&nbsp;at the right price.</p>
<p>“I believe that the offering will definitely attract a lot of investors, not only locally and regionally but absolutely outside of Pittsburgh,” he said.</p>
<p>“It’s just a matter of pricing. It’s a building that has had a good and long history in the city office market. I believe it’s an attractive investment at the right price.”</p>
<p>By mid-afternoon Tuesday, the current bid for the Pittsburgher had reached $4 million. The bidding is in $1 million increments.</p>
<p>On the cautionary side, the owner of the Law and Finance Building in the same block as the Pittsburgher put that property up for sale but then pulled it back from the market last month because of the uncertainty created by the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgher served as a 400-room hotel from its opening in 1928 until its closing in 1965. It attracted the likes of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, boxer Jack Dempsey, golfer Arnold Palmer, actor Lon Chaney, and TV show host Ed Sullivan.</p>
<p>As for King Penguin’s other properties, Mr. Broujos has been trying to broker the sale of Centre City Tower, which has been on the market for the last year.</p>
<p>King Penguin reportedly is close to a deal with Philadelphia-based PMC Property Group to buy the Allegheny Building, which it paid $7 million to buy in 2015. PMC has converted a number of buildings Downtown into apartments.</p>
