<h1>Columbus statue in Schenley Park vandalized</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Christopher Columbus statue at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Oakland was vandalized as statues of the explorer and colonizer continue being defaced across the country.</p>
<p>“Murder” and “OG Pig” were a few phrases written in paint across the statue. Red handprints covered the base of the statue as well.</p>
<p>Tim McNulty, the director of communications for the City of Pittsburgh, said the statue was damaged sometime overnight Friday, though it is unknown when. An investigation into the perpetrator is currently underway.</p>
<p>Mr. McNulty said the public arts office is working in conjunction with a graffiti team to examine the statue before cleaning it to ensure it will not be further damaged. According to Mr. McNulty, this process is typical for vandalized statues.</p>
<p>The Columbus statue was vandalized in 2010 and 2017 on Christopher Columbus Day.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.change.org/p/pittsburgh-parks-recreation-department-remove-the-christopher-columbus-statue-at-schenley-park" target="_blank">petition on Change.org</a> was created on Thursday calling for the Pittsburgh Parks and Recreation Department to remove the statue in Schenley Park. It has reached over 1,000 signatures.</p>
