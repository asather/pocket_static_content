<h1>Ben Roethlisberger and JuJu Smith-Schuster connect, but injury concerns mar Monday night win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — It didn’t take JuJu Smith-Schuster long to see Ben Roethlisberger look like his old self again. Or rekindle the connection that was so productive for the Steelers in 2018.</p>
<p>It was on full display Monday night in the empty cavern known as MetLife Stadium, when Roethlisberger made his much-anticipated return from elbow surgery with three touchdown passes —&nbsp;two to JuJu Smith-Schuster — in a 26-16 victory against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>“Having Ben back is huge for our offense,” Smith-Schuster said. “It brought back memories.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger threw for 229 yards, completed passes to nine different receivers, did not throw an interception and directed one of his vintage touchdown drives at the end of the first half. It was a clean and encouraging performance in his first game since sustaining a season-ending elbow injury nearly one year ago against the Seattle Seahawks at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“I’m excited we won the game,” Roethlisberger said. “I told the guys before the game, it’s not about me. The reason I came back is for these guys. I’m just thankful to be a part of it.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger threw touchdowns of 10 and 8 yards to Smith-Schuster, another of 13 yards to James Washington and finished with a passer rating of 117.8. His outing even included an 11-yard scramble that helped set up his second touchdown pass that gave the Steelers a 16-10 lead just seconds before halftime.</p>
<p>“It’s awesome to have our quarterback back and see the things he does,” Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger got some help from running back Benny Snell, who had the first 100-yard game of his young career after replacing an injured James Conner (ankle) to start the second half. Snell finished with 113 yards on 19 carries that included a 30-yard run to set up Roethlisberger’s final touchdown pass with 5:23 remaining.</p>
<p>In a surreal setting in which no fans were allowed at 82,000-seat MetLife Stadium because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Steelers defense shut down Giants running back Saquon Barkley, holding him to just 6 yards on 15 carries. They also got interceptions from two unlikely sources — linebacker T.J. Watt and defensive end Cam Heyward — leading to a touchdown and field goal, respectively.</p>
<p>“We had a commitment and we weren’t going to be bashful about that commitment,” Tomlin said. “We thought that guy was a catalyst. We did what we thought was necessary to minimize his impact on the game.”</p>
<p>The victory did not come without some potentially troublesome injuries to the offensive line, which was already without Pro Bowl guard David DeCastro.</p>
<p>Stefen Wisniewski, who started for DeCastro in his first game with the Steelers, left with a pectoral muscle injury — a potentially serious injury. Zach Banner, making his first NFL start at right tackle, injured his knee on Roethlisberger’s final touchdown and did not return.</p>
<p>Banner’s injury appeared to be serious, and his teammates expressed their concern after the game.</p>
<p>“He’s a very tough guy,” Snell said. “I’m definitely going to have him in my prayers that he gets better.”</p>
<p>The Steelers padded their lead to 19-10 at the start of the fourth quarter on a 36-yard field goal by Chris Boswell, but it came right after a goal line interception by Heyward — his first in his nine-year career — that ended a 19-play, 87-yard drive by the Giants.</p>
<p>Outside linebacker Bud Dupree forced the interception, chasing quarterback Daniel Jones out of the pocket and hitting his throwing arm as Jones was trying to throw across his body. Until then, Jones was keeping the Steelers defense off-balance — and exhausted — by running a no-huddle offense that moved the ball from their own 9 to the Steelers 4.</p>
<p>“That was a long drive,” Watt said. “We were very winded through that drive.”</p>
<p>“They were pacing us and got us out of rhythm,” Heyward said.</p>
<p>The Steelers scored on two of their final three possessions in the first half, thanks to a pair of touchdown throws by Roethlisberger. After a tentative start, Roethlisberger completed 12-of-21 passes for 145 yards in the first half.</p>
<p>It was the type of last-minute drive Roethlisberger has orchestrated throughout his career, and his teammates were glad to see it. He accounted for all the yardage on the 78-yard drive that lasted 85 seconds – completing 5-of-7 passes for 67 yards and even scrambling for 11 yards to the Giants 13 to set up his touchdown to Washington.</p>
<p>“That two-minute drive he was able to put together before the half, I thought, was significant,” Tomlin said.</p>
<p>“That was a good drive for us,” Roethlisberger said. “My job is to get the ball out of my hands and get it to the playmakers, and that’s what I did.”</p>
<p>The game was tied after one quarter, thanks to a 41-yard field goal by Boswell on the Steelers’ second possession with 49 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>What would have been the Steelers’ first possession never came about because Diontae Johnson muffed a punt at his own 12 that the Giants recovered at the 3. But Jones misfired on two pass attempts, and the Giants had to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Graham Gano and a 3-0 lead.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger completed 4-of-7 passes on the 13-play field-goal drive, the biggest a 28-yarder down the right sideline on third-and-9 to rookie Chase Claypool, who made a nice toe-tapping catch inside the boundary.</p>
<p>The Giants took a 10-3 lead early in the second quarter when receiver Darius Slayton got behind cornerback Steven Nelson on a deep post to catch a 41-yard touchdown from Jones — one play after cornerback Joe Haden was called for pass interference on third-and-12 that kept alive the Giants’ drive.</p>
<p>But after the Steelers went three-and-out on the ensuing series, Watt intercepted Jones’ pass on first down from the Giants’ 35, setting up Roethlisberger’s first touchdown pass since Week 16 of the 2018 season — a 10-yarder to a wide open Smith-Schuster.</p>
<p>Boswell, however, missed the extra point — something he didn’t do in 28 attempts last season — cutting the lead to 10-9. It was Boswell’s first extra-point miss since a Dec. 2, 2018, game against the Los Angeles Chargers, ending a streak of 37 in a row.</p>
