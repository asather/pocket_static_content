<p>The pres­i­dent of the Pitts­burgh Fed­er­a­tion of Teach­ers said Thurs­day she sup­ports a plan that would move the first nine weeks of school for city stu­dents to­tally on­line.</p>
<p>Nina Es­pos­ito-Vis­gi­tis said in a phone in­ter­view that teach­ers are ea­ger to get stu­dents back into the class­room, but re­open­ing schools amid ris­ing COVID-19 case num­bers in the Pitts­burgh re­gion poses too great a risk.</p>
<p>“We have con­cerns,” she said. “What if you have a preg­nant wife, or take care of a sick par­ent or a sick child? People want to go back, but they’re scared.”</p>
<p>Pitts­burgh Pub­lic Schools board mem­ber Kevin Carter in­tro­duced a res­o­lu­tion Wed­nes­day night that would im­ple­ment vir­tual in­struc­tion for the first quar­ter of the school year for all dis­trict stu­dents.</p>
<p>The res­o­lu­tion, which sev­eral other board mem­bers and dis­trict ad­min­is­tra­tion ap­peared to sup­port, will be up for a vote Aug. 4.</p>
<p>The dis­trict pre­vi­ously pro­posed a plan in which stu­dents would have two op­tions for the up­com­ing school year: on­line only, or a blended model with in-per­son in­struc­tion two days a week and on­line-in­struc­tion the other three days.</p>
<p>But as COVID-19 case num­bers have in­creased sig­nifi­cantly in Al­le­gheny County and south­west­ern Penn­syl­va­nia in July, some have ex­pressed con­cerns that the vi­rus would spread rap­idly through schools and into the com­mu­nity at large.</p>
<p>Ms. Es­pos­ito-Vis­gi­tis rep­resents about 2,400 teach­ers and more than 500 para­pro­fes­sion­als and other staff mem­bers in the dis­trict, and she said the ma­jor­ity want classes held on­line.</p>
<p>Ms. Es­pos­ito-Vis­gi­tis was among the more than 300 com­mu­nity stake­hold­ers who helped the dis­trict build its re­open­ing plan this sum­mer, but the sit­u­a­tion has changed since that work be­gan in early June as case num­bers have re­cently spiked.</p>
<p>“When we started [cre­at­ing the re­open­ing plan], I had no doubt we were go­ing back to school,” she said. “The num­bers are worse than when we started.”</p>
<p>Ms. Es­pos­ito-Vis­gi­tis called Mr. Carter “cou­ra­geous” for in­tro­duc­ing the vir­tual in­struc­tion res­o­lu­tion, but she said she wished the board would have voted on the mea­sure Wed­nes­day in­stead of wait­ing un­til Au­gust so that teach­ers and par­ents would have more time to pre­pare.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter de­cided to hold off on put­ting the res­o­lu­tion up for a vote to avoid pos­si­bly vi­o­lat­ing the state’s Sun­shine Act as the pub­lic has not had a chance to com­ment on the pro­posal.</p>
<p>“It’s the par­ents who are hurt­ing, it’s the teach­ers who are hurt­ing, and they’re wor­ried about the Sun­shine Act,” Ms. Es­pos­ito-Vis­gi­tis said.</p>
