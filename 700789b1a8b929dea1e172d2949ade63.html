<h1>Software company Mindera announces plans for an office in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Software engineering firm Mindera plans to open an office in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/05/21/Oakland-Walnut-Capital-Innovation-Research-Tower/stories/202005210132" target="_blank">Pittsburgh’s Innovation District in Oakland</a>.</p>
<p>The San Diego-based company, which employs more than 500 people across its six offices, builds software systems for clients in industries including fintech, grocery tech, artificial intelligence, gaming and eSports. Already, the company has offices in Portugal, India and the United Kingdom.</p>
<p>Mindera chose Pittsburgh as its second U.S. location because of the city’s “vibrancy” and proximity to student talent from places like the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University, according to Sean Luther, executive director of InnovatePGH.</p>
<p>A coalition of groups that work to attract leading tech companies to the city, InnovatePGH is focused on building out the space surrounding the Pitt and CMU campuses in Oakland, otherwise known as the Innovation District.</p>
<p>And Mindera isn’t the first company to scoop up space there. Zoom Video Communications Inc., the video conference platform that has helped many people connect virtually amid stay-at-home orders and social distancing requirements, announced in May it plans to build a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/05/14/Zoom-research-and-development-center-Pittsburgh-CMU-Phoenix-ASU/stories/202005140097" target="_blank">brick-and-mortar research and development center near CMU.</a></p>
<p>“Mindera’s expansion to Pittsburgh is the latest feather in our city’s cap of future-oriented innovation leaders moving here,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a prepared statement. “This is a most welcome addition to the Pittsburgh Innovation District and to the city and region overall, and will provide further support to our local economy.”</p>
<p>Mindera does not yet have a location picked out, Mr. Luther said. The company will likely move into a “temporary beachhead” office late this fall and scale up to a permanent location later on.</p>
<p>As remote work continues amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the timing of Mindera’s move is still in flux, he said.</p>
<p>With nine current positions open, Mindera plans to start its Pittsburgh team small and grow it over time.</p>
<p>“Opening an office in Pittsburgh represents an exciting new era in Mindera Software’s growth,” Mary Lockwood, managing director, U.S. for the company, said in a prepared statement. “The level of technical talent in the city, as well as its welcoming environment and emphasis on partnership, made this a very easy decision for us.”</p>
<p>“Mindera is the type of growth firm our region is well positioned to support,” said Mark Anthony Thomas, president of the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance, the economic development affiliate of the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. “This marks additional progress in reopening the regional economy and seeing promising businesses thrive in Pittsburgh.”</p>
