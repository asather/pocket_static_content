<h1>Adult website wants to help with virtual NFL draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Roger Goodell has a standing invitation from the vice president of a pornography platform.</p>
<p>Yes, the NFL commissioner has been offered NFL draft assistance from CamSoda, which bills itself as one of the world’s leading adult entertainment webcam websites. Basically, considering their expertise at streaming live video over the Internet, the folks at CamSoda would like to lend a hand to the league for its first-of-its-kind virtual draft, which begins Thursday night.</p>
<p>But the offer is not limited just to Goodell. Executives of NFL teams, who will be&nbsp;“bunkered down” in their draft rooms, according to a Monday news release from CamSoda, are also welcome to contact the site. The official letter to the NFL from the site’s vice president suggests that the Cincinnati Bengals, Cleveland Browns and New York Giants are some of the league’s&nbsp;“less tech-savvy franchises” and might need help to avoid technical difficulties during the draft.</p>
<p>“I implore you to seriously consider our offer,” writes Daryn Parker. “I’d love to send our IT team out to assist with the broadcast of this draft.”</p>
<p>The adult entertainment industry certainly is having some fun poking and prodding at a nation without sports. Noted veteran broadcaster Joe Buck recently rebuffed a proposal from the website ImLive that would pay him $1 million to call play-by-play of, well, some of their content. Buck declined, but not without getting a laugh in at himself.</p>
<p>“I am highly qualified as I have been practicing these calls most of my life,” Buck told Sports Illustrated.</p>
