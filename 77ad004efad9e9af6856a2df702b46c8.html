<h1>The story behind that 1980 photo of Kenny Rogers with Steelers superstars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We interrupt your regularly scheduled coverage of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/03/23/Wolf-to-issue-stay-at-home-order-for-hardest-hit-counties/stories/202003230080" target="_blank">rapidly evolving COVID-19 situation</a> to answer a burning question that was floating around social media this weekend: What’s the deal with this photo of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2020/03/21/Singer-actor-The-Gambler-Kenny-Rogers-dies-at-81/stories/202003210021" target="_blank">late country singer Kenny Rogers</a> hanging out with four Steelers legends?</p>
<p>Yes, that is indeed “The Gambler” crooner in a vintage No. 1 Steelers jersey accompanied by (from left to right) running back Rocky Bleier, defensive tackle “Mean” Joe Greene, receiver Lynn Swann and quarterback Terry Bradshaw.</p>
<p>The 81-year-old Rogers died Friday night of natural causes at his home in Sandy Springs, Ga. This photo began making the rounds shorty after his death was announced, and it begged the question: What is the Houston-born singer’s connection to Pittsburgh given all the black-and-gold love pictured here?</p>
<p>Thanks to a <a href="https://people.com/archive/the-gambler-its-kenny-rogers-suiting-up-with-the-steelers-vol-14-no-15/" target="_blank">People interview with Rogers</a> and those Steelers superstars from Oct. 13, 1980, we have the answers you seek.</p>
<p>It turns out that Rogers was at Three Rivers Stadium to play a “slapstick scrimmage” with some Steelers players for his third CBS television special, “Kenny Rogers’ America.” The special <a href="https://www.billboard.com/photos/9340087/kenny-rogers-life-in-photos" target="_blank">originally aired</a> on Nov. 20, 1980, according to Billboard.</p>
<p>Here’s a promo CBS put together for that Rogers special and some of its other shows that features a small amount of footage from this scrimmage.</p>

<p>“When you’re in Pittsburgh, the Steelers are your team,” Rogers — who would’ve been 41 at the time — told People’s Cable Neuhaus in that interview.</p>
<p>Though Rogers expressed a bit of concern about his own athletic prowess — “God forbid if they ask me to bend from the waist and touch the ground. I can’t get there,” he said — he apparently held his own surprisingly well, allegedly even throwing a touchdown pass to Swann.</p>
<p>Rogers, who apparently played quarterback in junior high, impressed Bleier with his pigskin-chucking skills.</p>
<p>“He’s got Kenny Stabler’s looks and Billy Kilmer’s paunch,” Bleier said, referencing two other quarterbacks of the era. “If you can pick a guitar, you can throw a pass. It’s all in the fingers.”</p>
<p>In exchange for attempting to play ball with professionals, the Steelers also tried their hand at singing two of Rogers’ classic tunes, “Lucille” and “The Gambler.” Rogers’ response to their mangled efforts to match his vocals: “If that doesn’t scare those other teams, nothing will.”</p>
<p></p>
<p>“Maybe we should show Kenny the important exercises, like how to take oxygen,” joked Bradshaw at one point.</p>
<p>Later on, Bradshaw reportedly directed his teammates to “push [Kenny] around a little,” which resulted in a gang tackle that left Rogers buried underneath a pile of Steelers.</p>
<p>Even after that experience, Rogers was still in good enough humor to say that with a little more training, he could do Bradshaw’s job.</p>
<p>“If Terry gets hurt, I could take over,” Rogers said. “If I could gain a little weight, I’d be OK.”</p>
