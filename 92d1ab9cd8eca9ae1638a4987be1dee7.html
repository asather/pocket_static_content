<h1>The Next Page: At 100, Armagh auctioneer an Indiana County legend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Indiana County auctioneer Pete Stewart has a treasure he’s happy to share with his family and friends.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart, who recently celebrated his 100th birthday, is a legend in the Pennsylvania’s Western counties. His treasure: Stories of auction and 20th Century rural farm life that he regularly shares.</p>
<p>With nearly 70 years of experience selling everything from homes to horses and furniture to farm implements, Mr. Stewart, one of some 500 auctioneers in the state, was honored in mid-July by family, friends and fellow auctioneers at the Armagh/East Wheatfield Volunteer Fire Company headquarters where he is the last charter member of the company that formed in 1941.</p>
<p>Naturally Mr. Stewart isn’t auctioneering at the pace he was 50 years ago but was still behind the microphone in 2019 and planned to be working in 2020 with his son and granddaughter Erin, both licensed auctioneers, at Pete Stewart and Son Auctioneers. But the coronavirus pandemic has pretty much halted in-person auction activity.</p>
<p>Woodrow Wilson was the country’s 28th president when Mr. Stewart was born and he got first got a taste of auctions as a youngster in the late 1920s when he skipped school to watch horse sales at his grandfather’s farm near his Brush Valley, Indiana County.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart says his grandfather had him clean out the stalls with the hope it might discourage him from skipping school to attend auction but it didn’t work.</p>
<p>“I always wanted to be an auctioneer,” Mr. Stewart said, “but it took me a little longer than expected.”</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart held a series of jobs to provide for his family during his late twenties after a stint in the Army during World War II and getting married in 1945. It kept him from becoming an auctioneer until 1952. He specialty has been farm sales, real estate and personal estate auctions.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart says being an auctioneer takes dedication and attention to detail. He explains you have to enjoy working with a variety of people and keep everyone happy while being honest and trusted by both buyers and sellers.</p>
<p>Charlie Stewart has worked with his father for decades. He laughs when he explains, “he taught me.” But Mr. Stewart’s son also is quick to say that his father has always been a stickler on details and could be difficult to please at times at auctions they ran.</p>
<p>Many of Stewart’s stories bring a smile to his listeners’ faces, especially if you are a regular at home and farm auction events. Mr. Stewart and his son told me they recall selling a piece of furniture at a home auction in Clymer, Indiana County, maybe 20 years ago where the owner, a woman and the last of her family, had moved to assisted living and her nephews hired Mr. Stewart to sell the contents of the home that already had been auctioned.</p>
<p>“Two of my staff brought out a dresser from the home,” Mr. Stewart said, “and it looked very old. The owner probably knew how valuable it was but didn’t tell her nephews.”</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart explains the dresser turned out to be a Soap Hollow chest made in Somerset County in the mid-1800s and brought $12,000 at auction back in 2000. Mr. Stewart laughed when he told me, “The guys who carried it out of the house were afraid to move it after it sold as it was so valuable.”</p>
<p><strong>All in the family</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Stewart was oldest of three children and grew up in the Brush Valley west of Armagh where he moved with his wife Ann in 1945. He still lives independently with some support and also is fortunate to have his family in the area including his daughters Judy and Linda as well as son and auction partner Charlie, daughter-in-law Barb as well as seven grandchildren and six great grandchildren.</p>
<p>Barb Stewart thinks she has heard almost all of Mr. Stewart’s stories and one of her favorites is a sale in Home, Indiana County, she helped Mr. Stewart and Charlie run, about 25 years ago.</p>
<p>“Everyone had to park in a field below the country road level,” she said. Before the sale was finished they were soaked in a huge thunderstorm, and no one could get their vehicle out of the field. A neighbor arrived with a tractor,” she continued, “and pulled everyone out but charged them for the tow and we’re still smiling about that.”</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart and his wife worked side by side on the auction circuit for decades until she passed away in 2000. Charlie Stewart said his parents always took him to many Indiana County farm auctions when he was a youngster and the farmers kept an eye on him while his parents ran the sale</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart has worked with Charlie for years, and now, also with Charlie’s daughter, Erin, who became a licensed auctioneer in 2019. Erin was sponsored by Mr. Stewart and worked with him and her dad for several years including auctioneering at 30 sales in one year before being licensed. Her parents say of their three children it was Erin who had the bug to be an auctioneer and although she has a full-time job, she helps out when she can.</p>
<p>Charlie Stewart has plenty of Stewart and Son auction stories, too. He remembers a sale in Marion Center where his dad, as he had always done, arranged for someone to sell refreshments to buyers who can be on-site for hours and are always are looking for a snack. “Well, Pete,” says Charlie, “hadn’t realized he had asked two groups to set up but was glad he did as both organizations sold all their food and drink before the end of the day.”</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart also fondly remembers a regular auction-goer who purchased barn picks and farm items for years. After he passed, his family had to rent a building so Mr. Stewart could sell off his collection.</p>
<p>“He had so much stuff,” Mr. Stewart recalls, “we actually had to run 19 separate sales over months to sell it all.” And he added, “The family also found multiple plastic Tide detergent bottles he had lined up in his barn and everyone thought they all were empty and just trash, but were pleasantly surprised when they discovered they were filled with spare change that totaled hundreds of dollars.”</p>
<p>The Stewart auction office, now in Armagh, was located for some 50 years in Indiana Borough, because in the mid-1960s lawyers, tired of hunting Mr. Stewart down to arrange an auction sale, just rented him an office in the business district.</p>
<p>During his career, Mr. Stewart served as a member of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania Auction Board for 25 years, was voted Auctioneer of the year in 1977 and received the Auctioneer Hall of Fame Award in 1994.</p>
<p>He has given back to his profession and community in many ways, serving on local regional and state auctioneering and real estate associations and volunteering to do charity sales for many organizations including the American Red Cross, the Salvation Army, the Lions and the Boy Scouts. As a volunteer with the Fire Company in the 1950s, he purchased a Ford fire engine for them when they needed a new vehicle and then sold $5 shares in the community so the fire company would own the equipment.</p>
<p>Mr. Stewart is a lifelong member of the Armagh United Methodist Church and he and Charlie have never run auctions on Sunday as they both felt it was a day for church and spending time with family, daughter-in-law Barb says.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Stewart and Charlie explain with the ups and downs of the economy, the auction business isn’t getting any easier but it is ingrained in Pennsylvania culture and is not going away. Mr. Stewart said, it is a profession he always has enjoyed and God willing, he is looking forward to continuing with Charlie and Erin as long as he can.</p>
