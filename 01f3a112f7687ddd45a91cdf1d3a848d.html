<p>It’s never too early to start planning a pierogi pig-out, right? Especially when said binging involves a trip to an iconic Pittsburgh amusement park.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Pierogi Festival is heading back to <a href="https://www.kennywood.com/" target="_blank">Kennywood Park</a> in West Mifflin on Sept. 27. In celebration of another day that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside — Valentine’s Day —&nbsp;it is offering some special bling for early purchasers when tickets go on sale at 6 a.m. Friday.</p>
<p>Along with an official Pierogi Festival T-shirt, the first 100 people to buy tickets also receive an official pierogi hat and festival bag that will be handed out at the main gate at the festival.&nbsp;The next 900 people to buy will get early bird pricing of $19.99 for ages 13 and up and $9.99 for ages 3-12 through April 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After April 12, advance tickets will cost $24 for adults ($28 at the door) and $12 for kids. Children 2 and under are free. That’s the same price as last year’s festival, which drew nearly 6,000 people.</p>
<p>This is the seventh year for the annual fest, which started relatively tiny at South Shore Riverfront Park in 2013. It runs from 1 to 6 p.m., and parking is free.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Guests will see the return of the Pierogi Pinching Contest, which last year drew dozens of participants from across the region. There also will be live music, vendors selling pierogi-inspired merchandise, a pierogi toss, opportunities to “Paint Your Own Pierogi” and appearances by Pittsburgh celebs and the famed Pittsburgh Pirates’ racing pierogies.</p>
<p>Ticket holders also will be able to ride a half-dozen classic Kennywood rides along with food from The Potato Patch and Swhinery Barbeque Co.</p>
