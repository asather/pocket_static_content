<h1>Forearm tightness forces Keone Kela from Friday’s game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It's just forearm tightness, Pirates manager Derek Shelton insisted after Friday's 7-2 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at PNC Park.</p>
<p>Minutes earlier, Shelton had walked to the mound and removed his closer, Keone Kela, from the game just five pitches into an appearance.</p>
<p>“[Kela] just had some forearm tightness, and I was erring way on the side of safety because of where we're at this year," Shelton said.</p>
<p>Kela showed an obvious look of discomfort after delivering a pitch to right fielder Brock Holt. Catcher John Ryan Murphy came out to the mound before head athletic trainer Bryan Housand also checked on Kela.</p>
<p>In a matter of seconds, Kela walked toward the Pirates dugout.</p>
<p>"I didn't even really give him the option," Shelton said. "When I got to the edge of the mound and he said, 'I tightened up a little bit,’ I just took the ball from him and said, 'OK.’ ”</p>
<p>After missing about a month due to a lengthy bout with COVID-19, Kela made his first appearance of the season on Aug. 13 in Cincinnati. He pitched again on Tuesday and has looked excellent.</p>
<p>Losing Kela would be a substantial blow to the Pirates. Not necessarily to their record (5-17), but Kela remains their most marketable trade chip for the Aug. 31 deadline.</p>
<p>As for the Pirates bullpen situation, that's another discussion.</p>
<p>They've lost Michael Feliz and Nick Burdi for the year to arm injuries. Kyle Crick is out with a right lat muscle strain. With Edgar Santana suspended, the group is extremely thin.</p>
<p>That's another reason why Shelton wanted to play it safe with Kela, who endured a pair of arm-related injuries last season.</p>
<p>“He just tightened up,” Shelton said. “Sometimes guys tighten up, and for the overly cautious, that's probably on me just because of the fact that we've lost five relievers, he's so important to us, and he's just coming back to pitch."</p>
