<h1>2020 WPIAL boys basketball playoff forecast</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 6A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:&nbsp;</strong>Zach Rocco, Penn-Trafford (23.7); Ryan Meis, Bethel Park (22.6); Ethan Morton, Butler (22.6); Jake Hoffman, Mt. Lebanon (21.2); Devin Carney, Butler (19.9).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Butler first, Fox Chapel second, Mt. Lebanon third, Upper St. Clair fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Butler. The Golden Tornado will get its first title since 1991 and fourth in school history. The others were in 1912, 1914 and 1915. Butler has unquestionably the best player in the WPIAL in Ethan Morton, a 6-6 senior point guard and Purdue recruit who impacts a game in many ways. Morton and Carney make for possibly the best one-two backcourt punch in the WPIAL. But the keys for Butler might be the shooting of Mattix Clement and how well Butler defends.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> One of the biggest question heading into the WPIAL pairings meeting Tuesday night was where Fox Chapel would be seeded. The Foxes were given the No. 2 seed, despite a 15-point loss to Upper St. Clair Friday. Upper St. Clair is No. 4. ... Mt. Lebanon, the defending WPIAL champion, lost two of its final three games, but point guard Blaine Gartley didn’t play in the final two games because of a concussion. The Blue Devils need him at full strength. ... Upper St. Clair is playing as well as any team and it will be interesting to see how much the Panthers’ pressure defense affects teams. USC’s 3-point shooting also has been lethal to many opponents. ... Central Catholic is a sleeper team. The Vikings own wins against Mt. Lebanon, Penn Hills and Pine-Richland.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 5A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Mekhi Reynolds, Shaler (23.2); Rodney Gallagher, Laurel Highlands (23.0); Deamontae Diggs, McKeesport (20.8).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Penn Hills first, Chartiers Valley second, Mars third, Thomas Jefferson fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Mars. The Planets have a player unlike any other in the WPIAL in 6-7, 290-pound senior Michael Carmody, a Notre Dame football recruit who is averaging 18.6 points and 18.9 rebounds. But the play of guard Zach Schlegel might be the biggest key for the Planets.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> Penn Hills is obviously capable of winning it all. Free-throw shooting in close games could be a major factor for Penn Hills. ... Chartiers Valley rolls into the playoffs on a 12-game winning streak. The Colts don’t have much of an inside game and shooting well from the outside will be essential to postseason success. ... Shaler is a team to watch, but the Titans lost some traction in the past few weeks, losing six of their final eight. ... How will Laurel Highlands fare in the postseason with freshman phenom Gallagher?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 4A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Mike Wells, New Castle (21.1); Devin Whitlock, Belle Vernon (20.5); Luke Wyvratt, Ringgold (19.5); Billy DeShields, Uniontown (19.1).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Highlands first, Knoch second, Quaker Valley third, Uniontown fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Quaker Valley. After losing to New Castle in the past three title games, this could finally be the Quakers’ year, despite a youthful team (three sophomores start).</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> It’s hard to pick against a New Castle team that has won six WPIAL titles in eight years. The Red Hurricanes are only 15-7, but could coach Ralph Blundo have some postseason magic again? ... Highlands has a seasoned team and certainly has the makings of winning the second title in school history. Watch Knoch, which tied Highlands for a section championship. ... Can Uniontown find playoff success? The Raiders won a section title for the 10th time since 2003, but they have advanced past the quarterfinals only once since then.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 3A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Cam Polak, Steel Valley (31.3); C.J. Cole, McGuffey (25.6); Riley Comforti, Southmoreland (23.1); Chauncie Mickens, Carlynton (20.6).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Lincoln Park first, North Catholic second, South Allegheny third, Seton LaSalle fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> North Catholic. It’s looking like North Catholic and Lincoln Park will play for the Class 3A title for the third time in four years. North Catholic averages 79 points, tops in the WPIAL during the regular season.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> South Allegheny is one of the most intriguing teams in the WPIAL playoffs. The Gladiators are 21-1 and won a section title for only the second time in school history. But are they championship caliber? South Allegheny gives up only 45 points a game. ... Washington and Charleroi tied for a section title, but it seems like few give either team much of a chance at winning it all. ... Steel Valley’s Polak is the second-leading scorer in the WPIAL, but he needs some help if the Ironmen are to win a playoff game or two.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 2A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Jake DiMichele, OLSH (29.0); Demitri Fritch, Springdale (24.6); Dante Spadafora, OLSH (22.8); Langston Moses, Winchester Thurston (22.1), Malik Smith, Sto-Rox (20.0); Klay Fitzroy, Apollo-Ridge (19.9).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Our Lady of the Sacred Heart first, Sto-Rox second, Jeannette third, Springdale fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Our Lady of the Sacred Heart. The Chargers are a heavy favorite to win their second consecutive title. The guard tandem of DiMichele and Spadafora are a handful for defenses.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> Springdale won a section title for the first time since 1993 and Fritch is a 6-4 point guard who averages a double double and could carry the Dynamos to some playoff success. ... Jeannette and Sto-Rox are peaking. Sto-Rox has won 13 in a row and Jeannette 14 of 15.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>CLASS 1A</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Leading scorers:</strong> Kaden DiVito, Cornell (20.8); Enzo Fetsko, Geibel (19.3); Isiah Langston, Cornell (18.6); Matt Stanley, Union (18.3).</p>
<p><strong>Top seeds:</strong> Vincentian first, Bishop Canevin second, Cornell third, Greensburg Central Catholic fourth.</p>
<p><strong>Winner will be:</strong> Vincentian. The Royals seem to have everything to win a second title in three years. They have outscored opponents by an average of 72-51.</p>
<p><strong>The scoop:</strong> While Vincentian seems to be just about everybody’s favorite, the Royals are not unbeatable. Cornell proved that Friday when it defeated the Royals, 66-57. ... Nazareth Prep certainly can’t be overlooked. Nazareth Prep beat Vincentian in last year’s title game and lost to Vincentian by only two and three points this season. ... Bishop Canevin and Greensburg Central Catholic could make some playoff noise also.</p>
