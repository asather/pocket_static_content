<h1>Pennsylvanians filing jobless claims over the phone in a pickle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Need to file for jobless benefits in Pennsylvania? You’d better have internet access.</p>
<p>The crush of new unemployment claims triggered by the state’s COVID-19 lock down has overwhelmed call center lines, with some residents complaining about taking weeks to get through.</p>
<p>But for people without access to the online system, there’s no other option than to keep calling. And the predicament is maddening.</p>
<p>One Pittsburgh area resident said she estimates she’s hit the redial button some 5,000 times trying to connect.</p>
<p>“The number is constantly busy,” she said in a voice mail message earlier this week. “Like many people out there, I don’t have a computer at home and do not have a smartphone and use the library for internet access. But the libraries are shut down right now.”</p>
<p>“If you can’t sign up for benefits, you don’t get paid that week,” she said. “I have missed the last two weeks.”</p>
<p>Officials at the Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry said Friday they “understand the anxiety that workers are feeling during this unparalleled time.”</p>
<p>An unprecedented 1.3 million workers have filed for jobless benefits statewide in the nearly four weeks since Gov. Tom Wolf ordered non-essential businesses to close to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The labor department is working as fast as possible to process applications “while also protecting the health of our employees through social distancing and teleworking,” officials said.</p>
<p>To speed up the claims process and get help to people more quickly, the department has temporarily eliminated the one-week waiting period to qualify for benefits and dropped the normal job search requirements.</p>
<p>In typical times, it takes about two to four weeks for applicants to receive their first unemployment check, “but it is possible that delays may be occurring,” the department said.</p>
<p>The department declined to say whether it was considering expanding the hours for its call centers — which are closed on weekends and have abbreviated hours on Wednesdays and Fridays.</p>
<p>Employees from other areas of the labor department began training on Friday to help in the call centers, and some retired workers are scheduled to rejoin the department on Monday, officials said. “Additional state agencies will also be helping us in the near future,” the department said.</p>
<p>In addition, the department is looking to hire at least 100 people to beef up its claims staff.</p>
<p>In the meantime, anyone who is able to apply for benefits online — at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">www.uc.pa.gov. </a>—&nbsp; is being urged to use that route.</p>
<p>“It’s the fastest and easiest way,” officials said. “This also allows us to reserve the phone lines for people who do not have computer/internet access and for non-English speakers who need to speak directly with a representative.”</p>
