<h1>Concerning threats: Mike Pompeo wrong to accost ICC personnel </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the midst of a national emergency that has imperiled economic stability and public health, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo found time recently to threaten the families of International Criminal Court staff.</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo, angered by an ICC probe into alleged war crimes committed by U.S. military personnel in Afghanistan, identified ICC investigators by name during a March 17 news conference and threatened punitive measures against them and their families if the inquiry continues.</p>
<p>“We want to identify those responsible for this partisan investigation and their family members who may want to travel to the United States or engage in activity that’s inconsistent with making sure we protect Americans,” Mr. Pompeo said.</p>
<p>The United States has had a contentious relationship with the ICC since it began operations in 2002. Across three presidential administrations, the U.S. has not yet formally recognized the court’s validity. In fact, the George W. Bush administration helped push a bill through Congress in 2002 called the American Service-Members’ Protection Act, which declares that the U.S. government has the unilateral authority to invade the Hague in the Netherlands, home to the ICC, if any U.S. citizen or ally is tried in the court.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has also been hostile to the ICC. In 2018, he told the United Nations that the ICC has “no jurisdiction, no legitimacy and no authority,” and that he would “never surrender America’s sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable, global bureaucracy.”</p>
<p>A refusal to recognize the ICC as a matter of policy is one thing. Agree with it or not, the U.S. government is well within its rights to object to the institution of the ICC and reject its attempt to claim jurisdiction over U.S. military personnel.</p>
<p>But for the secretary of state to threaten the staff of an intergovernmental organization, and their families, is as unbecoming of a high-level government official in a Western democracy as it is unproductive. Who is served by such petulant theatrics?</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo need not approve of the ICC’s investigation, but he should respect judicial independence and refrain from scattershot threats that undermine his credibility.</p>
