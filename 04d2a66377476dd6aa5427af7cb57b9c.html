<p>SALT LAKE CITY — State and local governments across the U.S. have obtained more than 30 million doses of a malaria drug touted by President Donald Trump to treat patients with COVID-19, despite warnings from doctors that more research is needed.</p>
<p>At least 22 states and Washington, D.C., secured shipments of the drug, hydroxychloroquine, according to information compiled from state and federal officials by The Associated Press. Sixteen of those states were won by Mr. Trump in 2016, although five of them, including North Carolina and Louisiana, are now led by Democratic governors.</p>
<p>Supporters say having a supply on hand makes sense in case the drug is shown to be effective against the pandemic that has devastated the global economy and killed nearly 200,000 people worldwide, and to ensure a steady supply for people who need it for other conditions like lupus.</p>
<p>But health experts worry having the drug easily available at a time of heightened public fear could make it easier to misuse. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday warned doctors against prescribing the drug for treating COVID-19 outside of hospitals or research settings because of reports of serious side effects, including irregular heart rhythms and death among patients.</p>
<p>It’s the latest admonition against the drug Mr. Trump mentioned 17 times in various public appearances, touting its potential despite his own health advisers telling him it is unproven.</p>
<p>The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent 19 million doses of hydroxychloroquine to 14 cities including Washington, D.C., Philadelphia and Baltimore from the federal government’s national stockpile, a source that also provided South Dakota and California with supplies.</p>
