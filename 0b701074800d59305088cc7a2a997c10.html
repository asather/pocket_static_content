<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kanye West says he’s running for president. It’s not clear if the musician is serious, or if this is a publicity stunt for himself or a project unrelated to the presidency.</p>
<p>West’s Saturday night tweet instantly went viral, picking up more than 100,000 retweets within the first hour;&nbsp;“Kanye” quickly became the No. 1 trending term on Twitter in the U.S.</p>
<p>By Sunday evening, it had over 1 million likes and half a million retweets.</p>
<p>If West really is serious about running, there is a long list of hurdles that would be nearly insurmountable for most candidates — most obviously, starting a campaign from scratch in July, just four months prior to the election.</p>
<p>He would need to qualify for ballot access across 50 states and the District of Columbia, as well as build a presidential-grade political organization from scratch, all without the support of a party infrastructure.</p>
<p>At the moment, West doesn’t appear to have filed forms with the Federal Election Commission to run for office, according to a Bloomberg review of FEC data.</p>

<p>West, 43, has talked about running for president for years; last year, he told an audience he’d run for president in 2024. He and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, have worked with President Donald Trump a number of times, particularly on the release of some prisoners. West controversially donned a red “Make America Great Again” hat for a meeting with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office in 2018.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the retweets continued to pile up, pointing to the celebrity couple’s influence in entertainment and business.</p>
<p>A week ago, Gap Inc. shares surged the most in at least 40 years after it revealed a partnership agreement with the rapper and designer. West, whose sneaker line with Adidas routinely sells out, will work with the struggling apparel company on a new line for men, women and kids called Yeezy Gap.</p>
<p>Three days later, Coty Inc. — the owner of Max Factor and Covergirl — reached an agreement to buy a 20% stake in Kardashian West’s beauty business for $200 million, valuing the business at $1 billion. West, who told Mr. Trump the Adidas deal made him a billionaire, also promptly crowned his reality TV star wife with the same status following the deal.</p>
<p>Tesla Inc. CEO Elon Musk, who previously supported former Democratic candidate Andrew Yang, quickly said he was on board with Kanye 2020: “You have my full support!” he replied to West’s tweet.</p>
