<h1>You can now watch KDKA news live on your phone, computer or streaming TV</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KDKA-TV became the latest station to join ViacomCBS’s ranks of direct-to-streaming news services today. The new, over-the-top venture will allow its Western Pennsylvania audience to stream the newly branded CBSN Pittsburgh content via the internet, with live streams of regularly scheduled newscasts and breaking news coverage.</p>
<p>The station’s library of local news content also will be available on demand online through CBSN, on CBSNews.com and the CBS News apps for mobile and connected TV devices. There will also be content through <a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/" target="_blank">CBSPittsburgh.com</a> and the CBS Local app for mobile.</p>
<p>“The concept of appointment viewing? This is not for that. [This] is for what you want to watch when you want to watch,” said Adam Wiener, executive vice president and general manager for CBS Local Digital Media.</p>
<p>CBS Television Stations and CBS Interactive had recently launched CBSN Denver, the seventh of ViacomCBS’ 13 local stations. Previous markets, beginning in 2018, were New York City, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, Minnesota and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>KDKA news director Kathy Hostetter said five full-time staffers were hired for the launch. “They come from all walks of life&nbsp;— traditional television broadcasting, one who came over from radio, I’ve got a couple others who I would categorize as ‘digital natives.’</p>
<p>“Having a diverse pool of skills and mindsets, all local, really helps push through a hyper-local digital streaming service.”</p>
<p>Hostetter joked that the new CBSN Pittsburgh crew has been dubbed “The Stream Team,” adding with a laugh “We even got them T-shirts.”</p>
<p>But some specifics have yet to be announced, including who is on the new team, who might be anchoring expanded news coverage, how many hours of “new” news might be accessed, or even what will constitute a “new” news product.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of ways you could slice and dice that,” Hostetter said. “We produce, in a normal Monday-to-Sunday week of live broadcasting, 60-plus hours of local content. So it’s safe to say we will be passing [a lot] through a live stream environment.”</p>
<p>Current broadcast fare such as “Nightly Sports Call” on the CW would also be available through the new service.</p>
<p>The CBSN content is ad-supported and will complement CBSN, CBS Sports HQ and ET Live content. New CBSN markets in the coming months will include Chicago (late March), Dallas-Fort Worth, Miami, Sacramento and Baltimore. It will also be available to those with a subscription to CBS All Access.</p>
<p>“We are excited to broaden the reach of the station’s award-winning news coverage by launching CBSN Pittsburgh — a service that makes our premium local news content available to consumers whenever and wherever they want to watch,” Peter Dunn, president, CBS Television Stations said in a statement.</p>
<p>After downloading the CBS Local app, users are asked to choose their market. Before the launch, the “Pittsburgh” content mirrored the station’s website. By clicking “Watch Now” on the app Wednesday morning, users could watch a live stream of Allegheny County executive Rich Fitzgerald introducing the new health director at a news conference.</p>
<p>With the launch of CBSN Pittsburgh, such content might eventually include more feature or sidebar coverage of issues ranging from COVID-19 to the NFL Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Chris Cotugno, vice president and general manager for KDKA-TV and CPCW-TV, said in a statement: “This is a landmark day for everyone at KDKA and The CW Pittsburgh as we launch this exciting new platform that provides viewers here in Western Pennsylvania and across the country with the high-quality journalism that has defined us for decades.”</p>
<p>With the April 28 Pennsylvania primary looming, “we are having discussions about what our election night coverage will look like in a CBSN ecosystem. It’s a new opportunity for us to certainly be there for people who are busy, who want content, on whatever flavor of device that might be, and on their own time,” Hostetter said.</p>
<p>She and Wiener both said the bar for breaking into programming on the streaming service is “lower” than for broadcast content. An example might be a primary candidate’s news conference as it happens&nbsp;— not just in Pittsburgh, but across the state.</p>
<p>“There’s no concern we’ll be breaking into ‘The Price is Right’ or a primetime broadcast,” Weiner said. “That’s sort of the beauty here.”</p>
