<h1>Pirates on pause: Logical targets with the No. 7 pick in the MLB draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>On Day 1 of Major League Baseball’s Winter Meetings this past December, Pirates general manager Ben Cherington made a fairly obvious statement — yet one worth noting now.</p>
<p><span>“It’s an area we’d like to keep improving our depth in,” Cherington said specifically of the catcher position, “both at the major league level and down below.”</span></p>
<p><span>Although the Pirates have since added Luke Maile and John Ryan Murphy, they’re hardly done, especially when it comes to infusing&nbsp;catching talent into the minor leagues. In fact, not a single one of their top 30 prospects according to MLB Pipeline plays the position.</span></p>
<p><span>Which is why, with the MLB draft now less than a month away, it’s a smart time to revisit that statement.</span></p>
<p><span>If the Pirates are going to target a catcher with the No. 7 pick in the first round, the guy they’ll want is Patrick Bailey, a 6-foot-2, 192-pound switch-hitter from North Carolina State.</span></p>
<p><span>Scouts like Bailey’s power potential. He also has a reputation for being a solid leader behind the plate, and he’s the rare college catcher who called his own game.</span></p>
<p><span>Offensively, Bailey has been trying to recapture what he did during a terrific 2018 season, when he led all ACC freshman in hitting (.321), total bases (113), slugging percentage (.604) and set a school record with 13 home runs. Bailey’s average (.288) dipped some as a sophomore, although he had nearly twice as many doubles (eight to 17) and walked at a better clip.</span></p>
<p><span>Taking Bailey at No. 7 might be prioritizing position over the best player available, which doesn’t really happen in baseball, although he definitely won’t last until the Pirates’ next pick, a compensatory choice at No. 31.</span></p>
<p>If the Pirates choose to wait, they could grab Dillon Dingler from Ohio State, a 6-3, 222-pound backstop who’s very good defensively (threw out 50% of runners trying to steal on him in college) and, again like Bailey, has the potential for more power.</p>
<p><span>Tyler Soderstrom from Turlock High School (Blake Cederlind’s alma mater) in California and Arizona (NCAA) product Austin Wells are technically ranked higher than Dingler, although there are questions about their ability to stay at the position.</span></p>
<p><span>What if the Pirates don’t target a catcher?</span></p>
<p><span>There are myriad options, especially if they want to pick up a college bat. One player they’ve been linked to quite a bit is Arkansas outfielder Heston Kjerstad, who has great size (6-3, 200) and projects as a future middle-of-the-order type.</span></p>
<p>Kjerstad, who would play either left or right, has slashed at least .330/.400/.550 each of his two full seasons and had six homers in 16 games before 2020 was cut short. Strikeouts (120 in 2018 and ’19 combined) remain an issue for Kjerstad, but he might have enough pop to render them meaningless.</p>
<p><span>Another name worth knowing is Nick Gonzales, a middle infielder from New Mexico State. Gonzalez slashed .432/.532/.773 as a sophomore and switched from second base to shortstop as a junior. Gonzales (5-10, 190) isn’t huge and lacks some power and arm strength, but he’s really good at most everything else.</span></p>
<p><span>West Allegheny’s Austin Hendrick was once mocked to the Pirates by Baseball America and could still be an enticing choice because of his power and bat speed; however, most newer mock drafts have another high school outfielder, Zac Veen from Spruce Creek High School in Florida, going ahead of Hendrick.</span></p>
<p><span>Although he likely won’t be a big power guy in the major leagues, UCLA outfielder Garrett Mitchell could be an intriguing choice. Mitchell has elite speed in center field and plenty of projectable tools, but at No. 7, he might represent something of a reach for the Pirates.</span></p>
<p><span>Pitching should also be an area on which to focus, though the top of the 2020 draft skews more toward college players. (The Pirates have taken a high school pitcher in the first or supplemental rounds in four consecutive drafts and in eight of the past 11.)</span></p>
<p><span>Given that all of their pitching prospects are right-handed, Louisville lefty Reid Detmers could make a lot of sense. Detmers pounds the zone and does so with a fastball that sits 90-91 mph and a curveball that features about a 20-mph drop.</span></p>
<p><span>Nevertheless, it’s a tremendous pitch for the 6-foot-2, 210-pound Detmers, who will turn 21 shortly after the draft and has been compared to Blackhawk product Brendan McKay.</span></p>
<p><span>Another option for the Pirates is Minnesota right-hander Max Meyer, who’s only 6-0, 185 pounds but might have the best stuff of any pitcher in this class. Meyer’s fastball comes in at around 97-98 mph, and he also has a slider that he can control, adding and subtracting velocity and hitting spots with it.</span></p>
<p>Meyer was a reliever in 2018 before becoming a starter for the Gophers in 2019, pitching to a 2.11 ERA with 87 strikeouts in 76 2/3 innings.</p>
<p><span>Detmers and Meyer are both enticing. The same as high school hurlers such as Mick Abel (Oregon) and Jared Kelley (Texas), hard-throwing bigger bodies that track with the type of pitcher the Pirates have drafted in recent years.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But if the Pirates want to add a position player prospect, especially a catcher, now might be the perfect time to do it.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING: </strong>Detmers had a program-record 167 strikeouts this past season (13.3 per nine innings) and tied Louisville’s school record for wins with 13.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>KNOW THIS: </strong>Bailey had a team-high six home runs when the season was stopped. Three were grand slams, which all came in an 11-day span. Also, two came in the same game, from different sides of the plate on Feb. 28 vs. Iowa. That was the second time in Bailey’s college career that he did that.</span></p>
<p><strong>HE SAID IT: </strong>“It’s certainly something that we pour a lot of resources into and that we care very deeply about. It’s incredibly important to our sustained, long-term success.” — Assistant general manager Steve Sanders on the MLB draft, which will be five rounds instead of its normal 40 this year because of COVID-19.</p>
