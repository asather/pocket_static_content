<h1>New AIU executive director begins tenure</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny Intermediate Unit’s new executive director began his four-year term this week as schools across the county work to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">Robert Scherrer</span>, who began his tenure Monday, takes over an agency that supports and&nbsp;provides specialized services to Allegheny County's 42 suburban school districts as well as non-public, charter and vocational-technical schools as they prepare to welcome back students for the first time since March.</p>
<p>“This school year will be unlike any other that we have experienced before,” Mr. Scherrer said in a statement. “The COVID-19 pandemic&nbsp;impacts every aspect of a school system. I look forward to working with education leaders throughout the&nbsp;county as we continue to coordinate our efforts on behalf of the children, youth and families whom we&nbsp;serve.”</p>
<p>Before Mr. Scherrer joined the AIU, he served as the superintendent and assistant superintendent for K-12 education at the&nbsp;North Allegheny School District.</p>
<p>He was also principal of the Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy and Allderdice High School&nbsp;in the Pittsburgh Public Schools, an&nbsp;assistant principal and co-principal for&nbsp;curriculum and instruction in the Woodland Hills School District, and an&nbsp;assistant principal&nbsp;at Peters Township High School.</p>
<p>He began working in education as a secondary educator at&nbsp;Baldwin High School in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District.</p>
<p>Mr. Scherrer received his superintendent’s letter of&nbsp;eligibility and a doctorate in administrative and policy studies from the University of Pittsburgh, where&nbsp;his dissertation focused on teacher evaluation. He&nbsp;earned his bachelor’s and master’s degrees in business education and his principal’s certification from Indiana University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;AIU board appointed Mr. Scherrer as the agency’s executive director in February.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
