<h1>Pitt mailbag: Are the Panthers' short rotations a cause for concern?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Nats in 7</strong>: Should there be any concern about the short rotation as the season goes on and players log a ton of minutes? Noticed Drumgoole got some run today, and although he didn't play great, at least it extends the bench a bit</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think so. The concern isn’t as great as it would have been, say, last season when three of the team’s four best players were freshmen who hit a wall at a certain point in conference play. This season, only one freshman, Justin Champagnie, is getting more than 10 minutes per game.</p>
<p>There’s a Pacific Ocean-sized gulf between what Jeff Capel knows about basketball and what I do, but I do question the wisdom of using a seven-man rotation in consecutive games, one of which went into overtime. In those two games, of a combined 85 minutes, Champagnie played 82 and Trey McGowens played 78. When those are occurring in just a 48-hour span, paired with a flight back from Miami late Sunday night, I think that has some kind of effect. Jeff Capel denied fatigue having a factor in Pitt losing a seven-point lead to Louisville in the final three minutes — and it may not have; it’s certainly not unheard of for the Panthers to go scoreless for several minutes — but it’s hard not to wonder if it might have.</p>
<p>If you’re feeling good about the way your team is playing and if that group is in a good rhythm, stick with it. There’s no reason to make changes to meet what might be an arbitrary quota. But with useful options there on the bench in Gerald Drumgoole and Abdoul Karim Coulibaly to eat a few minutes, especially as the former works his way back from an injury, there’s not much sense in limiting your options too much.</p>
<p><strong>Don</strong>: How many more wins does Pitt need to make the NCAA tournament?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’m of the belief it needs to finish the regular season with, at the very least, 19 — and even then, it will depend on who they’ve beaten. The Panthers have a couple of really nice wins in Florida State (13th in the NET) and Rutgers (18th), but they’re 71st in those rankings and have a decent amount of climbing to do, especially with losses to Nicholls State (178) and Wake Forest (108).</p>
<p>The other problem for them is that usually what would give a bubble team like them a boost — being in the ACC — isn’t exactly a hindrance this year, but it’s also not a huge help. The conference is down this year and, because of that, Pitt really only has two regular season chances left for top-20 wins: Jan. 28 at Duke and Feb. 18 at Florida State.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin</strong>: Is it better for this program to make the NCAA tournament as a 16-seed and be a one-and-done, or make the final four of the NIT and play in The Garden on national TV?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: If Pitt makes the NCAA tournament, it wouldn’t be as a 16-seed. As Georgia proved about 10 years ago, when it went 17-16 but won the SEC tournament and got a 14-seed, it’s basically impossible for a major-conference team to end up in such a spot. But I get your overall point: Is it better to be one of the tournament’s last inclusions or make the NIT final four?</p>
<p>Short of being guaranteed to win the NIT, I’ll always take the first option. Making the NCAA tournament is an invaluable experience for a young team and it does wonders for the perception of a program. Even if you lose your first game, I would venture to say you get more attention and viewers than you would in an NIT championship.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Has Jeff Capel adopted the Jamie Dixon offense, i.e., pass around the exterior for 20 seconds and then pray someone can make a shot before the shot-clock expires? BTW — Carl Krauser ran that offense better than anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: At times, it definitely seems like it. There can be a “Houston Rockets minus the analytics” quality to this offense at times, where a guy, usually McGowens or Xavier Johnson, dribbles around and tries to make a play late in the shot clock while his four teammates stand around. The problem for Pitt, of course, is that it doesn’t have James Harden in that scenario.</p>
<p>I will say, though, that in the past few games, I’ve noticed some better ball movement and more actions resembling a well-constructed offense — high ball screens, dribble handoffs (though the latter has been a pretty common thing for them throughout the season). I think there’s a level of trust that’s starting to build with this team offensively.</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: Why won’t the Oakland Zoo jump? Are millennials killing the cardio industry?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I don’t know why they’re not jumping, but I’m clear on this much — this generation is killing the cardio industry. Millennials, if we’re being honest, are killing everything. In fact, if you watch the Zapruder Film closely enough, you can see a guy with a man bun eating avocado toast and sipping a Kombucha firing a bullet at JFK.</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: Let’s talk travel. What are your favorite cities and countries you’ve visited?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’m a pretty easy guy to please, city-wise. Outside of Dallas and Buffalo, every major city I’ve visited in the United States I’ve generally liked. Even ones that people regularly rag on like Cleveland and Detroit I’ve enjoyed. My top 10, though, would probably be Seattle, New York, San Francisco, Boston, DC, Austin, Denver, Portland, Chicago and Atlanta, in no particular order. I haven’t traveled nearly as much internationally, but I’ve been to Colombia, Scotland and Ireland the past few years and loved them all. Edinburgh is easily one of my favorite places I’ve ever been.</p>
<p><strong>Werner:</strong> Is Weezer's cover of No Scrubs better than the original when you really think about it in its true context?</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Am I the only person who thinks Weezer ruined Toto’s “Africa”?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I haven’t listened to Weezer’s “No Scrubs” cover and, because of their cover of “Africa”, I probably never will.</p>
<p>You’re not the only person who thinks that, John. It’s terrible. If you’re going to do a cover of a song, go in on it. Mix it up and add your own twist to it. Sometimes, like it was with Jimi Hendrix’s “All Along the Watchtower”, it’s a lot better than the original. But if you’re just going to make it a carbon copy of the song you’re covering, just with better, more advanced production technology, why even do it? Also: Weezer is bad.</p>
