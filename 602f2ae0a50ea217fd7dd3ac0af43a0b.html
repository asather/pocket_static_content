<h1>Ex-Fish and Boat chief welcomes end to license fee dispute</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Pennsylvania anglers wait for Gov. Tom Wolf to sign off on the final language of a law that will change fishing license fees, one fisherman is particularly pleased.</p>
<p>John Arway, former executive director of the Fish and Boat Commission, was forced out of his job in 2018 following eight years of bickering with legislators over Fish and Boat funding. With the passage of House Bill 808, which is awaiting the governor's signature, the legislature finally approved a remedy that was on the table during Mr. Arway’s tenure.</p>
<p>The new law will allow Fish and Boat to set its own license and permit fees with legislative oversight and a sunset clause that will enable lawmakers to end the experiment without a vote if it doesn’t work.</p>
<p>When Mr. Arway took the helm in 2010, license fees had remained the same for five years. The agency is funded through fishing and boating license and permit fees, industrial leases on Fish and Boat properties and a federal excise tax on fishing supplies and boat fuel. State legislators provide no tax funding but set the license fees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“When I became executive director of the agency, I tried to diversify our funding portfolio by advocating for other sources of revenue to supplement license sales,” said Mr. Arway. “We were successful in getting $1 million annually from the Marcellus shale iImpact fees and a substantial increase in revenues from the gasoline tax for fuel used by motor boaters. However, we were unsuccessful in championing a major revenue increase which would carry the agency into the future.”</p>
<p>Services weren’t cut, but Fish and Boat staffing was reduced and major projects were dropped or left unfinished. Tensions between some legislators and Mr. Arway spilled into public view.</p>
<p>“A lot of members, Democrats and Republicans, don’t want to vote for something that would be considered a tax hike, even though it’s a user fee,” said Rep. Keith Gillespie, R-York, chairman of the House Game and Fisheries Committee. “When I took over at the Game and Fisheries Committee 5½ years ago, Fish and Boat had been something like 12 years without a license increase.”</p>
<p>In 2017, Fish and Boat commissioners ordered their executive director to trim $1 million from the agency’s $50 million budget. When Mr. Arway announced plans that would hamper the popular trout stocking program, a&nbsp;political catfight ensued resulting in Mr. Arway’s forced retirement.</p>
<p>With the former director out of the way, lawmakers passed the license fee agreement on June 29.</p>
<p>When the governor signs the bill as expected, the cost of an adult resident license will rise from $22.90, where it has remained since 2005, to $24.90 in 2022. Annual incremental increases of $1 will bring the fee to $27.90 in 2025.</p>
<p>The state Game Commission is in the same political bind. The 2020-21 hunting license year began July 1 with the adult resident license fee stuck at $20.90 since 1998.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of bad feelings between [some lawmakers] and the Game Commission over deer management, cash reserves and timber and mineral rights,” said Mr. Gillespie. “Those guys are top-notch people, they love what they do, they’re good at what they do. I hope now, out of fairness, that we can do something for them.”</p>
