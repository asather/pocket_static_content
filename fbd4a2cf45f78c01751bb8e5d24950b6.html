<h1>Duquesne suspends professor who used racial slur in class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Duquesne University professor seen on social media using a racial slur in class “in a pedagogical sense” has been placed on paid leave pending a campus investigation, officials said Friday.</p>
<p>The school’s education dean, meanwhile, issued an apology.</p>
<p>The professor, Gary Shank, was seen and heard in a pair of videos posted to Twitter, each under a minute, interacting with at least one student during a remote session. In it, the professor brings up the N-word. A student who posted the video said it was from a Wednesday session of an educational psychology class.</p>
<p>In one video, Mr. Shank says, “I’m giving you permission to use the word, OK? Because we’re using the word in a pedagogical sense. What’s the one word about race that we’re not allowed to use?”</p>
<p>After being greeted with silence, he adds, “I’ll give you a hint. It starts with ‘N.’ ... It’s even hard to say, OK? But, I’ll tell you the word, and again, I’m not using it any way other than to demonstrate a point. Fair enough?”</p>
<p>In a separate video clip, Mr. Shank says, “When I was a young man, all right, that was a very commonly used word.” He offers an example of how the word was used in his youth and asks his student, “Could we do that nowadays?” After a voice on the video says “no,” the professor offers another example and repeats the question.</p>
<p>The student who posted the video to Twitter, Marcanthony Peters Jr., is a Duquesne sophomore in business management who said he is a friend of the student who took the video and sent it to him. That individual, who is in the class, did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>“I honestly didn’t know what to think,” Mr. Peters said via a Twitter direct message Friday night. “I was involved in a situation last year and a white student called me the N-word. And now a professor is saying it &amp; encouraging students to say it during class comfortably ....”</p>
<p>Gabriel Welsch, a Duquesne spokesman, said late Friday that the professor as of Friday was not teaching. “As this is a personnel matter, further specifics cannot be discussed, but another professor is taking over the course,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Shank could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>Mr. Welsch shared content of a letter that School of Education Dean Gretchen Generett sent to students after she learned of the incident.</p>
<p>“I am writing this afternoon to let you know that I am aware of what transpired in your class yesterday and to offer my sincere apologies to you for what you experienced,” the dean wrote.” I learned about this incident from students who emailed their adviser. I am also aware that a student emailed the professor directly.”</p>
<p>She thanked the students for coming forward to share “the troubling and disturbing language that was used by your professor in class.</p>
<p>“To be clear, I believe that there is never a time, pedagogically or otherwise, for a professor to create a hostile learning environment,” Ms. Generett wrote. “ I know this from my experience as a student, a professor, and now as Interim Dean of the School of Education.</p>
<p>“Using the ‘N word’ or seemingly encouraging students to use that word is not in keeping with the mission of the University, the School of Education, or the Pennsylvania Department of Education,” she added.</p>
