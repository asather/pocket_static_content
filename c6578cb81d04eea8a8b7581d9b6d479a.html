<h1>Pine-Richland's Jeff Ackermann expected to be new Baldwin basketball coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Baldwin High School boys basketball program has never won a WPIAL championship. The man likely to be the team’s new coach has five titles.</p>
<p>Jeff Ackermann is leaving Pine-Richland and is expected to be Baldwin’s new coach. The Post-Gazette has learned that Ackermann has been offered and accepted the Baldwin job, but his hiring is not official until the school board approves it at a meeting Wednesday.</p>
<p>It is a notable coaching move because Ackermann has an impressive resume, including three WPIAL championships at Moon and two at Pine-Richland. He also won a PIAA title at Moon.</p>
<p>Ackermann could not be reached for comment, but parents of Pine-Richland’s players were informed of Ackermann’s departure Friday afternoon by Pine-Richland athletic director Sean Simmons. Ackermann also sent text messages to his players about his move.</p>
<p>Ackermann has been Pine-Richland’s coach the past six seasons and had a 126-35 record. He won WPIAL Class 6A championships in 2006-17 and lost in the 2018 final. His 2017 team also made it to the PIAA championship game before losing to Reading.</p>
<p>Before Pine-Richland, Ackermann was Moon’s coach for 13 seasons and was 224-116. Besides winning three championships (Class 3A) at Moon, Ackermann’s team also lost in the 2008 Class 4A title game to Central Catholic.</p>
<p>But Moon opened Ackermann’s position in 2014, and Ackermann then got the job at Pine-Richland. Ackermann’s career record in 19 years is 350-151.</p>
<p>Ackermann’s move to Baldwin might surprise some because Ackermann will be going to a program that has won one WPIAL playoff game in the past 35 years. But geography may have played a role in his decision. Ackermann lives in the South Fayette school district and teaches at Chartiers Valley High School. Baldwin is closer to his home and also his teaching job than Pine-Richland. In the past, Ackermann had said it was about a 45-minute drive from his home to Pine-Richland High School.</p>
