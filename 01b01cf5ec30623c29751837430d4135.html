<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne Light Co. brought a different sort of power to hundreds of families earlier this month.</p>
<p>Employees&nbsp;— including president and CEO Steve Malnight — delivered more than 200 boxes of food to senior citizens throughout Allegheny County via the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.</p>
<p>In Monaca, Beaver County, DLC bought 300 meals as volunteers helped with <a href="https://www.faithrestorations.org/" target="_blank">Faith Restorations</a>’ weekly food distributions.</p>
<p>“We’re here to help our neighbors most in need as the region recovers from the pandemic,”&nbsp;Mr. Malnight said in a statement. “Together, we will bring Pittsburgh back.”</p>
<p>Mr. Malnight was among the company volunteers who delivered boxes of food on May 19. DLC’s company-wide fundraising campaign donated $60,000 to the <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/" target="_blank">Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank</a>,&nbsp;including $20,000 from corporate.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.duquesnelight.com/" target="_blank">Duquesne Light</a> has always been such a great partner of ours and we’re thankful to them and their employees for once again coming together during this crisis to help our neighbors,” said Lisa Scales, Food Bank president and CEO.</p>
<p>Rachel Pittman-Triscila, director of the pantry at Faith Restorations, was also grateful.</p>
<p>“This has been a trying time. Our organization has been amazed at the support we have been given from the community as we are serving families in need,” she said.</p>
