<h1>Pittsburgh may be yellow, but Downtown foot traffic and transit ridership is still light</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Most kids are taught that red means stop and yellow means go slowly, and judging by the foot traffic and transit ridership in Downtown on the first Monday of the yellow phase, adults are following that rule, too.</p>
<p>No lunch crowds formed in Market Square for the noon rush; in fact, just under 20 people milled about the popular spot at the beginning of the hour.&nbsp;No tables or chairs were set up. No long lines trailed out of Chipotle, Starbucks, DiBella’s or Noodles &amp; Company. Vallozzi’s Italian restaurant and Bluebird Kitchen just around the corners remains closed.</p>
<p>But some signs have business owners seeing a sliver of hope.</p>

<p>Rick Conley, the owner of Oliver Flower Shop on Sixth Avenue, sold his first over-the-counter bouquet since March 12.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A&nbsp;regular customer came in and bought fresh flowers,” said Mr. Conley, who’s keeping the door locked and letting people in one at a time.&nbsp;“... We just put the [door]bell up over the weekend."</p>
<p>For the past several weeks, he’s been&nbsp;doing internet and phone sales for birthday and sympathy arrangements, but sales are down and there’s “not much funeral work,” he said.</p>
<p>Ray Conley, 37, of the North Side grabbed a bag from the takeout window at Smithfield Street’s Wiener World.</p>
<p>Mr. Conley — a security guard at the nearby Centre City Tower, and no relation to&nbsp;Rick Conley — said he’s worked every day of the shutdown and is just now beginning to see people come into the building.</p>
<p>“As far as today, we're starting to see a little bit of traffic, but it's mainly for people who are making appointments for foot doctors or dentists. There hasn't been a lot of traffic for our tenants returning yet," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By his estimates at the takeout window, Wiener World owner Dennis Rick said, “There’s about 10% of the [normal] population in town.&nbsp;We opened last week, and we're maybe at 20% at where we would normally be."</p>
<p>At roughly 11:45 a.m. he’d had about only five customers so far.</p>
<p>“We could've been open the whole [shutdown] time, but obviously you get to a point of diminishing returns. We're in Downtown, and if no one's Downtown, we have no business," he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ridership numbers from the Port Authority of Allegheny County won’t be available until next week, said spokesman Adam Brandolph, but&nbsp;“ridership was observed to be pretty light” on Monday when the authority&nbsp;restored several routes to regular weekday service.</p>
<p>Laura Wiens, head of the advocacy group Pittsburghers for Public Transit, said that organization’s COVID-19 commuter survey reveals a&nbsp;“very good indicator” of who will continue using public transit regardless of red, yellow or green status.</p>
<p>“It’s great that they’re restoring service frequency to nearly normal levels, but that doesn’t help on the routes that are already crowded,” she said, noting that the 51, 48, 91 and 87 have been heavily used during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because of social distancing rules on the bus, some commuters have reported being passed up, she said.</p>
<p>Most riders waiting at stops for those outbound routes in Downtown during the 5 o’clock hour reported that the yellow phase didn’t affect them much because, shutdown or not, they had to go to work regardless.</p>
<p>Just before 6 p.m. on the outbound Steel Plaza T platform — full on a normal day — two people waited for the light rail train, a lawyer who had popped into work to grab case files and an IT specialist for a financial services company who reports to the office every Monday.</p>
<p>This Monday was “a little bit different” for Vaughn Schmid, 48, of Castle Shannon.</p>
<p>“Usually I would say there’s four or five people on the T, but [this morning] maybe there was a dozen,” he said.&nbsp;“I’m sure it will start picking up, but I imagine a lot of companies will be cautious and not want to bring people back in regardless of what the status or color is.”</p>
<p>For those who’ve been parking for free in town, the city announced that meters will be enforced beginning Wednesday.</p>
