<h1>Five things to know about the Steelers' Week 1 opponent, the New York Giants</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Steelers open their 2020 season against the New York Giants on Monday night at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. Here are five things to know about the NFC East squad that struggled in 2019.</em></p>
<p><strong>Saquon Barkley has been as advertised —</strong>&nbsp;The former Penn State standout hasn’t been able to save his team from turmoil, but his production has been stellar. In two seasons, he’s rushed for 2,310 yards with a gaudy 4.8 yards per carry average and 17 touchdowns on the ground. Add 1,159 yards and six touchdowns through the air and he’s proven he can be dangerous pretty much any time that he’s on the field. The only thing that’s slowed him down was an ankle sprain that cost him three games in 2019. With a full slate, though, he should be right back up among the rushing leaders in 2020 after first challenging this Steelers defense.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Jones has taken over —</strong>&nbsp;Eli Manning is gone after nearly two decades and two Super Bowl wins for Big Blue. Now the former first-round pick is in charge after posting promising numbers in 2019 — 3,027 yards, 24 touchdowns and 12 interceptions with a completion percentage of 61.9 and a passer rating of 87.7. Not going to blow you away by any means, but certainly competent. Now Giants fans are hoping for more. How much will his coaches allow him to push his limits, especially early in the season against a defense as good as the Steelers? That remains to be seen, but don’t take this second-year signal caller lightly.</p>
<p><strong>Looking for more from Golden Tate —</strong>&nbsp;The former standout receiver with Detroit was limited in his first season with the Giants, first by a four-game suspension for performance-enhancing drug use and then by a concussion that cost him a fifth game. In the games he did play, he averaged 61.5 yards per game and scored six touchdowns. Not bad, but the Giants are probably hoping he can build on that by being on the field for a full season. If Jones takes a step forward, look for increased production from Tate to be a reason why. Darius Slayton is also a target worth mentioning. He actually led the team in 2019 with 740 yards and 8 touchdowns.</p>
<p><strong>Leonard Williams is still around —</strong>&nbsp;The former Pro Bowler with the Jets was traded across MetLife Stadium at midseason in 2019. The Giants subsequently signed him to a lucrative franchise tag tender in the offseason, so he has a lot to play for in the year ahead after notching just a half sack a year ago. He should bolster a pass rush that was led mostly by linebackers; Markus Golden led the team with 10 sacks, while Oshane Ximines added 4.5.</p>
<p><strong>Pass defense is shoddy, run defense is better —</strong>&nbsp;Teams were able to throw pretty much at will against this team last year. The unit yielded 264.1 passing yards per game, a worse mark than all but four teams in the NFL. The secondary also wasn’t very good at forcing turnovers, notching just 10 interceptions all season. It’s a key reason New York ranked dead last in turnover margin. Up front, things were a bit better, with opponents gaining an average of just 113.3 yards per game on the ground. That put the Giants around mid-pack.</p>
