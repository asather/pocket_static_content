<p>Authorities on Thursday arrested a man who allegedly threatened to blow up a state office building and get himself “gunned down by the police.”</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon police stopped the suspect’s vehicle, a white Mercedes sedan, on Washington Road near Woodhaven Drive and took him into custody without incident. Police said the vehicle contained several weapons and components that could be used to make explosive devices.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Bomb Squad removed and secured the items.</p>
<p>The suspect’s name has not been released. Whitehall police Thursday afternoon issued a bulletin warning of the individual, and said he posted threats to the CIA headquarters in Washington.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the FBI are involved in the investigation.</p>
