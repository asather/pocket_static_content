<h1>Penguins welcome Nick Bjugstad back to practice in Los Angeles</h1>

<p>LOS ANGELES — The ice was awfully crowded Thursday when the Penguins took the ice for their practice at Toyota Performance Center. It was borderline chaos as players zigzagged around while getting loose before the practice.</p>
<p>Why? The Penguins welcome two more players back to practice, including Nick Bjugstad, the big center who hasn’t skated with the team since November.</p>
<p>Bjugstad has not played since Nov. 15. He underwent core muscle surgery a few days later. The Penguins estimated then that he would be out at least eight weeks. He had been skating in mid-January but was scaled back for undisclosed reasons. He got back on the ice on an individual basis more than a week ago.</p>
<p>Bjugstad has played just 10 games this season, putting up just one point. In 32 games with the Penguins last season, he tallied nine goals and 14 points.</p>
<p>Bjugstad wore a big grin and a white non-contact jersey during the practice Thursday.</p>
<p>The other player returning to practice was Jared McCann, who did not play in Wednesday’s 2-1 loss to the Los Angeles Kings due to an upper-body injury. The forward, who sat out Tuesday’s practice, started in a red non-contact jersey but changed into a normal-colored jersey about 20 minutes into practice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, injured defensemen Brian Dumoulin and John Marino took a step forward in their comebacks. Both were in normal-colored jerseys, signifying that both of them have been cleared to practice without contact restrictions.</p>
<p>Both Dumoulin and Marino returned to a team practice setting Tuesday. For Dumoulin, it was his first practice in nearly three months following a gruesome ankle injury that required surgery Dec. 1. Marino has been sidelined since taking a slap shot to the face Feb. 6 and undergoing surgery four days later.</p>
