<h1>Gov. Wolf can't extend eviction moratorium, asks Legislature to act</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has said he cannot legally extend <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/07/09/Governor-Wolf-continues-moratorium-on-evictions-and-foreclosures-through-Aug-31/stories/202007090137" target="_blank">a statewide eviction moratorium — set to expire Monday</a> — and has asked legislators to keep people in their homes by extending the moratorium and improving a program aimed at getting funds to struggling renters and landlords.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, given my authority under the Emergency Services Management Code, an executive order further extending protections from foreclosure and eviction is not a viable option. Any further relief must be a product of the Legislature,” Mr. Wolf, a Democrat, wrote in a letter to legislators Monday. Both the state House and Senate have Republican majorities.</p>

<p>Housing advocates, citing the ongoing public health crisis of the COVID-19 pandemic and the need to get federal financial assistance to renters, had hoped the moratorium could be extended. Advocates have warned the combination of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/08/21/July-jobless-rate-payrolls-rise-as-Pennsylvania-seeks-aid/stories/202008220034" target="_blank">double-digit unemployment</a> and the end of an enhanced unemployment benefit a month ago could cause a spike in evictions during a time when people are still supposed to be at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>A program to distribute $150 million in federal aid to Pennsylvania renters and landlords has received thousands of applications since it started accepting them in July, but has been slowed by issues such as large numbers of incomplete applications, many applicants not having access to computers or printers, and a $750 monthly limit on rent relief, according to a report earlier this month from the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency, which oversees the program.&nbsp;An additional $25 million is available for homeowners who need help avoiding foreclosure.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf's letter said problems with the legislation that set up the program are preventing aid from reaching those in need.</p>
<p>“The expiration of the moratorium would be less significant if the programs established to assist renters and homeowners in Act 24 were functioning as intended to provide payment assistance. Unfortunately, there are a number of provisions of the legislation that are creating significant administrative and programmatic challenges for the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Authority, which is charged&nbsp;with administering the program," Mr. Wolf wrote.</p>
<p>Among the issues he highlighted — the $750 monthly cap on assistance “has proven too low for landlords to go through the process necessary to participate in the program.” The program requires applications from both landlords and tenants.</p>
