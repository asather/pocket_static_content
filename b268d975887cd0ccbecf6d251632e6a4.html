<h1>Penguins on pause: Chad Ruhwedel proves to be dependable option during time of need</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Chad Ruhwedel entered training camp buried on the blue-line depth chart.</p>
<p>Four righties were ahead of him in Kris Letang, Justin Schultz, Erik Gudbranson and John Marino. A fifth, Zach Trotman, was breathing down his neck, challenging for one of the last spots on the NHL roster.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How quickly things change.</p>
<p>Marino emerged. Gudbranson was traded. And just about everyone on the roster got injured.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So while it took until the 22nd game of the season for Ruhwedel to even earn a jersey on game night, the confluence of events opened the door for the 29-year-old defenseman to play in 41 of the final 48 games.</p>
<p>Injuries on the blue line were the most significant factor in Ruhwedel’s expanded role. Letang, Schultz, Marino and lefty Brian Dumoulin missed a combined 83 games — several of them overlapping. During these injury-plagued stretches, the Penguins could have fallen apart. Ruhwedel was one of the reinforcements who helped the team weather the adversity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, Ruhwedel is not Letang. He’s not going to dazzle with skill and offensive instincts. In total, he recorded six points (two goals, four assists) and plus-4 rating. However, for a player who makes just $700,000 a year, he added more value to the Penguins this season than his salary-cap hit would indicate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He was basically what the Penguins needed out of a third-pairing defenseman this year. Not spectacular. But more than just solid.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> It’s hard to come up with one singular defining moment for Ruhwedel. But that’s kind of the point. His value to the Penguins was that he often went unnoticed, which is usually a good thing for a defenseman.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Ruhwedel set a career benchmark in 2017-18 by playing in 44 games. Had the season not been suspended, there was a chance he could have matched or eclipsed that mark.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins defensive corps is finally healthy. Marino and Dumoulin had both played in the last five games before the season was suspended. The break should provide even more time for them to get healthy. That will almost certainly bump Ruhwedel to the press box, at least for now.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Ruhwedel is signed through the 2020-21 season on a deal that carries just a $700,000 average annual value. His usage next year depends largely on how the Penguins choose to address their blue line this offseason. Should the Penguins choose to let Schultz walk as an unrestricted free agent, Ruhwedel could see even more playing time unless the team looks outside the organization for another righty.</p>
