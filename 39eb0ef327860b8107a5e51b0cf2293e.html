<h1>Steelers linemen David DeCastro, Maurkice Pouncey replaced in Pro Bowl</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you tune in for the Pro Bowl in a couple weeks, you won't see any Steelers offensive linemen paving the way for the AFC.</p>
<p>Right guard David DeCastro and center Maurkice Pouncey will not play in the all-star game Jan. 26 in Orlando. Both were included in an NFL announcement of injury replacements, with DeCastro being replaced by Cleveland’s Joel Bitonio and Pouncey by Indianapolis’ Ryan Kelly.</p>
<p>DeCastro was one of three offensive linemen to start all 16 games for the Steelers in 2019, while Pouncey missed Week 17 with a knee injury. It’s unclear what DeCastro’s injury is, but he also sat out last year’s Pro Bowl. DeCastro last played two years ago, but has been selected five seasons in a row.</p>
<p>Safety Minkah Fitzpatrick, defensive lineman Cam Heyward and linebacker T.J. Watt are the other Steelers representatives in the game. Rookie linebacker Devin Bush is an alternate.</p>
<p><strong>Futures contracts</strong></p>
<p>For the third day in a row, the Steelers signed a player to their offseason roster. Thursday, it was second-year safety John Battle, a three-year starter at LSU. The 6-foot, 201-pound Battle spent his rookie training camp with the Jets, then last season on the Tampa Bay practice squad.</p>
<p>Wednesday, the Steelers signed wide receiver Anthony Johnson to a reserve/futures deal. Johnson, who’s 6-2, 220 pounds, went undrafted last year despite posting back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons his final two years at Buffalo. He spent last season on the Chargers practice squad.</p>
<p>Tuesday, the Steelers brought back former Pitt star Darrin Hall to their running back equation. Hall had two brief stints on their practice squad in 2019 but was waived Nov. 12.</p>
<p><strong>No more Mularkey</strong></p>
<p>Former Steelers tight end Mike Mularkey, better remembered as the team’s offensive coordinator from 2001-03 under Bill Cowher, announced his retirement Thursday. Mularkey spent this past season as the tight ends coach in Atlanta, his only stop after spending 2016 and 2017 as head coach of the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>Mularkey, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., native who turned 58 in November, was the Steelers tight end coach for five seasons before being promoted to offensive coordinator. From there, he became Buffalo’s head coach but resigned after the 2005 season after two years with the Bills. He also was Jacksonville’s head coach in 2012 but was fired after one 2-14 campaign.</p>
<p>“I’ve been blessed to do this for a long time and have a lot of great memories from the game I love,” Mularkey said in a statement through the Falcons. “I’ve also missed a lot of time with my family who I love and who has supported me so much throughout my career. I am looking forward to spending even more time with them and making even more memories.”</p>
