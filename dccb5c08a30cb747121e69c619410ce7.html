<h1>Man acquitted in Wilkinsburg massacre ordered detained on federal gun charge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal magistrate judge on Monday ordered Cheron Shelton, recently acquitted in the killing of five people in Wilkinsburg, to be detained pending trial on a gun charge that is likely to send him to a U.S. prison.</p>
<p>U.S. Magistrate Judge Lisa Pupo Lenihan said Shelton will remain locked up as a danger to the community and as a flight risk.</p>
<p>Shelton, 33, is under indictment for possession of a rifle and ammunition by a felon. Prosecutors on Monday filed images of the weapon and bullets as court exhibits.</p>
<p>An Allegheny County Common Pleas jury <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">acquitted him on Feb. 14 in the mass shooting at a Wilkinsburg cookout</a> in 2016 that left five dead and three injured. Charges against his co-defendant, Robert Thomas, were dismissed.</p>
<p>Shelton has a 2010 drug conviction in state court. As a felon he canâ€™t have guns or ammo. Federal agents and police said he had both.</p>
<p>During the murder investigation, police searched Shelton's mother's house in Homewood and found a .22-caliber rifle and the ammunition.</p>
<p>Shelton was taken into custody for receiving stolen property, since the gun was reported stolen, and later charged with the murders.</p>
<p>The rifle seized is not the murder weapon, which police believe was an assault rifle.</p>
