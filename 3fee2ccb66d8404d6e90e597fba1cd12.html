<h1>Port Authority ridership remains low despite easing of COVID-19 restrictions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Although Port Authority ridership has been&nbsp;“very slow” to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the agency plans to return its light rail system to full service Monday and buses to full service Aug. 23.</p>
<p>The agency had cut service by about 25% at the start of the pandemic in March, but last month returned 39 bus routes to full service with reduced rider capacity to allow social distancing. Another 32 commuter and rapid routes and the light rail system remained on reduced service.</p>

<p>With Gov. Tom Wolf placing Allegheny County in the least restrictive green phase of virus restrictions last week, Chief Development Officer David Huffaker told an authority committee Thursday he was interested to see what would happen with ridership. The green phase allows people to return to work but encourages working from home when possible.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been a huge difference in ridership, Mr. Huffaker said. Bus ridership, which had been down more than 80% compared to last year on some days, continues to be down about 70%.</p>
<p>Ridership on the light rail system has been even worse, down about 80% now compared to down 90% at its low point.</p>
<p>“There was a small recovery [on light rail], but not as much as on the bus side,” he said.</p>
<p>However, the agency plans to resume its full light rail schedule on Monday because it has been getting complaints that cars have too many riders to allow for social distancing. The agency is limiting cars to 25 riders.</p>
<p>Spokesman Adam Brandolph said all routes will be operated with one-car trains. Rush-hour routes usually have two-car trains in the morning and afternoon.</p>
<p>For buses, the agency plans to return to full service on Aug. 23, assuming it has the staffing for its vehicles. Dozens of employees have been off duty for sickness, child care or health care reasons due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Huffaker said the agency continues to talk with large employers and work with planning groups in Downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland to encourage ridership and promotions to draw people to the neighborhoods. It remains&nbsp;“the big unknown” when workers will return to their offices, he said.</p>
<p>When they do, Mr. Huffaker said, he is&nbsp;“pretty excited” about the authority’s role in reopening the economy.</p>
<p>“Frankly, I think transit is the thing that’s going to help restart the economy,” he said.</p>
<p>Right now, though, the agency still has buses that pass riders because they have reached their limited capacity, which drew concern from Laura Wiens, executive director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit. Mr. Huffaker said the authority is “somewhat limited” in addressing that issue due to staffing, but he said he expects to introduce a new app in the next week or so to help riders know when a bus may have to pass their stop without picking up riders.</p>
