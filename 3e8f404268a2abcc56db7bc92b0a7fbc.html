<html><head><title>Superior Court faults order in Scaife trust fund case</title></head><body><p>In a five-year-old case involving the fortune of the late billionaire publisher Richard Mellon Scaife, the state Superior Court this week delivered a procedural victory to three trustees attempting to defend their handling of an emptied trust fund.</p><p>Writing for three members of the court, Judge Mary Jane Bowes found that a lower court judge made a mistake when she ordered the trustees to turn over legal communications to the son and daughter of Mr. Scaife.</p><p>The decision pushes the discovery dispute back to the Allegheny County Orphans Court. Since-retired Judge Kathleen Durkin had decided that the trustees must turn over legal communication to David and Jennie Scaife, but her replacement must now review the disputed documents and decide which of them are rightfully shielded from discovery.</p><p>The case, initiated by David Scaife and Jennie Scaife in 2014, has been otherwise largely on hold for a year while the Superior Court reviewed the discovery dispute. The decision may allow the case, which has potential nine-figure implications, to move forward.</p><p>Jennie Scaife died in 2018, but her personal representative, David Zywiec, is pursuing the case.</p><p>The case involves a fund set up for Richard Mellon Scaife by his mother, Sarah Mellon Scaife, in 1935. She dedicated it to supporting her son's welfare, with the balance to go to his children.</p><p>There was, however, nothing left for Jennie Scaife and David Scaife upon the publisher’s 2014 death. The vast bulk of the $450 million withdrawn from the fund over 20 years was used to support the Tribune-Review media properties.</p><p>The son and daughter seek to show that trustees H. Yale Gutnick, James M. Walton and PNC Bank wasted the trust fund assets, at least in part because Mr. Scaife wanted to “disinherit his children,” as Judge Bowes put it in her 17-page decision. In their effort to prove that, the son and daughter subpoenaed documents from Mr. Gutnick’s former firm, Strassburger McKenna Gutnick &amp; Gefsky, and other firms involved with Richard Mellon Scaife’s estate, and received 39,000 pages.</p><p>The son and daughter wanted more documents, but the trustees argued that those were shielded by attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, which exempts from discovery documents created in preparation for litigation. Judge Durkin ruled in favor of the son and daughter, ordering the firms to provide the documents.</p><p>The Superior Court ruled that Judge Durkin mistakenly concluded that the trustees had waived their objections to disclosure of the documents. The court also found fault in the judge’s conclusion that a decision in another estate case was applicable to this situation. And the court found that the judge should have agreed to review the disputed documents in private before deciding whether they are discoverable — a process which it said “is warranted.”</p><p>Judge Durkin has been replaced by Bruce Beemer. The docket in the trust fund case does not yet indicate the reassignment of the matter.</p><p><em>Rich Lord: rlord@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1542 or Twitter @richelord</em></p></body></html>
