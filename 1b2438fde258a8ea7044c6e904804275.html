<h1>Trump defense team questions Hunter Biden’s role in Ukraine amid intensifying push for witnesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Hours after a bombshell report led some Republican senators, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, to consider a deal for witnesses in President Donald Trump’s Senate<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/27/White-House-lawyers-Donald-Trump-impeachment-trial-US-Senate/stories/202001270047" target="_blank"> impeachment trial</a>, the White House defense team on Monday turned their focus to Hunter Biden.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s defense lawyers argued Mr. Biden defied long-standing conflict of interest and corruption concerns when he joined the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that company.</p>
<p>The lawyers sought to show senators that Mr. Trump’s interest that Ukraine announce an investigation into Burisma for corruption was — rather than targeting the son of a political opponent — rooted in legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>“What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for millions of dollars?” asked Eric Herschmann, an attorney for Mr. Trump. “Nobody has ever investigated why.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden had few, if any, qualifications to oversee operations at an oil and gas firm, Mr. Herschmann added. “He did have one qualification: He was the son of the vice president of the United States,” he said.</p>
<p>Monday’s presentations were praised by many Senate Republicans who spoke with reporters during breaks in the trial. Yet the defense team’s tactics added another wrinkle in a looming battle this week over whether to call witnesses and issue subpoenas for documents.</p>
<p>Support for witnesses grew after a report in The New York Times on Sunday. The Times reported a draft copy of an upcoming book from John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, stated the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s hold on that military aid, along with delaying a coveted White House meeting, was at the center of the impeachment inquiry launched by House Democrats last September. The House voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two charges: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>House Democrats asserted Mr. Trump betrayed U.S. national security interests by pressuring the American ally to interfere in the 2020 presidential election. The former vice president is running for the Democratic nomination to face Mr. Trump in November.</p>
<p>Democrats have been calling for Mr. Bolton to testify for months. Mr. Bolton — who left the Trump administration days before the surfacing of the whistleblower report that sparked the impeachment inquiry — has direct knowledge of the president’s motivations in Ukraine, Democrats have argued.</p>
<p>Setting the ground rules for the trial last week, Senate Republicans voted down Senate Democrats’ numerous attempts to call any witnesses until both sides presented arguments and senators finished a round of questioning.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton’s draft manuscript, which was not independently viewed by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, appeared to sway some key Republican senators on Monday. Four Republican senators would have to join the 47 Senate Democrats in approving a measure.</p>
<p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said in a statement on Monday that Mr. Bolton’s disclosure “strengthens the case” for the Senate to call witnesses.</p>
<p>“I’ve always said that I was likely to call witnesses, just as I did in the 1999 Clinton trial,” Ms. Collins stated. She added she would make a final decision later.</p>
<p>Another key senator, Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said it’s “increasingly likely” Republican senators would vote to call witnesses. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, are also coming under pressure.</p>
<p>Michael Steele, former chair of the Republican National Committee, tweeted at all four Republican senators that “it’s time to keep faith with the American people and call for witnesses.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Republican Sen. Pat Toomey floated the idea of a “one-for-one” deal on witnesses, meaning Democrats could call Mr. Bolton and Republicans could choose a witness to call. The proposal was first reported by The Washington Post.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s office declined to comment on the report. In a statement on Monday, Mr. Toomey said he “will make a determination regarding the need for additional witnesses — including Ambassador John Bolton — after the president’s lawyers make their presentation and senators have had a chance to pose questions.”</p>
<p>If Republicans wind up calling witnesses, Hunter Biden could be the focus.</p>
<p>White House lawyers on Monday laid out years of news reports — and some witness testimony from the House impeachment proceedings — that questioned the appearance of Hunter Biden’s board seat while Burisma was under investigation for money laundering and other crimes.</p>
<p>Pam Bondi, an attorney for Mr. Trump, showed the testimony of one witness, a diplomat who has served during the Obama and Trump administrations, who raised concerns to the former vice president’s office in a February 2015 phone call.</p>
<p>George Kent, deputy assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, told House investigators he told the office Hunter Biden’s role “could create the perception of a conflict of interest.” The Ukrainian oligarch who owned Burisma “stood out for his self-dealings,” Mr. Kent testified.</p>
<p>“Every witness who was asked about Hunter Biden’s involvement agreed there was a potential appearance of a conflict of interest,” Ms. Bondi said.</p>
<p>After the presentation, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said Mr. Trump was “entirely justified” in pushing Ukraine to investigate Burisma. Though Mr. Cruz does not think witnesses are necessary, he said, “at a minimum, the most important witness for the Senate to hear from is now Hunter Biden.”</p>
<p>Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., said “we will decide Friday on witnesses” and that it could “be a group of individuals.”</p>
<p>Other Republicans suggested the whistleblower could be called.</p>
<p>If Senate goes down the road of calling witnesses, “you gotta go all the way to the end,” said Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, who has advised the president’s impeachment defense. “And that would be to call the whistleblower that started this whole thing.”</p>
<p>Though the news surrounding Mr. Bolton’s book commanded the media spotlight, White House lawyers on Monday largely ignored it.</p>
<p>Kenneth Starr, who led the investigation that spurred the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, lectured senators for more than an hour that this impeachment inquiry is unprecedentedly unfair, in part because House Democrats did not allege Mr. Trump committed a crime.</p>
<p>Mr. Starr, now an attorney for Mr. Trump, said senators should weigh the unusual partisan nature of Mr. Trump’s impeachment proceedings and the “grave disruption” an impeachment would bring in an election year.</p>
<p>The Senate “would do well to guide the nation to return to our country’s traditions when presidential impeachment was truly a measure of last resort,” Mr. Starr said.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats said Mr. Starr, by arguing senators should be impartial, inadvertently made their case for more information.</p>
<p>“The president’s lawyers continue to make the case for witnesses and documents,” said Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. “What’s a court without witnesses and documents?”</p>
<p>“The case for witnesses became ever stronger last night,” Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., in a video posted to Twitter during a trial break he recorded with his Senate floor neighbors, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, and Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn.</p>
<p>“I feel like we’re in an alternative universe sitting in there,” Ms. Klobuchar said, saying there are “game-changing revelations” in Mr. Bolton’s manuscript.</p>
