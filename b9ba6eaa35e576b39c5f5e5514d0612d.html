<h1>Matt Murray gets the nod in net for Penguins-Canadiens Game 2</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Asked to evaluate goalie Matt Murray’s performance following Game 1, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan summed it up simply by saying “solid.”</p>
<p>Solid enough to earn a start in Game 2? It appears so.</p>
<p>Sullivan announced on Monday morning that his two-time Stanley Cup-winning goalie will again appear in net when the puck drops at 8 p.m. against Montreal.</p>
<p>Murray made 32 of 35 saves in Game 1. Could he have been better? Sure. He was too deep in his net on several occasions, and his rebound control was problematic. Clearly, Carey Price’s sensational first period proved he was the best goalie on the ice. But when is he not?</p>
<p>At the same time, none of the goals Murray allowed could be considered soft. He’s not the reason — or even probably in the top three reasons — the No. 12-seeded Canadiens lead the best-of-five series 1-0 even though they were the last team to qualify for the Eastern Conference postseason.</p>
<p>The Penguins goalie dynamic has been a hotly debated issue this season. There was certainly an argument for starting Tristan Jarry in Game 1. He’s a first-time All-Star whose stats were better than Murray over the course of the entire season.</p>
<p>But if Sullivan wanted to go with Murray to start the playoffs, there wasn’t enough wrong in Game 1 to completely abandon that course. Sullivan seems to think so, too.</p>
<p>The bigger issues lie in a broken power play that went just 1-for-7 and a failure to get to the front of the net to disrupt Price’s sight lines. More Patric Hornqvist, who played the second-fewest minutes of any Penguin on Saturday, might help solve both of these problems.</p>
<p>The challenge of a shortened, five-game series is that there isn’t a lot of time or margin for error. While this is an unprecedented situation and a shortened series that no one has even been part of, the Penguins veteran corps has the benefit of experience. They’ve been through rough series that came unhinged, and they’ve fought back from early deficits on the way to winning the Cup.</p>
<p>Murray can be included in both camps, as someone who hoisted the Stanley Cup twice as a rookie but also started all four games of last year’s debacle against the New York Islanders.</p>
<p>“It’s a series,” Sullivan said. “It’s not a one-game scenario.”</p>
<p>“We’re a forward-thinking group. We’re going to try to learn from the experience we went through in Game 1. When the puck drops tonight, we’re going to have to make sure we stay in the moment.”</p>

<p><strong>Top line management</strong></p>
<p>On a top-heavy Canadiens roster, the top line does most of the heavy lifting. Tomas Tatar (61 points), Phillip Danault (47) and Brendan Gallagher (43) combined for nearly 44% of the 346 points tallied by Habs forwards in the regular season.</p>
<p>At points this season, the Penguins have decided to play their tight-checking fourth line against the opponent’s strength. That didn’t happen at all in Game 1.</p>
<p>Instead, Sullivan chose to go strength vs. strength with this matchup, playing mostly Sidney Crosby’s line against Danault and Co. They kept this top line off the scoreboard and held the Canadiens’ leading scorer, Tatar, to zero shot attempts.</p>
<p>“They’re a very good line,” Sullivan said. “They’re a good 200-foot line. They play on both sides of the puck. They defend hard. They’re competitive guys. I thought the guys that were on the ice against them did a pretty good job.”</p>
<p><strong>Managing Marleau?</strong></p>
<p>No active player in the NHL has skated in more games than Penguins 40-year-old forward Patrick Marleau. But in Game 1? No Penguin played less.</p>
<p>Skating on the third line centered by Jared McCann, Marleau tallied just 11:15 at even strength and no minutes on special teams. Asked if he was trying to be “careful” about the way he used the veteran, Sullivan squashed that idea.</p>
<p>“I’m not trying to be careful about the way I use Patrick Marleau,” Sullivan said. “He’s a hell of a player. It was more about how the game played out and the amount of special teams that took place.”</p>
<p><strong>Stick infractions</strong></p>
<p>The NHL referees evidently missed using their whistles over the pause. Over the first two days of games, stick infractions seem to be a particular point of emphasis during special teams-heavy contests.</p>
<p>“It’s something we always talk about with our team, just our stick discipline,” Sullivan said. “Certainly, it’s something that we’ll continue to discuss.”</p>
