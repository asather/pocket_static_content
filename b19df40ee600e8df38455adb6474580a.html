<h1>Pennsylvania deer torture suspects charged in Jefferson County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Charges were filed Friday against a Jefferson County man and a teen who recorded videos of themselves torturing a wounded and immobile white-tailed deer. Images from the Nov. 20 incident went viral on social media and the story was carried by news organizations worldwide.</p>
<p>Alexander Brock Smith, 18, and a 17-year-old male, both of Brookville, each face two felony counts of aggravated animal cruelty and two felony counts of conspiracy to commit aggravated animal cruelty, as well as additional misdemeanor and summary counts. Mr. Smith is the stepson of the Brookville police chief. The 17-year-old is being charged as a juvenile.</p>
<p>The charges were filed by the Pennsylvania Game Commission, which led the investigation with the assistance of state and local police. Jeff Burkett, Jefferson County district attorney, said in a statement that the public questioned the length of time taken to complete the investigation.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this case has generated a large amount of public outcry,” Mr. Burkett said. “People have assumed that officers have been dragging their feet when, actually, the opposite is true. They have put a lot of hard work in on this case in order to present the case for prosecution. I commend the Pennsylvania Game Commission for their efforts in this matter.”</p>
<p>Tim Layton, Game Commission president, said the time taken to investigate the incident was necessary.</p>
<p>“It’s easy to understand why people were outraged by the incident,” he said. “But the worst-case scenario would have been rushing the investigation and heading into court with a case that wasn’t as strong as it could have been.”</p>
<p>In separate interviews, the defendants confirmed they had been hunting together Nov. 30 in a tree stand on property in Jefferson County owned by Mr. Smith’s family. The juvenile shot and wounded the buck, then missed with a follow-up shot. Video was taken while the deer was immobilized, then shared through the messaging app Snapchat. A recipient of the video saved it and contacted the Game Commission.</p>
<p>In the video, two teens appear to kick the deer in the face, step on its legs and rip out its antlers, all while it was still alive but unable to escape because it had been shot.</p>
<p>Bryan Burhans, Game Commission executive director, said many messages about the incident were posted on the agency’s Facebook page, including those from hunters who were outraged by the actions depicted on the video.</p>
<p>“Hunters care deeply about wildlife,” Mr. Burhans said in a statement. “Hunters are taught at an early age to hunt ethically, to be respectful of the game they hunt, the property upon which they hunt and other hunters.”</p>
<p>Mr. Smith faces 11 charges, including aggravated cruelty to an animal, tampering with evidence and corruption of a minor. He was arraigned before District Judge Gregory M. Bazylak and released on $50,000 unsecured bail. He faces up to seven years in prison, up to $15,000 in fines and multiple years of hunting license revocation if convicted.</p>
<p>Ten charges filed against the teen were to be sent to juvenile court. He was charged with aggravated cruelty to an animal and tampering with evidence. As a minor, he faces penalties to be determined in the juvenile court system, as well as multiple years of hunting license revocation.</p>
