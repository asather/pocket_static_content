<h1>Pitt plans phased-in reopening for students with 'shelter-in-plan' requirements</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>First-year students arriving on the University of Pittsburgh campus in Oakland and returning upperclassmen will be required to shelter in place for 14 days before attending in-person classes, according to a new COVID-19 reopening plan from the university.</p>
<p>As an added safety measure, the university said it will be testing up to 400 students a day to help monitor the “prevalence of the virus” before any on-site classes take place.</p>
<p>Students will begin arriving on the main campus Aug. 11 — about 1,500 at a time —&nbsp;as part of a “phased arrival approach” developed by the university’s&nbsp;COVID-19 Medical Response Office in consultation with its Healthcare Advisory Group, according to university officials.</p>
<p>But before they arrive, students living in Pitt dormitories are being told to shelter in place for seven days — and then for another seven days once they’re on campus.</p>
<p>For example, a student whose move-in date is Aug. 13 would need to shelter in place at their permanent residence starting Aug 6 and would shelter in place on campus until Aug. 20, the university said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Some students will be able to attend an in-person class earlier than others” and “we anticipate&nbsp;some students having to start classes remotely in their permanent residence before coming to campus,” the university said.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if or how the university planned to enforce the shelter-in-place plan.</p>
<p>About 29,000 students attend classes on Pitt’s main Oakland campus, and&nbsp;about 6,000 of them live in residence halls, according to university data.</p>
<p>Last month, Pitt said a&nbsp;“significant portion” of freshmen<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/25/University-Pitttsburgh-hotels-COVID-19-students-dorms-residence-trustees-Pitt/stories/202006250105" target="_blank">would be living in hotel rooms</a> as a way to reduce density in the dorms and best guard against infection. The hotels were expected to be within a 15-minute walk of campus.</p>
<p>Pitt said residence staff will plan safe social activities for students sheltering for their second seven-day period.</p>
<p>Students living off campus are required to shelter in place for 14 days — either at home or at their off-campus residence —&nbsp;before coming onto campus.</p>
<p>“Students are encouraged to coordinate these plans with their room or housemates to align as closely as possible,” the university said.</p>
<p>Pitt officials said they consider the move-in changes&nbsp;“a worthwhile trade-off and estimate that — barring any strategic pauses — all Pittsburgh campus students should be moved into university housing by Aug. 31.”</p>
<p>Pitt plans to hand out face coverings to students, faculty and staff once they return to campus, and has installed hand sanitizing stations throughout campus in an effort to keep transmission at bay.</p>
<p>The university also said it will have testing available in coordination with its UPMC partnership, if any student develops COVID-19 symptoms. Results will be available within 24 hours.</p>
<p>And in the event students test positive, the university said it has prepared “isolation facilities” at each of its campuses so those infected will be separated from others for up to 14 days.</p>
<p>Pitt officials said the reopening plan may be revised, while noting that&nbsp;more information about “close” contract tracing, isolation, quarantining and campus travel guidelines will be released over the next few weeks.</p>
