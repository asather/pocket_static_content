<h1>Virus death toll in China rises to 56 as U.S. prepares evacuation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The death toll from a new virus in China has risen to 56 with 1,975 total cases reported, as China’s leader called the accelerating spread of the disease a grave situation.</p>
<p>The figures reported Sunday morning cover the previous 24 hours and mark an increase of 15 deaths and 688 cases.</p>
<p>The government also reported five cases in Hong Kong, two in Macao and three in Taiwan. Small numbers of cases have been found in Thailand, Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Vietnam, Singapore, Malaysia, Nepal, France and Australia.</p>
<p>Canada said it discovered its first case, the man is his 50s who recently flew from Wuhan to Guangzhou, China, and then on to Toronto.</p>
<p>The U.S. Consulate in Wuhan will evacuate its personnel and some private citizens aboard a charter flight Tuesday.</p>
<p>A notice Sunday from the embassy in Beijing said there would be limited capacity to transport U.S. citizens on the flight that will proceed directly to San Francisco.</p>
<p>It said that in the event there are not enough seats, priority will be given to to individuals “at greater risk from coronavirus.”</p>
<p>French automaker PSA Group says it plans to evacuate its expatriate employees and their families from Wuhan.</p>
<p>PSA Group tweeted on Saturday that the employees will be quarantined in another major city in China, before they are brought back to France.</p>
<p>Sophia Shek, 42, of Hong Kong, said life in her city over the last week has been “pandemonium.” Long lines snaked through stores to purchase supplies and some retailers have taken advantage of the crisis by hiking prices to as much as $60 a mask, she said. Friends asked her to stock up and bring back face masks and other short supplies when she returns from Chicago.</p>
<p>She said she is anxious about the virus and traveled only because the trip was for work. “I experienced SARS,” she said of the similar coronavirus that killed 774 people and infected more than 8,000, most of them in China, in 2002 and 2003. “This new virus is dormant so you don’t know if the person next to you has it.”</p>
<p>In the heart of the outbreak where 11 million residents are already on lockdown, Wuhan banned most vehicle use, including private cars, in downtown areas starting Sunday, state media reported. Only authorized vehicles would be permitted, the reports said.</p>
<p>The city will assign 6,000 taxis to neighborhoods, under the management of resident committees, to help people get around if they need to, China Daily said.</p>
<p>In Hong Kong, leader Carrie Lam said her government will raise its response level to emergency, the highest one, and close primary and secondary schools for two more weeks on top of next week’s Lunar New Year holiday. They will reopen Feb. 17.</p>
<p>Ms. Lam said direct flights and trains from Wuhan would be blocked.</p>
<p>In a sign of the growing strain on Wuhan’s health care system, the official Xinhua news agency reported that the city planned to build a second makeshift hospital with about 1,000 beds. The city has said another hospital was expected to be completed Feb. 3.</p>
<p>The new virus comes from a large family of what are known as coronaviruses, some causing nothing worse than a cold. It causes cold- and flu-like symptoms, including cough and fever, and in more severe cases, shortness of breath. It can worsen to pneumonia, which can be fatal.</p>
<p>China cut off trains, planes and other links to Wuhan on Wednesday, as well as public transportation within the city, and has steadily expanded a lockdown to 16 surrounding cities with a combined population of more than 50 million — greater than that of New York, London, Paris and Moscow combined.</p>
<p>China’s biggest holiday, Lunar New Year, unfolded Saturday in the shadow of the virus. Authorities canceled a host of events, and closed major tourist destinations and movie theaters.</p>
<p>Temples locked their doors, Beijing’s Forbidden City and Shanghai Disneyland closed, and people canceled restaurant reservations ahead of the holiday, normally a time of family reunions, sightseeing trips and other festivities in the country of 1.4 billion people.</p>
<p>“We originally planned to go back to my wife’s hometown and bought train tickets to depart this afternoon,” said Li Mengbin, who was on a stroll near the closed Forbidden City. “We ended up canceling. But I’m still happy to celebrate the new year in Beijing, which I hadn’t for several years.”</p>
<p>Temples and parks were decorated with red streamers, paper lanterns and booths, but some places started dismantling the decor.</p>
<p>People in China wore medical masks to public places like grocery stores, where workers dispensed hand sanitizer to customers.</p>
<p>The National Health Commission reported a jump in the number of infected people, to 1,287. The latest tally, from 29 provinces and cities across China, included 237 patients in serious condition.</p>
<p>Of the 41 deaths, 39 have been in Hubei province, where Wuhan is the capital city. Most of the deaths have been older patients, though a 36-year-old man in Hubei died this week.</p>
<p>The National Health Commission said it is bringing in medical teams to help handle the outbreak, a day after videos circulating online showed throngs of frantic people in masks lined up for examinations and complaints that family members had been turned away at hospitals that were at capacity.</p>
<p>The Chinese military dispatched 450 medical staff, some with experience in past outbreaks, including SARS and Ebola, who arrived in Wuhan late Friday to help treat many patients hospitalized with viral pneumonia, Xinhua reported.</p>
<p>Xinhua also said medical supplies are being rushed to the city, including 14,000 protective suits, 110,000 pairs of gloves and masks and goggles.</p>
<p>The rapid increase in reported deaths and illnesses does not necessarily mean the crisis is getting worse but could reflect better monitoring and reporting of the virus.</p>
