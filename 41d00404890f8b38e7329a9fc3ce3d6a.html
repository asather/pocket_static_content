<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Tuesday proposed a new $204 million tuition program for targeted full-time students attending the 14 state-owned universities who agree to remain in Pennsylvania for as many years as they receive the benefit.</p>
<p>In his remarks, and in a summary of the governor’s proposed 2020-21 commonwealth spending plan, Mr. Wolf said the new Nellie Bly Tuition program would use re-purposed dollars from the Pennsylvania Race Horse Development Trust Fund.</p>
<p>It is the signature among his proposals for higher education in next year’s proposed $36.1 billion general fund budget to support state operations beginning July 1.</p>
<p>He also is seeking $60 million in new funding for the Pennsylvania State Grant Program and $12.9 million in special funding next year to assist with redesign of the 14 universities belonging to the State System of Higher Education, whose nearly 96,000 students include those at California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock universities in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The tuition program already is getting push back from individuals within agriculture including the Pennsylvania Equine Coalition, which characterized it as a&nbsp;“raid” that&nbsp;“would result in the end of horse racing.”</p>
<p>However, Mr. Wolf characterized the scholarships as important to support college affordability, help reduce time to degree and keep young adults in Pennsylvania and working to help fuel the state’s economy.</p>
<p>“This needs-based tuition will fill the&nbsp;gap between the students’ financial aid and other financial&nbsp;assistance to cover the tuition and the real costs of college,&nbsp;including room and board, books, supplies, and graduation&nbsp;expenses,” according to an executive summary of the budget plan. “The tuition converts to a loan if the student moves&nbsp;out of the commonwealth during the commitment period and&nbsp;can be deferred while the student pursues further education.”</p>
<p>The proposed budget otherwise keeps at current funding levels the appropriations for the State System, the state-related universities —&nbsp;the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities —&nbsp;and the state’s community colleges.</p>
<p>Last fall, the State System's board of governors asked the governor and Legislature not only for a 2% increase in the system’s 2020-21 state appropriation, to $487 million, but also the first $20 million installment on $100 million the board says is needed over five years for system redesign. That would include dollars for infrastructure to allow campuses to deliver academic programs jointly, to share services and to reach new student markets.</p>
<p>In recent weeks, system representatives sought to make their case. In remarks last month, Chancellor Daniel Greenstein cast it as a watershed moment. He said the system has put in place strategies that can return the universities to self-sufficiency&nbsp;within five years — a date intended to avoid interfering with current students’ academic pursuits.</p>
<p>He said the system is ready but that what Harrisburg decides this coming year will determine if the students&nbsp; "regardless of race, ZIP code or wealth" will have an affordable pathway to the middle class and beyond.</p>
<p>“This year, we will decide whether all of Pennsylvania’s communities will have the health care workers, business leaders, educators, engineers and professionals they need to drive their local economies in the 21st century,” Mr. Greenstein said in his State of the System address. “This year, we will decide whether millions of adults will have the affordable public re-skilling and up-skilling options they need to maintain their relevance and viability in an evolving labor market.”</p>
<p>The State System grew steadily to a record enrollment of nearly 120,000. But since 2010, a 20% enrollment loss has dropped headcount to 95,802 across the system, fueled by factors including cost, competition and population loss across parts of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Those opposed to use of Race Horse Development Trust Fund revenue spoke of dire consequences if the money is shifted to State System scholarships at the fund’s expense.</p>
<p>“If approved by the legislature, this raid would result in the end of horseracing in Pennsylvania by eviscerating the primary funding source for the purses and breeder incentives that serve as the lifeblood of the industry,” said Pete Peterson, executive director of the Pennsylvania Equine Coalition, an organization representing the six thoroughbred and standardbred horsemen and breeder associations in the state.&nbsp;</p>
