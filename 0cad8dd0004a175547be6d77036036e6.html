<h1>Pitt study shows coach-taught program helps middle school boys change behavior with girls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Dr. Elizabeth Miller undertook a new study to see if middle school male athletes would benefit from a program already known to reduce abusive behavior toward girls among male high school athletes by using their coaches as instructors, her hypothesis was not good.</p>
<p>“I actually thought it wasn’t going to work,” Dr. Miller, director of the division of adolescent and young adult medicine at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“That was partly because middle school relationships between athletes and coaches is so different,” she said. “Kids are not as specialized; coaches don’t spend as much time with the kids; and middle school sports are much more lax than high school.”</p>
<p>The program she was evaluating, called Coaching Boys into Men, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/02/28/Coaching-Boys-Into-Men-program-looks-to-reduce-sexual-violence-by-getting-coaches-to-talk-to-male-athletes/stories/201602280187" target="_blank">has been around for 15 years as a way to reduce violence toward girls and women</a> by boys and men. Dr. Miller has been involved since its conception, monitoring it along the way in several different research projects.</p>
<p>All that experience taught her that the way middle school coaches worked with their athletes wouldn’t be long or intense enough.</p>
<p>“We think the magic sauce for the program is the coach-athlete relationship,” said Dr. Miller, who is a University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine pediatrics professor. “We thought we were going to say it is better for high school athletes and we should focus our attention on high school.”</p>
<p>But following evaluations of 973 athletes’ behaviors and attitudes at 41 Pittsburgh-area schools after half of them went through the program in 2015 and 2017 —&nbsp;the other half were the control group that did not go through the program —&nbsp;Dr. Miller found her hypothesis was wrong.</p>
<p>“Lo and behold, it worked with middle school athletics, too,” she said of <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/article-abstract/2758662" target="_blank">the results of a study published Monday</a> in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics.</p>
<p>For example, the student athletes who went through the program reported a more than 50% increase in “positive bystander behaviors” —&nbsp;that is: intervening in their peers’ disrespectful or harmful behaviors with girls —&nbsp;over those in the study who did not go through the program.</p>
<p>Also, a year after they were given the program in 15-minute, once-a-week sessions with their coaches, athletes were more than twice as likely to report positive bystander behavior as those who did not go through the program.</p>
<p>The program appeared to have a direct impact on the athletes’ own relationships, with 76% less likely to abuse a dating partner a year after it than those who did not go through the program.</p>
<p>The shorter middle school seasons did present some challenges.</p>
<p>Only half of the middle school coaches&nbsp;got through eight of the 12 “cards,” or lessons, that the program prescribes. Athletes whose coaches got through all 12 seemed to absorb more of the program than those who did not.</p>
<p>Also, while relationship abuse was reduced among those athletes who dated during the study, there was no reduction in cyber abuse, sexual harassment or homophobic teasing. That, the study said, suggests “… that these behaviors (which are frequent and likely normative in early adolescence) may require even more intensive prevention programs.”</p>
<p>“Coaches may be less comfortable addressing homophobic teasing and may have less familiarity with social media to address cyber abuse,” the study concluded.</p>
<p>That said, the program accomplished much more than even participants thought it would.</p>
<p>“I was skeptical,” said Anthony Pototo, who was the coach of Springdale Junior/Senior High’s seventh and eighth grade boys basketball teams when they were part of the study. He led the weekly sessions with his 20 players.</p>
<p>“They didn’t talk much those first few days. But after a few sessions, they started to open up to me.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pototo teaches third grade in Springdale but was a fourth or fifth grade teacher during the study and knew many of his athletes because he also had taught them in class. He said he initially didn’t see how the program could work, and he was not thrilled with the idea.</p>
<p>“You want me to do this one practice a week and take time out of my day to do it?” he remembers thinking when his athletic director, Ray Davis, asked him to take part.</p>
<p>But he said his athletes —&nbsp;some of whom he thought would not be open to such conversations —&nbsp;began having such involved, specific conversations about the issues he would raise during the sessions that he had to break it up into two sessions a week.</p>
<p>“Some days we probably would have gone even longer, but their parents were waiting for them to get them home” after practice, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Strong Pittsburgh support</strong></p>
<p>Because Dr. Miller has been based in Pittsburgh for the last eight years, the program has had a lot of support here, getting more involvement of schools than any other location in the country, she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Miller said key was the support of organizations like the FISA Foundation, the United Way, the Pirates, Steelers and Penguins, which all provide encouragement and financial support. To date, the three professional teams have provided $200,000 and United Way has spent $1.4 million.</p>
<p>In the five years since United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania began supporting the program, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24582876" target="_blank">after Dr. Miller’s prior research showed it was effective with high school athletes</a>, a little more than 10,000 high school athletes in nine counties in southwestern Pennsylvania have been taught it by more than 1,300 coaches in 69 schools in 54 school districts, said Bobbi Watt Geer, United Way CEO.</p>
<p>Those numbers will likely go up as it is more formally encouraged in middle schools, Ms. Watt Geer said, something United Way intends to do after it raises additional funding.</p>
<p>Brian O’Connor, director of public education campaigns and programs with Futures without Violence, the national advocacy group that created Coaching Boys into Men, said the results were better than expected, but not wholly surprising.</p>
<p>“Anecdotally we’ve heard the program [which was designed for high school boys] has been aged-down for middle schools already, and aged-up for college athletes,” he said.</p>
<p>The program’s materials are available for free online, so Futures does not have a good grasp of exactly how many middle school programs have already adapted it.</p>
<p>Dr. Miller’s study “is affirming a lot of what we already were thinking was true: That we want to try to get [the program] to young people even earlier than high school,” Mr. O’Connor said.</p>
<p>Kristy Troutman, executive director of the FISA Foundation in Pittsburgh, thinks Coaching Boys into Men&nbsp;should be taught from middle school through high school, and “it would be a mistake to do one and not the other.”</p>
<p>“My long-term vision for this is that, because kids change so much between elementary school and college, the more we can reinforce this message the better,” she said. “That’s the path for them to have positive and consensual relationships.”</p>
