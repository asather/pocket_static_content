<h1>Local artists, writers and art groups to receive $170,000 in grants </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Seven local artists, the Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and the Office of Public Art will receive $170,000 in grants this year from Investing in Professional Artists.</p>
<p>The program, which began in 2011, is&nbsp;funded by The Pittsburgh Foundation, Heinz Endowments and Opportunity Fund.</p>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council and the Office of Public Art each will receive $50,000 grants for special initiatives in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The arts council will use the money for its Emergency Fund for Artists, which is providing relief grants of up to $500 to individual artists. At least 90% of the funds are given to artists of color. The&nbsp;Office of Public Art will pay for artist commissions and professional development for 20 Pittsburgh artists working to support their communities.</p>
<p>Three project cycles organized by the Office of Public Art will focus on groups most affected by the new coronavirus, including Blacks, Latinos, Asian Americans and members of the LGBTQIA community. The Office of Public Art will commission new works by artists from these communities whose art bridges physical separation and increases well-being.</p>
<p>Seven artists will each receive grants of $10,000 intended to advance their careers, encourage collaborations between artists and organizations and increase the visibility of working artists.&nbsp;The following artists received grants:</p>
<p>Writer&nbsp;<strong>Jari Bradley</strong> will develop a manuscript for “Unruly,” a full-length collection of poems about the black queer body.</p>
<p>Visual artist <strong>Darnell Chambers</strong> will organize an exhibition and sequence of comic book-style illustrations as a storyboard of “Run Back Town,” a three-season animation series that focuses on ancient African history and folktales.</p>
<p>Glass artisan <strong>Jaime Guerrero</strong> will create five new life-size glass sculptures of angels to honor those who lost their lives to acts of racism. The figures will highlight social issues relevant to people living in Pittsburgh and will be hand-sculpted at the Pittsburgh Glass Center using its equipment and staff assistants.</p>
<p>Dancer and choreographer <strong>Pearlann Porter</strong> will produce a new full-length work, “mirror/360,” to debut in fall 2021. The grant will support artist residencies, open community workshops and two informal performances at The Space Upstairs, which is Ms. Porter’s permanent artistic residence.</p>
<p>Sculptor <strong>Lindsey Scherloum</strong> will build two land art sculptures in publicly visible landscapes and develop a public engagement process that communicates contemporary environmental issues while practicing ancient building and weaving techniques. She is planning public engagement events with Tree Pittsburgh and the artist collaborative Creatives for Climate in which volunteers and staff will harvest materials and weave them into sculptural forms at the museum.</p>
<p>Film and video artist <strong>Mariah Torres</strong> will continue to work on a half-hour comedy series, “Rock Bottom,” about the artist’s experiences living in her car in New York City with her best friend after she was evicted. Ms. Torres describes the project as “a unifier in these divisive times. Everyone has had a rock bottom moment. What we want to illustrate is that you can create your own reality, and with humor and heart, we can build each other up even in the darkest moments.”</p>
<p>Sculptor <strong>Rachel Mica Weiss </strong>will create&nbsp;a large-scale, outdoor work at a building in Point Breeze. The artist’s recent cast-concrete “Fold” sculpture was inspired by walls people build, ranging from the geological and architectural barriers to formless psychological constructs. The slabs bend paradoxically like fabric or foam and “their abstracted figures — along with their material morphology — speak to a transcendent, transformational experience that the viewer is invited to share.”</p>
<p>All submissions were reviewed by a panel of artists. The panelists for this cycle were:</p>
<p>Nisha Blackwell,&nbsp; the founder of Knotzland Bowties, a sustainable lifestyle brand that sources, rescues and repurposes discarded textiles into bowties.</p>
<p>Dominique Luster, the endowed Charles “Teenie” Harris archivist at Carnegie Museum of Art.</p>
<p>Wali Jamal, a veteran actor who has performed in Pittsburgh over the last 22 years and has had roles in all 11 plays by playwright August Wilson.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mikael Chukwuma Owunna, a queer Nigerian-Swedish American photographer, Fulbright Scholar and engineer.</p>
<p>Orlando “Buscrates” Marshall, a music producer and DJ born and raised in Pittsburgh who draws significant influences from 1990s hip hop and early-to-mid-1980s electronic funk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adriana Ramirez, a Mexican-Colombian literary artist with a national reputation for slam poetry and nonfiction writing.</p>
<p>Randal Miller, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s director of dance programming and special events.</p>
<p>Since 2011, 142 artists and organizations have received $2.1 million through the Investing in Professional Artists program. The Opportunity Fund is new to the partnership this year.</p>
