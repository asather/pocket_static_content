<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police seized spray paint cans, guns and a sweatshirt from the home of a 20-year-old Shaler man, alleging that the clothing links him to the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/30/A-peaceful-protest-turns-violence-pittsburgh-george-floyd/stories/202005300072" target="_blank">destruction of a police SUV</a>&nbsp;by rioters Saturday when a protest against police brutality turned ugly.</p>
<p>An <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/31/Pittsburgh-protest-police-suspect-Brian-Bartels-riots-George-Floyd-protests/stories/202005310132" target="_blank">arrest warrant has been issued for Brian J. Bartels</a>, who was not in custody as of Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Police said an anonymous tip from a co-worker of Mr. Bartels at Amazon identified him as one of the culprits who was involved in destroying the marked police SUV that was parked along Centre Avenue at Washington Place near PPG Paints Arena. Police are not accusing him of igniting the vehicle.</p>
<p>The attack on the empty police car marked one of the flashpoints in the hourslong protest that led to clashes with police and numerous arrests. Police said people, including Mr. Bartels, jumped on the car before it was set afire.</p>
<p>Police executed a search warrant Sunday afternoon at Mr. Bartels’ house in the 2500 block of College Avenue, using officers with the North Hills Special Response Team to break down the front and back doors when no one answered.</p>
<p>There was no response Monday afternoon at the house when a reporter visited. The oval window of the front door was smashed in, and some of the shattered glass was scattered on the ground in front of the door. There was a hole in the door where a deadbolt lock was removed.</p>
<p>Police said they searched every room of the house, which was empty, and confiscated two guns, six spray paint cans, gloves, miscellaneous books, a phone, a bag with unidentified items and a sweatshirt, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The search warrant paperwork was not available from the courts, and there was no additional information about the items seized.</p>
<p>Police described the Sunday protest as one that&nbsp;“turned destructive, violent and into a riot situation” around 4:30 p.m. and blamed the incident with the police vehicle as being the root cause.</p>
<p>Detectives monitoring social media during the rally watched a protester strike the police car. Police acknowledged in the criminal complaint that plainclothes officers had infiltrated the crowd and one of them, identified as Detective Michael Lewis, saw the attack on the SUV unfold, inciting the crowd “to commit criminal acts.”</p>
<p>Protesters broke the SUV’s windows and used spray paint to tag the vehicle with graffiti. Some protesters tried to stop the damage, but the actions caught the attention of five police officers on horseback stationed near the arena, and they rode their horses into the thick mass of a crowd in an attempt to push the protesters away from the SUV.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the top of Centre Avenue near Crawford Street, protesters were confronted by two SUVs with officers in them.</p>
<p>In both cases, angry protesters resisted, pushing against the horses, and hitting the side of the SUVs further up Centre Avenue.</p>
<p>Then, simultaneously, the officers on horseback and the two SUVS turned and left the area, as if they had all been given orders to leave.</p>
<p>As soon as they did, protesters lit the parked SUV on fire and cheered as the acrid, black smoke turned into flames that eventually blew out all four tires and the remaining gas. The fire was allowed to burn uncontrolled.</p>
<p>“You saw that, didn’t you?” one protester, a woman who asked not to be named, said. “We were being peaceful until they came in with their horses.”</p>
<p>Another protester, though, conceded that it was protesters who had damaged the car first.</p>
<p>According to the police account, the man they identified as Mr. Bartels pulled a can of orange or red spray paint from a backpack and tagged the SUV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowd cheered, and someone else jumped on the hood. Mr. Bartels, who is white, kicked the police vehicle and then threw something that broke the window, the complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A black woman&nbsp;“stepped in front of Bartels and pleaded for him to stop, he gave her the finger&nbsp;and then jumped on the car hood and stomped the windshield (breaking it further),” according to the complaint.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowd cheered. Mr. Bartles jumped down,&nbsp;“retrieved additional items to throw and continued throwing at the police car. Some individuals from the crowd&nbsp;attempted to stop him,” the complaint said.&nbsp;“As Bartels continued his destruction the crowd fought back against him less and more people began to&nbsp;join him in damaging the car.”</p>
<p>That was when police said the officers mounted on horseback arrived to push back the crowd.</p>
<p>“The&nbsp;crowd was now completely hostile towards the mounted police,” the complaint said.&nbsp;“Bartels had retreated back in the crowd when bricks and rocks were being thrown at the police and the horses. It became apparent the [officers] were unable to regain order or save the heavily&nbsp;damaged vehicle. Their safety was in jeopardy as well as the safety of their horses They retreated and abandoned the police car. The tension of the crowd burst as the crowd jumped on to the car in victory.”</p>
<p>Around 10:30 p.m. that night, police said they received a call from someone who requested anonymity and claimed to recognize Mr. Bartels, a co-worker at Amazon, from social media as the rioter who damaged the police SUV.</p>
<p>“The caller received a communication from Bartels on 5/30/20 where Bartels stated ‘If I'm not at work&nbsp;tomorrow, ask the boss to give me paid time off.’ Later in the day the caller received a second communication from Bartels stating&nbsp;he would be at work tomorrow,” the complaint said.</p>
<p>Police said they found a picture of Mr. Bartels and showed it to Detective Lewis and a Pennsylvania State Police trooper, who both claimed that he was the person who damaged the vehicle.</p>
<p>Among the items police seized at the Bartels residence was a black sweatshirt with white lettering that they claim matches the clothing worn by the rioter. It was found on top of a clothes dryer in the laundry room, police said.</p>
<p>Mr.&nbsp; Bartels is charged with one felony count each of criminal mischief, institutional vandalism and riot along with five misdemeanor counts of recklessly endangering another person.The complaint said he caused more than $5,000 of damage.</p>
