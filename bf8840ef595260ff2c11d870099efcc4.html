<h1>Post-Gazette Game of the Week: Clairton's ground game takes down Jeannette</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Things may be totally different than in years past during this high school football season, but one thing remains unchanged — Clairton’s seat at the throne as the WPIAL’s undisputed king of Class 1A.</p>
<p>With senior running back Dontae Sanders leading the way, No. 1 Clairton (1-0) rode its punishing rushing attack to a pivotal 34-28 road win against No. 2 Jeannette (0-1) Friday night at McKee Stadium. The top two teams in the WPIAL in Class 1A battled back and forth in a game that more than lived up to the hype, but in the end, it was the mighty Bears who once again staked their claim as the team to beat.</p>
<p>“It’s not only great for me as a coach — I’m excited for the kids to be able, especially my seniors, to be able to have the opportunity to come out,” Clairton coach Wayne Wade said. “Even if it’s only three or four games and this thing comes back, they had the opportunity. We’re here, and I’m grateful for it.”</p>
<p>Sanders finished with 209 yards rushing and three touchdowns on 24 carries, while quarterback Jonte Sanders passed for 101 yards and a pair of scores in the win.</p>
<p>The Jayhawks received a big performance from senior wide receiver James Sanders, who caught seven passes for 153 yards and two touchdowns, as well as freshman quarterback Brad Birch, who made a stellar debut by completing 16 of 25 passes for 246 yards and three scores.</p>
<p>“It feels good, because we weren’t about to have a season,” Dontae Sanders said. “It feels good to come out here and play.”</p>
<p>With only a handful of spectators scattered throughout the bleachers while following social distancing guidelines, the raucous crowd that typically accompanies a marquee matchup like this one was nowhere to be found. Although the atmosphere was calmer than usual for the rivalry, the teams wasted little time turning up the intensity on the field.</p>
<p>James Sanders opened up the scoring for Jeannette with a 20-yard touchdown reception, though the Bears quickly responded with a 24-yard scoring hookup from Jonte Sanders to senior running back Isaiah Berry.</p>
<p>After taking a direct snap and dropping it, Jayhawks running back Roberto Smith picked up the loose ball and scampered 59 yards for a score to put Jeannette on top 14-6. Clairton then answered with a scoring drive led by Dontae Sanders, who capped it off with a 1-yard touchdown plunge to tie the game at 14.</p>
<p>That’s when things really started to heat up. On the first play of the Jayhawks’ ensuing possession, James Sanders caught a screen pass and outraced the defense down the sideline for a 57-yard touchdown. On the very next play, Bears wide receiver Brooklyn Cannon made a highlight-reel, over-the-shoulder grab and ran it in for a 67-yard touchdown from Jonte Sanders. Clairton’s conversion attempt failed, and Jeannette took a 21-20 lead into the half.</p>
<p>The Bears came out strong after the break as Dontae Sanders punished a would-be tackler with a vicious hit on his way to a 48-yard touchdown run on the second play of the third quarter. Sanders limped off the field after the run but returned on the next drive and added on his third touchdown of the game, this time from 6 yards out, to give Clairton a 34-21 lead.</p>
<p>It seemed like the Bears were going to ice the game away early in the fourth quarter, but a huge goal-line stand and forced fumble gave the Jayhawks new life.</p>
<p>Senior wide receiver Toby Cline caught a 20-yard touchdown pass from Birch with a little more than two minutes remaining to cut the deficit to six, and Jeannette forced a quick three-and-out to get the ball back. The Jayhawks’ rally came up just short, though, as their last drive stalled out around midfield and Clairton hung on.</p>
<p>“That’s a good football team,” Wade said. “If we’re on different sides of the bracket for the playoffs, we’ll probably see them down at the big house.”</p>
