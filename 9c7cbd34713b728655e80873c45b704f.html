<h1>Despite Pennsylvania's stay-at-home order, COVID-19 continues to spread. Why?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Non-life sustaining businesses have been closed across Pennsylvania in conjunction with a statewide stay at home order since mid-March to help slow the coronavirus spread.</p>
<p>Yet, as the commonwealth eyes a target date of May 8 to begin a phased reopening plan, 1,397 additional positive cases were announced on Saturday, bringing the total to 40,049 since the first one was announced about seven weeks ago.</p>
<p>Those facts led to a question with perhaps an obvious but still worthwhile answer during Health Department Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine’s Saturday COVID-19 briefing: If everyone is staying home while most places to go are closed, why is the deadly virus still spreading at such a large, if not exponential, rate?</p>
<p>“It’s being transmitted by anybody who’s not just at home,” Dr. Levine said. “And, so, there are lots of reasons why people might not be at home, they might be essential workers, they might be working in health care in hospitals or offices, they might be working in long term care living facilities, etc.</p>
<p>“In addition, people have to go out and get food and medical supplies and medicines, and all of those stores have to be staffed by people. We have to make sure that those supply chains exist. So even though there is a general stay at home order, there are still people who have to be out and about. Whenever that is true, there is going to be transmission of this very contagious virus.”</p>
<p>Tracking a decrease in the number of new cases is one of the most important criteria of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan, along with many other things.</p>
<p>Obviously, a continued spread will make it hard for some regions of the state to start an economic recovery quickly, which is why Dr. Levine continues to stress the idea of staying at home unless it is absolutely necessary to leave.</p>
<p>“That’s why we recommended the mask order, and remember, my mask protects you and your mask protects me,” she said, “and if you’re both wearing masks, there is more protection, but it’s not 100%.</p>
<p>“There continues to be spread of COVID-19. The biggest areas where they’re spread is where there’s more population density. That’s why we have more cases in the southeast.”</p>
