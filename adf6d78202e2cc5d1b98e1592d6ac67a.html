<h1>Pirates on pause: Where can the (needed) extra power come from in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other P-G digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>The Pirates were not a lousy offensive team in 2019. They tied for the National League lead in batting average (.265) and scored 758 runs, an average of 4.68 per game that was very much on par with NL Central playoff teams St. Louis (4.72) and Milwaukee (4.75). Pitching and defense were much bigger issues.</p>
<p>But looking strictly at the Pirates’ offense, it obviously has room to grow, specifically when we’re talking about power. The Pirates were next-to-last among the 15 NL clubs in home runs (163) and 13th in isolated power (ISO) at .155 — the latter stat aimed at quantifying raw power by only taking extra-base hits into account.</p>
<p>Can the Pirates find more power? That’s an interesting question and one certainly complicated by the January trade of Starling Marte, who was coming off a season where he set career-highs in runs (97), home runs (23), RBIs (82), slugging percentage (.503) and OPS (.845).</p>
<p>A pessimist might say the Pirates are in serious trouble. Home runs cost money, and the Pirates don’t often spend much of that. It’s a reasonable take, though there are still areas where the Pirates can improve. There are also players who can and should do more.</p>
<p>One area of potential improvement doesn’t cost much and is actually fairly coachable — pitch selection. While the Pirates had the lowest strikeout rate (19.5%) in the National League, they also had the second-lowest walk rate (6.8%).</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be time to take a few more pitches — the Pirates saw 23,525 in 2019, fourth-fewest among all MLB clubs — and risk striking out more, the upside being opposing pitchers potentially making more mistakes.</p>
<p>Another area was how the Pirates performed against left-handed pitchers; they slugged just .386, which placed them just 27th in the majors.</p>
<p>The Pirates, who were last in MLB in barrel percentage (5.4) and next-to-last in launch angle (9.5 degrees) against all pitchers, also need a few guys to take significant steps forward in 2020, most notably Gregory Polanco and Colin Moran.</p>
<p>If the Pirates are going to replace Marte’s power in the aggregate — Jarrod Dyson isn’t built to do it directly — Polanco and Moran are the two most logical choices, the two with the most room to grow.</p>
<p>Moran had a respectable run-producing season in 2019, with the third baseman racking up 80 RBIs and sporting a .277 average. But he also struck out 23.3% of the time, which was 12th-worst among the 44 MLB third baseman who logged 300 or more plate appearances in 2019, and his walk rate was 6.0% (seventh-worst).</p>
<p>The Pirates need Moran to see more pitches and do more with them, but one rival NL scout does believe there’s enough latent power inside the 2013 first-round pick. It’s just a matter of someone finally pulling it out.</p>
<p>“I think the swing is compatible for having that type of production,” the scout said. “It’s more gap-to-gap than anything else, but maturity should help, too. There’s raw power in there. I think he’s going to get to it.”</p>
<p>Another player who would help the Pirates’ cause here is Polanco, who had a dreadful season in 2019 — one that was ultimately cut short after just 42 games because of recurring left shoulder issues.</p>
<p>Polanco hit just .242, while he, too, struck out at an alarming rate: 29.3%, which was 12th-worst among right fielders who had at least 100 plate appearances in 2019.</p>
<p>But similar to Moran, who hits from the same side of the plate, Polanco has the power there somewhere inside of his smooth, left-handed swing. The problem has been staying healthy and getting that 4 o’clock power to show up at 7 p.m.; Polanco’s career slugging percentage (.422) is only a couple points higher than that of Adam Frazier (.420).</p>
<p>“There’s so much natural lift in his swing,” the same NL scout said. “It’s a classic, high finish. He falls backward through contact. He has those long levers. The power is in there. He can hit it a country mile. If he stays healthy, there are 20-25 [homers] in there, no doubt.”</p>
<p>That would be welcomed by the Pirates, the same as Kevin Newman and Bryan Reynolds having strong sophomore seasons and Josh Bell looking more like the guy they had in May and June than the one who failed to hit a home run in his first 24 games (23 starts) out of the All-Star break.</p>
<p>Those, however, are easier leaps to make. What the Pirates need are a few pleasant surprises to join those three, specifically as it relates to injecting some semblance of power into manager Derek Shelton’s lineup.</p>
<p>“If you had asked me this question pre-COVID-19 and promised me Moran and Polanco were going to play 90 percent of the season healthy, I therefore would wager that both guys would have 20-plus home run seasons,” the scout said. “I do think these guys could do it, but they have to stay healthy.”</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:</strong> While the 2019 Pirates were 11th out of 15 National League teams in slugging percentage (.420), it was the best franchise mark since Pittsburgh produced the same number in 2003.</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:</strong> Four of the Pirates’ eight starting position players were selected in the first or second rounds of the MLB draft. Newman and Moran were first-round picks, while Bell and Reynolds were second-round selections.</p>
<p><strong>THEY SAID IT:</strong> “He extends our lineup completely. When he’s been here, and he’s been healthy, he’s been a really good player.” — Shelton on Polanco.</p>
