<h1>Analysis: What a shortened MLB draft means for the Pirates and baseball</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball cutting its 2020 draft from 40 to five rounds because of economic concerns resulting from the coronavirus pandemic is hardly an ideal scenario for the Pirates, who are looking to add as much talent as possible into the organization. The draft, of course, offers one of the most cost-effective ways of doing that.</p>
<p>But it’s certainly not an insurmountable task, Larry Broadway insisted during a Saturday morning appearance on 93.7 The Fan. Broadway, whose title is Pirates senior director of minor league operations, described the situation as a “challenge” and said it’s one the new braintrust is ready to attack.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a challenge. It’s definitely a challenge,” Broadway told host Dan Zangrilli. “It’s a challenge that everybody is going to face. We’re typically used to ingesting 30-35 players out of the domestic draft and undrafted free agents. To have potentially five or less than five or five to 10 if there are some free agents added, that’s very different. That also impacts the landscape of what it looks like next year.</p>
<p>“Yeah, there are a lot of questions to be answered. It’s going to be a fun challenge to be able to think about things differently and a challenge a bunch of people already to take on as soon as we can understand what the constraints are a little bit better.”</p>
<p>Shortening the draft will do a few different things, but the biggest, obviously, will be raising the importance of getting these picks right, essentially eliminating any margin for error. But inside of that, there are several more ripple effects. Among them:</p>
<p>• The owners drew a hard line here. Had they acquiesced to a 10-round draft, that would’ve meant less than $1 million per team in additional slot money (total $29,578,100). Apparently that was too much for a group that won’t be making money on ticket, merchandise or concession sales any time soon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the players rejected an amended 10-round draft — one that paid half as much to those who are chosen — and wound up getting nothing when it comes to additional rounds.</p>
<p>Are the owners going to play hardball when the two sides try to work out a return-to-play plan next week? Did the players give a little bit now to preserve what they want — no additional pay cuts — when those discussions commence? We’ll find out.</p>
<p>• The amount of talent in this year’s draft could be diluted.</p>
<p>Sure, the top guys will be unaffected, the ones who know they’re going in the higher rounds. But what about the players who aren’t so sure and have the option of staying in school? Might make more sense for that high school senior to go the college route instead of rolling the dice here.</p>
<p>A college player, meanwhile, might be best served sticking around for another year, leaning on that scholarship and trying to improve his draft stock for 2021.</p>
<p>This makes things more difficult on the Pirates. In addition to needing to get all six right — five rounds plus their compensatory pick after the first round — they’ll be doing so with a lesser talent pool. Furthermore, everybody will be on equal footing after the rounds are completed.</p>
<p>That’s when teams can sign an unlimited number of players for $20,000 each. But think that about that, too: If a guy’s truly going to bolster your organization, odds are he’s not falling to that spot. And then if he gets $20,000 offers from the Pirates and, say, the Yankees, where do you think that kid is going to go?</p>
<p>The Pirates can — and surely will — try to find diamonds in the rough. But they’re digging with a rake.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Talented players going to or returning to college could create a glut of talent for next year.</p>
<p>One hand, great. Just scoop ‘em all up then. But picks in baseball’s draft have slot values assigned. What if a guy doesn’t like how far he falls in 2021, then doesn’t want to sign for what he views like is less than he’s worth?</p>
<p>The Pirates lose because they might not be terribly appealing for that prospective players, and draftees who’ve tumbled a couple rounds will obviously make less than they would have otherwise because of the slotting system.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Long-term, what does this mean for baseball?</p>
<p>Do high school males prioritize other sports because they view baseball as a path to difficult to traverse? Does this diminish interest in the game?</p>
<p>For a sport looking (and needing) to revive itself, adding fewer talented players seems ... well, dumb.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">•&nbsp;What does this mean for the future of the minor leagues? It almost assuredly points to contraction, which Broadway said he expects, though he didn’t really levy an opinion either way.</span></p>
<p>“Whatever that is, we’ll be looking to leverage it as best we can,” Broadway said. “I do know [the minor leagues in 2021] are going to be different because they definitely announced the draft is only going to be five rounds this year.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Pirate City next?</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Another interesting nugget Broadway dropped in his appearance was the idea of what happens to the minors in 2020.</span></p>
<p>As soon as reasonably possible, Broadway said the hope was for guys to train at Pirate City and for others to join the major league club via expanded rosters.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We hope to at least be able to do that right now,” Broadway said. “Major League Baseball is focused on how do we get the major league season up and running so we can get revenues going again.</span></p>
<p>“But if we can get into our affiliate cities, then the hope is we can take the necessary measures for safety at our spring training complexes to get some sort of group development activity going.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">One of the big issues, Broadway explained, involves pitchers’ arms and making sure there’s not too drastic of a jump in innings and pitches thrown from 2020 to 2021.</span></p>
<p>“That’s probably the biggest fear,” Broadway said, “is that we lost this year, especially for starting pitchers, then what’s the appropriate threshold to get to next year without risking injury? All of those things need to be figured out.”</p>
