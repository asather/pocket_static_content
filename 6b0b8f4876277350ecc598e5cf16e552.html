<h1>Ben Roethlisberger 'pleasantly surprised' with resurgence of arm strength </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even in his 17th training camp with the Steelers, Ben Roethlisberger continues to have some eye-opening moments in his career. And he is relieved they have all been good.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, they all have to do with the most discussed subject in town — the state of his throwing arm.</p>
<p>The latest came the other day when Roethlisberger said he wasn’t able to step into a throw when he lofted a deep pass down the left sideline. “It felt when it came off my hand it was going to be short,” he said. But, like a baseball player surprisingly seeing a routine fly ball go over the fence for a home run, Roethlisberger was surprised when his pass hit the receiver perfectly in stride.</p>
<p>“I’m pleasantly surprised how my arm strength has come back, maybe even better than it was before,” Roethlisberger said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger has said he had discomfort in his elbow for a number of years prior to his season-ending injury. But, after having three of the five flexor tendons in his right arm surgically reattached, Roethlisberger has had another eye-opening moment: The discomfort is gone.</p>
<p>"No more sharp pains or dull pains in my elbow,” Roethlisberger said. “I'm thankful for that."</p>
<p>Offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said he pays particular attention to the state of Roethlisberger’s throwing arm and has seen no hesitation from his quarterback to cut loose with deep throws.</p>
<p>“I like the idea that, from a script standpoint, he hasn’t wanted to shy away from any of those deep opportunities if it presented itself,” Fichtner said.</p>
<p>With all concerns about his arm seemingly out of the way, the last remaining hurdle for Roethlisberger is playing in a game again and testing his arm in live action. He has not appeared in a game since Week 2 last season, when he left in the second quarter against the Seattle Seahawks and never returned — the longest playing drought of his career.</p>
<p>In fact, when he opens the regular season Sept. 14 against the New York Giants in East Rutherford, N.J., it will be one day shy of a year since his injury.</p>
<p>“Try not to be too nervous,” Roethlisberger said. “I’ve noticed when we’ve done some two-minute drills I’ve actually felt the jelly kind of legs. I felt nervous on the practice field, which I’ve never felt before, maybe for a long time. So I know if I’m nervous on the practice field, now I know the games are going to be a different feeling.</p>
<p>“That is going to be the last hurdle — and getting hit. Getting hit and calming the nerves are going to be big ones for me.”</p>
<p>Fichtner said Roethlisberger remains on a pitch count in practice, even though he practiced three days in a row last week. However, the Steelers do not want him hanging around to throw after practice or engage in his usual pre-practice competition with center Maurkice Pouncey where they try to hit the goal-post crossbar from various distances on the field. Fichtner called that “fluff stuff.”</p>
<p>But, other than some fatigue that is associated with any day of heavy throwing, Roethlisberger feels good as new after an off day. During the regular season, he gets back-to-back off days following a game.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing how fast it bounces back and feels great the next day,” Roethlisberger said. “I feel very confident going into the regular season schedule.”</p>
