<h1>Obituary: Olivia King Holt, a 'ground-breaking' woman who inspired children during segregation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Olivia King Holt was a trailblazer, earning a bachelors degree in 1948 and a masters degree in 1951, an era when most women did not attend college — especially if they were African American. She used her education and social work degrees from the University of Pittsburgh and her passion for learning to inspire hundreds of young African Americans to aspire to higher education and careers in teaching and other professions.</p>
<p>Olivia King grew up in the Hill District and became the first member of her working-class family to attend college. She devoted her&nbsp;life to children, working as a teacher, social worker, guidance counselor and assistant principal.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holt, 92, died “after a long, fulfilling life and a short illness” on Dec. 18 at UCLA Medical Center in Santa Monica, Calif., said her niece, Donna Allison of Inglewood, Calif.</p>
<p>“She was a ground-breaking African American woman. She was my inspiration. I always said I wanted to be just like Aunt Libby,” said Mrs. Allison, who also grew up in the Hill District.</p>
<p>After graduating from Schenley Senior High School in 1944, Olivia King started a job that would change the course of her life, and the lives of many others.</p>
<p>From 1944 to 1966 she worked summers at Camp James Weldon Johnson in Raccoon State Park in Beaver County. It was one of the the first camps in the country for African American children and teenagers who were barred from established “fresh air” summer camps because of segregation.</p>
<p>At the camp, she met John M. Holt, the man she would marry, in 1944 when she was working as a secretary.</p>
<p>Camp Johnson employed college students as live-in counselors, and that’s the job Olivia King filled every summer when she attended Pitt.</p>
<p>In 1947, Mr. Holt, a teacher and athletic coach, became director of Camp Johnson, a position he held until 1965. From 1951 to 1965, Olivia King was program director and assistant director of the camp.</p>
<p>The couple married in 1953 and moved to Baltimore, where they worked in the public schools. But they returned to Pittsburgh several times each year, Mrs. Allison said, for holidays&nbsp;and other occasions, and for reunions with campers and counselors.</p>
<p>The camp was established in 1939 thanks to a $60 start-up contribution from Pittsburgh Courier editor Robert L. Vann and contributions and fundraising efforts by the Pittsburgh Urban League and the Rotary Club, according to information at the Detre Library &amp; Archives at the Heinz History Center.</p>
<p>Through the years, parents from all over Allegheny County contributed, on a sliding fee scale, to send their children to two-week sessions that included swimming, hiking, boating, fishing, star gazing, golf, dramatics, music, dancing and some academic lessons.</p>
<p>“My Aunt Libby and Uncle John did not have children of their own, but they touched the lives of so many children, including mine,” said Mrs. Allison, who followed her aunt’s advice and example, graduating from Duquesne University and working as a technical writer in the aerospace industry.</p>
<p>Another who benefited was Gladys Burrell Hayes of Beltzhoover, who worked at the camp in the 1950s, said her son, Harold Hayes, who retired from KDKA-TV in 2016 after working 36 years as a reporter.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes said the camp had such an impact that his mother — who graduated from Howard University in 1937, taught elementary and special education in the Pittsburgh public school system and was a probation officer in juvenile court —&nbsp;took him to view the Beaver County site, long after the camp closed in 1967.&nbsp;By then, most summer camps had been integrated.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holt retired from the Baltimore City Public Schools in 1983 and then moved to Pittsburgh in 2002, after her husband died. The two had been married for 49 years.</p>
<p>At an emotionally moving funeral in Pittsburgh, many former campers and counselors came “and sang camp songs,” Mrs. Allison said.</p>
<p>Mrs. Holt later moved to Seal Beach, Calif., in 2010 “because she said she always wanted to live in California,” her niece said.</p>
<p>In addition to her professional career, Mrs. Holt was always active in the community, including volunteering as a Girl Scout leader. She was a member and a pianist at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in the Hill District and an active member of the Chancel Choir at Douglas Memorial Community Church in Baltimore.</p>
<p>In addition to Mrs. Allison, survivors include two nieces, Linda S. Morton and Sonja G. Newsome of Pittsburgh; one nephew, Harry J. Morton of Sherman Oaks, Calif.; and two grandnieces, Sonja M. Newsome of Pittsburgh and Claudia L. Newsome of Atlanta.</p>
<p>The family will receive friends from 4-8 p.m. Thursday at the Samuel J. Jones Funeral Home, 2644 Wylie Ave., in the Hill District.</p>
<p>Services will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at Ebenezer Baptist Church, 2001 Wylie Ave., also in the Hill District.</p>
<p>James Weldon Johnson was a diplomat and the first African American executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, according to the Heinz Center archives.
