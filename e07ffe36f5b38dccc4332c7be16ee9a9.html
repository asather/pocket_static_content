<h1>Pitt lands 17th commit in 2021 cycle, nears top-20 recruiting ranking</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt's recruiting run hasn't slowed down.</p>
<p>Derrveron Maxwell-Black, an inside linebacker from Lakewood High School in St. Petersburg, Fla., committed to the Panthers' 2021 class on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>Maxwell-Black is the 17th member of Pitt's class, which, as of Thursday afternoon, ranked 21st nationally on Rivals.com. That’s two spots behind Penn State and good for fifth in the ACC. Clemson, as expected, leads the conference at No. 6 nationally, followed by No. 8 North Carolina, No. 10 Miami and No. 17 Louisville.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maxwell-Black is a three-star recruit, according to Rivals.&nbsp;He's also Pitt's third linebacker of the cycle, joining three-star Georgia prospect Preston Lavant and two-star Virginia native Trevion Stevenson.&nbsp;The 6-foot, 210-pounder — who tallied 83 tackles, 16 TFLs and four sacks as a junior in 2019 — chose Pitt over offers from Syracuse, Illinois and a host of Group of Five and Division I-AA programs.</p>
<p>Whether or not Maxwell-Black and Pitt's other 16 commits stay committed when the COVID-induced recruiting dead period ends is a question that will be answered later.</p>
<p>Commitments have skyrocketed nationwide this cycle, with prospects staring an uncertain future in the face and accepting offers while they have them. The opening of campus visits could lead to a flurry of decommitments across the sport, and Pitt, like every Power Five program with a large class, might see some attrition.</p>
<p>“If you’re visiting Pitt, you’re going to visit maybe West Virginia or swing over to Penn State or over to Ohio State. And you’ll hear different things and get a feel for the process and what’s legit and what’s not,” Mike Farrell, Rivals' national recruiting director, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/06/17/Pitt-football-COVID-19-recruiting-2021-class-Pat-Narduzzi-247-Sports-Brian-Dohn-Mike-Farrell-Rivals-Jimmy-Morrissey/stories/202006170067" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette</a> two weeks ago. “But being isolated like this, it just changes your perspective as a recruit. You have to believe coaches when they say, ‘Hey, you better jump on this now.’ Because you just don’t know if you’re going to have a football season, if you’re going to get back out there to visit, if you’re going to have an offer in the fall.</p>
<p>“A lot of that is really up in the air.”</p>
<p>As it stands, though, Pat Narduzzi and his staff are in a good spot. They have room in the 2021 class to add half a dozen or more prospects — with six months until a possible December signing period.</p>
