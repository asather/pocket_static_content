<h1>Mid-Ohio planners, West Virginia University push for hyperloop certification facility</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The agency pushing a hyperloop system to link Pittsburgh to Chicago in less than an hour through a low-pressure tube system also wants to be involved in government certification for the new technology.</p>
<p>The Mid-Ohio Regional Planning Commission, based in Columbus, is among 17 groups vying to build a massive testing center for Virgin Hyperloop One, the same company the commission is working with to establish one of the first uses of the technology in the United States. The minimum requirements for the certification facility include a 6-mile test track.</p>
<p>Because the proposed transportation system involves new technology, it is expected to go through extensive, rigorous testing before it is approved by the Federal Transportation Administration. Virgin&nbsp;put out a request for proposals to host the center late last year and has asked a number of the applicants, including the Mid-Ohio planners and West Virginia University, to provide more information about their proposals.</p>
<p>Three years ago, Virgin’s predecessor, Hyperloop One, used a similar approach to get regional proposals from organizations willing to develop a corridor for the system before whittling the group down to 10 organizations authorized to continue the process. In a statement released through WVU, Virgin Hyperloop confirmed it has reduced the number of certification center applicants it is working with and WVU remains involved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thea Walsh, director of transportation and funding for the Mid-Ohio group, said her agency is&nbsp;“super excited” to be considered for the certification facility.&nbsp;She wouldn’t discuss the specifics of the group’s proposal other than to say it has identified a location in north central Ohio.</p>
<p>Based on Virgin Hyperloop’s requirements, Ms.Walsh said, she expects the testing facility to be a big economic generator for the region.&nbsp;The planning agency believes the Ohio site should have an advantage because that area already specializes in vehicle testing at the 400-acre Transportation Research Center in Logan County, about 40 miles northwest of Columbus.</p>
<p>That facility, which is used by all of the major car manufacturers and the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration, has been in operation for more than 30 years and has more than 400 employees. It is involved in testing a variety of vehicle components, including crash testing, child safety seats and emissions, as well as developing solutions to address problems.</p>
<p>Ms. Walsh said she believes the project would be “a big economic deal” and she would expect complimentary businesses to open around the hyperloop facility as they have near the research center.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of this that aligns with what we already do,” Ms. Walsh said.&nbsp;“We think the hyperloop facility would be the same type of facility. We see that activity in practice in our region every day.”</p>
<p>Planners won’t tackle the task of building the facility until Virgin Hyperloop says the regional site meets minimum requirements, Ms. Walsh said. The company wants to break ground on the facility in 2021 and have the technology certified by 2025.</p>
<p>In West Virginia, the effort to obtain the hyperloop facility is a natural outgrowth of the university’s announced goal a year ago to make the state a cradle for developing new technology, said Javier Reyes, vice president of Start-up WVU and dean of the John Chambers College of Business and Economics.</p>
<p>Mr. Reyes said activities at the certification center would touch many aspects of the university beyond engineering such as business, computer technology and human interaction. The push for building the certification center in West Virginia itself is a very positive process, he said.</p>
<p>“If we get it, it’s incredible. It would be transformational,” he said.&nbsp;“If we don’t get it, just the aggregation of all the resources with the state and Marshall University and others will be a tremendous benefit for the future.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mid-Ohio planners continue to meet with municipal leaders along the proposed Pittsburgh-Columbus-Chicago route for the Mid-West Connect hyperloop.. A feasibility study released in October showed the route could be built in sections over the next 30 years and an environmental impact study finished at the end of the year found no major environmental concerns that would prevent the project from proceeding, Ms. Walsh said.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing that says we can’t do it, but there’s nothing that says it’s going to be easy,” Ms. Walsh said.&nbsp;“What [the environmental study] told us is there would need to be a lot of bridges and a lot of tunneling on the eastern end [closer to Pittsburgh], which is to be expected..</p>
<p>“Certainly that told us that’s an area that’s going to take more time and more money to complete.”</p>
<p>The agency expects to build the system from west to east because of the mostly flat topography in the west. It hasn’t projected a cost for the system, but it is expected to cost billions and be built through a public-private partnership.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
