<h1>Ross police say double shooting was a murder-suicide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Investigators have concluded that a man killed himself Saturday afternoon after murdering another man inside the victim’s Ross townhouse.</p>
<p>Bing Liu, 37, was shot multiple times around noon inside his home in the 200 block of Elm Court.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu, who police said was a Chinese national, was found by his wife a short time later, around 12:14 p.m.</p>
<p>His shooter was found shot dead in his car about 100 yards away on Charlemagne Circle with a gunshot wound of the head, Ross police Sgt. Brian Kohlhepp said Monday.</p>
<p>The attacker, who was in his mid-40s and lived in the North Hills, according to the sergeant, has not been publicly identified.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An autopsy found that Mr. Liu was shot multiple times, including in the head, neck and torso.</p>
<p>Sgt. Kohlhepp said the men knew each other.</p>
<p>He declined to comment on a possible motive, but said no other suspect is at large.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu had the front and rear patio doors open to his townhouse at the time he was killed because the weather was nice, so there was no need for forced entry, Sgt. Kohlhepp said. His wife was not home at the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>Police are still looking into whether there was any confrontation that preceded the shooting. Sgt. Kohlhepp said there was no indication that anything was stolen, and the townhouse did not appear to have been ransacked.</p>
<p>The sergeant declined to release further information about how police determined that the attacker killed himself.</p>
<p>A formal ruling from the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office about the cause and manner of the man’s death is pending.</p>
