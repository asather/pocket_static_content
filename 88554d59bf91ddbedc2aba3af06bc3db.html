<h1>Attorney demands that jailhouse witness in Wilkinsburg mass shooting be charged for baby's slaying </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An attorney representing the family of a toddler who was killed in 2013 is demanding charges be filed after they learned last week that a man who had allegedly confessed to the slaying has not been prosecuted.</p>
<p>That man, identified as Witness No. 3 in court documents and hearings relative to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/28/wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-cheron-shelton-robert-thomas-witness/stories/202001280131" target="_blank">the 2016 mass shooting in Wilkinsburg</a>, is a cooperating witness in that case, and as many as 12 others.</p>
<p>The Wilkinsburg case is scheduled to go to trial on Monday</p>
<p>Paul Jubas, who represents the family of Marcus White Jr., who was killed at a family picnic in East Hills on May 21, 2013, said that the 15-month-old's mother, Jameela Tyler, learned through social media just Friday that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/24/Wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-Key-jailhouse-witness-Allegheny-County-Police-Robert-Thomas-Cheron-Shelton/stories/202001240152" target="_blank">Witness No. 3 admitted his participation</a> in the crime. The social media posts followed media coverage of the Wilkinsburg case.</p>
<p>"This information was not provided to her by law enforcement or the District Attorney’s office, as required by the Pennsylvania Crime Victims Act. Instead, this information came out in open court in a separate case," Mr. Jubas said in a news release Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>He is having a news conference on the issue Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>At a hearing on Friday, Casey White, a defense attorney for Robert Thomas, who is charged in the Wilkinsburg case, said that he obtained a four-minute recording Witness No. 3 gave to investigators in March 2018, in which the man admits his involvement in Marcus' death.</p>
<p>Mr. White objected to having not had that information previously turned over by the prosecution.</p>
<p>As Mr. White cross-examined ATF Agent Neil Carman about Witness No. 3 during that hearing, he asked if the witness had been given a promise that he would not be prosecuted in the baby's death in exchange for his testimony.</p>
<p>The prosecution objected before the agent could answer.</p>
<p>The agent did say, however, that Allegheny County police had provided Witness No. 3 with financial compensation and relocation services as part of his cooperation.</p>
<p>At a hearing on Tuesday, it was revealed that Witness No. 3 knows about or has been involved in as many as a dozen crimes.</p>
<p>Witness No. 3 is also charged separately with aggravated assault for shooting into a crowd gathered for a vigil in Homewood in September 2015 which wounded a 3-year-old.</p>
<p>In his news release, Mr. Jubas demanded that criminal charges be filed in the shooting death of the baby.</p>
<p>"The Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office has a troubled history with unsolved murders," he wrote. "It is astounding that the District Attorney has elected to protect a confessed baby-killer. The choice to protect a confessed baby-killer, as opposed to providing justice to Baby Marcus and his family, proves that the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office has lost its way. It is difficult to imagine a more disappointing perversion of justice."</p>
<p>In the release, Mr. Jubas said that Marcus' family is calling for the resignation of District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr. " for the decision to not charge this confessed baby-killer with criminal homicide, for keeping this information from Jameela Tyler and her family, and for denying Baby Marcus justice."</p>
<p>A message left late for the DA's office was not returned.</p>
