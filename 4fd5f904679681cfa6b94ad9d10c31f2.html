<p>Experts on the White House Coronavirus Task Force expressed alarm on Tuesday over infection rates in New York City, and advised people who have passed through or left the city to place themselves into 14-day quarantine.</p>
<p>Dr. Deborah Birx, the coronavirus response coordinator, said new infection hot spots on Long Island indicate that people leaving the city are already spreading the virus.</p>
<p>“Everybody who was in New York should be self-quarantining for the next 14 days to ensure the virus doesn’t spread to others no matter where they have gone, whether it’s Florida, North Carolina or out to far reaches of Long Island,” she said.</p>

<p>New York City is now being treated the way parts of China and Europe have been viewed, as an epidemiological hot zone. On Monday, Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis, said he would <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/coronavirus-updates-usa-world.html#link-2106d9e2" rel="nofollow">sign an executive order</a> requiring anyone flying to the state from the New York area to observe a mandatory 14-day quarantine. Dr. Birx said that about 60% of all the new cases in the country were coming out of the metro New York area.</p>
<p>“New York City definitely is a very hot spot,” President Donald Trump said.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence made it clear that New York City is now the nation’s epicenter: “We have to deal with the New York metropolitan area as a high-risk area,” he said, telling New Yorkers, “We are with you.”</p>
