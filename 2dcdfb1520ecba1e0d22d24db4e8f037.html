<h1>Allegheny County Board of Elections addresses concerns before state primary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Board of Elections held a special meeting Tuesday to discuss 2020 election preparations with executive members of the Elections Division. The meeting was open to the public to comment or voice their concerns over the preparations process.</p>
<p>Chief among those concerns were the implementation of new election laws in Pennsylvania and information on new voting procedures.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf signed a sweeping election reform bill into law on Oct. 31. State officials say Act 77 will allow for more secure and convenient voting.</p>
<p>Along with changes such as the introduction of mail-in ballots and pushing the deadline to register to vote to 15 days before an election, the bill also allows the state to apply for a bond issuance of up to $90 million to reimburse counties for new voting machines.</p>
<p>While those at the meeting generally applauded the changes, many appeared worried about how those changes will be executed.</p>
<p>Julie Zavom, the first of eight people granted one minute to speak, noted that the board’s last major update was in September, when it approved the purchase of new voting machines.</p>
<p>“Election infrastructure is a part of national security,” Ms. Zavom said, “and so I think it’s important for you to have more regular updates on what is going on and when.”</p>
<p>Others, such as VoteAllegheny President Ron Bandes, expressed concern that a significant number of voters will not be adequately informed about the new voting systems before the state primary in April.</p>
<p>“Voters have new election laws to deal with and many know nothing about them,” Mr. Bandes said. “I spoke with the PA Department of State and they told me that they have no plans for voter education other than their website. If Allegheny County does not educate its voters about the new election laws, it simply won’t happen.”</p>
<p>Following public comments, election board members Rich Fitzgerald, Sam DeMarco and Bethany Hallam also asked questions to the five gathered members of the Election Division.</p>
<p>Director of Administrative Services Jerry Tyskiewicz, who oversees the Elections Division, and Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Evanto took the lead in assuaging everyone’s concerns.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Tyskiewicz and Mr. Evanto, Allegheny County will undertake the largest ad campaign for election and voting procedures in its history. Before the Pennsylvania primary in April and before the presidential election in November, the county will spend approximately $400,000 on ads for local TV, print, radio, signs, social media and even music streaming services like Spotify to spread news of the changes.</p>
<p>Mr. Evanto said Allegheny County will create a new website for information on how to use new electronic and paper ballots, will schedule demonstrations of the new voting machines in public spaces such as libraries and malls, and will train poll workers starting in late March.</p>
<p>Although board members and many of the onlookers were left audibly impressed when the meeting adjourned, some, like Mr. Bandes, had unanswered questions.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of good information here, but I didn’t hear anything about computer security or hiring people with computer security expertise.” Mr. Bandes said. “I didn’t hear anything about holding more demonstrations in typically disenfranchised and minority communities. There’s still so much more that needs to be discussed.”</p>
