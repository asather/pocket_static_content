<h1>Petition demands information about air pollution at U.S. Steel's Edgar Thomson Works</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The sky above U.S. Steel’s Edgar Thomson steel mill in Braddock has been repeatedly smudged in recent years by the plant’s air pollution, but what’s being done to enforce emissions rules and correct the problems is hazier still, according to the Group Against Smog and Pollution.</p>
<p>GASP on Wednesday delivered a petition to the Allegheny County Health Department calling on it to publicly disclose what’s being done to fix the “ongoing emissions events” at the 145-year-old mill, including a dense and dark plume of smoke emitted June 17.</p>
<p>The petition is signed by more than 550 residents of the industrial Mon Valley where the steel mill is located, and 16 environmental and community organizations.</p>
<p>The petition asks the health department, which is responsible for regulating industrial pollution sources and enforcement, to publicly disclose the terms of a long-promised plan to bring the mill into compliance with those regulations, identify required equipment and procedural upgrades, and detail financial penalties against the Pittsburgh-based steelmaker.</p>
<p>“While ACHD acknowledged a reddish-brown plume emanating from the plant in June, telling the public it was investigating the incident and later revealing that a faulty valve was to blame, nothing further has been publicly stated about air quality compliance at Edgar Thomson,” said GASP&nbsp;Executive Director Rachel Filippini. “What reassurance does the public have that this won’t happen again?”</p>
<p>The petition was prompted by the June 17 smoke plume, which was captured on video by the Breathe Project’s Breathe Cam.</p>
<p>But GASP also notes two instances, on Oct. 24, 2019, and April 29, 2020, when thick clouds of smoke from the mill exceeded emissions limits. GASP said the enforcement order on those violations is dated June 1, but wasn’t posted on the ACHD website until Aug. 13.</p>
<p>In Nov. 2017, the health department and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency announced a joint enforcement action against U.S. Steel for multiple air pollution and equipment violations at Edgar Thomson, but almost three years later no plan has been disclosed.</p>
<p>“The public has waited long enough for an update on this public health issue, which impacts the day-to-day lives of our neighbors living in the communities surrounding the plant, those downwind of it, and everyone in between,” Ms. Filippini said in the GASP news release. “ACHD officials have repeatedly asked residents to be patient; to trust the process. But without transparency, there can be no trust. They must provide a detailed update as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Aaron Aupperlee, a health department spokesman, said in an email response to questions that, “Due to (the) current case initiated and ongoing by the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency involving U.S. Steel in which the Allegheny County Health Department is a co-plaintiff, ACHD will not be commenting on this matter.”</p>
<p>Amanda Malkowski, a U.S. Steel spokeswoman, issued a statement saying the company has responded to numerous EPA and health department inquiries&nbsp;before and after the 2017 notice of violations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are committed to continuing to work with EPA and ACHD on implementing measures that are sensible and improve the air quality in the communities in which we operate,” Ms. Malkowski stated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said the health department’s June 1 enforcement order concerning violation notices issued in Oct. 2019 and April 2020 involved emissions from work by a third party contractor that was later terminated.&nbsp; She said the steelmaker completed corrective actions and fulfilled all requirements of the health department’s enforcement order within the allotted time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lisa Graves Marcucci, a lifelong resident of the Mon Valley and a community outreach coordinator at the Environmental Integrity Project said it’s long past time that U.S. Steel be held accountable for the ongoing emissions at Edgar Thomson.</p>
<p>Stacey Simon, an East Pittsburgh Borough councilwoman, said local residents deserve to know what pollutants are in their air so they can protect their health.</p>
<p>“It’s a no-brainer to me. Breathing is essential to human life. The activities going on at the Edgar Thomson Works impact the quality of air that we breathe,” Ms. Simon said in the Gasp release. “Knowledge is power, and we deserve to know more — so that we can do more — about the ongoing emissions issues ... .”</p>
