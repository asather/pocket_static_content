<h1>Protesters call for complete investigation into May 26 death of Aaliyah Johnson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Protesters marched through McKeesport Friday to call for a complete investigation into the death of a 32-year-old trans woman found dead after a fall from her apartment in the city.</p>
<p>Although the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s office has ruled the May 26 death of Aaliyah Johnson a suicide, Post-Gazette news partner <a href="https://pittsburgh.cbslocal.com/2020/06/12/protesters-calling-for-answers-about-aaliyah-johnson/" target="_blank">KDKA-TV has reported that an Allegheny County police investigation is continuing</a>.</p>
<p>“I feel as though it’s my duty to make sure there’s a fair investigation and we can lay rest to all speculation,” Terrance McGeorge, Aaliyah’s friend and organizer of Friday’s protest told KDKA.</p>
<p>“She was very spiritual. She was talented. She could do hair, she could dance, she could sing,” Mr. McGeorge added.</p>
<p>And people who knew Ms. Johnson say they’re not so sure she took her own life, telling KDKA&nbsp; that she spent some of her final days living in fear.</p>
<p>“This lady was receiving death threats,” said Chauntey Porter, executive director of TransYOUniting. “This lady was trying to get out of the city.”</p>
<p>“Even if she would have done something like that, there would have been a note. There was nothing there,” said Dena Stanley, founder of TransYOUniting.</p>
<p>County police told KDKA while there’s no indication of foul play at this time, they continue to comb through video as the investigation continues.</p>
