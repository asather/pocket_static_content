<h1>Philadelphia man gets 6-12 years in prison for child rape in Harrison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County judge Monday sent a child rapist to prison for six to 12 years.</p>
<p>Willie James Porter III, 45, of Philadelphia pleaded guilty Monday to one count of rape of a child and two counts of corruption of minors.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police said Porter raped one girl and sexually assaulted another while he was living in Harrison around 2014.</p>
<p>Detectives launched their investigation in February after a relative of the girls came forward. At the time, the victims were 12 and 15; police said the crimes occurred when they were 8 and 11.</p>
<p>In exchange for Porter’s guilty pleas, the Allegheny County District Attorney’s Office withdrew seven other charges.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Judge Jill E. Rangos also sentenced Porter to five years probation and ordered him to a lifetime registration as a sex offender.</p>
