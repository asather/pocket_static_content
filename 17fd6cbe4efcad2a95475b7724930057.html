<h1>Anthony McFarland active for Steelers, will make NFL debut</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If not for a misinterpretation of new NFL rules last week, Anthony McFarland would have made his professional debut in the season opener. Instead, he just had to wait six more days.</p>
<p>The Steelers’ fourth-round rookie running back is active for the first time Sunday afternoon against the Denver Broncos. He was one of six inactives in Week 1, though the Steelers actually could’ve dressed one more player under the expansion of game day rosters for 2020. It will be interesting to see how the offense might use McFarland, who’s not likely to supplant James Conner or Benny Snell but is known for his top-end speed more than any other rusher in the Steelers backfield.</p>
<p>Inactive for the Steelers are No. 3 quarterback Josh Dobbs, tight end Zach Gentry, defensive lineman Carlos Davis, linebacker Ulysees Gilbert and guard David DeCastro, who’s missing his second consecutive game with a knee injury. Those five also were inactive last week.</p>
<p>For the Broncos, No. 1 wide receiver Courtland Sutton is active after missing their season-opening loss to the Titans with a shoulder injury. Sutton was limited all week in practice. Denver’s inactives are running back Phillip Lindsay, who has turf toe,&nbsp; wide receiver Tyrie Cleveland, tight end Albert Okwuegbunam, guard Netane Muti, defensive tackle McTelvin Agim and a couple of 2019 Steelers linebackers. Inside linebacker Mark Barron will miss his second game in a row with a hamstring injury, while outside linebacker Anthony Chickillo will not get a helmet after being signed earlier this week.</p>
