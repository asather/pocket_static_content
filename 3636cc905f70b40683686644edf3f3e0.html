<h1>Gov. Wolf, state health department preparing for spread of coronavirus</h1>

<p>After officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that an outbreak of the flu-like coronavirus, which has affected thousands worldwide, is likely to spread within the United States, Pennsylvania’s Department of Health announced steps it has taken to prepare for such an event.</p>
<p>While no one in Pennsylvania has tested positive for the virus, Rachel Levine, the state’s health secretary, on Wednesday outlined steps Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration has taken to prepare for a “community spread” of the disease, also known as COVID-19. The CDC’s website says at least 14 cases have been diagnosed in the U.S. as of Tuesday.</p>
<p>To date, Wolf’s administration has activated the department of health’s emergency operations center; maintained communication and outreach with federal, state and local partners; provided symptom monitoring for residents returning to Pennsylvania from China; provided information to health care professionals, businesses and educational settings; and reviewed and adapted current pandemic flu plans for COVID-19, the state department of health said in a statement Wednesday.</p>
<p>Wendell Hissrich, Pittsburgh public safety director, recently said the city’s police, fire, EMS and Animal Care &amp; Control officials also are preparing response methods to an outbreak. Emergency officials are being trained to identify signs and symptoms and then “act accordingly,” according to Pittsburgh police spokesman Chris Togneri.</p>
<p>Officials at Carnegie Mellon University on Wednesday morning introduced new travel restrictions for all students, faculty and staff who are traveling to China and South Korea for university business. A warning was issued out of an “abundance of caution” for those planning international travel during the coming spring break as well, school authorities said in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those planning personal travel to China and South Korea were urged to “reconsider such plans.”</p>
<p>“Since the start of this outbreak, we’ve taken a proactive approach to prepare and carefully monitor potential cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania,” Dr. Levine said in a statement. “... We are working to make sure our health systems, first responders and county and municipal health departments have the resources they need to respond.”</p>

<p>As of Tuesday, more than 80,000 cases have been reported worldwide, including more than 2,700 deaths, the governor’s office reported. The CDC said it expects more cases in the coming days, but wants everyone to take action to help prevent the spread of the virus. Washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning surfaces and staying home if you are sick, are ways citizens can be proactive, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>There is currently no vaccine or drug available to treat the virus, officials said.</p>
<p>“We know through our work with CDC in planning for disease outbreaks that it is best to prepare now.” Dr. Levine said. “The same <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/Documents/Emergency%20Preparedness/2017%20DOH%20EP%20Guide.pdf" target="_blank">family emergency plans and kits</a> that we use to prepare for flu or norovirus, and even snowstorms and floods, are important now.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html" target="_blank">The CDC’s website</a> will be updated as new information is uncovered.</p>
<p>Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as 14 days after exposure. Reported illnesses have ranged from people with few or no symptoms to people being severely ill and dying.</p>
