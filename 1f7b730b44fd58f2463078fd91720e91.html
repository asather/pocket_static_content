<h1>Man pleads to voluntary manslaughter in 2017 shooting death</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Garfield man pleaded guilty Monday to voluntary manslaughter and will serve eight to 17 years in prison.</p>
<p>Dion Jackson, 22, admitted that he went to buy drugs from Raheem Porter the evening of July 24, 2017, and that Porter was killed during the sale.</p>
<p>But it wasn’t a bullet fired by Jackson that killed the victim. According to the prosecution, Porter was killed when a bullet fired by his friend inadvertently struck Porter instead.</p>
<p>According to Assistant District Attorney Chris Stone, Porter and his friend, Russell Page, set up a heroin sale with Jackson that evening and met him in the 1300 block of Woodbine Street in Stanton Heights.</p>
<p>Mr. Page was in the driver's seat, while Porter sat in the passenger seat. Jackson, who was supposed to be buying five bricks of heroin from Porter, got in the back seat behind Porter. After he received the heroin, Mr. Stone said, Jackson stalled and then brandished a gun, pointing it at Page's head.</p>
<p>Mr. Page, who was licensed to carry a gun, swatted Jackson's gun away with his right hand, but it went off striking Mr. Page in the collarbone.</p>
<p>Mr. Page tried to return fire with his left hand, Mr. Stone said. He got off two shots, but one of them entered Porter's back, and the other struck the car’s console.</p>
<p>Jackson fled from the car, while Mr. Page raced Porter to the emergency room at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, where he was pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Mr. Page and Porter had been friends since childhood.</p>
<p>Investigators said they were able to link Jackson to the drug deal through messages on Facebook, as well as phone records.</p>
<p>Mr. Page also was able to identify him through a photo lineup, Mr. Stone said.</p>
<p>Kimmeeko Porter, the victim’s mother, said she feels guilty in her son’s death.</p>
<p>He had asked her to borrow money to pay fines he owed from a 2016 plea to possession with intent to deliver after police found 127 stamp bags of heroin hidden inside his pants during an arrest in 2015. He was sentenced to two years of probation.</p>
<p>Ms. Porter said she refused to give him the money, instead telling him he was a grown man who needed to be responsible.</p>
<p>“If I would have gave him this money, none of this would have happened, and he’d still be here,” she said. “He did this so he could pay off a couple months of his fines.”</p>
<p>Ms. Porter told Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Jill E. Rangos that she has two other sons, now 7 and 16, who have completely changed since their brother’s death.</p>
<p>“I want my kids back,” she said. “I want them to be who they normally are.”</p>
<p>But at the same time, Ms. Porter continued, she knows that she has changed, too.</p>
<p>“My kids tell me I’m not the same. I’m not fun anymore, I’m mean,” she said. “I want to be happy again, but I can’t</p>
<p>“My heart is so empty.”</p>
<p>Judge Rangos praised Ms. Porter for being able to go on.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine losing a child,” the judge said. “The strength that you’ve had through this for your two sons, for Raheem’s daughter, is commendable.</p>
<p>She continued: “I hope you will find healing, peace and comfort and that you will process this in a way that will allow you to overcome the guilt.</p>
<p>“Your son was an adult.”</p>
