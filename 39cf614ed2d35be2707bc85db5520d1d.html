<h1>Pennsylvania courts continue as COVID-19 concerns grow; jurors age 60, or with health issues can receive deferment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania’s courts continue to function in the face of COVID-19, but officials have announced some changes with potential for more.</p>
<p>Jurors who are age 60 and above, or who have health issues, can contact the Office of Jury Management for a deferment. The Allegheny County office can be reached at 412-350-5336.</p>
<p>All divisions within the court have met to develop accommodations, including keeping numbers of people in one room to a minimum, said Stacey&nbsp;Witalec, spokeswoman for the Pennsylvania courts. For example, special hearings for first-time offenders were taken individually Friday morning, rather than in groups, she said.</p>
<p>Public access to the Pennsylvania Judicial Center in Harrisburg became limited at noon Friday to only staff and lawyers, litigants and witnesses involved in scheduled hearings or who are filing papers or pleadings, according to a news release.</p>
<p>“We’re looking at all avenues to minimize large groups so that we can stay focused on functions and activities as a court,” Ms. Witalec said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County courts are expected to release a more detailed plan next week, she said.</p>
<p>The state courts are providing updates <a href="http://www.pacourts.us/ujs-coronavirus-information" target="_blank">online</a> and on Facebook at @pennsylvaniacourts and on Twitter @PACourts.</p>
