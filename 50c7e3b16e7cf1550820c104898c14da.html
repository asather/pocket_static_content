<h1>Steelers sign two more rookies, WR Chase Claypool and S Antoine Brooks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers are now officially two-thirds of the way through making sure their 2020 rookie class are inked to shiny new contracts.</p>
<p>On Wednesday evening, safety Antoine Brooks, the Steelers’ sixth-round selection out of Maryland, posted a photo on Instagram of himself putting pen to paper.</p>
<p>Not long after Brooks announced his signing, receiver Chase Claypool did the same on Twitter.</p>
<p>The Notre Dame product was picked by the Steelers 49th overall in the second round of April’s draft. Claypool signed his rookie contract almost exactly a month after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/22/Current-former-Pittsburgh-athletes-give-dads-unforgettable-Father-s-Day-weekend/stories/202006220083" target="_blank">buying his dad</a> a brand new truck for Father’s Day.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is inching its way toward getting all its rookies signed before training camp starts on July 28. On Tuesday, both linebacker Alex Highsmith (third-round pick, Charlotte) and running back Anthony McFarland (fourth-round pick, Maryland) <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/21/steelers-draft-picks-signed-rookie-deals-alex-highsmith-2020/stories/202007210101" target="_blank">agreed to terms</a> with the team.</p>
<p>That just leaves guard Kevin Dotson (fourth-round pick, Louisiana) and nose tackle Carlos Davis (seventh-round pick, Nebraska) who have yet to finalize their rookie deals with the Steelers.</p>
