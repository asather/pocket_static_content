<h1>Linda Dickerson was a passionate advocate for people with disabilities.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Linda Dickerson, a magazine publisher, business consultant and prominent advocate for people with disabilities, died Saturday morning at her family’s farm in Greensburg.</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson, who lived in Gateway Towers, Downtown, passed away in her sleep, said Steve Irwin, an attorney and good friend of Ms. Dickerson’s.</p>
<p>She was 59. The cause of death is pending.</p>
<p>“She supported a lot of initiatives and raised a lot of money for countless non-profits,” said Jamie Hudzik, who worked at Ms. Dickerson’s consulting firm for nearly a decade starting in 2009.&nbsp;“She was an amazing person. She deserves to be remembered for all the good she did.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson was actively working on charitable campaigns up until her death, Mr. Irwin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the last several years, Ms. Dickerson used a breathing tube and communicated with a device that allowed her to speak using eye movements.</p>
<p>“The breathing tube was not an impediment to her. She emailed incessantly, mouthed quite a bit and spoke through the eye gaze,” Mr. Irwin said.</p>
<p>Diagnosed at an early age with Werdnig-Hoffmann, a rare, genetic neurosmuscular disease, Ms. Dickerson used a wheelchair for most of her life. But from the time she was growing up in Greensburg, her own physical limitations drove her to become independent of her parents and help others with disabilities, said her father, Logan Dickerson.</p>
<p>“She only asked me for help when she knew she had to have it,” he said in a 2015 interview with the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>One of those occasions was when Ms. Dickerson wanted to expand her office space in Gateway Towers to make it more accessible for her clients who had disabilities.</p>
<p>Her father helped her buy several more condominiums in the building and renovated them to comply with the federal Americans with Disabilities Act.</p>
<p>“Then they could meet with her without her or them having to travel,” he said.</p>
<p>The consulting firm she owned and operated — 501(c)(3)2 — specializes in strategy, research and fundraising for nonprofits and for-profit businesses.</p>
<p>It also provides pro bono work for organizations and individuals involved in disability rights issues and policy.</p>
<p>“She was driven by a deep desire to help those who will benefit and even thrive from assistance in helping themselves,” Mr. Irwin, who advised Ms. Dickerson’s business on legal matters, said in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>“She didn’t see people with disabilities as being disabled,” he said.&nbsp; “She saw them as people. Her gift was focusing on what people can do.”</p>
<p>Mr. Irwin became a close friend of Ms. Dickerson’s in 1999 after they were seated together at an annual dinner held by the Anti-Defamation League.</p>
<p>After that, they collaborated as volunteers and fundraisers for a number of nonprofit organizations including Life’s Work, the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and the Clemente Foundation.</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson’s indefatigable spirit motivated her to assist those groups and others, Mr. Irwin said.</p>
<p>“She was blessed and cursed by an impatience ... a recognition that each day is a blessing and that the time to get things done is uncertain.”</p>
<p>Among the accomplishments for which she received wide recognition was her lobbying effort for the ADA to become federal law in 1990.</p>
<p>Ginny Thornburgh, wife of former two-term Pennsylvania governor&nbsp;Dick Thornburgh, worked alongside Ms. Dickerson as they fought for ADA to become law. While many people across the state and country helped make ADA become reality, Ms. Thornburgh said Ms. Dickerson’s trusted voice of reason was specifically influential in their success.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“She was not a tall person, but a magnificently huge and respected voice,” Ms. Thornburgh, 80, of Verona, said.&nbsp;“She was one of millions of us who made that bill possible.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson was most importantly a loving friend to Ms. Thornburgh above her work as an activist.</p>
<p>“She was a wise person and a good strategist,” Ms. Thornburgh said.&nbsp;“And a lot of our work in the disability community you have to think through carefully who are your allies and how can you get done what needs to be done. And she was excellent on those issues.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In September 2015, 25 years after the legislation was enacted, the Three Rivers Community Foundation created the Linda A. Dickerson Fund for Disability Rights in her honor to provide grants to nonprofits that advocate for rights and services for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“She was instrumental in promoting that law and helping it get passed so there was a lot of interest in doing something to honor Linda,” said Nick Palazzetti, executive director of the foundation.</p>
<p>Among the boards and committees Ms. Dickerson served on that allowed her to work directly for those with disabilities were the City of Pittsburgh/Allegheny County Joint Task Force on Disabilities; Life’s Work; Three Rivers Center for Independent Living; the United Way’s Frail, Elderly and Disabled Task Force; The Children’s Institute; and the advisory board of Carnegie Library for the Blind and Physically Handicapped.</p>
<p>After graduating from Greensburg Salem High School, Ms. Dickerson earned a bachelor’s degree in marketing and small business from Carnegie Mellon University and a master’s in career studies from Duquesne University.</p>
<p>Her professional career began in publishing. In the mid-1980s she launched a monthly magazine, Executive Report, which served as a platform for her to get to know movers and shakers in Pittsburgh business and government circles. In 1997, she donated the publication to the Pittsburgh Regional Alliance.</p>
<p>She ran unsuccessfully for Allegheny County commissioner in 1995 and later opened a consulting practice, Dickerson &amp; Mangus Ink.</p>
<p>From 2007 to 2009, she was chief executive of the National Aviary but left the job citing differences with the organization over a range of issues including access for people with disabilities.</p>
<p>When she was named to that post, she told the Post-Gazette that if she could have anything it would be a good singing voice.</p>
<p>“I think [people] assume I would wish I could walk. I’ve never walked but I really wish I could sing.”</p>
<p>She was the first chair of the Allegheny Regional Asset District and served on dozens of other civic boards and advisory panels including the Homeless Children and Family Emergency Fund; Greater Pittsburgh Convention and Visitors Bureau; Carnegie Mellon University; Pittsburgh Ballet Theater; Three Rivers Workforce Investment Board; and the Greater Pittsburgh Literacy Council.</p>
<p>When she wasn’t working or involved in charity events, Ms. Dickerson spent time with friends and her dogs and loved listening to classical music, going to the theater and eating Chinese food.</p>
<p>Her death, which was a surprise, was a tremendous loss, Mr. Irwin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s nobody I know in the world who has overcome such adversity and made such a contribution in Pittsburgh and nationally,” he said.&nbsp;“She can’t be replaced.”</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson was particularly engaged in current politics, Mr. Irwin said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A life-long Republican,&nbsp;“she continued to be a Republican who stood with those who were vociferously opposed to the current administration,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Dickerson is survived by her father. She was preceded in death by her mother, Ann.</p>
<p>Funeral arrangements are pending. The family anticipates a memorial celebration in the future at Carnegie Mellon University, her alma mater.</p>
<p>Memorial donations can be made to the organization through which people were most touched by her hard work and contributions, Mr. Irwin said.</p>
