<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The three Squirrel Hill-based congregations that suffered the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history will give a sizable donation to Pittsburgh’s Department of Public Safety.</p>
<p>The Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha congregations received donations from across the globe following the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/pittsburgh-squirrel-hill-synagogue-massacre/" target="_blank">Oct. 27, 2018, mass shooting attack on the Tree of Life synagogue building</a> that claimed the lives of <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">11 people</a> and injured several more, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/10/24/Pittsburgh-police-officers-shot-Tree-of-Life-recovering-one-year/stories/201910240175" target="_blank">including multiple Pittsburgh Police officers</a>.</p>
<p>Now they give back to the city’s first responders with a $200,000 donation for equipment, supplies and training.</p>
<p>“Each of three congregations received part of those donations. As a whole all three congregations, the Jewish community, all of us, wanted to thank the city of Pittsburgh for their response,” said Barb Feige, executive director of the Tree of Life - Or L’Simcha congregation.&nbsp;“...&nbsp;We're so incredibly grateful to the first responders, and we hope that this helps. God forbid this happens again, but should it, they will be even better prepared to save lives.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Safety officials said that the funds will&nbsp;used for vehicles and equipment for active threat and mass casualty situations. “... Two of the survivors of the deadly attack on Tree of Life are alive today due to the efforts of our Police and Tactical Medics,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich in a statement.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh Public Safety is incredibly grateful for this generous grant from Tree of Life,” he said. “Even during this very uncertain time, the Board of Trustees of the Tree of Life, New Light, and Dor Hadash congregations, along with the Independent Committee, deemed our City's first responders worthy recipients of the money, which came from donations to the synagogue.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council must approve the donation to the Pittsburgh Public Safety Support Trust Fund. The body will discuss the donation at next Wednesday’s standing committee meeting.</p>
<p>In the months following the attack, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2020/03/09/Distribution-planned-for-Tree-of-Life-donations/stories/202003090098" target="_blank">three congregations received $5.45 million in donations</a>. Separately, the&nbsp;Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh raised another $6.3 million.</p>
