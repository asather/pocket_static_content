<p>Love is in the air with dads, daughters and dance.</p>
<p>More than 150 attended the Ties &amp; Tiaras father/daughter dance at the Bethel Park Community Center Saturday night, featuring a DJ, treats and prizes. The Bethel Park Recreation Department sponsored the event near Valentine’s Day as a way to bring everyone closer together.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to give my girls a good time and to show them how a man should be treating them when they grow up,” said&nbsp;Eric Pinero, of Bethel Park, who danced with his daughters Ava Lynn, 7, and Mari Belle, 5.</p>
<p>Another father, Jason Hill, of West Mifflin, said his 5-year-old daughter Ireland has “talked about this since we attended last year and she’s been looking forward to it ever since, so I couldn’t say no.”</p>
