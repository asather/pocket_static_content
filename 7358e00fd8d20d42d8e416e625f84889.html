<h1>ScareHouse will open Bold Escape Rooms in Strip for Valentine's Day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you like your Valentine’s Day with a little Halloween mixed in you’ll be happy to learn that the ScareHouse is finally debuting the new attractions it tried to unveil in October.</p>
<p>Bold Escape Rooms will open Friday at the ScareHouse’s new location in the Strip District. The two experiences: are Stalked by a Killer and data/bass with each featuring “intricate sets and unique puzzles in immersive adventures that can last up to an hour.”</p>
<p>ScareHouse creative director Scott Simmons said in a press release that the permit delays for the attractions in October for The Scream District led to a decision to open the brand-new escape rooms and re-introduce The Basement.</p>
<p>“So many people are desperate to escape the terrors of Valentine’s Day that when we realized last fall that we could not open our ‘Scream District’ concept on time and as planned, we began targeting this frightful, creepy, anxiety-laden day for the launch of our permanent escape rooms and the return of ‘The Basement,’” Simmons says.</p>
<p>It is located at 2420 Penn Ave. Tickets start at $49.99 for a double ticket (admission for two people) and $34.99 for single admission. Admission to the escape rooms, each of which is purchased separately, is $26.95 each. Tickets for all attractions at BOLD ESCAPE ROOMS can be purchased online at <a href="https://www.boldescaperooms.com/" target="_blank">www.BoldEscapeRooms.com</a>. Advance booking is strongly recommended.</p>
<p>Bold Escape Rooms will also feature the return of The Basement, the 18-and over horror experience, through February.</p>
