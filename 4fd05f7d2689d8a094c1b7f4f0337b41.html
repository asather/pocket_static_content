<p>Allegheny County will send mail-in ballot applications to every registered voter in the county who hasn’t already applied for one, officials announced Friday.</p>
<p>The county is currently “finalizing” the mailings — which will include an application and a postage-paid envelope addressed back to the county elections office, according to a press release.</p>
<p>County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, who earlier this week called on the governor to use his emergency powers to allow counties to send actual mail-in ballots to voters, said that without that authority, officials are&nbsp;“moving forward” with sending the applications.</p>

<p>The move follows weeks of lawmakers and local officials encouraging Pennsylvanians to apply for mail-in ballots if they’re concerned about the viability of voting in-person on June 2 in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald has warned that encouragement isn’t enough, and that holding in-person voting on June 2 would be a&nbsp;“disaster.”</p>
<p>The county has received more than 71,000 absentee and mail-in ballot applications so far, the release said — 20,000 of which have been processed already.</p>
