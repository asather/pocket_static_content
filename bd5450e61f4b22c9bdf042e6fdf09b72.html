<h1>Obituary: Amil Padezanin was a staple of the Freedom community</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was one of those stereotypically sweltering summer days in Arlington, Va. High heat, and even higher humidity.</p>
<p>Dan Zachem was pulling into the driveway of his new house when he saw his father-in-law, Amil Padezanin, sweating profusely and sitting on a milk crate in the garage, with a chisel and hammer in his hands. He was chipping excess pieces of cement leftover from construction off the wall before resealing and repainting the room.</p>
<p>The job took all day, but he kept at it despite Mr. Zachem’s urgent pleas that he come inside to avoid having a heart attack. Mr. Padezanin was out there for more than 12 hours before calling it quits, only after the job was done.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t stop working,” Mr. Zachem said. “If he started on a project, it didn’t matter what it was. … This man doesn’t stop until it’s 4 o’clock in the afternoon, until he does it and re-does it and does it again until it’s absolutely perfect.”</p>
<p>Those were the values that defined the man who lived his life as a staple of the community in Freedom before dying April 12 because of COVID-19. He was 89, one day shy of his 90th birthday.</p>
<p>Born and raised in Beaver County to a family of eight brothers and sisters, Mr. Padezanin immersed himself in his community from an early age. He played football at Freedom High School and never really left, attending hundreds of Bulldogs games over the years.</p>
<p>After serving in the Marines during the Korean War, Mr. Padezanin joined the town council, planned community events and became a dedicated member of the local Serbian Club while raising his family of two daughters — Kathy and Karen — alongside his wife, Martha, known throughout the community as “Mutsie.”</p>
<p>He spent his working life mostly at Conway rail yard&nbsp;in Freedom, where he labored as a brakeman for 42 years, taking pride in the daily grind in a way that rubbed off on family members in profound ways. His daughter Kathy, for example, once declined to have her name added to the name of her law firm upon earning a partnership.</p>
<p>“ ‘That’s not why I do this,’ ” her husband quoted her as saying. “ ‘I don’t do this for the money, I don’t do this for the recognition. I do this for the sake of doing the work.’ And she means it. It’s not some B.S. sales pitch. And she got that from her father.”</p>
<p>A chip off the old cement block, one could say.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/faces-of-covid-19/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/04/15/faces-of-covid-19-stories-behind-local-lives-lost" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>That same effort permeated family and social life. Mr. Zachem recalled elaborate, multi-course meals served at Orthodox Christmas Eve celebrations that drew dozens of family members and friends to the home Mr. Padezanin had built himself in Freedom. Lamb and pig on a spit — his favorites — were staples, though he was far from a picky eater. A dazzling array of foods would cross his table on those nights, too.</p>
<p>Festivities including sensible amounts of light beer and Slivovitz continued into the night. Well past Mr. Zachem’s bed time. Yet every time he arose in the morning, he’d be stunned to find the house spotless.</p>
<p>Mr. Padezanin went the extra mile for his sports teams, too. In the 1970s, he scored tickets to watch AFC championship games multiple times. He held season tickets for Pitt basketball and even followed the Panthers to New York for the Big East basketball tournament on several occasions.</p>
<p>And of course, it all happened in the context of a loving marriage that endured for 69 years. Mr. Zachem said he never heard the couple argue in his decades knowing them. Yell, perhaps, but always with love. Their secret?</p>
<p>“Marry your best friend and then leave them alone,” Mr. Zachem recalls Mrs. Padezanin telling him.</p>
<p>The pair moved to Arlington about seven years ago as Mr. Padezanin fought Alzheimer’s. They lived in apartment near the Zachems for a time until Mr. Padezanin required care in a memory care facility in Annandale, Va., about five years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Zachem said he remained very healthy physically until his last couple of weeks. His family last saw him in early March before his facility closed to visitors because of coronavirus concerns. A few weeks later, after running a mild fever for about 10 days, he tested positive for COVID-19 and died as his breathing became labored just a few days later.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, his daughters, their husbands and his only granddaughter, Alex Zachem, who lives in Los Angeles. Mr. Zachem was the only family member to attend his internment back in Freedom in hopes of limiting further spread of the virus. A wake in Mr. Padezanin’s memory will be held when the threat passes.</p>
<p>For now, Mr. Zachem said he’ll remember the man he called his “best friend” fondly for how he lived his life alongside his beloved Mutsie, the scene of him quietly toiling away in that hot garage fresh in his mind.</p>
<p>“They appreciate everything and complain about nothing,” Mr. Zachem said. “It’s remarkable. Absolutely remarkable.”</p>
