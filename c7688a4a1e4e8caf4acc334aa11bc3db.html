<h1>Steelers mailbag: Why a trade is not realistic — at least not yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Congratulations, @phinsanity32, you made it into a Steelers mailbag. Sometimes our most enticing topics come from the most unexpected sources.</p>
<p>Anyway, this question did get me thinking about something I was asked in my chat this week, as well. Everyone who follows or covers the Steelers can pretty much agree that the depth chart is fairly crowded at two spots on offense, wide receiver and running back. And given that the Steelers have some thin ranks elsewhere — looking at you, inside linebacker — the armchair GM in all of us might entertain the idea of trading positions of strength to shore up a weakness.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing — actually, a few things.</p>
<p><em>Thing No. 1:</em> Why would any team trade for a running back right now? Sure, the Steelers have a lot to like in their backfield, from James Conner to Benny Snell to Jaylen Samuels, not to mention Anthony McFarland, who’s only a rookie. Wendell Smallwood and Kerrith Whyte are nice options, too, but no other team wanted to sign Smallwood before the Steelers snagged him last month, and Whyte hung out on Chicago’s practice squad all last year until the Steelers were decimated by injuries. Then you look at the current free agents out there now, and guys such as Devonta Freeman and Spencer Ware are on the street, so why would any team trade for one? In other words, the value of any Steelers running back would most likely be low.</p>
<p><em>Thing No. 2:</em> Back to JuJu, he may well be in his final year here, but trading him in 2020 would be quite risky, especially if you still believe in him as the best receiver on this team. Because while there’s plenty of potential in a receiver trio of Diontae Johnson, James Washington and Chase Claypool, let’s not pretend it’s a sure thing. Johnson had an exciting, but also inconsistent rookie year. Washington improved, but not enough to keep the Steelers from drafting another outside receiver. And as far as Claypool goes, do you really want to trust a second-round pick to be a key contributor after he didn’t even get a real offseason under his belt? Perhaps Washington would be the most logical trade chip, but again, you’d be putting a lot of confidence in Claypool — or another receiver lower on this depth chart (Ryan Switzer? Deon Cain?) — in that scenario. If it turns out the Steelers have an abundance of playmakers on their hands, maybe then there’s a realistic possibility of dealing Smith-Schuster mid-season.</p>
<p><em>Thing No. 3:</em> In case you haven’t noticed, in an entirely bizarre training camp/preseason, teams have a lot more to consider than potential trades. There has been one such transaction in August, and when the Patriots dealt for second-year cornerback Michael Jackson Sr., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Uj3zitETs4" target="_blank">they weren’t starting something</a>. That was Aug. 9, and there hasn’t been a trade since. There also have been just four trades since the draft, three of which were in July, one of which was voided. Given all the uncertainty, it might not be a great year for wheeling and dealing, even for a Steelers front office that made four trades last year between Aug. 31 and Sept. 25 and has made at least one preseason trade five seasons in a row.</p>
<p><strong>Jim B. in Burke, Va.:</strong> Hi Brian, when was the last time Steelers ownership actually fired anyone of significance? What I mean is to actually fire them rather than just let their contract expire. Seems like the Rooneys are really beholden to contracts and don’t actually fire coaches, management, etc. Is this a euphemistic way to get around a practice they are not comfortable doing? Was the last example the Bruce Arians “retirement” announcement?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> I don’t think it’s euphemistic, Jim, as much as it simply speaks to their way of doing business. Not a lot of snap decisions or impatient bosses in the Steelers organization, as evidenced by having three head coaches in 51 years.</p>
<p>But to answer your question, it depends on what you’d consider someone “of significance.” If it’s limited to head coaches and general manager-types, you’d have to go back to the period of relative flux from 1986-91. Dan Rooney fired his brother, Art Jr., as player personnel director before the 1987 season. Dick Haley took his place, and while he wasn’t fired four years later, he elected to leave after Tom Donahoe was promoted to director of football operations, essentially a demotion for Haley.</p>
<p>If you want to expand a bit to assistant coaches, those are decisions made more often by the head coach rather than ownership, and they happen with more regularity. Mike Tomlin fired offensive line coach Jack Bicknell Jr. after just one season in 2014. On the coordinator front, special teams coordinator Al Everest was actually fired during the preseason in 2012.</p>
<p>So, no, outright firings don’t happen too often around here. There’s probably a philosophical discussion to be had about whether not renewing a coach’s contract is effectively the same thing as firing them, but we won’t be having that discussion here. What we will do is rank our favorite euphemisms for firing a coach, a list shaped by years of covering Pitt prior to the Steelers.</p>
<p><em>5. “Part ways” —</em> This one’s generally reserved for assistant coaches, often as a way to soften the blow for firing people who were nice and well-liked but still had to go.</p>
<p><em>4. “Mutually agreed to part ways” —</em> Similar to No. 5, but better because of the unspoken caveat that if it hadn’t been mutually agreed upon to be mutually agreed upon, it would just look worse for the person being fired.</p>
<p><em>3. “Leadership change” —</em> A relatively new one in the sports world, it’s comical and also great because you don’t even have to use any sort of action verb. Just announce that you’re making a leadership change, and your head coach will no longer be your head coach, like it’s magic.</p>
<p><em>2. “Relieved of duties” —</em> Kind of an old school phrase, but someone should make an effort to revive it. To me it almost implies that you’ve been so bad at your job you don’t even want to do it anymore yourself, so the team is providing some sort of relief for you, in addition to them.</p>
<p><em>1. “Terminated” —</em> Just an all-around great term. If your contract gets terminated, you really screwed up. Using the word “termination” really gives it an air of not only are you being parted ways with (hopefully, mutually), not only is there a change in leadership, not only are you being relieved of your duties, but any paper trail of employment is being violently shredded as soon as possible.</p>
<p><em>Honorable mention:</em> “Dismissed,” “released,” or simply “cut,” which is so commonplace in football that we forget it’s just another way of saying a player has been fired.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:</strong> Whereas a lot is written about Ben going down as to why the offense sputtered, should RF also get some blame? It seems like he could have had a better gameplan especially down the stretch when the defense was just starting to dominate</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Yes, and offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner did get some blame. In the Post-Gazette alone, there was this <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2019/12/31/randy-fichtner-steelers-offense-2019-duck-hodges-mason-rudolph-lamar-jackson-ravens/stories/201912310087" target="_blank">Joe Starkey column</a> exploring “How much blame goes to ‘Coach Randy’ for Steelers’ hideous offense?” and this <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/paul-zeise/2020/01/02/pittsburgh-steelers-offensive-coordinator-Randy-Fichtner-paul-zeise/stories/202001020148" target="_blank">Paul Zeise column</a> saying Fichtner doesn’t deserve a pass, and this <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/29/Steelers-Ravens-report-card-Devlin-Hodges-Benny-Snell-Diontae-Johnson/stories/201912290159" target="_blank">Ray Fittipaldo report card</a> from the season finale at Baltimore in which the coaches — Fichtner included — get a failing grade. So not only did Fichtner get some blame, but he also got relieved of one of his duties — in the literal sense — when the Steelers hired Matt Canada to be the full-time quarterbacks coach and gave Fichtner the sole role of offensive coordinator and play-caller.</p>
<p>But here’s why Fichtner should have and did keep his job for a third season in 2020. In 2018, which is either “two years ago now” or “just two years ago” depending on your perspective, the Steelers offense — coordinated by Fichtner, quarterbacked by Ben Roethlisberger — ranked sixth in the NFL in yards per play, sixth in passing touchdowns and tied for seventh in rushing touchdowns. The primary issues were turnovers and balance — two problems that were linked, given that Roethlisberger led the league in interceptions — and outside of six quarters in 2019, Fichtner and his quarterback didn’t get a chance to try to fix those two things.</p>
<p>Maybe the offense as a whole will look better this season, or maybe it won’t. But only until we see more of it, more of Fichtner and Roethlisberger working together, will we have a better grasp of whether this coordinator is the right man for the job.</p>
<p><strong>David D.:</strong> Any update on Mr. Hillgrove’s health? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Well, not sure what exactly you mean by an update on his health, because he did return to work <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/25/bill-hillgrove-2019-dapper-dan-dinner-and-sports-auction-lifetime-achievement/stories/202001270002" target="_blank">during Pitt basketball conference play</a> after missing the end of last Steelers season due to back surgery. But the latest on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/19/Steelers-Pitt-Panthers-Westmoreland-County-Murrysville-Bill-Hillgrove/stories/202006190105" target="_blank">Bill Hillgrove’s DUI charges</a> from two months ago are that he’s scheduled for a formal arraignment Oct. 28 before Judge Timothy Krieger.</p>
<p>And on a related note, in a recent chat of mine, someone wondered whether the Steelers broadcast team will be calling games on-site or from a studio, and I said I’d look into it. The Steelers are still working through those logistics, and like many team decisions in this season of COVID-19, it could also be up to the NFL in the end.</p>
