<h1>Appeals court sends sex misconduct case against Butler County judge back to lower court</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 3rd U.S. Cir­cuit Court of Ap­peals sent a sex­ual mis­con­duct case against a But­ler County judge back to U.S. Dis­trict Court, say­ing the lower court in­cor­rectly de­nied him qual­i­fied im­mu­nity.</p>
<p>The Court of Ap­peals af­firmed most of the lower court’s or­der, which re­jected Judge Tho­mas Do­err’s qual­i­fied im­mu­nity de­fense in the civil suit.</p>
<p>But the ap­pel­late court dis­agreed when the Dis­trict Court de­nied Judge Do­err, the pres­i­dent judge of the But­ler County Court of Com­mon Pleas, qual­i­fied im­mu­nity on the plain­tiff’s claim that his al­leged ha­rass­ment vi­o­lated her First Amend­ment rights.</p>
<p>Judge Do­err is en­ti­tled to qual­i­fied im­mu­nity in that claim be­cause nei­ther the plain­tiff nor the Dis­trict Court’s rul­ing “al­leges a vi­o­la­tion of a clearly es­tab­lished right,” the opin­ion states. The Court of Ap­peals re­versed the de­ci­sion and re­manded it to the lower court.</p>
<p>The plain­tiff ar­gued Judge Do­err vi­o­lated her First Amend­ment as­so­ci­a­tion rights by co­erc­ing her to main­tain their sex­ual re­la­tion­ship even af­ter it had ended. She al­leged he in­sisted she ap­pear in her court so he could “look her over,” that he trans­ferred her to a dif­fer­ent di­vi­sion so she could “be close to him” and that he scolded her when she spoke to other men at work.</p>
<p>She also noted that Judge Do­err ran into her and her then-boy­friend at a Lowe’s store and said he hoped they were off the clock.</p>
<p>The plain­tiff ar­gued that she and her hus­band “were sub­jected to ha­rass­ment at the hands of the Court’s ad­min­is­tra­tion un­der the di­rec­tion or ac­qui­es­cence of Do­err,” even­tu­ally caus­ing her hus­band to re­tire, court doc­u­ments state. The court noted that the plain­tiff and her hus­band mar­ried de­spite the ha­rass­ment.</p>
<p>“Nei­ther the Supreme Court nor this Court has held that un­mar­ried, ro­man­tic part­ners have a fun­da­men­tal right to in­ti­mate as­so­ci­a­tion,” Judge Tho­mas Har­diman wrote in the opin­ion.</p>
<p>The ap­pel­late court also took is­sue with the cases cited by the lower court to sup­port its de­nial of the judge’s qual­i­fied im­mu­nity.</p>
<p>One such case in­volved a sub­ject of a po­lice in­ves­ti­ga­tion who com­plained that an of­fi­cer lied to the sub­ject’s wife, costing him his mar­riage. “A po­lice of­fi­cer’s dis­hon­esty is not suf­fi­ciently sim­i­lar to ha­rass­ment in the work­place,” the opin­ion states.</p>
<p>Another in­volved a case “where a wife was al­leg­edly ter­mi­nated from her po­si­tion as su­per­in­ten­dent of a cor­rec­tional fa­cil­ity be­cause of her mar­riage to a train­ing of­fi­cer at the same fa­cil­ity.”</p>
<p>“This is not enough to con­sti­tute a ro­bust con­sen­sus of case­law to put any rea­son­able of­fi­cial on no­tice that ha­rass­ment vi­o­lates an em­ployee’s as­so­ci­a­tion rights,” Judge Har­diman wrote.</p>
<p>But even if that right had been es­tab­lished, the ar­gu­ment would not be ap­pli­ca­ble in this case since the re­mark Judge Do­err made to the plain­tiff at Lowe’s “is in­suf­fi­cient to es­tab­lish di­rect and sub­stan­tial in­ter­fer­ence with her right to es­tab­lish or main­tain that re­la­tion­ship.”</p>
<p>Despite re­vers­ing that de­ci­sion, the Court of Ap­peals up­held most of the lower court’s or­ders de­ny­ing Judge Do­err qual­i­fied im­mu­nity.</p>
<p>Law­yers for Judge Do­err and the plain­tiff did not im­me­di­ately re­spond to re­quests for com­ment.</p>
<p>The plain­tiff orig­i­nally sued Judge Do­err af­ter al­leg­ing mul­ti­ple in­stances of mis­con­duct and ha­rass­ment. She said he in­vited her to his cham­bers mul­ti­ple times af­ter they met at a Christ­mas party.</p>
<p>After mul­ti­ple re­fus­als, she said they had in­ter­course in the judge’s cham­bers, court doc­u­ments state. She claimed the judge’s ad­vances were un­wel­comed, and he told her that their sex­ual in­ter­ac­tions were a “busi­ness re­la­tion­ship,” with the un­der­stand­ing that the re­la­tion­ship would lead to her get­ting her de­sired job as a pro­ba­tion of­fi­cer.</p>
<p>When she be­came a pro­ba­tion of­fi­cer in 2005, she al­leges that Judge Do­err be­gan sum­mon­ing her to his cham­bers, per­suad­ing her to have sex, shar­ing por­nog­ra­phy with her and dis­cuss­ing sex on the tele­phone, be­hav­ior that con­tin­ued for four years.</p>
<p>When they ceased sex­ual re­la­tions in 2009, Judge Do­err con­tin­ued his ad­vances, ask­ing her to film her­self per­form­ing sex­ual acts, flirt­ing with her from the bench, hold­ing her “hand while ex­plain­ing that he could help her re­turn to her pre­vi­ous job” and in­ter­rupt­ing her when he saw her speak­ing to male staff, ac­cord­ing to the law­suit.</p>
<p>After briefly leav­ing the pro­ba­tion of­fice, she re­turned and was de­nied op­por­tu­ni­ties that her male coun­ter­parts had, such as her own of­fice, over­time and train­ing op­por­tu­ni­ties, she said.</p>
<p>When she told su­per­vi­sors she planned to file a com­plaint with the Equal Em­ploy­ment Op­por­tu­nity Com­mis­sion, Judge Do­err placed her on a “per­for­mance im­prove­ment plan” de­spite that she had re­ceived a good per­for­mance re­view two months prior.</p>
