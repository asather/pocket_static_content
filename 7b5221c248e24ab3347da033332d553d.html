<h1>Dominik Simon week-to-week with upper-body injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Adding depth to the forward corps was one of the goals this trade season, when the Penguins acquired four new players in the span of a couple weeks. Now, just days after the deadline, it’s time to show it.</p>
<p>Dominik Simon is week-to-week with an upper-body injury, coach Mike Sullivan said on Monday.</p>
<p>The forward, who left Saturday’s loss in the third period, has tallied seven goals and 15 assists this year while playing on a number of different lines. During an injury-ravaged season, he was also one of just four Penguins who played in all 64 games. The others are Brandon Tanev, Teddy Blueger and Marcus Pettersson.</p>
<p>Even before Simon was injured, there were questions as to where he would fit into the Penguins’ new-look lineup that has added new faces and returned several players from injury. His puck possession skills and ability to navigate in tight spaces makes him a complementary piece when paired with Sidney Crosby, even if his finishing ability leaves something to be desired. However, with Connor Sheary back in the fold after a trade from Buffalo, Simon had slid from Crosby’s right wing down the lineup.</p>
<p>The other injury news was more encouraging. Defensemen John Marino and Brian Dumoulin are game-time decisions for Tuesday night’s game against the Ottawa Senators. Nick Bjugstad skated with contact on Monday for the first time since his core muscle surgery. He’s been ruled out for Tuesday’s game but is tracking in the right direction and nearing a return.</p>
