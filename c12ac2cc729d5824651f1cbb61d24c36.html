<h1>City man gets federal prison for heroin dealing after Jefferson Hills investigation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh man convicted of manslaughter for shooting a man during a fight outside a hotel in 2012 will spend more than six years in federal prison for dealing drugs.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon on Monday imposed a term of 75 months on Tyrone Swan, 30, who was on parole for the shooting when he committed the drug offenses.</p>
<p>His co-conspirator, Daroy Murphy, received 15 months last year.</p>
<p>Swan's sentence was agreed to as part of a guilty plea.</p>
<p>In the spring of 2018, Jefferson Hills police working surveillance on the Heritage Hills apartments, where Swan was living with a girlfriend, saw a silver Lexus with illegal tinted windows pull up and park. Murphy was behind the wheel. Swan came out and got in and the car drove away.</p>
<p>Police pulled it over and found a grocery bag containing 100 stamp bags containing a heroin and fentanyl mix. A search of the apartment where Swan was staying turned up $18,000 in cash, more stamp bags and a gun registered to his girlfriend.</p>
<p>Searches of seized cell phones revealed that Swan and Murphy had been dealing drugs in March and April 2018, with Swan telling customers to meet Murphy for purchases.</p>
<p>Swan was on parole after being sentenced to five to 10 years for voluntary manslaughter and aggravated assault in the 2012 case.</p>
<p>In that incident, he opened fire on a group of drunk people he said had attacked him and his girlfriend outside the Comfort Inn on Banksville Road. Swan's gunshots killed Allen Austin and wounded Robert Finley. Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Anthony Mariani convicted him following non-jury trial, although he acknowledged that the victims "instigated the matter because they were drunk."</p>
<p>Swan was also previously convicted of aggravated assault while driving drunk and possession with intent to deliver heroin and cocaine.</p>
<p>"Mr. Swan has had plenty of wake-up calls," Assistant U.S. Attorney Craig Haller said in sentencing papers. "He has had plenty of second chances. He needs to stop committing crimes."</p>
