<h1>Tom Savini helps create masks that are scary and protective</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some people have taken to baking artisan bread or taking long walks during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Tom Savini is doing what he knows and loves — creating scary but really useful masks.</p>
<p>“They are safety masks, they are PPE and they have been selling like crazy,” said Mr. Savini, a Bloomfield native who is legendary for his special makeup effects.</p>
<p>Jason Baker and a group of 10 others have producing creepy resin masks with filters, based on Savini’s sculpt, at&nbsp;a studio near Bakery Square. Designs include “Friday the 13th” Jason hockey masks, zombie heads and skulls.</p>
<p>Baker is a graduate of the Tom Savini Special Make-up Effects program at the Douglas Education Center in Monessen, as well as the George A. Romero film school there. He had been working as Mr. Savini’s assistant.</p>
<p>“It’s become an industry,” Mr. Savini said. “We thought we were going to sell maybe four or five of these to nerds like ourselves.”</p>
<p>The masks&nbsp;— which might soon include a likeness from the William Castle horror film “Mr. Sardonicus”&nbsp;— go for $60, $100 if autographed. Baker’s social media accounts (@bakingjason) direct interested parties to email requests to callowsumfxstudios@gmail.com.</p>
<p>Since they’re made from a hard plastic, they can be scrubbed.&nbsp;“You can even use Windex on it,” said Mr. Savini, noting that his grandson, James, is helping out.</p>
<p>He said they are sensitive to the realities of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I have to say that after the virus broke out and I saw all these commercials for face masks and gloves, I thought ‘Wow, look at all these people capitalizing on this disaster.’</p>
<p>“But now we look at where we are at. These are ‘monsters’ for the nerd populace that loves this stuff.’”</p>
<p>That includes the masks’ designer.&nbsp;He shared a photo of one with a lurid purple, melting face.</p>
<p>“I’ve always wanted a Vincent Price bust, with his makeup from ‘House of Wax.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Savini is also a writer, director and actor. He appeared as “Old Snake” in the most recent episode of AMC’s “NOS4A2,” and recently made cameos in Netflix’s “Locke &amp; Key.” Members of the series’ high school horror film club refer to themselves as “Savinis.”</p>
<p>Closer to home, Mr. Savini can be spotted every day in Lawrenceville, where artist Jeremy Raymer created a mural of him on the side of a house on Almond Way.</p>
<p>He had planned to appear at a big convention in Texas in December, “although Texas is looking pretty bad.”&nbsp;When conventions resume, he plans to&nbsp; bring along a selection of his masks. That includes his custom favorite, a black version of Jason.</p>
<p>“I’ll sit there with a mask on every day, maybe wear two different ones.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>For now, the idea of attending any large gathering is its own horror show, he said. “But it’s like my wife says about a lot of things: ‘This is temporary. It’s not going to last forever.’”</p>
