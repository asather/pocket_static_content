<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rivers Casino on Thursday announced it would furlough “most” of its team members starting next week amid the state shutdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The furloughs are expected to last through June 30, a statement from the casino reads. Employees that remain will receive “substantial salary cuts.”</p>
<p>All employees will continue to receive health benefits from the company. It was not made clear exactly how many employees will be affected by furloughs or pay cuts.</p>
<p>“This was an extremely difficult decision and one we desperately hoped to avoid,” Rivers Casino CEO Greg Carlin wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>The North Shore casino closed March 15. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2020/03/19/Pennsylvania-all-non-life-sustaining-businesses-close-coronavirus-governor-order/stories/202003190151" target="_blank">ordered the closure</a> of all&nbsp;“non-life-sustaining” businesses March 19.</p>
<p>Casino officials said the location will reopen “when the state determines that it’s safe to do so.”&nbsp;</p>
