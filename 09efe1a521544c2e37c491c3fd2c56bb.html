<p>The Fox Chapel Area School District said Tuesday that a brother of two high school students tested positive for COVID-19 on Monday.</p>
<p>The district said the brother is not a student at the school, but after his “return to the area” Friday he developed mild symptoms. The district did not specify where the person had been prior to returning to the Fox Chapel area.</p>
<p>Classes at the school were canceled Monday, but students were allowed to retrieve belongings that day between&nbsp; 7 a.m. and 3 p.m. The district said one of his siblings was picking up personal belongings from the high school between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. and may have come into contact with other students.</p>
<p>The district said school officials are in the process of&nbsp;identifying and attempting to notify any students who may have come in contact with the sibling on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district said it did not receive information about the high school students’ brother until Tuesday.</p>
