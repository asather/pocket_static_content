<h1>HHS Secretary Azar to visit region Friday, citing health benefits of reopening U.S.</h1>

<p>U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar will be in Pittsburgh on Friday to participate in a roundtable discussion with Allegheny Conference members about the challenges of safely getting back to work.</p>
<p>Mr. Azar also plans to meet later with Heritage Valley Beaver Medical Center leaders and Beaver County commissioners regarding their COVID-19 response and what reopening will look like in that area.</p>
<p>Mr. Azar’s visit comes as Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration is easing restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing more businesses to reopen while limiting the risk of a resurgence in infections.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. Azar argued in the Washington Post that reopening America businesses is a critical health, as well as financial, matter, citing increased rates of suicide and opioid deaths associated with a higher unemployment rate, now near 15% nationally.</p>
<p>“Shortening this economic crisis through a safe reopening could save thousands of lives,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Also, he added in the article, routine diagnostic procedures such as mammograms and colonoscopies that were postponed or canceled in preparation for an onslaught of COVID-19 patients may mean medical problems may not be identified as quickly.&nbsp;Mammograms have decreased by 87%, he wrote, and with more than 1.7 million new cancers diagnosed yearly in the U.S., “we could already have 200,000 or more undiagnosed cancer cases as a result.”</p>
<p>Mr. Azar advocates for a combination of surveillance, broad access to testing and containment of isolated outbreaks as work continues to develop a vaccine, the ultimate goal of the Trump administration’s Operation Warp Speed initiative.</p>
<p>In a statement Thursday, Mr. Azar said, “Reopening our country is about health versus health: balancing the important health benefits of safely reopening and the health costs of staying closed against the health risks of the coronavirus, which Pennsylvania is making progress against every day.”</p>
