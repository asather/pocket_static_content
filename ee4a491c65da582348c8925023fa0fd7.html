<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Quarantine has even made going outside to sort the trash seem exciting, so our readers were all too eager to root around for some humor to share. Check out the three top captions of CapCon 392 below.</p>
<p>We can commiserate with the frustration felt by the dissectologist&nbsp;featured in Caption Contest 393, but maybe you see it another way. Send up to three captions, either via email to&nbsp;page2@post-gazette.com or via the U.S. Postal Service to Caption Contest/Portfolio, Post-Gazette, 358 North Shore Drive, Suite 300, Pittsburgh, Pa. 15212. Include name and full address and identify your municipality or Pittsburgh city neighborhood. Entries must be received by midnight, May 24. Winners get a Post-Gazette mug, perfect for relaxing during social isolation, however itâ€™s enforced.</p>
