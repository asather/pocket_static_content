<h1>Penn State postpones all football-related activities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State has announced the postponement of all football-related activities, according to a statement released on Thursday afternoon.</p>
<p>With the announcement, the Nittany Lions join a long list of sports teams, conferences and professional leagues that have taken serious action to help prevent the spread of COVID-19, commonly known as coronavirus.</p>
<p>This particular action from Penn State means that the program’s pro day, spring practices, media availabilities and recruiting efforts will be put on hold until further notice. The statement does say that a decision hasn’t been made on the status of the Nittany Lions’ spring game, which is scheduled to be held on April 18.</p>
<p>“We are assessing this rapidly evolving situation with the health and welfare of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and community as the priority,” Penn State’s athletic department said in a statement. “We will continue to seek guidance from University leadership, health experts and local authorities in making decisions.”</p>
<p>Wednesday and Thursday have been big days for these types of announcements. Essentially all conferences in the Division I basketball canceled their postseason tournaments, while the NBA, NHL and MLB all suspended activity. Additionally, college basketball teams like Duke and Kansas have announced that they will not be participating in the NCAA tournament, putting the status of that enormous event in doubt, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These all come as a precaution, as the worry surrounding COVID-19 continues to grow day-by-day.</p>
