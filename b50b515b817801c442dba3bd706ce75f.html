<h1>Mustard chugging and iPad watching: Penguins detail rush between shifts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LAS VEGAS — The Penguins were getting worked in their first game of the season, a loss to the Buffalo Sabres on Oct. 3. Gasping for air on the bench at PPG Paints Arena after a busy shift, <strong>Zach Aston-Reese</strong> was looking for an answer.</p>
<p>“I swear to god, I thought someone on the bench was eating a hot dog,” the winger said. “I’m not even kidding. I was like, ‘What the hell is going on?’ ”</p>
<p>Apparently, one of the new guys, <strong>Brandon Tanev</strong>, was squirting mustard into his mouth, much to the disgust of several stunned Penguins teammates.</p>
<p>Some weird stuff can go down on an NHL bench in the blur between shifts. But for the most part, it’s all business for the Penguins after they bust their butts on the ice for about 45 seconds then coast to the bench to recover and regroup.</p>
<p>A top-pair defenseman such as <strong>Kris Letang</strong>, who logs more than 25 minutes of ice time per game, knows he’s probably going right back out there the next shift. But for a bottom-six grinder such as Aston-Reese, who doubles as a penalty-killer, he isn’t sure if he’ll hop over the boards in three seconds or three minutes.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s got to be ready to go, no matter what,” <strong>Jared McCann</strong> said.</p>
<p>How they get ready depends on the player. But it all starts with inhaling.</p>
<p>First, picture NHL players as Lamborghinis going 0 to 60 in three seconds, doing a few laps around a demolition derby course then screeching into a garage.</p>
<p>McCann estimated that after going end to end a few times then plopping down on the bench, it may take a player 20 to 30 seconds to get his wind back. While his torso is heaving, he’s probably replaying that last shift in his head.</p>
<p>“You’re trying to focus on your breathing and lower your heart rate,” Aston-Reese said. “That helps you recover and calm down and regain control of your thoughts. Because when your heart rate’s up, it’s harder to process information.”</p>
<p>To try to simulate the unique challenge of hockey, players make interval workouts part of their training regimen, whether they ride the bike or sprint on a track. But if you get trapped on the ice for more than a minute, a regular occurrence in the second period with a longer skate to the bench, your legs still throb.</p>
<p>“Even though you’re not moving at all on the ice the last minute, you’re still gasping away and your legs [ache],” blue liner <strong>Marcus Pettersson</strong> said. “Then you think about it a little bit, because you can’t think about anything else. You stand up a couple of times and try to shake it off and get ready to go again.”</p>
<p>As evidenced by the chugging of condiments on the bench, there is a wide range of liquids, supplements and other stuff players consume between shifts.</p>
<p>Pettersson just has a drink or two of water. <strong>Teddy Blueger</strong> slurps a berry-flavored drink, chock-full of electrolytes and amino acids, mixed up by the training staff. Aston-Reese used to sip a supplement called HOTSHOT that helps with cramping, but now he may take PEPCID because Gatorade gives him heartburn.</p>
<p>And then there’s Tanev, who picked up his mustard habit in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>Early in his Jets career, then-teammate Adam Lowry recommended that Tanev take a squeeze to help with cramping. He has been eating it ever since.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it maybe after a really long shift. You’ve got a little bit of lactic acid backing up or something like that,” the winger said. “It’s more heat of the moment and how you feel and how your legs feel. I’ve been doing it and I guess it’s been part of my routine, if you want to call it that. But it definitely helps out.”</p>
<p>No, Tanev doesn’t walk into the neighborhood Burger King and shove a fistful of mustard packets into his pocket. The training staff scores some for him.</p>
<p>Now that the recovery process is over after about a minute, it’s time to refocus. Linemates will typically have a quick conversation about their last shift.</p>
<p>“It’s usually just, ‘Good shift. Do it again.’ Or maybe you’re just explaining your reasoning behind doing something stupid,” Aston-Reese said, laughing.</p>
<p>Unless a mistake is especially idiotic, he said coach Mike Sullivan and his assistants won’t say much in the moment. Players know when they screw up.</p>
<p>“But if you keep doing it,” Aston-Reese added, “they’re going to yell.”</p>
<p>In some instances, a Penguins player or coach might pull out an iPad. They are not watching the latest viral cat video on YouTube. In 2017, the NHL made a deal with Apple to deliver video and data to the bench on electronic tablets.</p>
<p>The Penguins pull up video after a missed opportunity or a breakdown. Maybe they want another look at, say, the structure of a suffocating forecheck.</p>
<p>“It’s huge. I’ve used it a lot this year,” McCann said. “We’ve played some really tough teams that play [their third forward] low on the centerman. When I see that, I just kind of grab the tablet, see which guy is open and the next play [put it to use].”</p>
<p>The Penguins don’t overdo it, though. They want their guys to play freely.</p>
<p>“In Anaheim, we watched a lot more than we do here,” Pettersson said.</p>
<p>Perhaps a player will chat with an athletic trainer after getting banged up on their previous shift. Sometimes they may tromp over to the stick rack to pick out a new twig. Maybe they will chirp at an opponent as they glide by the bench.</p>
<p>Two of their biggest talkers — surprise — are Tanev and <strong>Patric Hornqvist</strong>.</p>
<p>“It’s good to communicate and bring a sense of energy,” said Tanev, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/08/penguins-vegas-knights-hockey-NHL-brandon-tanev/stories/202001080083" target="_blank">got the winner in Tuesday’s 4-3 victory</a> over the Vegas Golden Knights. “I think that’s important, especially maybe in games when you’re down by a goal or you want to keep a lead, to have a lively bench. And I try to do that as best I can.”</p>
<p>Wait! There’s a whistle. And Tanev throws his leg over the boards and heads out to kill a penalty — determination in his eyes and mustard on his breath.</p>
