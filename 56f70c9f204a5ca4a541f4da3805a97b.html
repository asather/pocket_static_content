<p>The Peduto administration announced Tuesday that it plans to allocate millions in COVID-19 federal relief funds to small business bridge loans, housing aid and food pantries.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/01/Pittsburgh-to-receive-12-million-community-housing-grants-as-part-of-federal-COVID-19-stimulus-relief-bill/stories/202004010115?cid=search" target="_blank">city received</a> roughly $8.4 million in community development block grants and nearly $4.2 million in emergency housing grants under <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/03/27/House-passes-2-2T-rescue-package-rushes-it-to-Trump/stories/202003270114" target="_blank">Congress’ $2.2 trillion</a>&nbsp;Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act.</p>

Of that, $5 million will be used by the URA for its small business bridge loan program for businesses that have lost revenue due to the pandemic. Two million will be dedicated to the URA’s mortgage and rental programs for those facing economic hardship from COVID-19.

<p>The next largest allocation is $500,000 for the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank.</p>
<p>“This funding will deliver critically needed assistance to many who are suffering during this pandemic, from fears about rent to purchasing food to those experiencing domestic violence. Much, much more financial aid will be necessary, but I’m grateful Congress awarded us these tools,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a press release.</p>
<p>The remaining money will be split among the following local nonprofits:</p>
<p>The funding allocations will be introduced to City Council on May 5.</p>
<p>The funding is administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and must be used for specific community and housing needs.</p>
<p>Allegheny County also received $12.3 million in the community development and emergency housing grants. The county has not yet announced funding allocation.</p>
