<h1>Athletic eligibility </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A proposed program that would have school officials work with student athletes who do not meet academic eligibility requirements while allowing them to continue participating in sports deserves the support of the Pittsburgh Public Schools board.</p>
<p>The program, whose details are still being worked out, would allow student athletes with a grade-point average of 1.05 to 1.99 at the end of the previous report period to enter the academic intervention program. They would have to complete program requirements and earn a 2.0 GPA by the next report period, but could continue playing while working to improve their grades.</p>
<p>If approved, the program would be a change from the current eligibility policy which bars students with less than a 2.0 GPA from competing in the sport for that season.</p>
<p>Although the proposal is short on specifics at the moment, school officials stressed students would be required to “fully participate” in the intervention program in order to remain active in athletics. The program must address academic improvement and commitment by the student so it’s not viewed as simply a way to extend athletic eligibility.</p>
<p>For many student-athletes with academic issues, making them ineligible to participate in sports only serves as another reason to stop attending school. One parent and coach who offered support for the program told the school board excluding students from athletics often leads to students making “bad decisions” or surrounding themselves with peers who encourage bad behavior.</p>
<p>Students who participate in team sports learn important life lessons in regard to discipline, responsibility and commitment they might be missing in their home environment. Athletics shouldn’t take a higher priority over academics, but they do play an important role in grooming young people into adulthood.</p>
<p>As long as school administrators develop an intervention program that addresses improved academics, it’s a worthwhile plan for helping student-athletes while allowing them to stay on the field.</p>
