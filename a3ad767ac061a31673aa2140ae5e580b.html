<h1>Bill to allow local decisions on Pa. high school sports fans passes in Senate</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of fans permitted to attend a high school sports contest might soon be a decision schools can make on their own.</p>
<p>The state Senate passed a bill Wednesday by a 39-11 vote that gives individual schools the power to decide if — and how many&nbsp;— spectators would be allowed at games, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill was passed by the state House of Representatives, 155-47, last week.</p>
<p>State Rep. Mike Reese, R-Westmoreland/Somerset, said he is&nbsp;“hopeful” the&nbsp;bill could be on Gov. Tom Wolf’s desk by Thursday.&nbsp;He has 10 days to act and can veto the bill. But the House and Senate can override the veto because it passed by a two-third majority in both the House and Senate.</p>
<p>Thus, it might be more than a week before the spectator issue is resolved. High school football teams in Pennsylvania, including those in the WPIAL, start playing games Friday. WPIAL girls volleyball matches indoors begin Monday as well as boys and girls soccer games.</p>
<p>The bill was originally sponsored by Reese, and it goes against Wolf orders on spectators at school sports events. Originally, Wolf and the Pennsylvania Department of Health issued an order in July that banned any spectators from high school games. Last week, Wolf relaxed the spectator ban to allow some fans, but the state gathering limits of 250 outdoor and 25 indoor remain in place.</p>
<p>Fans, players, coaches, officials, game workers and any cheerleaders or band members must all count toward the limits of 250 outdoors. The new bill allows schools, if they choose, to have more than 250 people at outdoor games such as football and more than 25 indoors, provided they still follow other state health and safety guidelines.</p>
<p>“I think the votes tell me parents, teachers, coaches and other people have been reaching out to legislators and explaining what does on. Hopefully, the governor hears that and sides with the majority,” Reese said. “I think it would be a very difficult veto for him. To be very blunt, I think it would upset a lot of Pennsylvanians. I think he has to at least consider this bill, even though I think it’s a bill he doesn’t necessarily love.”</p>
<p>PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said last week that the league would be happy if the governor’s office would even permit 25% capacity of a facility (stadium or gym).</p>
<p>“That’s a consistent number for other formats that the state uses, like restaurant capacity,” Lombardi said last week.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Wolf said restaurants in the state will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity starting Sept. 21 as long as they “self-certify” that they are following COVID-19 safety orders and guidelines.</p>
