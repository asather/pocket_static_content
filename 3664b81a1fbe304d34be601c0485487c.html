<h1>Bus and light rail traffic to detour around Mount Washington transit tunnel, delays likely </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Inbound bus and light rail traffic is being detoured Tuesday night around the Mount Washington transit tunnel to avoid an ongoing landslide issue.</p>
<p>Detours will continue Wednesday morning, according to the Port Authority of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Inbound light rail vehicles will travel on tracks through the city’s Allentown neighborhood.</p>
<p>Outbound vehicles will use the inbound tracks in the transit tunnel beginning Wednesday morning, and riders boarding at Station Square or South Hills Junction are instructed to use the inbound platforms, the authority said.</p>
<p>The authority is advising commuters to plan for delays.</p>
<p>Stormwater runoff at the southern end of the tunnel is causing the landslide, according to the agency.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“For the safety of Port Authority employees and customers, no light rail service will operate on the outbound tracks until the debris is cleared and the hillside is stabilized,” according to a Port Authority news release.</p>
<p>The agency is working with the city and the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority to prevent further erosion.</p>
