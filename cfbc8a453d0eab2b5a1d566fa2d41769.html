<h1>Reports: West Allegheny's Austin Hendrick signs with Cincinnati Reds</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After he was selected with the 12th overall pick in the 2020 MLB draft, Austin Hendrick, the 18-year-old from West Allegheny High School, has now signed with the Reds, according to MLB Network’s Jon Heyman.</p>
<p>The Reds’ slot value for the 12th pick, or the most they were permitted to sign Hendrick for, was $4,366,400. According to Heyman, Hendrick, a projected right fielder with a left-handed swing, signed for just under that value, at $4 million.</p>
<p>Hendrick’s selection placed him in uncommon territory, as he became just the sixth WPIAL player to be drafted in the first round since 1965.</p>
<p>Dick Williams, the Reds’ president of baseball operations, said they loved Hendrick’s power and hitting tools, and Reds director of amateur scouting Brad Meador said they had Hendrick a lot higher than 12 on their big board back on June 10, the night of the draft.</p>
<p>It is unclear what the near future holds for Hendrick. MLB teams are required to submit a list of 60 players who will be either on the major league roster during this season or will be part of their “taxi squad,” the group that is at the ready to join the big-league club should an injury or other unforeseen issue arise with a player. Those lists are due to MLB on Sunday, and there have been rumors that some teams could include their 2020 draft selections on the 60-man list in order to ensure them the best opportunity for development this year.</p>
<p>Whether that applies to Hendrick or not remains to be seen. Still,&nbsp;the Reds were presumably eager to get Hendrick’s name signed on the dotted line.</p>
