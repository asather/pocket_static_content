<h1>Us: Dr. Stress to the rescue during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each of us has a story. This one made our website. To suggest someone for the Us column, which runs every Monday, email uscolumn@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p>Yes, COVID-19 is stalking and threatening us.&nbsp;But there are lots of other risks these days that may force us to fight or flee.</p>
<p>Our fields are full of poisonous hemlock. We hear daily reports about droughts and wildfires, storms and floods. The economy has collapsed like a badly baked cake. And poverty is sweeping the land like plagues of grasshoppers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hey, Asian murder hornets have arrived in America with stingers only the National Rifle Association could admire.&nbsp;And now those gosh-darn newspapers — yes, you, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — are reporting a psychological pandemic caused by a viral one: loneliness. We’ve all become Bobby Vinton’s “Mr. Lonely.”</p>
<p>You might think I’m in a fetal position under my bed with blood running thick with stress hormones, heart pounding like a kettledrum and brain doing more twists and turns than a Ferrari during Le Mans.</p>
<p>But that’s not the case for one good reason: I know Dr. Bruce Rabin.</p>
<p>Everyone should know Dr. Rabin and his message.&nbsp;The retired UPMC director of immunopathology is known lovingly as Dr. Stress, not because he creates it but because he knows all the tricks to reducing it.</p>
<p>In retirement, Dr. Rabin, 79, of Squirrel Hill, continues practicing what he preaches as Pittsburgh’s calmest, gentlest force — a prophet of peacefulness —&nbsp;that I can best describe as Mister Rogers for adults.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For years he has spent his own time and dime helping city teachers, firefighters, students, doctors and journalists, among many others, to adopt certain mental and physical practices to keep predatory stress at bay, as a tamer does tigers.</p>
<p>The science is complex but excessive inflammation from stress exacts a heavy toll on physical and mental health, with potential to cause heart disease, diabetes and autoimmune diseases.</p>
<p>For years, Dr. Rabin taught medical students the biology of stress and how to treat patients suffering from it. But his complementary goal was preparing them to withstand the rigors of their own profession. Since his 2017 retirement,&nbsp;Dr. Rabin has focused on helping neglected and abused children by helping parents contend with their own stress.</p>
<p>The pandemic put his sessions on the South Side and at the&nbsp;Hazlewood Center of Life on hold, so he has posted <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xYJxoZV5U0&amp;list=PL4biDBbaBdJOGFXf-RHjpmHAR7daf9I2q" target="_blank">stress-coping Youtube videos</a>&nbsp;to help anyone and everyone. His January 2019 book, “Coping with Stress for Mental and Physical Health and Longevity,” is available through Amazon or Barnes &amp; Noble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The child abuse situation is tough with lots of ugliness that leaves scar tissue,” he said, noting that an occasional raised voice might not affect a child but persistent yelling can adversely affect the child’s behavior and ability to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“The point is, you have to be kind to people. You don’t have to be right,” Dr. Rabin said. “Lose the argument for the sake of the kids and create a kinder atmosphere at home.”</span></p>
<p><span>When kids encounter abuse at home, with parents yelling at one another, the child who hasn’t been sleeping well goes to school with incomplete homework. “How do you expect them to do well in school?” Dr. Rabin said.</span></p>
<p>Pandemic or no pandemic, Dr. Rabin wants you to understand these key points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• A child doesn’t know right from wrong. They learn that from adults who should strive to be meaningful role models.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Stress hormones alter the brain, raising the risk of depression and inability to think clearly and focus.</p>
<p>• Uncontrolled stress in pregnant women can cause functional alterations of the brain of the fetus, which means the newborn could face a higher risk of depression, learning disabilities and chronic disease.</p>
<p>“When you ask the question ‘When does healthy living begin?,’&nbsp; the answer is when you are a fetus,” he said, emphasizing the&nbsp;importance of pregnant women using stress-coping techniques for the sake of their babies.</p>
<p>Those techniques include slow, deep breathing to extinguish the flames. Laughing makes stress disappear, so maybe go watch “Shaun the Sheep.”&nbsp;Mentally place yourself in your favorite place — a beautiful beach, a mountain cabin or your basil garden. Add gentle New Age music to those happy thoughts and r-e-l-a-x. You’ll swear your bones just melted.</p>
<p>His <a href="http://healthylifestyle.podbean.com/" target="_blank">guided imagery program</a>&nbsp;will rinse away your stress. As for loneliness, Dr. Rabin said, direct contact with others is most beneficial, but any form of communication is beneficial — be it Zoom, Skype, texting or talking on the phone.</p>
<p>So puff it away like a tugboat. Think spectacular wild kingdom thoughts. Recall a cat video. Remember, the goal is inspired reflection, not infection obsession.&nbsp;And&nbsp;be absolutely thrilled that murder hornets aren’t yet in Pittsburgh —&nbsp;but Dr. Rabin is.</p>
