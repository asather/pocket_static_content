<h1>Steelers practice report: Good news on the injury front</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A day after rookie guard Kevin Dotson was helped off Heinz Field by a trainer and Ben Roethlisberger, it sounds like his left knee injury isn’t a major one.</p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin characterized Dotson (and reserve tight end Dax Raymond) as “more short-term … nothing of any significant long-term concerns.”</p>
<p>“No news is good news on the injury front,” Tomlin said after a Wednesday practice without pads. “Not a lot of new stuff.”</p>
<p>Even some Steelers who have been out of action, such as wide receiver James Washington and defensive tackle Chris Wormley, are “working their way back” by practicing in a limited capacity. The main worry after Tuesday’s practice was the health of Dotson, an affable fourth-rounder trying to compete for a backup spot on the offensive line, if not push to start at some point in his first season.</p>
<p>Don't count out Raymond in the mix at tight end, either, at least not after how position coach James Daniel assessed his group Tuesday afternoon. Second-year fifth-round pick Zach Gentry would seem to have the inside track for the No. 3 job, but Pine-Richland and Youngstown State product Kevin Rader spent almost all of last season on the practice squad, while Raymond was signed last month to add more polish in place of converted rugby star Christian Scotland-Williamson.</p>
<p>“These guys are here competing. They know. We put it out there upfront, they’re competing and we’re going to see who’s the best fit for getting done what we need done in the room,” Daniel said.</p>
