<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Will sports pay a price for bringing politics into leagues?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started — and I sense a theme this week:</em></p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong>&nbsp;Do you think pro sports, particularly the NBA, is going to pay a steep price for continuing to bring politics into their leagues? The vast majority of fans just want to watch a game, not engage in a protest.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> This is a tricky question. I think most people who claim they will never watch again are lying and most fans who have an issue with the social justice stuff just don’t like double standards. If guys walked out on the court with&nbsp;“Blue Lives Matter” or&nbsp;“Make America Great Again” or some other slogan like that, they would get hammered for it. Most leagues would probably fine them and prohibit it. That’s just part of it, though. The “Black Lives Matter” movement is popular right now and the issue of racial justice is an important one. I agree there needs to be a limit to how much of it goes on because it can be excessive, but I don’t know where that line is. I don’t know what is right or wrong, and I just hope all the pomp and circumstance is followed by legitimate action.</p>
<p><strong>Nate:</strong> Are sports ever going to be about sports again? I am a die-hard fan but am close to tuning out for good if this continues.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No. It won’t ever go back to the days when most players showed up, played and went home. I will say this: Most of the time people who have a problem with it have a problem only with the forms of protest or causes they aren’t interested in. I will be transparent, I hate all of it — the social justice displays, the fake patriotism and troop worship, the overly religious stuff.&nbsp;I am not saying these players should shut up and dribble. They need to speak up, be active in their communities and do things to make change — but they shouldn’t forget the reason they have such a big platform is because they can dribble, punt, pass, kick or hit a baseball a mile.</p>
<p><strong>Tyler:&nbsp;</strong>Why did Mike Tomlin feel the need to give a speech in an empty stadium at Steelers practice? Whatever happened to just playing football?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Why did it bother you? I think, from start to finish, it was four minutes long. You could have tuned it out very easily and then tuned in to watch practice. Again, these are unique times, and right now athletes want to try and use their voice to make a change. That was Tomlin’s way of letting the world know the Steelers support these social justice initiatives and are unified. To be honest, that was the exact right way to handle it.</p>
<p><strong>Jordan:</strong> Why are you and all the rest of your colleagues so liberal and woke about every subject? Why do you refuse to acknowledge that some people may just want to watch sports and that doesn’t make them racists? I’m so tired of you.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I have to admit it is hilarious that you are accusing me of being a “woke” progressive. I’m sure those who follow me on social media would disagree. I agree that just because you don’t want to hear the social justice messages, it doesn’t mean you are a racist. But ask yourself: Why does it bother you so much? What’s the big deal? Maybe there are things you can listen to and learn from. Do I think it is overboard at times? Yes, but if it triggers you that much, you need to do some self-examination.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> You praise Drew Brees and rip NBA players. Why don’t you just wear your MAGA hat? Why do you have such a problem with players taking a stand for social justice issues?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Sigh. Marty please talk to Jordan, he seems to think I am a “woke” progressive. I have no issues with players taking a stand, making their voices heard and being active. I do think there is a time and a place and a right way to go about it, and some of what I have seen is counterproductive to the cause. That’s all I have said.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Would Kevin Warren, the Big Ten commissioner, get as much criticism if he was white? Do you agree that he is being unfairly targeted because he is Black?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think this is the silliest storyline of the summer, and that is saying a whole lot considering what we have been through. Warren is the commissioner of the second most popular football conference and the second most profitable conference in college sports. He is a guy who happens to be the leader of a group of very passionate football programs that all want to play. Of course it isn’t all his fault they screwed up the fall sports postponement so badly, but he is the highest profile person in the conference, and that means the buck stops with him. Roger Goodell, Rob Manfred, Adam Silver, Gary Bettman and just about every single other commissioner I can think of at times has taken a lot of criticism for stuff that was beyond their control because they all answer to their teams. Warren is no different, and the people who insinuate he is being targeted because he is Black are not being intellectually honest. Part of being a commissioner is taking heat for decisions that affect the league you oversee. It’s why the job pays so well.</p>
<p><strong>Ira:</strong> Why would you criticize Cole Tucker for his stance on police brutality? He is a great young man and a credit to his family and the Pirates organization.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I didn’t. I simply said if he truly believes police brutality is more important than sports — his profession — he should not play and go to work to end police brutality. Fighting police brutality is important, and Tucker’s ability to do that and be a leader —not too mention his paycheck — is tied to his ability to play sports. It is virtue signaling 101. All I said basically was&nbsp;“do better” because that kind of message is not genuine unless there is action behind it. I love Tucker, by the way. He has a great spirit about him and really plays the game with a joy that few have these days.</p>
<p><strong>Bob:</strong> Could the Big Ten teams negotiate their own TV deal outside the conference and still play this fall if they want to?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> No, and they wouldn’t. They make so much money from the Big Ten that they wouldn’t go against the conference to make a statement. It just wouldn’t make sense on any level.</p>
