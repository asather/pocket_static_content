<h1>Biden’s choice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I take umbrage at the tone of the Aug. 13 editorial about Joe Biden’s pick for his running mate (“<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2020/08/13/Why-Biden-blew-it-kamala-harris/stories/202008130110" target="_blank">Why Biden Blew It</a>”) and the nasty opinion piece the same day by right-winger Ben Shapiro (“<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/Op-Ed/2020/08/13/Ben-Shapiro-Joe-Biden-awful-vice-presidential-pick-Kamala-Harris/stories/202008130032" target="_blank">Joe Biden’s Awful Vice Presidential Pick</a>”). Since when does the editorial writer have entree to the inner workings of Mr. Biden’s mind?</p>
<p>I am confident that Mr. Biden, having interviewed a large number of potential candidates, personally chose the one he felt was best suited for the position. It was his choice.</p>
<p>Kamala Harris is an intelligent, articulate and experienced candidate. Why are old white men so fearful of strong women that they feel they must denigrate them? I happen to appreciate strong women.</p>
