<h1>$25B mail delivery bill passes House, but likely to falter; Pa. Republicans rebuke push for aid</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — House-passed legislation to provide $25 billion in emergency aid to the U.S. Postal Service is likely to falter in the Senate amid opposition from Congressional Republicans and President Donald Trump, who has opposed additional funding for mail delivery because he wants to prevent mail-in voting during the 2020 elections in November.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania congressional delegation, called back to Washington last weekend for an unusual Saturday vote, split mostly along party lines on the bill, which also would block the Postal Service from making any operational cuts until the COVID-19 health emergency is lifted.</p>
<p>The Delivering For America Act <a href="https://clerk.house.gov/Votes/2020182" target="_blank">passed by a vote of 257 to 150</a>, with 26 House Republicans joining every House Democrat in support. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Bucks County was the only House Republican from&nbsp;the Keystone State to vote in favor. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, did not cast a vote due to a “pre-scheduled and unavoidable family commitment,” a spokesperson said Monday.</p>
<p>Democrats have expressed alarm in recent weeks at changes put forth by <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/08/24/Postal-chief-warnsvoters-request-return-ballots-early-election-2020-pandemic-trump-biden/stories/202008240061" target="_blank">Postmaster General Louis DeJoy</a>, a major Republican donor and former logistics executive. A memo last month outlined Mr. DeJoy’s changes that, citing a need to trim costs, prohibited overtime pay, shut down sorting machines early and required letter carriers to leave mail behind when necessary to avoid extra trips or late delivery on routes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Postal Service has removed hundreds of mail-sorting machines, and mail had been delayed recently in Western Pennsylvania, a union official <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/insight/2020/08/16/United-States-Postal-Service-mail-delivery-2020-elections-Trump-Doyle-Kelly-Toomey/stories/202008160025?cid=search" target="_blank">told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette this month</a>.&nbsp;Last week, the VA informed the Disabled American Veterans that Postal Service cuts had recently led to <a href="https://www.dav.org/learn-more/news/2020/statement-on-usps-delays-from-dav-national-commander-stephen-butch-whitehead/" target="_blank">25% delays in delivering medicines</a> to veterans, according to DAV National Commander Stephen Whitehead.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. DeJoy, facing pressure from lawmakers during Capitol Hill hearings Friday and Monday, pledged to halt any more changes to mail delivery operations but has declined to bring back machines that have already been removed.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., demanded a vote on the bill to “reject the Trump administration’s efforts to undermine the critical mission of the postal service.”</p>
<p>Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, voted in support and tweeted that he would protect the right to vote from “@realDonaldTrump's #VoterSuppression efforts that are delaying many mail deliveries.”</p>
<p>Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, wrote in a statement after the vote that Mr. DeJoy’s actions would “impede prompt and reliable service” and that the Democrats’ bill was “designed to protect the constitutional rights of all Americans.”</p>
<p>“Many of us will exercise our constitutional right to vote by relying on the Postal Service to deliver our ballots,” Mr. Lamb stated. “The USPS is prepared for this mission, but they need extra support to accomplish it while still meeting the needs of seniors, veterans, small businesses and rural communities.”</p>
<p>Yet Pennsylvania Republicans opposed any more funding, echoing Mr. Trump’s language that the funding is politically motivated and the reports of slowed mail delivery amount to a “conspiracy theory.”</p>
<p>“Speaker Pelosi and House Democrats doubled down on their politically-motivated conspiracy theory about the United States Postal Service,” Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, said in a statement opposing the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The USPS has more than enough funding to get through the year,” he added, “and Democrats’ legislation would not fix any of the irrational state ballot deadlines that are incompatible with USPS delivery standards.”</p>
<p>Mr. Reschenthaler referred to the request this month from Pennsylvania&nbsp;state officials that postmarked ballots arriving days after Election Day be counted. The Postal Service had warned it could not guarantee that ballots put into the mail by the state’s deadline of Oct. 27 to apply mail-in ballots&nbsp;would reach election officials by Election Day on Nov. 3.</p>
<p>Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair, said Democrats were peddling “a baseless conspiracy theory” about the Postal Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The American people should not be on the hook to bailout the U.S. Postal Service under the guise of protecting our elections,” Dr. Joyce stated, pointed out the Postal Service earlier this month got access to a $10 billion loan approved by Congress in March.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, in a statement provided my his spokesperson, said he would have voted against the bill, saying the agency needs substantial reform to trim its losses.</p>
<p>“Another government bailout for an agency that has a long history of fiscal mismanagement is not the right answer,” Mr. Kelly stated. “The systemic challenges of USPS pose no threat to the November presidential election.”</p>
<p>On Monday, White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows shot down the bill, saying Mr. Trump would consider additional money only as part of a broader COVID-19 relief package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Trump has repeatedly attacked the Postal Service and — as with the COVID-19 pandemic requiring an unprecedented demand for mail-in voting — has&nbsp;falsely claimed there is widespread fraud in mail-in ballots.</p>
<p>After the bill passed on Saturday, Mr. Trump aired the grievances again on Twitter.</p>
<p>“This is all another HOAX by the Democrats,” he wrote, saying the bill would “give 25 Billion unneeded dollars for political purposes, without talking about the Universal Mail-In Ballot Scam.”</p>
<p>“Only ABSENTEE BALLOTS are acceptable!” Mr. Trump added, even though mail-in ballots and absentee ballots are the same type of ballot.</p>
<p>On Sunday, a federal judge in Pittsburgh ordered a stay in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/23/Trump-campaign-files-its-evidence-in-mail-voting-suit/stories/202008220065" target="_blank">the Trump campaign’s lawsuit</a>&nbsp;that seeks to ban ballot drop boxes and other changes to Pennsylvania election procedures.</p>
<p>Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan — a Trump nominee confirmed last year to the U.S. District Court of the Western District of Pennsylvania — wrote&nbsp;the federal case will not move forward until similar lawsuits in state courts are decided.</p>
<p>The ruling came hours after the Trump campaign submitted a 500-page filing with what it portrayed as evidence of mail-in voter fraud. But the document <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/23/Trump-campaign-files-its-evidence-in-mail-voting-suit/stories/202008220065" target="_blank">did not contain any&nbsp;specific evidence</a> that suggests rampant and widespread fraud enabled by a flawed mail-in system.</p>
