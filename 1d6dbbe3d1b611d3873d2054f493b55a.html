<h1>Goodell taking no salary as NFL implements pay cuts, furloughs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is working without a salary, and the league office is implementing pay cuts and furloughs for employees, as the sport grapples with the economic impact of the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Goodell decided last month to voluntarily eliminate his salary, a move enacted this month, league spokesman Brian McCarthy said. The pay cuts of 5% to 15% will affect league employees making at least $100,000 and the furloughs are to take effect May 8, according to a memo sent from Goodell to staffers in the NFL office in New York and employees of NFL Films and the NFL Network.</p>
<p>“The NFL is not immune to the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is our obligation to take responsible steps to protect the business and manage through this crisis as effectively as possible,” Goodell wrote in the memo, a copy of which was obtained by The Washington Post.</p>

<p>“These decisions were difficult and we know these measures will cause hardship for those impacted. I encourage everyone to continue to identify ways of operating more efficiently and reducing costs. If we do that, I believe that furloughs and compensation reductions can be limited, or in time even reversed. I assure you that we will continue to monitor economic conditions, communicate with you promptly and openly - whether the news is good or bad - and have your interests in mind as decisions are made going forward.”</p>
<p>In December 2017, Goodell signed a contract extension through 2024 worth as much as about $40 million annually, though close to 90% of that figure was tied to incentives. It was not immediately clear how Goodell’s decision to work without a salary will eventually affect his ability to earn those incentives. Goodell made the decision in consultation with Pittsburgh Steelers owner Art Rooney and other owners on the compensation committee that determines his contract terms.</p>
<p>The pay cuts and furloughs do not affect employees of NFL teams.</p>
<p>McCarthy said that the NFL continues to move forward with the hope and expectation of having a 2020 season that starts on time in September, and that the pay cuts and furloughs are not indicative of any decreased optimism about the league’s ability to conduct a season. Rather, they are reflective of the economic impact the league is beginning to see as the pandemic and resulting lockdown measures affect the NFL’s business partners and other companies nationwide, he said.</p>
<p>The NFL still plans to release its schedule for the 2020 regular season soon, McCarthy said. But Goodell has acknowledged that while the NFL hopes to have a full season, it will make adjustments if necessary. People familiar with the league’s planning have said the contingencies being contemplated include games in empty or partially filled stadiums, a shortened or delayed season, and games being rescheduled or relocated. The league is trying to figure out when and how to reopen teams’ training facilities.</p>
<p>According to Goodell’s memo, the pay cuts for league employees take effect in paychecks issued May 22. The cuts will be 5% for managers, 7% for directors, 10% for vice presidents, 12% for senior VPs and 15% for executive VPs. No pay cut will be responsible for reducing an employee’s salary below $100,000, according to the memo.</p>
<p>The furloughs will affect those NFL employees whose workloads have been significantly reduced and those unable to perform work duties “substantially” from home, the memo said. The league will pay the costs of benefits for any furloughed employees receiving medical, dental and vision benefits through the NFL, according to the memo.</p>
<p>The NFL has continued to conduct much of its offseason business while other in-season sports leagues are shut down, holding free agency for veteran players and conducting the NFL draft remotely. Teams are conducting virtual offseason programs with players.</p>
<p>“It is clear that the economic effects will be deeper and longer lasting than anyone anticipated and that their duration remains uncertain,” Goodell wrote. “The downturn has affected all of us, as well as our fans, our business partners, and our clubs.</p>
<p>“While we continue to prepare for a full 2020 season of NFL football, we also need to manage in a responsible way, adopting a flexible approach that responds to the current conditions in a way that minimizes the risk to our employees, our clubs, and the NFL’s business. Our league has great strength and has shown its resiliency time and again. But part of that strength is the result of careful planning and a willingness to act responsibly.”</p>
