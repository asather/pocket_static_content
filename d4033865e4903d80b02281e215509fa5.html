<h1>Rochester man gets five years for sending harassing child porn text messages</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man who sent text messages containing child pornography along with images of guns and human feces to some 30 Beaver County residents as a form of harassment is headed to federal prison for his deeds.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Joy Flowers Conti on Wednesday imposed a term of five years on Brent Cotman, 30, of Rochester.</p>
<p>It took the FBI, the state attorney general's office and authorities in Beaver County more than a year to catch Cotman, who was using a software application called "TextNow" to mask the source of the text messages he was sending starting in 2016.</p>
<p>Local police couldn't track the sender and called in state agents and the FBI. During the course of the investigation, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Carolyn Bloch, 30 people in Beaver County or former residents of the county reported receiving similar harassing texts.</p>
<p>"In most reported incidents, the victims received a phone call from an unknown individual, followed by one or more texts with threatening and/or harassing statements, along with images depicting the sexual exploitation of minors, images of firearms, and/or images of human feces," Ms. Bloch said in sentencing papers.</p>
<p>The government analyzed the receivers' phones and obtained data from Facebook, Google and Sprint to finally track down a cellphone used by Cotman, then raided his house on Feb. 1, 2018.</p>
<p>He turned over two phones but said he didn't know the passwords because, he said, one phone was given to him and he found the other on a bus. The FBI was able to open them, however, and found victim contact information along with images of child porn, guns and feces.</p>
<p>Agents identified 66 porn images. The Beaver County District Attorney's Office charged him with sending threatening messages, including some in which he said he was following the victims and would harm their children.</p>
<p>The attorney general's office said one victim had been harassed by Cotman for four years. At one point she said she was walking with her son when she received a text from Cotman in which he described what she was wearing.</p>
<p>In another incident, she was grocery shopping when she recognized a voice as Cotman's from having received phone calls from him. She took a picture of him with her phone.</p>
<p>Police questioned Cotman in March 2017, according to the AG, and the FBI began watching him later that year as they worked to trace the text messages to his phones.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury indicted Cotman in 2018 on charges of disseminating child porn and he pleaded guilty last year.</p>
