<h1>Steelers practice report: Mike Tomlin coaches with heavy heart for 'idol' John Thompson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin began his post-practice briefing Monday with a&nbsp;“rest in power” rather than a&nbsp;“rest in peace,” and he did it for a sports figure that couldn’t be more fitting for that twist on an old phrase.</p>
<p>John Thompson, larger-than-life former coach of the Georgetown men’s basketball program, died Sunday at 78. He was a legend in the college game, but even more so in the Washington D.C.-Maryland-Virginia metro area, and Tomlin is a proud son of the Hampton Roads region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was a Virginia boy growing up in the ’80s,” Tomlin said with a grin. “I had the Georgetown Starter jacket, man. I was a Hoya.”</p>
<p>Not only that, but Tomlin also called Thompson a&nbsp;“blueprint” and an&nbsp;“idol,” not just for him but for many. Tomlin even phoned into Thompson’s radio show when he was younger, just for the chance to talk to the 6-foot-10, 1984 national championship-winning coach.</p>
<p>Later in life, especially once he got to Pittsburgh — where Pitt played in the same Big East Conference that Thompson used to rule — and established himself as an NFL head coach, Tomlin was thrilled to develop a relationship with the man he looked up to so much. In fact, he sought out Thompson’s guidance.</p>
<p>“You’re wise to seek wise counsel,” Tomlin said, smiling at the memory.&nbsp;“I enjoyed every time I had an opportunity to go to the D.C. area and play, whether it was Washington or Baltimore.”</p>
<p>Tomlin was a little younger than Alonzo Mourning and a little older than Allen Iverson, two basketball greats from the Tidewater region who chose to play for Thompson at Georgetown. By that time, Thompson had become the first Black coach to win a national title and was as well known for his leadership in the lives of his many Black players as he was for his exploits on the court.</p>
<p>“I just had a big-time appreciation not only for his coaching prowess and reputation and record, but also how he moved in the lives of the young people he worked with,” Tomlin said.&nbsp;“He was a mentor, if you will — a guy who’d been there and done that. I just appreciated the times I had to visit with him and glean some of his wisdom.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury report</strong></p>
<p>The most notable health concern looming for the Steelers didn’t get much clarity from Tomlin, as starting right guard David DeCastro missed practice after leaving Friday night’s scrimmage.</p>
<p>“He’s just dealing with a lower-body injury,” Tomlin said. “We’re managing it, he’s managing it, and hopefully he’ll be back out there soon.”</p>
<p>For the most part this camp, Tomlin has characterized players as dealing with&nbsp;“minor ailments” or being&nbsp;“day to day.” Not so for DeCastro, but the season opener is now less than two weeks away.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the injury front, a number of players who’d been banged up were back in some capacity Monday. That includes receivers Diontae Johnson and Ryan Switzer, running back Wendell Smallwood and defensive lineman Chris Wormley. Safety Terrell Edmunds, still wearing a brace on his left knee, was in pads and practiced for the first time since Aug. 19.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot of things that come with training camp — injuries, lack of availability from a short-term standpoint,” Tomlin said.&nbsp;“A lot of those guys are working their way back into action and we’re glad that they are.”</p>
<p>Still sidelined are rookie running back Anthony McFarland, who’s been in concussion protocol since Friday night, and long-snapper Kameron Canaday.</p>
<p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p>
<p>• Devin Bush dropped what could’ve been an interception by Ben Roethlisberger targeting JuJu Smith-Schuster over the middle.&nbsp;“Two hands on that, 55!” Tomlin yelled, likely echoing something Thompson yelled at Dikembe Mutombo back in the day.</p>
<p>• New fullback Derek Watt, who has been limited as he recovers from an offseason surgery, got his most extensive action yet with the starting offense in a live goal-line period. Offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/08/29/will-steelers-use-fullback-derek-watt-james-conner-roosevelt-nix/stories/202008270163" target="_blank">had been looking forward</a> to seeing more from Watt, who was flexed out as an H-back on two snaps.</p>
<p>• In that goal-line drill, the first-team defense stopped the offense twice in three tries, as did the second-team defense. Roethlisberger acted as the de facto referee.</p>
<p>• Sixth-round pick Antoine Brooks wasn’t perfect at safety, but given that he’s been quiet all camp, it might be worth noting that he picked off a pass intended for running back Trey Edmunds.</p>
