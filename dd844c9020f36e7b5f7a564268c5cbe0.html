<h1>Duquesne drug dealer and five-time offender gets 22 years in federal prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Duquesne man described by a federal prosecutor as a "recidivist drug dealer" was sentenced Tuesday in federal court to 22 years in prison for narcotics trafficking, his fifth conviction.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge David Cercone imposed that term on Donte Taylor, 37, of Catherine Street.</p>
<p>Taylor was convicted of possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine, cocaine, heroin, fentanyl and marijuana.</p>
<p>At his trial, prosecutors presented evidence that on May 10, 2018, Taylor was on state parole for prior drug trafficking offenses when parole agents came to his house for a home visit. They smelled marijuana and Taylor's co-defendant, Ericka Smith, gave agents and police consent to search.</p>
<p>The search turned up 279 grams of crack, 33 grams of cocaine, 56 grams of heroin, 12 grams of fentanyl, 155 grams of marijuana, $14,000 in cash, drug scales and other drug trafficking material.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Mark Gurzo said this is Taylor's fifth conviction for dealing drugs.</p>
<p>"The Defendantâ€™s possession with intent to distribute highly lethal and addictive controlled substances constitutes a very serious offense given the opioid pandemic that has plagued the United States in general and specifically the Western District of Pennsylvania," he said. "Further, the Defendant has demonstrated a complete lack of respect for the law as he has continuously trafficked drugs for the past fifteen years and while under court supervision."</p>
<p>Taylor's lawyer, James Brink, said the government's request for a 30-year term was excessive and suggested 10 years was more reasonable.</p>
<p>In addition to the 22 years, the judge ordered that Taylor be on probation for eight years.</p>
<p>The government withdrew charges against Ericka Smith.</p>
