<h1>What Pitt's 2020 signing day means for the Panthers' future, scholarship count</h1>

<p>Pitt's 2020 recruiting class is complete after filling a couple needs and bringing the Panthers' scholarship situation to a fluid yet workable state.</p>
<p>Pat Narduzzi and his staff picked up a couple more Panthers — four-star cornerback Rashad Battle and two-star kicker Ben Sauls — on Wednesday morning after securing the signatures of 16 prospects in December's early period. Pitt announced that Sauls signed his letter of intent at 7:30 a.m., while Narduzzi confirmed Battle’s addition three hours later.</p>
<p>The Panthers' 2020 class — not including transfers Lucas Krull and Joey Yellen and any potential grad transfers in the months ahead — will close at 18 members. Pitt will not sign three-star defensive tackle Timothy Brown, who verbally committed to the Panthers in June 2019. Brown, who was charged with robbery, felony battery and kidnapping in October 2019, re-opened his commitment on Jan. 31.</p>
<p>With Sauls' verbal commitment in hand late Tuesday night, Pitt's 2020 class ranked No. 49 nationally and eighth in the ACC on Rivals.com. The Panthers' national ranking is expecting a bit of a boost with Battle in tow, which should make the 2020 group Narduzzi's fourth-highest ranked class in six cycles at the helm.</p>
<p>It's far from Pitt's 2016 class, which ranked 29th and featured 24 members, including seven 2020 expected starters. But rankings aren't everything. The Panthers filled the spots they had available in December and on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Battle provides further cover at corner — a position not necessarily desperate for depth, but worth adding to. Dane Jackson's eligibility ran out after 2019, and redshirt sophomore Therran Coleman left the program, while projected starters and upperclassmen Damarri Mathis and Jason Pinnock will be gone following the 2020 season.</p>
<p>Battle, who stands at 6-foot-3, is the fourth defensive back of Pitt's 2020 class. He joins four-star Jahvante Royal and three-star prospects Hunter Sellers and Buddy Mack. Mack is a safety, and Royal and Sellers are expected to begin their collegiate careers at cornerback, which could always change before spring ball.</p>
<p>Either way, the addition of Battle — Pitt's third four-star recruit, per Rivals, along with Royal and Westinghouse defensive end Dayon Hayes — is significant. The former Maryland verbal, who decommitted in November, also had offers from South Carolina, Virginia Tech, NC State, Baylor, Iowa and more.</p>
<p>Sauls was also previously committed to a Power 5 program. But his split from Iowa State was much more recent.</p>
<p>The left-footed placekicker, who should be considered Alex Kessman's ideal replacement beyond 2020, “120% committed” to the Cyclones verbally on Jan. 29. That decision came after Pitt reportedly tried to bring him in as a walk-on, promising to put him on scholarship next January, similar to what Narduzzi did with Kessman. However, Sauls' commitment to Iowa State prompted a full offer in this cycle from the Panthers.</p>
<p>Now, Sauls and Battle bring Pitt's 2020 scholarship count to 86, one over the NCAA's limit. But no reason to panic yet. Narduzzi and his staff have until August to get that number down, and further roster attrition should naturally come after spring camp, when a player (or two or three) sees the writing on the wall and enters the portal.</p>
<p>For now, the Panthers are in solid shape after further strengthening the cornerback position with Battle and inking Kessman's possible replacement in Sauls.</p>
