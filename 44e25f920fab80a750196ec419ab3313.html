<h1>Wesco completes Anixter acquisition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wesco International Inc. closed on its acquisition of Anixter International on Monday, making the combined company the largest distributor of electrical products in North America, according to Wesco’s market analysis.</p>
<p>The Station Square-based company, which distributes industrial, construction and utility equipment, pursued Illinois-based Anixter, whose specialty is in data communications, security, wire and cable products, to consolidate a fragmented market.</p>
<p>The deal has been in the works since last year and getting to this point required Wesco to fight off a private equity firm that wanted to buy Anixter and, it was then revealed, had also pursued Wesco.</p>
<p>Wesco raised its bid for the Illinois distributor several times until it was declared the winner. The final deal is valued at $4.5 billion.</p>
<p>The combined company is expected to have 18,600 employees and would have had $17 billion in revenue last year.</p>
<p>Wesco’s stock has seen significant growth since the pandemic shutdown in mid-March. It has outpaced the recovery of the S&amp;P 500 index by a factor of 5, with share prices rising from $15.77 on March 18 to $38.26 on Monday. That’s a gain of 143%, compared with the 29% increase in the S&amp;P index.</p>
<p>Still, Wesco’s stock price remains more than $20 below what it was when the company first revealed in late December that it was in a bidding war for Anixter. That announcement kicked off a stock slide that preceded but was exacerbated by the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
