<h1>City looking to refinance $161M in bonds while rates remain low</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The city is looking to take advantage of favorable market conditions and refinance just over $161 million in municipal bonds to reduce debt.</p>
<p>In an April 8 letter from the city’s Director of Finance Margaret Lanier to City Council members, the administration requested the approval of an issuance $161,250,000 and asked that council send the bill to committee this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because interest rates remain low,&nbsp;“it’s not unreasonable for a city to want to refinance some of its outstanding debt to get a savings, just like homeowners are refinancing mortgages because mortgage rates are so low right now,” said&nbsp;Matt Fabian, a partner and lead analyst at Massachusetts-based Municipal Market Analytics.&nbsp;“Cities really are in the exact same position. It works almost exactly like it would for a homeowner with a mortgage who can maybe free up a bit more cash every month.”</p>
<p>If approved, the bond issuance would be used in part to refund all or portions of bonds previously issued in 2012, 2014 and 2018.</p>
<p>“The city's financial advisors have been watching the constantly changing market, and determined the time is right to refinance. It should save the city an estimated $15 million,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman.</p>
<p>Council in February approved a $52 million bond issuance.</p>
<p>The resolution for the new refinancing will be introduced Tuesday and fast-tracked for committee discussion Wednesday.</p>
<p>Council on April 7 passed a resolution <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/31/City-pittsburgh-lines-of-credit-maintain-continuous-operations-COVID-19-economy/stories/202003310101" target="_blank">authorizing the Peduto administration to negotiate and secure lines of credit</a>&nbsp;“for the purpose of maintaining and supporting continuous operations during and immediately after the COVID-19 pandemic.”&nbsp;</p>
