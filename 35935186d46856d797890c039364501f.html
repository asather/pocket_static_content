<h1>Steelers sign punter Dustin Colquitt, release veteran Jordan Berry</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers will have a new punter for the first time since the 2014 season.</p>
<p>Dustin Colquitt, a 15-year veteran, signed with the Steelers on Monday after a tryout. Jordan Berry, who had served as the punter since 2015, was released.</p>
<p>Colquitt spent 15 seasons in Kansas City and was the punter in the Super Bowl for the Chiefs earlier this year. He played for the Chiefs from 2005 until he was released in the spring.</p>
<p>Colquittâ€™s average last season was 44.3 yards per punt, which was his lowest average since 2006. He turned 38 years old in May and is the son of former Steelers punter Craig Colquitt, who won Super Bowls with the Steelers following the 1978 and 1979 seasons.</p>
<p>Berry never missed a game in five seasons with the Steelers, but he was inconsistent with his kicks. The Steelers brought in Corliss Waitman to compete with him during training camp, but they decided to go with Colquitt instead. Waitman was signed to the practice squad Sunday.</p>
