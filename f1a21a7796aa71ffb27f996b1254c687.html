<h1>Pitt's offensive line takes responsibility for improving running game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dave Borbely, Pitt’s offensive line coach, is a bit of a perfectionist. That’s to be expected from a 61-year-old who’s coached at eight different Power Five programs over the course of his career. Borbely’s seen a lot, and he knows what he likes and doesn’t like.</p>
<p>Last year, Borbely, as well as Pitt’s fan base, saw a lot of the latter.</p>
<p>Pitt’s offensive line was competent at best, dismal at worst in 2019. That’s not news to anyone or something Pitt’s own linemen would refuse to admit. Jimmy Morrissey, the Panthers’ two-time captain and All-ACC center, acknowledged Pitt’s woeful rushing attack on more than one occasion last season, placing the blame at the feet of the offensive line.</p>
<p>It’s not entirely the line’s fault that Pitt ranked 118th nationally in rushing yards per game last year (118.8). The Panthers also ranked 100th in rushes per game, rarely committing to the run as Kenny Pickett attempted 39.1 throws per contest, third-most in college football. Running backs A.J. Davis, Vincent Davis and Todd Sibley Jr. also dealt with periodic injury issues, further stunting any potential growth in the ground game.</p>
<p>But the offensive line played a role in the Panthers averaging only 21.2 points per game (112th nationally) in Mark Whipple’s first year as offensive coordinator. Pro Football Focus ranked Pitt’s offensive line 94th in the country, as it allowed 76 tackles for loss (77th nationally) and 29 sacks (86th). Pitt was also penalized 102 times, fourth-most among Power Five teams, with false starts and illegal procedures factoring heavily.</p>
<p>As Pitt’s offense tries to take a step forward in Whipple’s second year, Pitt will still rely on Pickett’s arm. But the Panthers know they need a reliable rushing attack in 2020 to reach the ACC championship game — and that starts with the offensive line making noticeable improvements.</p>
<p>“We’ve been stressing that we have to run the ball, and we’ve got to be good at it if we want to win championships,” said Carter Warren, the Panthers’ returning starter at left tackle. “There’s been a lot of emphasis on running the ball.”</p>
<p>“We put that on our back as the offensive line. That’s our responsibility,” Morrissey added. “I think we’re going to have a lot better year running the ball.”</p>
<p>While it’s hard for the Panthers to do worse in the run game, Morrissey’s confidence is rooted in something real.</p>
<p>The fifth-year senior — who hasn’t allowed a sack in 1,006 pass-blocking snaps, per Pro Football Focus — said Pitt’s line took an aggressive approach to training camp, practicing what he called “running off the ball” when run blocking. “Instead of being passive and seeing what the defense does,” Morrissey said, the Panthers are going after defensive linemen with more urgency.</p>
<p>Bryce Hargrove, Pitt’s returning starter at left guard, concurred, adding that Borbely’s group “capitalized and learned” from studying its own film and that of the Dallas Cowboys, New Orleans Saints and other NFL offensive lines during quarantine Zoom sessions.</p>
<p>Hargrove, Warren and Morrissey also agreed that the offensive line’s experience and familiarity should help keep Pickett upright and open holes for Pitt’s cluster of backs.</p>
<p>Warren, after entering last season as an unproven redshirt freshman, now has 13 starts under his belt. Hargrove, a rotational piece in 2018, earned third-team All-ACC honors and allowed just one sack last year. Morrissey’s resume speaks for itself, while Butler’s Jake Kradel and Upper St. Clair’s Gabe Houy return with experience at right guard and right tackle, respectively.</p>
<p>Kradel, a redshirt sophomore, started the final seven games of the season at right guard. Houy — who battled through undisclosed injury issues throughout the campaign and underwent offseason surgery — worked at right tackle when healthy after starting the first six games at guard.</p>
<p>“You like being on the field with him because he inspires you with his intensity and the way he approaches the game,” Hargrove said of Houy before complimenting Kradel. “And Jake, that’s my guy. That’s my young dude. ... Every day, every play, every rep we exchange a back and forth. How would you take this block? How would you approach this play? How do you approach film? How do you approach the game?”</p>
<p>Matt Goncalves, a 6-foot-6 redshirt freshman who can swing between guard and tackle, is another young option at Borbely’s disposal. Keldrick Wilson, a graduate transfer from Hampton, will continue to compete with Houy for the right tackle gig. Meanwhile, Belle Vernon’s Blake Zubovic, Carson Van Lynn and Owen Drexel are slated to back up Kradel, Warren and Morrissey, respectively.</p>
<p>Head coach Pat Narduzzi, who’s talked up all 10 of the aforementioned linemen at some point in the last month, is confident those five starters and the depth behind them are enough to elevate Pitt’s offense. In fact, when he was asked on Monday how confident he was in the offensive line, Narduzzi said he was confident four times.</p>
<p>But as his answer continued, Narduzzi couched that confidence with a dose of caution as Pitt nears its season opener against Austin Peay at 4 p.m. Saturday at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“I’m confident until I’m not confident,” Narduzzi said. “... I’m excited with where we are. And that’s why you play games. We’re going to find out who they are and what they are — and what this 2020 team looks like — on Saturday at 4 o’clock. That’s when I’ll really know.”</p>
