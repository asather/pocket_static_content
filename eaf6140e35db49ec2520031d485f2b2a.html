<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: Could the Pirates be better than we think?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise's weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon on Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @Paul Zeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let's get started.</em></p>
<p><strong>Chris:</strong> People seem to want the Pirates to spend $100 million on payroll, but even that wouldn't be enough to field a World Series team. That's why until baseball economics are fixed, isn't Bob Nutting smart for pocketing the $50 million he isn't spending?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes, he is very smart. That doesn't mean he is right and that doesn't mean fans need to participate in that scheme. That is the prevailing attitude, though, when it comes to the smaller market teams these days. They believe they should save the money they could spend to get a little bit better and hope they get lucky with a couple of reclamation projects. He isn't the only one. There is a prevailing thought that if you can save $20 or $30 million and still field a reasonably competitive team, why wouldn't you do it? I hate that thought and wish winning was more of a priority, but I can't blame him for it. He has made a lot of money from the Pirates, and that seems to be his ultimate goal.</p>
<p><strong>Franklin:</strong> Hear me out â€” I actually think the Pirates will be better than people think. The pitching staff is solid, the moves they have made have improved the defense and if Polanco is healthy the middle of their lineup (Reynolds, Bell, Polanco) isn't terrible. Am I just an overly optimistic fan?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I wish I could get there with you, man, but I can't. I think this is a 62 to 68-win team all around. They have way too many bad players or below-average players. The pitching staff is a huge question mark and has not shown any signs of consistency. The defense will be a little better, but that's not nearly enough to fix what ails the team. I just don't see much, if any, improvement from last year, and don't forget this fact: If any of the veterans perform well in the first half, they will likely be dealt for prospects at the trade deadline. That will hurt the team's chances of winning in the second half of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> Wouldn't it benefit the Pirates to sign a player like Yasiel Puig if not to help with attendance, then to turn and flip them at the trade deadline for prospects?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong>&nbsp;I suppose, but how many people are flocking to PNC Park to watch a bad team with Yasiel Puig? Maybe he could become a nice trade piece, but at this point, it wouldn't make much sense to sign him.</p>
<p><strong>Theodore:</strong> People have made fun of the idea that the Steelers should trade Ben Roethlisberger but I can't understand why more fans don't embrace it. Wouldn't it be in the best interest of the Steelers long term?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Ben Roethlisberger's contract is a real problem for the Steelers. And that's especially true if he can't come back and play at a reasonably high level. And while I do see some merit in your thoughts, I don't think it is that simple. The Steelers still think they can win this year, and if that's the case, their best chance of achieving that is with a healthy Roethlisberger. There is also so much dead cap money and all that stuff involved in a trade of a contract like his that I don't think that it would benefit in the short term. And I am not even sure what he would bring in return.</p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong> Why do college coaches sign contracts if they are able to get out of them and leave anytime they want? Why don't the colleges make them honor their deals?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> They aren't binding, that's why. And schools can fire coaches any time they want. And the reason schools won't band together to try and force some sort of legislation that makes coaches honor their contracts is every school wants to be able to hire and fire coaches as they please. Say Pat Narduzzi broke his contract and went to Michigan State. Pitt fans would complain about loyalty even though his replacement would likely be some other head coach who broke his contract to come to Pitt. That's just the way of the world, and as long as schools can fire coaches, coaches will always have the ability to leave on their own.</p>
<p><strong>Jim:</strong> I keep hearing you say that Pat Narduzzi has done a good job. What is this based on? He has been average at best.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think he has built a good, solid foundation. He has given the program an identity. He has the Panthers on the verge of becoming a top-25 team annually. I like how he has recruited and I think he has brought a certain toughness to the brand. I am interested to see if that translates into 10-win seasons, and I have a hunch that it will.</p>
