<h1>Pitt men's basketball adds Morgan State to its 2020-21 non-conference schedule</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ever so gradually, Pitt’s men’s basketball schedule for the 2020-21 season is taking shape.</p>
<p>The Panthers will host Morgan State on Nov. 25 at Petersen Events Center, according to a copy of the contract obtained through a public records request. The deal was signed by Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke on April 24.</p>
<p>As part of the arrangement between the two schools, Pitt will pay Morgan State $85,000 within 60 days of the contest’s completion, a common sum for a game between a major-conference program and an opponent from a much smaller league. It is a standalone game and not part of a larger series.</p>
<p>The tipoff time for the contest has yet to be determined.</p>
<p>With the game against the Bears set, the Panthers have five matchups on its 2020-21 non-conference schedule that are not yet known. They’ll play at West Virginia in the final game of a four-game series, will be included in the annual ACC-Big Ten Challenge against a yet-to-be-unveiled opponent and are scheduled to play in the Myrtle Beach Invitational, where they’ll take part in three games.</p>
<p>Morgan State, a historically black university in Baltimore that is a member of the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference, finished 15-16 overall and 9-7 in its league during the 2019-20 season. Though that was the program’s best win percentage since 2012-13, it ended the season ranked No. 322 of 353 Division I teams, according to KenPom.com. Last season was the Bears’ first under coach Kevin Broadus, a former assistant coach at Maryland and Georgetown who, as a head coach, led Binghamton to the NCAA tournament in 2009.</p>
