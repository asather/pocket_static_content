<h1>Degrading impeachment</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the Senate’s acquittal of President Donald Trump, the impeachment melodrama finally ends.</p>
<p>Impeachment always seemed reckless — based as it was on vague charges and a rushed and incomplete investigation by the House and held, as it was, in the shadow of a new presidential election.</p>
<p>The Senate did no better. It held a trial without witnesses.</p>
<p>And the whole thing was brought on by the president’s own stupendous recklessness and hubris.</p>
<p>There were no good guys in this whole messy and sad affair.</p>
<p>And everyone knew the bottom line and ultimate outcome. Everyone knew the votes for impeachment would never be there. So what was the point?</p>
<p>The point was to assert once again that Mr. Trump should not be president — that he is “unworthy.”</p>
<p>But that is a word we should all be careful with. Barack Obama has supposedly said that Bernie Sanders is unworthy to be president. Some thought Mr. Obama was unworthy.</p>
<p>In the United States of America, anyone duly elected is worthy.</p>
<p>When the Watergate crisis happened, President Gerald Ford called it “our long national nightmare.” And it was. But there <em>were</em>&nbsp;good guys, and we all watched and learned and felt proud. The result was idealism.</p>
<p>In this case, the result is cynicism and an increased likelihood that the next Democratic president with a Republican House will be impeached.</p>
<p>Impeachment has been degraded, if not trivialized, and the Senate, House and presidency have been wounded and diminished.</p>
<p>We need to stop this. We need to end the politics of enmity and payback before we destroy ourselves.</p>
