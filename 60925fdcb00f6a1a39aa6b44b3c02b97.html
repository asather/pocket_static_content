<h1>Italy slows deaths as day-to-day positive cases of COVID-19 drop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ROME — Italy’s day-to-day increases of new cases of COVID-19 have dropped considerably compared to figures from a day earlier.</p>
<p>According to data released on Monday by Italy’s Civil Protection agency, new cases rose from a day earlier by 4,789 cases.</p>
<p>That’s nearly 700 fewer new cases that were reported in the day’s previous day-to-day increases. Italy has been anxious to see daily new case loads drop as it health system struggles to keep up with the world’s largest outbreak after China.</p>
<p>Day-to-day increase in deaths also were fewer than the day before: 602 compared to 651 reported by authorities on Sunday.</p>
<p>Health authorities have said it will need a few more days to see if a positive trend holds, including in northern Lombardy region, which is the nation’s worst stricken region.</p>

<p>The latest numbers come nearly two weeks into a national lock-down in a desperate bid to contain Europe’s largest outbreak.</p>
<p>Italy has become the flash point of the coronavirus pandemic, with a death toll at 6,077 and counting -- the highest in the world. More than 2,000 Italians have been killed by the virus in the past four days alone.</p>
<p>The staggering toll stands for now as a worst-case scenario for what happens when a country is caught unprepared. Italy’s high elderly population has exacerbated the problem.</p>
<p>But while some unique aspects have amplified the scale, doctors and health officials say other countries should regard Italy not as an outlier or an example of missteps, but as a harrowing preview for the hardships they might soon have at hand.</p>
<p>The disaster in Italy does not stem from gross government negligence. Rather, analysts say it is partly a consequence of the weeks between the emergence of the outbreak and the government decision to absolutely lock down the population. And though many in Italy now argue their government waited too long, democracies across the West have been mulling the same decisions -- and in some cases have acted less decisively.</p>
