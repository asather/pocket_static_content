<h1>Mt. Lebanon 'concerned' about PIAA basketball game because of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Concerns over COVID-19 have begun to affect the PIAA basketball playoffs, but the league is going forward with all games.</p>
<p>Three Philadelphia-area schools refused to play host to PIAA boys basketball second-round playoff games Tuesday and Wednesday because of concerns over COVID-19. That forced the PIAA to find alternate sites for the games.</p>
<p>Also, Mt. Lebanon’s school administrators expressed concern to the PIAA Tuesday about playing Cheltenham in a boys game Wednesday at Chambersburg High School. Mt. Lebanon’s concerns came after Cheltenham, located in Montgomery County near Philadelphia, announced Monday that it was closing school for the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Cheltenham officials said a school district parent was a caregiver to a patient who tested presumptive positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon coach Joe David said Tuesday night that he is still unsure about the status of the game, but was hopeful it would be played. Both David and Mt. Lebanon athletic director John Grogan said said school administrators were working with the PIAA and Cheltenham, but there was a possibility that the only fans allowed to attend the contest would be family members of players and coaches.</p>
<p>“Nothing has been decided definitely yet,” David said. “Obviously, we want to play. We’ve been practicing all year for this. Hopefully, they’ll figure out something that everyone is happy with and safe with. There might be a compromise of something like, ‘They do this and we do that.’”</p>
<p>Earlier Tuesday afternoon, PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said there is no plan to cancel games or limit fans.</p>
<p>“We’re going day by day and following some direction by the [Pennsylvania] Department of Health,” Lombardi said. “We certainly don’t want to close down games. We haven’t gotten to that level and hopefully we won’t.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday afternoon, the Ohio High School Athletic Association (Ohio’s equivalent of the PIAA) announced that beginning Wednesday, it would limit spectators to state and regional basketball games. This was in response to Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine asking Tuesday that all indoor sporting events in Ohio — high school, college and professional — be played without most fans in attendance.</p>
<p>The Connecticut Interscholastic Athletic Conference announced Tuesday that it had cancelled the remainder of the winter sports high school tournaments, which include boys and girls basketball, hockey and boys swimming.</p>
<p>OHSAA Executive Director Jerry Snodgrass said in a release, “We are pleased that our tournaments can continue and we will soon determine who can attend. However, we can already say that it will most likely be no more than the immediate family of the student-athletes participating in the event.”</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Oxford, Coatesville and Norristown high schools all informed the PIAA that they would not play host to second-round games.</p>
<p>Oxford declined to host West Chester Rustin and Unionville after Unionville announced Monday that it was closing as a precautionary measure. Coatesville refused to host Lower Merion and West Lawn Wilson after Lower Merion announced it would close for a day. Norristown refused to stage the game between Methacton and Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>“We’ve had statements placed on our web site about [COVID-19],”&nbsp;Lombardi said. “We’re following the department of health’s guidance and trying to promote the message of people trying to protect themselves by washing their hands, using sanitizers, cough into their elbows, have fist bumps and elbow bumps in games instead of handshakes.</p>
<p>:We also hope the general public is being diligent to make sure they’re healthy. If they’re sick, stay home.”</p>
