<h1>Shareholders OK Mylan's merger with Upjohn</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mylan shareholders have overwhelmingly approved the generic drug makerâ€™s proposed merger with Upjohn, Mylan announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>Approximately 99.6% of votes cast were voted in favor of the transaction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pending regulatory approvals, the merger is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, Mylan said.</p>
<p>Mylan, which is run from executive offices in Cecil, had expected the deal to be completed by now, but in March announced a delay due to expected delays in the regulatory approval process because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>Upjohn, based in China, is the generic and off-patent brand name drug unit of Pfizer Inc.</p>
<p>The newly combined company is to be called Viatris.</p>
