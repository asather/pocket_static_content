<h1>Ten jurors seated in Wilkinsburg mass shooting case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two more jurors were seated on Monday to hear the case against two men accused of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2016/03/10/Multiple-people-shot-in-Wilkinsburg/stories/201603100136" target="_blank">2016 Wilkinsburg mass shooting</a> that killed five people and an unborn child.</p>
<p>That brings the total for the capital case to 10, divided evenly between five women and five men.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cheron Shelton, 32, of Lincoln-Lemington, and Robert Thomas, 31, of Homewood, are accused in the March 9, 2016, shooting during a backyard cookout on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Killed were siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26. Three others were wounded.</p>
<p>Testimony in the case is expected to begin the week of Feb. 3 before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski.</p>
<p>If the jury finds either or both of the defendants guilty of first-degree murder, the case will move into a penalty phase where the prosecution will ask the jury to return a sentence of death.</p>
<p>On Monday, attorneys for the prosecution and defense interviewed 13 prospective jurors and chose two — a woman who works in social media marketing and a man who is employed as a teacher.</p>
<p>One woman was excused from jury service when she said she wasn’t sure she would be able to separate out her emotions once she viewed the photos of the victims or crime scene. A young man was excused when he said he would give more credibility to a police officer testifying than a layperson based on the the officer’s oath to uphold the law.</p>
<p>Selection will continue on Tuesday. A total of 12 jurors and four alternates will be selected.</p>
