<h1>Executive says Nova Chemicals not for sale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A top executive of the investment firm that controls Nova Chemicals said the company is not for sale at this time.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced last year that Nova’s owner, Mubadala Investment of the United Arab Emirates, was exploring its options including a sale.</p>
<p>In a video interview with Bloomberg, Musabbeh Al-Kaabi, chief executive of petroleum and refining for Mubadala, said the firm doesn’t think it’s the right time to sell.</p>
<p>Its owners are “very proud” of Nova, which has delivered “excellent operational performance” and is “enjoying a leading petrochemicals position in North America,” he said.</p>
<p>Nova, based in Calgary, Canada, has about 250 employees at an executive center in Moon, and 200 at a plant and technology center in Monaca, Beaver County.</p>
<p>It makes plastics used in packaging, industrial molding and other applications; and foams used in construction materials, coffee cups, automobile components and other products.</p>
<p>Sales totaled $4.5 billion in 2018.</p>
<p>In the Bloomberg interview, Mr. Al-Kaabi acknowledged Nova is currently making a “massive investment” in capital expenditures.&nbsp;Among its projects is a $2.2 billion facility expansion in Sarnia, Ontario.</p>
<p>Last week, Nova said it’s selling its 50% stake in a joint venture in the Texas Gulf Coast to venture partner Borealis, an Austrian business.</p>
<p>Terms weren’t disclosed.</p>
<p>Mubadala Investment is a government holding firm based in Abu Dhabi.</p>
<p>In June, Reuters reported that Chevron Phillips Chemical offered $15 billion for Nova. The companies at the time did not comment on that report.</p>
