<h1>Review: Feel the cool aboard Indian's muscular Scout Bobber Sixty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are two ways to achieve coolness in life.&nbsp;One is to be born with the name Arthur Fonzarelli.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the rest of us, there's only the buy-in option.&nbsp;That's where Indian steps in.</p>
<p>Indian Motorcycles, which continues to rebuild its brand by catering to younger riders, is promoting its Scout Bobber Sixty, a minimalist bike with a mouthful of a name.</p>
<p>The motorcycle has a low, muscular profile and a blacked-out look that makes it one sweet piece of industrial art. So much so that it was right at home during a photo shoot at Rivers of Steel's Carrie Furnaces in Swissvale.</p>
<p>And, boy, is it cool.</p>
<p>Indeed, a ride aboard the Sixty generated a lot of second looks and plenty of comments, often centering on just how low the bike sits — the seat is just 25½&nbsp;inches above the ground.</p>
<p>During my first ride, I even worried that the footpegs would drag at every turn. But it was all in my head. The Sixty may sit low, but it’s surprisingly nimble and wants to turn. Lean angle — max is 31 degrees — was never a problem. During a late-summer ride, the bike ate up the many twists and turns near Ohiopyle State Park and Bear Run in Fayette County.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, however, that the Sixty has very little rear suspension —&nbsp;just 2 inches of travel. With a big rider like me further compromising the dual springs, the price for being — well, looking — cool was paid by my derriere. Avoid potholes and sunken manhole covers. And McArdle Roadway. And Millvale.</p>
<p>The riding position, with back hunched to reach the bars, puts some strain on the lower back, even for riders over 6 feet tall. That’s part of the “look,” but a little more back support from the stock seat would’ve been welcomed.</p>
<p>Those were my only issues with the Scout Bobber Sixty, and it generally prevented rides longer than 50 miles or so before I needed a break. Still, it's important to remember that the bike's a bobber, and comfiness isn’t part of a bobber’s DNA.</p>
<p>Everything else was flawless.</p>
<p>The motorcycle is one of Indian's entries in the V-twin cruiser market. With an engine displacement of 61 cubic inches, or 1,000cc, the Sixty is a tad smaller than its big brother, the Scout Bobber, which comes with a 69-cubic inch (1,133cc) engine.</p>
<p>The 2020 model I tested came in Thunder Black with ABS and a $9,799 price tag. Without ABS, the bike's MSRP is $8,999, which may be one of its most attractive features.</p>
<p>While the cost is low, the bike isn't cheap. It not only looks like a more expensive bike, it rides like one.</p>
<p>The Sixty puts out a claimed 78 horsepower and 65 foot-pounds of torque — numbers that aren’t overwhelming compared with other bikes on the market or underwhelming for anyone enjoying the open road. And it’s forgiving. Miss a downshift or two coming to that stoplight? No problem. A touch of throttle and the bike pulls away just fine in third gear.</p>
<p>Shifting through the five-speed transmission was smooth and effortless. No clunkiness at all.</p>
<p>Hard pulls on the throttle brought on exciting rushes of acceleration, especially in the 3,500-5,500 rpm range in second and third. Near 75 or 80 mph, there was some buzz, especially in the pegs and mirrors, but that’s normal for a big twin.</p>
<p>Honestly, the Sixty can be ridden almost entirely in second gear in the city, with just a few flirtations in first and third. If you're in fourth or fifth, you're likely on the highway.</p>
<p>At the lowest speeds, I expected some surging or hiccups with the throttle. That was never a problem, even while holding the throttle steady over a bumpy stretch of road.</p>
<p>That compliance helps while commuting. In traffic, the liquid-cooled Sixty does get hot, so don't be surprised when the cooling fan whirls into action.</p>
<p>Both the fan and belt drive made some noise, but they were otherwise drowned out by the motor.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how many things in life sound better than a V-twin during deceleration, and the Sixty — whose V is 60 degrees — sounds the part, with two blacked out mufflers keeping the decibels in check. They look like a double-barrel shotgun running down the right side of the bike.</p>
<p>Up front, the braking is handled by a single disk and a two-piston caliper. Since I'm generally used to dual discs up front, I made good use of the rear brake, a single-disk, one-caliper unit. I did not test the ABS.</p>
<p>The bike’s clean, minimalistic look continues with the headlight, the block INDIAN on the tank — no fancy logo on this model — and&nbsp;the gauges. The only design frill was the script letter I on the cylinder heads.</p>
<p>The instrument cluster is simple, and the analog speedometer will be appreciated by purists. Below the speedometer is a small digital display that shows the selected gear along with a choice of digital tachometer, engine temperature, odometer and trip meter. That information can be accessed by a toggle switch managed by the rider's left index finger.</p>
<p>While the Sixty lacks a gas gauge, it does include a low-level light. Please note: That light is your friend, as the Sixty carries only 3.3 gallons of fuel. And at nearly 550 pounds (with fuel), it’s not exactly an economy vehicle.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that’s OK, since the Sixty won’t likely be your long-haul bike. In and around town, it has plenty of available grunt. Combine that with its looks and a price still in the four-figure range, and Indian may have a winner on its hands.</p>
