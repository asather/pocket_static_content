<h1>Some districts get set to exceed previous limits on high school football fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A few days after a federal ruling gave the green light to large gatherings in Pennsylvania, some local school districts are giving their high school football teams the OK to admit hundreds of fans.</p>
<p>The Butler and Belle Vernon school districts released guidelines this week regarding spectators at home games. Both schools play their home openers Friday. Butler is anticipating roughly 750 attendees, a number that includes its band and cheerleaders, groups they previously were not going to allow. Belle Vernon has imposed a limit of 627 fans.</p>
<p>The decisions come on the heels of Monday’s ruling by United States District Judge William S. Stickman IV, who ruled that restrictions on outdoor gatherings mandated by Gov. Tom Wolf to lessen the spread of COVID-19 are unconstitutional.</p>

<p>When the WPIAL high school season kicked off last Friday, some schools strictly enforced the state’s outdoor gathering limit of 250, while others did not. West Mifflin and Upper St. Clair were among those who exceeded 250.</p>
<p>A week later, some will now considerably exceed that previous limit.</p>
<p>“Talking with my superintendent [Brian White], we thought that with what happened on Monday, this was a good opportunity to increase the number of fans a little bit,” Butler athletic director Bill Mylan said. “This gives our band and cheerleaders and some of our parents a chance to see a football game. God forbid we get shut down somewhere down the road, we thought this was a good opportunity to provide that to them.”</p>
<p>There are a few other balls in play, so to speak. One of them is a bill. Last week, the state House and Senate passed a bill allowing schools to have the final say on crowd sizes for all sports. It’s now sitting in the hands of Gov. Wolf, who has stated he will veto it. However, because the House and Senate both passed the bill by two-thirds of majority, they can override the veto. A verdict might not be rendered until next week. Additionally, the state Department of Education could send out new recommendations, possibly as soon as Friday.</p>
<p>At Butler, all football, band members and cheerleaders will be given two tickets to Friday’s game against Erie McDowell. The football team has a roster of 54 players and Mylan said there are more than 200 band members and cheerleaders. McDowell will not be allocated any tickets. Previously, only parents of senior football players and cheerleaders were going to be admitted. The stadium holds about 6,500.</p>
<p>“Obviously, our parents are elated,” Mylan said. “From a community standpoint, there’s a lot of happy people that we’re doing this. It’s important for them to get the opportunity to see their son or daughter either cheering, playing an instrument or playing football.”</p>
<p>Belle Vernon, which has a stadium that seats 5,000, will also provide two tickets to each football player, band member and cheerleader, according to athletic director Matt Humbert, who doubles as head football coach. The visiting district — this week it’s West Mifflin — will be provided 120 tickets, while 45 tickets will be distributed to Belle Vernon administrators, school board directors, and guests. A liability waiver must be signed and submitted upon entrance.</p>
<p>Right up the road from Butler, the Karns City Area School District said Wednesday that it will no longer restrict attendance to events. Karns City, which hosts DuBois on Friday, is not a WPIAL school. It’s a member of District 9.</p>
