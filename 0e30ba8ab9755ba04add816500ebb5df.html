<h1>Scott commissioner draws condemnation after remark about Pa. health secretary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Remarks made during a public meeting by Scott Commissioner Paul Abel and aimed at Pennsylvania Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine have some residents calling for his resignation.</p>
<p>The commissioner’s comments were made Tuesday at the end of a nearly three-hour meeting and after he questioned the state’s color-coded system of loosening COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll tell ya, I am tired of listening to a guy dressed up like a woman,” he said, a clear reference to Dr. Levine, a transgender woman.</p>

<p>His comment was met with an audible gasp by Commissioner Stacey Altman.</p>
<p>During the public meeting, none of the commissioners responded to Mr. Abel’s comments. Six of the eight commissioners participated in the meeting via Zoom. Mr. Abel, who is vice president of the commission, and another commissioner participated in person at the municipal building.</p>
<p>Mr. Abel questioned if there was “any end to this,” referring to the restrictions set in place by the Wolf administration. The question was directed at commissioner Angela Wateska, who has a master’s degree in public health and epidemiology.</p>
<p>“We’re in the green now. Is there any end to this? Is there another color, do we go to blue or anything where we can start acting like human beings again?” Mr. Abel said.</p>
<p>Ms. Wateska said, “As far as when green ends, or if we do have to go back to yellow, I have no idea.”</p>
<p>It was after that exchange Mr. Abel made his comments about Dr. Levine.</p>
<p>He then added, “I know how frustrated people are. I just hope somebody realizes that. I understand some people are afraid. I understand that, and that’s fine, but I think the rest of us that aren’t and who want to take the risk should be able to do whatever they want: go out to dinner, go snowshoeing.”</p>
<p>The controversial remarks prompted the township on Thursday to issue an apology letter.</p>
<p>“The township, its board, administration and employees strive to serve and respect all residents and non-residents alike, regardless of race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity or socio-economic class,” the apology said. “While we understand Commissioner Abel made these very surprising comments in the heat of frustration in attempting to balance the safety and public service and recreation needs of Township residents at the end of a three-hour commissioners’ meeting, such frustration does not justify the comments made, and we apologize to the community and to Dr. Levine, specifically.”</p>
<p>In a Facebook post made public by Scott Township Watchdogs, which is not affiliated with the township, resident Lynn Trachtenberg Richards, who shared the meeting video on the page, wrote, “Not only is his comment disgusting, inappropriate and hate-filled, not one of the other commissioners called him on it.”</p>
<p>She went on to post, “I want to call for his immediate resignation. There should be consequences for his remarks and he should be held accountable.”</p>

<p>Ms. Richards’ post has more than 70 comments, some of which also call for Mr. Abel’s resignation.</p>
<p>Scott resident Carrie O’Connell contacted the Delta Foundation of Pittsburgh, an LGBTQ advocacy organization, after she saw the video.</p>
<p>“Every single day, Dr. Levine has offered a calming presence in her daily briefings on the coronavirus pandemic. We’re disappointed at the vitriol that continues to be directed against someone whose top concern is keeping Pennsylvanians healthy,” said Christine Bryan, Delta Foundation’s spokeswoman.</p>
<p>“I literally just was in shock by it,” Ms. O’Connell said, adding that she was equally shocked “at the fact that nobody said anything” during the meeting about Mr. Abel’s comment.</p>
<p>“I was sad. I was shocked to see, here’s this community leader ... who not only feels this way, but openly expressed it in a professional capacity,” Ms. O’Connell said.</p>
<p>She said she hopes to work with the Delta Foundation to “do something meaningful” in light of Mr. Abel’s comments and not just to lash out and call for his resignation.</p>
<p>She plans on writing a letter to the president of the board of commissioners expressing the “disappointment and sadness that this has brought on the community.”</p>
<p>Ms. O’Connell said nearly 30 residents have committed to signing the letter.</p>
<p>“My end goal is to try and address the situation in a way that we can turn this into a teachable moment for everyone and maybe come out of it with some understanding and some acceptance, if not at least tolerance, of the differences that exist among us,” Ms. O’Connell said.</p>
<p>She said community leaders need to think about how their words impact the people they serve.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Commission President Dave Calabria said Mr. Abel’s comments were wrong, and he was surprised by what the former police officer said.</p>
<p>“I do not know why he would say a remark like he did,” Mr. Calabria said. “He was frustrated, but that is not an excuse.”</p>
<p>Why didn’t Mr. Calabria respond immediately to Mr. Abel’s statement?</p>
<p>“Myself, I was shocked and did not want to hear any more of it with the hopes he realized what he had done,” Mr. Calabria said.</p>
<p>“Paul asked me if I wanted him to resign,” he said. “I said, ‘No, if you are apologizing and mean it, you made a mistake.’ ”</p>
<p>In an email, Commissioner Tom Castello — writing on behalf of Commissioners Meyers, Altman and Wateska — said: “We were stunned and appalled at the statement made by Commissioner Abel at our June meeting regarding Dr. Rachel Levine. Commissioner Abel's opinions and views are not those of ours. Our biggest mistake was not addressing Commissioner Abel's statement when it happened but we were too stunned to immediately respond. For that we apologize.”</p>
<p>Ms. Wateska added, “Speaking for myself, it did take longer than I would have liked to process what he was saying, but I still should have spoken up.”</p>
<p>In addition to the commission’s apology letter, Ms. Wateska further explained why she didn’t say anything during the meeting.</p>
<p>“I've been trying for the last several years to consider myself as someone who stands with and supports marginalized individuals, but the reality is I didn't have the courage to speak up.&nbsp;... I apologize to Dr. Levine, the transgender community, and Scott Township for not doing better,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Abel did not respond to requests for comment.</p>
<p>When asked for a comment from Dr. Levine, state Health Department spokeswoman Maggi Mumma said, “Dr. Levine always serves at the pleasure of the governor and will continue to serve under his leadership as Secretary of Health. She remains laser-focused on protecting the health and well-being of Pennsylvanians as we navigate this ongoing pandemic.”</p>
<p>Ms. Mumma said Dr. Levine did not have any further comment. She referred the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette to a press release issued this week by the Pennsylvania Commission on LGBTQ Affairs denouncing transphobia in the commonwealth.</p>
<p>“In times of crisis and pain, LGBTQ individuals are united in pushing back against transphobia of any kind. Members of the commission believe that the health and safety of Pennsylvanians should not be undermined due to these toxic and personal attacks,” the release stated.</p>
