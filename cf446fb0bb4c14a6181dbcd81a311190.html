<h1>Some Allegheny County parks close early</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite the record warm weather Saturday, three Allegheny County parks will close early due to&nbsp;“inclement weather.”</p>
<p>The ice rinks at both North and South parks, as well as the snow tubing and skiing areas at Boyce Park, will close at 7 p.m., according to the county.</p>
<p>The parks are scheduled to open for normal operations Sunday&nbsp;“weather and conditions permitting.”</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh area <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/11/record-high-temperature-National-Weather-Service-warmth-continues-high-winds-possible/stories/202001110042" target="_blank">broke a record</a> Saturday as the temperature hit 70 degrees on this date for the first time since 1890.</p>
<p>However, a line of thunderstorms moved over the area just after sunset, and the region is under a wind advisory until 1 p.m. Sunday.</p>
