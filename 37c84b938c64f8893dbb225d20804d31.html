<h1>COVID-19 testing now underway at state lab in Chester County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health has begun testing on its own for COVID-19 at the state laboratory in Exton, Chester County, its secretary said Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We are testing samples as we speak at our state lab,” Dr. Rachel Levine said during a phone press conference.</p>
<p>The state lab can currently only handle about six cases a day, which Dr. Levine said should “significantly” increase by the end of the week as the state gets more equipment to handle more tests.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Levine said&nbsp;“a number” of commercial laboratories, including at academic health centers around the state, have told the state they are going to begin testing in-house by the end of this week or beginning of next week using the federal test kit now being distributed.</p>
<p>At a separate press conference earlier Tuesday at UPMC Montefiore hospital, UPMC said it has already begun work on its own in-house test for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“We are working quickly to develop our own testing capabilities so that any cases could be identified more rapidly,” said Dr. Graham Snyder, UPMC’s medical director of infection prevention</p>
<p>He said getting a test up and running&nbsp;“is a priority” for UPMC, which is not waiting to get a test kit from the federal government to get its testing going.&nbsp;</p>
<p>UPMC spokeswoman Allison Hydzik said in an email after the press conference that UPMC would, instead, use “the reagents specified by the CDC in order to speed-up our process” of getting a test in-house.</p>
<p>Allegheny Health Network is “working with several of our lab instrumentation vendors who are pursuing approval of their tests for the virus - while we also explore the possibility of developing our own in- house test,” according to AHN spokesman Dan Laurent in an email answer to questions.</p>
<p>Dr. Kristen Mertz, Allegheny County Health Department’s medical epidemiologist, said at the UPMC press conference that, until now, any cases in the state that have been tested for COVID-19 had to be sent to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lab in Atlanta —&nbsp;a process that took two to three days before a sample was analyzed.</p>
<p>With the state lab, that process could take less than 24 hours, depending on how close the person being tested is to that lab.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That process would come down to mere hours if it could be done in-house.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said the state has been sending samples to Atlanta over the last month, though she would not say how many.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania still has yet to have a case of COVID-19, though Dr. Levine said, “We will not be surprised if we [eventually] have a positive test.”</p>
<p>With expanded testing, Dr. Mertz said, “We expect to detect cases in Pennsylvania in the coming weeks and we are prepared.”</p>
<p>Dr. Don Yealy, UPMC’s chief of emergency medicine, said even though patients have been considered for COVID-19 testing, not a single patient has yet been tested for it in the UPMC system.</p>
<p>“We still have not had any cases in need of COVID-19 testing, based on the collaborative, expert decision making that we’ve already had in process for weeks now,” he said during the press conference.</p>
<p>Both Dr. Levine and Dr. Mertz said many travelers from affected countries — in particular, China,&nbsp;where COVID-19 first was identified — have been monitored since they returned over the last month.</p>
<p>“Since Feb. 3, we have been monitoring travelers coming back from China,” Dr. Mertz said,&nbsp;“telling them to stay home and collecting information on their temperature and their symptoms.”</p>
<p>Dr. Mertz said the “worst case scenario” of what could happen in an outbreak of a new virus with no known vaccine or cure is exactly what has already happened in Wuhan, China, “where a large percentage of people become ill.”</p>
<p>“We don’t think that will happen here, one, because we are more prepared for the virus now,” she said. “They [in Wuhan] have the disadvantage of being the first place [it struck] where we are not.”</p>
<p>“We also had the advantage of delay, in that China is now doing clinical trials on some anti-viral medications, so we’re hoping that we start to see some results of those in the next month or so, and that should also help,” she said. “So there’s several reasons why we don’t think it is going to be as severe here as it was in China.”</p>
