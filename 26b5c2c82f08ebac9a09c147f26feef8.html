<h1>The Next Page: Remembering August Wilson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When he was 20, August Wilson walked to downtown Pittsburgh and bought his first typewriter. After carrying the 35-pound machine back to his basement apartment in the Hill District, he began a career that would produce the most significant chronicle of Black life in Pittsburgh ever written, and mark him as one of America’s greatest playwrights.</p>
<p>It was on “the Hill” where Mr. Wilson, who died 15 years ago this month, studied the speech and behavior of the men and women who populated one of the most vibrant Black neighborhoods in America.</p>
<p>“I went out on the street corners, the bars and restaurants and barbershops to learn how to be a man to learn what codes of conduct the community sanctioned and how I might best live a full and dedicated life,” Wilson said in 1999 at the celebration of the 100th anniversary of the Hill District branch of the Carnegie Library.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Born in 1945, Mr. Wilson came of age during the Hill’s most lively decades before urban renewal, compounded by poverty and discrimination, put an end to an era that will live on in Pittsburgh lore.</p>
<p>It was on the Hill where Wilson developed his obvious affection for the Black working class.&nbsp;“He took the way ordinary Black people spoke, the kind of banter that he scribbled on napkins in the haunts on the Hill, and rendered it sublime,” wrote Mark Whitaker in his book “Smoketown.” Through his pen, Mr. Wilson’s Pittsburgh has been “etched in the national imagination as the definitive depiction of Black American life in the 20th century.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson did not start writing plays in earnest until age 34, the year after he left Pittsburgh —&nbsp;first for St. Paul, Minn., then Seattle —&nbsp;and he did not find success in theater until he was almost 40, when “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” opened on Broadway in 1984. Like James Joyce memorializing Dublin in print after he left the city, Mr. Wilson used the distance from Pittsburgh to produce his century cycle, which he called “the dramatic tracing of the Black American odyssey.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson wrote a play for each decade of the 20th century, nine of which are set in the Hill District. By the last decade of the 20th century he was the most produced playwright in the United States.</p>
<p>The oracular “Aunt Ester,” whom Wilson called the century cycle’s most important character, was a living metaphor for the Black experience. Named after the biblical Queen Esther, who risked her life to save her people, Wilson’s Ester was the original African American, and her age, which varied from play to play, was roughly equivalent to the number of years Black people had been in America. Her house at 1839 Wylie Ave. was numbered after the date of the Amistad slave ship revolt.</p>
<p>“In the back. Go up there and you’ll see a red door. Go up there and knock on that,” said the self-made philosopher, Holloway, in Wilson’s 1992 play “Two Trains Running.” Wilson’s red door was entrée into the spiritual world of Black Americans. The house was a sanctuary for veterans of the old Underground Railroad and for others seeking to have their souls washed. Aunt Ester (An-cestor), who is 322 years old in this play, represents centuries of cultural memory, and she is the one who “the characters turn to when they are most in need,” Wilson said, “in her we have a tradition to remember and fall back on.”</p>
<p><strong>A vital role</strong></p>
<p>From early childhood, books played a vital role in Mr. Wilson’s life. He said of his mother, Daisy, that “she recognized that she lived in a society in which information is equated with power,” and she transmitted this seriousness to her son.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson grew to revere Andrew Carnegie and said he owed the great Scot his education.</p>
<p>“Betraying all my mother’s hopes for me,” Mr. Wilson quit school at age 15 and ran out of places to go except one. He walked each day from Hazelwood to the main branch of the Carnegie Library in Oakland wandering the stacks until it was time to come home from school.</p>
<p>Later in life he remarked how Ralph Ellison’s “The Invisible Man” “opened a world that I entered and have never left. I have for years been promising myself a second reading … but I continually forestall it because I do not want to abandon the magical and mystifying memory of that first reading.”</p>
<p>Encountering the “30 or so odd books” in the Black writers section at the Carnegie Library, Mr. Wilson said, “was the proof that it was possible to be a writer.” In 1989, he received the only high school diploma ever issued by the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The foundation of Mr. Wilson’s writing was poetry, but the wellspring of his art was the blues.</p>
<p>“Anything you want to know about the Black experience is in the blues,” Mr. Wilson said. “The blues is the Book —&nbsp;it is our sacred book.”&nbsp;A chance encounter with a Bessie Smith record was “the last piece in the puzzle” of Mr. Wilson’s education. “It was not until I discovered the blues that I could look at myself as a black man and not find that wanting. I could look in the mirror and say that was sufficient.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson never formally studied theater. With no background or training in the tradition, it was the blues, and the poetry of Amiri Baraka, Dylan Thomas and John Berryman that were his key influences. When he transitioned from poet and short-story writer to playwright, he deliberately avoided reading the classics so that he could “do it my way.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson saw himself as a “conduit of antecedents,” and believed that Black Americans would become larger and stronger once they embraced their cultural heritage. Author Kim Pereira wrote of Mr. Wilson’s conviction that one can only move forward by first going back, and “that the solutions to the future lie in the past. Clues to the identity of Black Americans are strewn along a cultural trail that leads backward through slavery all the way to Africa.”</p>
<p>A return to history, a journey back, will provide empowering self-knowledge. Convinced that the collective memory of Black Americans is their greatest strength, Mr. Wilson urged his people to call on their ancestors.</p>
<p>“If we are not walking in our grandfathers’ shoes, then whose shoes are we walking in?” he asked. “Our grandfathers and mothers lived and fought and died to preserve a way of life that was important to them. They taught us everything we know to be true.” Grounded in Black history and in service of “blood’s memory” Mr. Wilson was “trying to write plays that contain the sum total of Black culture in America.”</p>
<p><strong>A case for Black theater</strong></p>
<p>In the many interviews he gave once he became famous, Mr. Wilson patiently and ceaselessly made the case for Black theaters, and for the preservation of Black culture.</p>
<p>“Black theater in America is alive, it is vibrant, it is vital —&nbsp;it just isn’t funded.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mainstream theaters practice colorblind casting, which Mr. Wilson argued was empowering Black talent at the expense of Black people and Black theater. Colorblind casting implies that race does not matter, that casting can be blind to color, that whites are in a position to write or direct about Blacks, and that Black actors can play white roles.</p>
<p>Mr. Wilson rejected every one of these premises. The dilution of “color,” he argued, results in the diminishing of the minority culture —&nbsp;the African in African American. The Black actor on stage does not have the tools or resources to represent himself so he is forced to represent the race of another instead. “We do not need colorblind casting,” Mr. Wilson argued. “We need theaters to develop our playwrights.”</p>
<p>Rather than Black assimilation into the broader culture, Mr. Wilson called for the establishment of theaters devoted to the production of Black plays. He believed that Black life should be presented on its own terms “in all its richness and fullness,” and that Black artists should be given the time and space to develop their craft.</p>
<p>Author Alain Locke encouraged Black artists to “interpret the soul of their people in a way to win the attention and admiration of the world.” Mr. Wilson did just this. He wrote plays, he said, to “feed the spirit and celebrate the life of Black Americans.” His death, wrote Peter Marks in the Washington Post, “did not simply leave a hole in the American theater, but a huge yawning wound, one that will have to wait to be stitched closed by some expansive, poetic dramatist yet to emerge.”</p>
<p>In a professional career that lasted little more than 20 years, Mr. Wilson emphatically proved that Black life is its own idiom; that a Black writer working in the mainstream can retain a strong cultural identity; and that the English language has made tremendous gains thanks to the ingenuity of Black Americans.</p>
