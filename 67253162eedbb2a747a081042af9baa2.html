<h1>Love hasn't given up for couple who shared their story</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>They’ve tapered back the speaking engagements, the blogging and the video interviews that in their time reached tens of thousands of people with a story of love and faith persisting against severe adversity.</p>
<p>Now Ian and Larissa Murphy are quietly living out new chapters of their story as they raise children with the support and encouragement of extended family and church members living nearby.</p>
<p>“We’ve become just&nbsp;focused on raising our kids, and trying to stay connected with the little community here that is our village for raising our kids,” Mrs. Murphy said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That could summarize the routines of many young families, but the Indiana, Pa. couple’s story is anything but routine</p>
<p>Their 10th anniversary arrives Aug. 28, they will have occasion yet again to reflect on the auspicious meaning that the date holds for them&nbsp;— 8/28.</p>
<p>For the couple, the number represents a well-known biblical passage, Romans 8:28: “For those who love God all things work together for good.”</p>
<p>It’s a promise they have held to even under severe tests,&nbsp;and which inspired the title they gave their 2014 book documenting their journey of commitment, grief and an unexpected new normal: “Eight Twenty Eight: When Love Didn’t Give Up.”</p>
<p>They met and began dating while students at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, and they began talking about marriage.</p>
<p>But in 2006, while driving to work on Route 422, Ian lost control of his station wagon and collided with an SUV, leaving him with a brain injury, a crushed knee and other traumas. Larissa joined the Murphys and other close friends keeping vigil while Ian was stabilized in an intensive-care unit in Pittsburgh, then underwent a long rehabilitation, which has enabled him to regain some of his ability to walk and speak.</p>
<p>During the years she helped with his rehabilitation it became clear that each had retained the love for the other, and they discerned they should go forward with marriage. They married on Aug. 28, 2010, in the mountains of her native Sullivan County.</p>
<p>Through their book, blog and YouTube videos, they began to reach a wide audience, particularly among fellow evangelical Christians, inspiring others including those who had been through chronic health problems and other faith-challenging crises. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2015/11/01/Ian-and-Larissa-Murphy-s-faith-journey-goes-national/stories/201511010106" target="_blank">Their story reached a wider audience with an appearance on the&nbsp;“Belief” series in 2015 on Oprah Winfrey’s OWN network.</a></p>
<p>The couple made clear the journey had its struggles. There are bad days, but they have maintained a commitment to hold to their faith, and to laugh together.</p>
<p>Since then, the couple has had two children&nbsp;— a son, now 3-and-a-half, and a daughter, 1-and-a-half. They asked that their children’s names not be published.</p>
<p>“Thinking about how God is working all things together for good, they were born exactly when they were intended to be born,” Mrs. Murphy said. “All of that is so incredible, to think all of that is part of the story of God working.”</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy said of being a father:&nbsp;“It’s the best.”</p>
<p>They’ve lived in the same accessible home for several years now. Mrs. Murphy continues to work in marketing at a local bank, Mr. Murphy’s mother helps watch the children during the day, and they also spend time regularly with cousins living nearby. Mr. Murphy receives daily help from a longtime caretaker.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family has spent a lot of time at nearby Yellow Creek State Park, particularly since the pandemic began. They sometimes go there to listen to livestreamed services from their Saving Grace Church in Indiana.</p>
<p>Their son is old enough now to help his father. “He just wants to help Ian,” Mrs. Murphy said. “He loves pushing Ian in his wheelchair.”</p>
<p>For a child who has only known living with a parent with a disability, “it's just part of our day that we're helping each other,” Mrs. Murphy said. “That, I hope, will just be second nature to our kids, of just always being helpers. And always looking out for people who need an extra hand.”</p>
<p>The son also is showing some of his father’s traits, including his humor. He reminds people of the&nbsp;“non-stop talking” that characterized Ian before the accident. Sometimes Mrs. Murphy texts her mother-in-law with the boy’s latest utterances and adds,&nbsp;“Who does this sound like?”</p>
<p>Said Mr. Murphy of his son:&nbsp;“My doppelganger.”</p>
<p>There have been setbacks.</p>
<p>Mr. Murphy suffered a severe seizure in April and was again taken for weeks of hospital care to Pittsburgh, a stark reminder of his long hospital stay after the accident. He had another seizure in June. Undergoing more rehabilitation, he has returned to his baseline of capabilities.</p>
<p>Whereas the days and years immediately after the accident prompted serious soul-searching, Mrs. Murphy said it has been different lately.</p>
<p>“I don't know if this is just what happens as you get older,” she said.&nbsp;“But with this most recent seizure,&nbsp;it was very scary, but it didn't feel&nbsp;like it raised big spiritual questions. It was more of just feeling very sad that Ian had to go through something again. We had a conversation in the ICU: ‘Ian, if you if you don't&nbsp;want to do this anymore, it's between you and the Lord.’ I just felt a lot of peace in that and it didn't really feel like a battle of faith.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Murphy said the answer she got back from Ian was: “I want to do this for my kids.” He wanted to recover, she said, and “also he wasn't afraid of dying because he knew where he was going to go.”</p>
<p>For the first several years of their relationship, she said, it felt like the couple was constantly striving toward goals such as rehabilitation. “Now there’s a certain level of, we've made it this far. Ian's future is in his kids, and we just need to enjoy this day we have with them. We don't know what his future health will be. But we have this moment now and we have these beautiful kids we get to enjoy.”</p>
