<h1>Social media reacts to the Pirates' new uniforms</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After teasing them Thursday evening, the Pirates officially unveiled new uniforms at PiratesFest on Friday.&nbsp;First baseman Josh Bell and pitcher Joe Musgrove served as models.</p>
<p>The team also introduced the new-old look by tweeting a video showing 1990s-era highlights to tie the new threads to the years when their distinctive script&nbsp;“Pittsburgh” was first used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The gray version of the uniforms, which will presumably be used on the road, looks a lot like the ’90s kit that it’s inspired by. The only major difference is the lack of black-and-gold trim for a cleaner, more modern look.</p>
<p>The black jersey, by contrast, very much follows the color-heavy trend that started in the NFL and has come to dominate sports uniform design in recent years. Look at it side by side with the Penguins’ Stadium Series look from last year and the Steelers’&nbsp;“Color Rush” presentation that’s a few years old now, and you’d swear they were created to look consistent with each other.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the accompanying hat? Its changes are modest with a gold outline tracing the traditional “P.”</p>
<p>So far, the uniforms have been greeted with mostly positive reviews on social media. Well, positive in the sense that fans seem to like them, though a lot of the compliments have been mixed with digs at the team’s 69-93 record in 2019.</p>
