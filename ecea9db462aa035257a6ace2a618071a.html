<h1>McKeesport council approves firefighter contract </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>McKeesport City Council this week approved a four-year contract with its Fire department.</p>
<p>The contract, which runs through 2023, includes salary raises each year starting with a 3% raise in 2020; 2% raises in both 2021 and 2022; and a 1% raise in 2023.</p>
<p>Firefighters now will also have to pay a deductible for their health insurance, which will be $1,500 per year for a single firefighter or $3,000 per year for a family policy. The city employs about 20 full-time and 12 part-time firefighters, as well as a city electrician and the fire chief. The new contract will also permit the fire chief to use part-time firefighters in a more flexible manner, thus cutting back on overtime for full-time employees.</p>
<p>“I believe this is a fair contract on both sides,” Mayor Michael Cherepko said at the Monday night meeting. “They realize we’re not a city that’s affluent. At the end of the day, they’re happy and we’re happy.”</p>
<p>Also at the meeting, Mr. Cherepko was sworn into office for a third term as mayor by Magisterial Judge Eugene Riazzi. Judge Riazzi also swore in re-elected council members Keith Soles, Timothy Brown, Richard Dellapenna and LuEthel Nesbit.</p>
<p>Mr. Dellapenna was elected council president and Jamie Brewster-Filotei vice president.</p>
