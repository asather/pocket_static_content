<h1>Gov. Wolf extends stay-at-home order; Pa. reports 92 more COVID-19 deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday said he was extending Pennsylvania’s stay-at-home order to May 8 as efforts continue to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The governor, though, said the state would soon allow some activities to continue, such as online car sales and notary services. Construction — as long as workers follow social distancing guidelines — could also resume across the state in the near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Today, I want to announce that we are taking small steps toward regaining a degree of normalcy in Pennsylvania,” he said during a news conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said the state will examine the safety of curb-side pickup at the 176 recently reopened wine and spirits stores to determine if the same option is feasible for other businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ll closely monitor this to see if this can be done safely,” Mr. Wolf said. “While limiting person-to-person contact, not just at the stores but throughout the supply chain. This is going to help us determine if curb-side pickup can be more broadly applied to a much more diverse retail landscape as well as to other industries.”</p>
<p>Senate Bill 841, which Mr. Wolf said he would sign later Monday, will allow for online auto sales as well as online notary services.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On May 8, the governor said said, the state will allow for limited construction statewide that follow “strict” social distancing guidelines.</p>
