<h1>Point Park U. students sue school for refunds over online instruction</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four Point Park University students have sued the school in federal court, saying they received an inferior online education in the spring because of COVID but still paid for a first-rate in-person experience.</p>
<p>The students are asking for a refund for the spring semester, when classes moved online.</p>
<p>Similar suits have been filed by students against other universities in the region and across the country since COVID forced schools to teach remotely.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs are Rafael Figueroa, Kahlil Cabble, Ty'Anthony Scott and Ryan Petty, all undergrads. All are suing for themselves and all others similarly situated for breach of contract and unjust enrichment by the university.</p>
<p>"Such persons paid all or part of the tuition, housing, and mandatory student fees for the semester for in-person live education, on campus housing, and on-campus experiences," the suit said. "The University has not refunded any amount of the tuition, housing (for those who moved out after March 27, 2020), or any of the mandatory fees, even though it cancelled in-person classes starting on March 13, 2020."</p>
<p>The plaintiffs paid for a "first-rate education and an on-campus, in-person education experience" but were provided a "materially deficient and insufficient alternative," the complaint said.</p>
<p>The suit is seeking a return of the prorated portion of the tuition and fees proportionate to the reduction in services when the school closed and switched to online teaching in March 2020. In the case of housing, the plaintiffs are seeking refunds for anyone who moved out after March 27, 2020, for the days left in the semester. Students who left before that date received a prorated refund but those who left after did not.</p>
<p>Lou Corsaro, school spokesman, said in a statement that Point Park does not comment on pending lawsuits.</p>
<p>"However, University faculty, staff and administration have worked tirelessly to ensure a quality education for all of its students," he said in a statement. "The global pandemic has presented many challenges. In early March, when Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses in the Commonwealth to close, Point Park transitioned all instruction from on campus to fully remote in a matter of days, while also completing the delivery of all credits for its students.‚Äù</p>
