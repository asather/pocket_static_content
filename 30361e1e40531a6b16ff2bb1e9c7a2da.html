<h1>After 2 positive COVID-19 tests, Serra Catholic H.S. moves to online learning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Serra Catholic High School is moving to online learning after two of its students tested positive for COVID-19, the Diocese of Pittsburgh announced Thursday.</p>
<p>The diocese said all sports programs affiliated with the McKeesport school will be suspended through the weekend "out of an abundance of caution." Additionally, the school building will be closed through Monday.</p>
<p>The affected students are in quarantine and are not experiencing symptoms, the diocese said.</p>
<p>Anyone in contact with the students will be notified individually and be required to quarantine.&nbsp;“All school families were notified of the need for a closure, and will receive updates through school communication channels,” the diocese said.</p>
<p>“As a school community, we have been exceeding the standard practices established by the various health organizations in order to keep all students safe. It remains our goal to have the school in full operation as soon as it is completely safe to do so,” said Tim Chirdon, Serra’s principal, in a release.</p>
<p>The diocese did not specify the grade levels of the affected students.</p>
<p>“This is a challenging time for all involved,” said Mr. Chirdon. “While Serra Catholic has made extraordinary efforts to fully screen each person entering the building, maintain social distancing standards, carefully monitor mask-wearing and conduct regular cleaning and disinfecting practices, this virus poses extreme difficulties. Fortunately, the school has in place a solid virtual learning environment where our curriculum can be fully implemented, even in times when we have to be closed to ensure the safety of everyone in our school.”</p>
