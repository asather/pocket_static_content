<h1>Allegheny Health Network Q1 loss near $100 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny Health Network on Friday joined an already-crowded field of Pennsylvania health systems reporting major first-quarter losses due in large part to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>The 12-hospital system had a $98.5 million net loss for the first three months of 2020, driven by decreased patient revenue and an investment portfolio hit hard by the nationwide shutdown meant to contain the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Of that amount, $59.5 million was an operating loss and $42.2 million came in its reserve investment portfolio, with the $3.2 million difference from the net loss total coming from non-operating gains.</p>
<p>AHN Chief Financial Officer James Rohrbaugh said Friday the network had finished 2019 “in its best position ever,” completing an 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating income.</p>
<p>That momentum carried into the new year, too — until mid-March when concern about the spreading virus closed nonessential businesses and the state ordered hospitals to halt elective procedures.</p>
<p>In those final two weeks of March and all of April, patient care services were cut by half, Mr. Rohrbaugh said, resulting in a more than $161 million reduction in net patient revenue with no reduction in its expenses.</p>
<p>Few hospitals statewide escaped the financial impact of COVID-19 the past few months, even in southwest Pennsylvania, where the pandemic did not overrun hospitals as once feared.</p>
<p>On Thursday, UPMC reported a $653 million net loss, and Excela Health in Westmoreland County recorded a net loss of $27.7 million, $12.5 million of that in operations and $15.2 million in its reserve investments.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 pandemic has touched every part of the state, from critical access hospitals to integrated delivery networks,” said Rachel Moore, spokeswoman for the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. She cited one report that estimates Pennsylvania hospitals lost $914 million in March alone and are projected to lose $4.6 billion between April and June.</p>
<p>“The financial impact has caused hospitals to make incredibly difficult decisions in order to ensure their long-term viability,” Ms. Moore said.&nbsp;“There have been thousands of people impacted by hospital furloughs and layoffs.”</p>
<p>While the AHN and UPMC investment losses can be eye-catching, those funds are not used for day-to-day operations and so are subject to market fluctuations — and most funds bounced back to some degree in April.</p>
<p>But with the ban on lucrative elective care procedures continuing through April, patient revenue numbers will undoubtedly be down again when second quarter financial results are released.</p>
<p>Year over year, AHN saw its total number of surgeries drop from 26,642 in 2019 to 25,324 this year although Mr. Rohrbaugh said patients are already starting to reschedule procedures put on hold by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Allegheny Health also has received $67.9 million in federal funds under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act as of May 22.</p>
<p>But one ongoing issue may be the spike in the number of unemployed people who have also lost their health insurance, pushing some into government programs such as medical assistance, which typically reimburse hospitals at a lower rate than employer-based commercial plans.</p>
<p>Like UPMC, Allegheny Health saw an explosion in telehealth consultations between clinicians and patients, from fewer than 50 each day before the outbreak to more than 4,000 as the pandemic unfolded.</p>
<p>The number now is leveled off at about 3,000 telehealth appointments daily, indicating a clear shift in how patients and doctors will interact in coming months and years.</p>
<p>Patients seem to like it, Mr. Rohrbaugh said, adding, “It certainly is a more efficient way to provide care.”</p>

<p><em>Correction, posted May 29, 2020: In an earlier version of this story, the weeks in which patient care services were cut by half were listed as the last two weeks in March. The correct period of days is the final two weeks of March and all of April.</em></p>
