<h1>The 'Burgh's best dishes and drinks right now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here, found and devoured by our intrepid staffers across the city and the region, are this week’s #BBDD — ’Burgh’s best dishes and drinks right now. It’s all about carbs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Bagels from Pigeon Bagels, Squirrel Hill</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>My family has long debated who makes the better bagel — Einstein’s or Bruegger’s. After (finally) making it to Pigeon Bagels, I have to say that was some wasted arguing.</p>
<p>I'm not Jewish, so the fact the bagels are made in a certified kosher bakery doesn't sway me in one direction or the other. What’s important is how amazing they taste — crusty on the outside with a dense, chewy interior, and enough toppings that you get sesame seeds, garlic sea salt or everything in every single bite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At $2 apiece or $21 a dozen, they’re not cheap. You can buy containers of the spreads ($7-$16) including plain and flavored cream cheese, hummus, tofu schmear and lox, or order the bagels as sandwiches. I had a veggie sandwich ($6) and the combination of sliced cucumber, greens, red onion and herb cream cheese on an everything bagel was a vegetarian’s delight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you go on weekend mornings, expect a line snaking out of the door. You won’t be outside for long, but you'll&nbsp; wish you’d brought a cup of coffee for the wait.</p>

<p><strong>Brick Oven Flat Bread Pizza at Caffe Notte, Emsworth&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Cafe Notte in Emsworth is known for its upscale Italian fare, but sometimes late on a Saturday night all you're hungry for is a really good bar snack. We found one in the cafe's brick oven-baked flatbreads. We were expecting a thin, cracker-like pizza with a super-crispy crust but instead got something more akin to a personal pan pizza. Not that we were disappointed. The round pie ($10.95) boasted a thick and chewy crust, and the quarter-sized slices of pepperoni added a spicy, smoky flavor. The bright red tomato sauce had zing, but not too much, and the cheese was melty enough that it dripped down my chin. Yum.</p>

<p><strong>Buffalo wings at the Obey House Tavern, Elliott</strong></p>
<p>As it was Super Bowl weekend, it seemed downright unAmerican not to have an order of hot wings. So when a few twists and a wrong turn through the city’s western neighborhoods brought me past the Obey House Tavern, I stopped. The place has for decades quietly made some of the city’s best wings.</p>
<p>This was the site of my very first wing night. In the summer of 1995, the guys on my tree service crew took me there before my freshman year of college. Hot wings for me, cold beer for them in this two-story bar with a second-floor porch at Obey and Steuben streets. Supposedly a stagecoach stop on the Steubenville Pike, it’s been there forever.</p>
<p>Those wings are still bangin’ — piping hot, crispy skins, juicy inside and a sauce that creeps on your tastes buds, building to hit that sweet spot between hot and really hot. It’s just enough to get a little brow-sweat going.</p>

<p><strong>Paczki at Party Cake Shop, Brookline, and other area bakeries</strong></p>
<p>You have less than a month to get your <em>paczki</em> on. Pronounced <em>POONCH-key,&nbsp;</em>these Polish-style doughnuts are available around Fat Tuesday, just before Lent begins.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At this Brookline landmark, you can order ahead to get the traditional prune flavor, or try to decide from among apricot, raspberry jelly, lemon, custard, buttercream, chocolate buttercream, strawberry buttercream, peanut butter buttercream, even plain. This bakery’s are the bomb: It sells&nbsp;35-40 dozen of them each weekday and about 55 dozen on weekends.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I picked up an assorted half dozen ($8.10) that came beautifully boxed and tied up with string. I opened them at work and they disappeared. This bakery will have its&nbsp;“PACZKI TODAY” sign up through Feb. 25, which some people call Paczki Day, and then — unless you go to one of the bakeries that extends the season to Easter —&nbsp;you’ll have to wait until mid-January 2021 to get them again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
