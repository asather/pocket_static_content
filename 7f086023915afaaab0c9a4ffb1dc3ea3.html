<h1>Pirates' poor season brings heavy TV viewership losses, according to Forbes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not even the pandemic could save the Pirates from steep viewership losses in 2020.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/maurybrown/2020/10/04/mlb-sees-local-tv-and-streaming-viewership-up-over-4-for-2020/#22ba0dd3dacd" target="_blank">Forbes</a> reported Monday that the club posted the third-largest decline in local television audience throughout baseball during the truncated 60-game campaign. Average viewership for broadcasts primarily shown on AT&amp;T SportsNet dropped from 70,122 in 2019 to 46,836 this year.</p>
<p>Only the Miami Marlins at 21,082 had worse average viewership, league-wide.</p>
<p>The data comes via Nielsen, which changed its tracking methods this year to better reflect viewership across all platforms, including digital.</p>
<p>Pure television ratings league-wide declined for this reason, as fewer TV households were measured. Total viewership, however, rose 4.2% as Americans generally gobbled up sports content amid advisories that staying home was the surest way to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Of 25 markets tracked by Nielsen, Forbes reported that 14 made viewership gains averaging 36%. Eleven markets bled viewers at a 22% clip. Only the Los Angeles Angels (34%), Seattle Mariners (36%) and Boston Red Sox (54%) bled viewers at an equal or greater rate than the Pirates.</p>
<p>Average viewership across the sport was 102,859 this year compared to 98,707 in 2019.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ losses come after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/10/15/pirates-tv-ratings-attendance-increase-2019/stories/201910010138" target="_blank">modest ratings gains</a> posted last year, which reversed a trend of decline since the club’s last playoff appearance in 2015. Not much of a surprise, considering they finished with baseball’s worst record at 19-41.</p>
