<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 04.30.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Ok technical issues solved let’s get started</p>
<p><strong>retguy18</strong>: The recent draft makes me remember Jon Baldwin, a #1 for the Chiefs. Any thoughts on why he never made it? Injuries, wrong team, just not an NFL WR? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: It isn’t easy to play in the NFL His career never really planned out and part of it may be he just wasn’t ever in the right system. He lasted a couple years but he wasn’t productive enough. He was a player who was taken on his athleticism and size and potential but he was a little raw and sometimes those guys don’t improve in the areas they need to</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: paul, i haven't been a fan of big ben since his off the field problems with 2 women, but do you agree or not that ben's career is vastly over rated, in the 2 super wins with him at qb he has only 1 touchdown pass !!! and in the other game he has the lowest qb rating of any winnings qb, in that game he threw for 84 yards !!!in the past 11 years only 3 playoff wins, i think he's in it for the money only !!! whats your opinion paul <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I don’t think he is overrated - he is rated about where he should be, which is to say he is considered a great quarterback but below the elite guys like Peyton Manning, Drew Brees, Tom Brady, Aaron Rodgers..... For the most part he has always probably been more of a top 8 quarterback than a top 5 quarterback in the league</p>
<p><strong>Thomas</strong>: Does the highly rated pitt bball recruit stay more than one year? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Yes. He isn’t a one-and-done type player. He is a very good player but he isn’t at that elite level where he will be ready to go after one year</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Enjoyed your interview with Chuck Copper last night about the book on his father. With the virus slowing everything down, will the Dukes have to be vagabonds again this season. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: What does vagabonds mean? Do you mean in recruiting? No. I don’t think so, Keith Dambrot has a really good recruiting class lined up. If you mean in terms of their home court, no I don’t think so. Construction I think is set to start up again and if that’s the case they should be done by the start of the season <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I thought exactly the same thing - why would we send people into New York and Philly. But I have to defer to the health experts - they wouldn’t OK something that isn’t safe. I am sure they will find some way to make it work or they will have to come up with a different plan</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Golf courses are open tomorrow. But I’m still chicken. You? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I have a tee time Saturday morning at Manor Valley. And the only reason I don’t have a tee time tomorrow is it is supposed to rain</p>
<p><strong>Andy D.</strong>: Hey Paul, now that I’ve been released, can you put in a good word for me with Mr. Colbert and Coach Tomlin? Thanks! <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Tell you what - go on Twitter and tweet Andrew Filliponi and ask him to start a campaign for you to come to the Steelers - it didn’t work with Jameis but it might work for you!!!</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Penn State seems like they having a great recruiting season for football. Sounds like they are all in on Coach Franklin but wasn’t he shaky not long ago? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: His first few years he couldn’t beat anyone good and the fan base was getting nervous. He has that thing rolling now and they are gonna be really good every year. He has done a fabulous job there</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: Pitt’s men’s basketball just got a top recruit, and has a nice overall recruiting class. What’s your thoughts for next season? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: It may be tough for them to get all the way to the NCAA Tournament but they absolutely should be in contention for it. And that means they should at least be an NIT team. Again they are getting really good players but it is hard to incorporate six new players into a team and have immediate success. They should be good but if you are a Pitt fan you should be really excited about the future of this program</p>
<p><strong>Lucky</strong>: Even if J.Winston would have been available on the cheap to the Steelers, I still think it probably best not to bring him in because of constant QB questions/distractions all season long. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I disagree. Ben Roethlisberger is the unquestioned starter so what would the questions be? And if they brought in Jameis he would be the backup. So there wouldn’t be much to guess or ask about</p>
<p><strong>Bizzee Bee</strong>: Paul - Would you be able to beat Craig Meyer in a game of HORSE? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Well my speciality is fouling and rebounding so maybe not. But one-on-one, I never lose but mostly because we always have to play by my rules......</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: I think the Steelers are fine with Mason Rudolph as a backup. The kid was throwing to unproven receivers in Washington and Johnson, along with practice squad guys like Cain and Griffey. The running game wasn’t very good. He sustained a pretty serious concussion and had terrible accusations against him. Yet the Steelers won 5 games he started I believe. People expected him to step in and be a star with no support. Am I nuts for thinking the kid deserves another chance? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He does deserve another chance and maybe he will ultimately be good enough. There is nothing wrong with trying to upgrade at that position though and Jameis Winston would have been an upgrade</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Who woulda thunk a couple years ago Paul that Pitt and Duquesne could realistically appear in top 25 this season? Really could be a lot of fun with two legit caliber college teams in the city, plus RM does great job in their bandwidth. Did you expect this from Dambrot and Capel? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Yes I thought it was absolutely a possibility because they are both really good coaches. I knew Capel would be able to recruit at a high level and Dambrot was a great coach at Akron and that’s not an easy place to win</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Hi Paul. Watched the original 1951 movie Angels in the Outfield the other day and it had some great shots of Forbes Field with the Cathedral of Learning seeming to be looming over the third base line. I went to a few games there as a youngster, but I was too young to know the actual location of the park. I've heard that home plate is actually in the lobby area of one of the Pitt dorms. Is that true? Also, tell Primanti's to save the "O". Great dogs and fries. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Part of the fence from Forbes Field is still up in Oakland. If you go down Forbes, make a right at the O and then make the first left like you are going to Schenley Park you can see it on your right. And yes someone needs to save the O</p>
<p><strong>PZ fan</strong>: Hi Paul. Most of us think that by drafting a speedy receiver in Round 2 that the run game will automatically improve, along with having our QB back. Left guard looks improved by new blood also. So why the fretting about not taking a star RB in Round 2? However I do wish Round 4 would have gone to ILB but I can't complain about our draft except for that. Agree? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I’m not fretting about anything. You’d hope they improved the running game by improving the line, by having a QB who can complete passes back and by having a healthy James Conner. I do agree with you that they need to address inside linebacker</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Paul, is the NHL season over? If so, where does that leave the Pens after those late-season trades? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I think there will be some form of playoff and the Penguins will be in them.</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: Hello, Paul. If the Steelers are sitting at, say, 4-3 after 7 games and Ben goes down, do you think that they would play out the season with Rudolph or attempt to sign some journeyman QB to finish the season and perhaps playoffs? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Mason Rudolph is the back up quarterback. There is no journeyman to go get that will be worth a damn at that point in the season. For better or worse it is Rudolph.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Have you seen the first four shows of the The Last Dance documentary on ESPN? If ESPN was to do a similar series on a Pittsburgh sports figure, who would it be? Mario, Roberto, Willie, Art or Bob (Nutting, and just kidding!)? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I think Mario and the whole process of him buying the team so he could basically get paid. That would be an interesting behind the scenes type story</p>
<p><strong>Mario and Pierre</strong>: We’re playing Oakmont...how about you and Pomp joining us? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I can’t afford Oakmont! I have to wait until the US Open media day!!!!</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: The Bengals are going to release Dalton as expected. Some Steelers fans will want to sign him but they don't have the cap space. Why would he sign here when he could sign in NE or Jacksonville and start? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: You mean like Jameis Winston signing with New Orleans instead of Jacksonville? There are a lot of reasons why guys do or don’t sign with teams and most of them have a lot more to do with money and contracts than anything else</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Do you really think it's fair to call 6th and 7th round picks busts? They're not expected to make the team. If they even become backups, they're exceeded expectations. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: If a guy gets drafted and doesn’t make the team, yes he is a bust</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Projections being what they are, could you see Highsmith having a similar path as Joey Porter? Smaller school, similar body types and skill sets from what I can tell. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He is going to be either a star or a player who always leaves us wanting more from him and wondering why he never turned into a star</p>
<p><strong>Eli</strong>: I was hoping Dane Jackson would have been drafted earlier than the 7th round, but Buffalo may have found a steal. Any thoughts as to a player who was drafted way too high and one who was undervalued? Thank you. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I thought Dane Jackson should have gone much earlier and I will say the same thing about the kid from New Castle - Geno Stone. The Ravens got a really good football player in the 7th round. As for overvalued - I think the two quarterbacks - Tua and Justin Herbert going 5th and 6th was insanity. I’ll be shocked if either is a star in the NFL</p>
<p><strong>Questfor7</strong>: Kind of sick hearing how everyone is unhappy with Anthony Macfarland Jr pick. People are comparing him to Archer and Rainey. Both of those guys were 5’8” 180lbs. This guy is closer to Kamara’s size (5’9” 210). We had no one who could take it to the house prior to this pick. I actually think he could develop in to a startling 3 down back. What are you thoughts on AM Jr? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: The issue most people have is they could have had Dobbins or Cam Akers if they wanted a running back. I have no issues with the pick except I don’t think he is a 3-down back and they could use a 3-down back</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: I know the Steelers say they aren't looking for an experienced backup, but would they consider signing someone cut by another team that would be an upgrade from Lynch and Hodges, not that it would be hard to do that. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Maybe but I think that they want to make it clear to everyone - including Mason Rudolph - that Mason Rudolph is their backup. And so they aren’t gonna sign anyone any time soon. Maybe at the end of training camp they cut Lynch and Hodges and grab someone who was cut elsewhere to be their third string guy but that’s about it</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: How has McCullers stayed so long? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He is the perfect reserve - he is a big body, can do his job adequately, keeps himself in shape, does what he is asked and doesn’t cost a lot of money. Those kinds of guys hang around forever</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Is Wisiewski the backup center? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: No, he is likely gonna be a starter at guard</p>
<p><strong>Zack</strong>: Paul, thanks for the chats. It seems that Pitt’s football and basketball recruiting programs are really starting to turn the corner competing with and getting quality players. I hope Pitt will be able to retain those responsible. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Well the good news is both Pat Narduzzi and Jeff Capel are signed for a long time. I don’t think either is going anywhere any time soon, either. This could be an era where Pitt finally figures it out and has some sustained success in two sports</p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: The Steelers like their RBs to be able to pass protect. Isn't that a glaring weakness with McFarland? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: And that is why he isn’t a 3-down back and why he is going to be more of a gimmick player - and I don’t mean that in a negative - where he is used in special formations and situations</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: A second question, Paul. 10 WRs were picked before Claypool. What do those teams know about Claypool that the Steelers don't? I think that his reported speed might not be accurate, and that at maybe 4.6 he is just an average WR. Also, with his weight he could begin to slow down sooner as he ages than other WRs who are at their peak when 28-29 years old. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: It may be that other teams liked other guys more. I don’t know what his speed is but when I watch film he seems to be blowing by everyone so I would hope it is accurate. I also think he will be more of a hybrid tight end player so a little weight isn’t bad</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: What are the best things that have come out of this virus? My son says his marriage is better than ever. I'm getting a lot of chores done around the house and my wife is happy not to hear: honey, it's Penguins playoff hockey, I have to watch the game.... <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I’m not a pie in the sky guy - domestic violence is up, suicides are up, the economy is blowing up, businesses are going under, people are dying, we are more divided as a country than ever, we have no sports, people are declaring bankruptcy. There ain’t anything good that has come out of this crap. Not a thing.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hi Mr. Z. Do you think Kevin Colbert will leave when Big Ben and Pouncey retire in a couple of years? If so, your guess as to who will take his place? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: It seems clear they are grooming Brandon Hunt to be the next GM although there are also two Rooney’s on staff that could be the guy as well. Colbert has a few more years but I think he would like to retire while he is still young enough to enjoy life after football a bit so I don’t anticipate him being the GM five years from now</p>
<p><strong>Tom in Dallas</strong>: How will this virus impact how you do your job once sports resume? Will you ease back to business as usual, or do you expect some permanent long term changes? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: The only change I could see is how much access and how interviews are conducted. Teams are always looking for ways to limit access and well, now they have a built in excuse. I hope that’s not the case but I fear it probably will be</p>
<p><strong>ZO</strong>: As shared by many, getting Dotson in the 4th round was a bit lucky. I guess the fact that the rest of the league determined that he wasn't worthy to be invited to the combine may turn out to be the best case scenario for both him and the Steelers. What do you think are the chances that he starts at Guard as a rookie? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I think it would be asking a lot for him to jump into the starting lineup his first year. He seems like he could be a guy who is in the starting lineup for 8-10 years. I love that pick he seems like he will be a really good player for a long time</p>
<p><strong>Happy Day</strong>: So Paul if MLB goes with a 100 game season, with the 10 team divisions with the Pirates in with the Yankees and Red Sox's and AL and NL East, think they win more then 15 games tops ? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I actually think the shorter season could benefit them. In smaller sample sizes teams with less talent could catch lightning in the bottle and get hot. I would say they would win about 40-42 games</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: Any takeaways from the virtual draft-positive or negative? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I actually liked it more - though I could have lived without all the pandering PSAs and musical stuff. But I liked the way it went off, liked the more personal touch of the coaches at their houses and loved not having fans cheering and booing every pick</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Big Ben scorched the Patriots for 3 points in the opener against the Patriots last year. Are fans wearing Steeler goggles about his future play? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Well he had an elbow injury at that point. If he is healthy he will be an upgrade over last year. I don’t know that he will be as good as he was five years ago but I do think he can play at a reasonably high level</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Paul your article about the Steelers overrated ability to draft receivers is ludicrous. You include 6th and 7th round picks. Some of those guys don’t even make it out of camp. The Steelers have done well drafting receivers early. You also left off the first 10 years of Colbert in the front office.... <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Oh my bad, I didn’t realize 6th and 7th rounders didn’t count. Of course, the entire reason people gave them their reputation was they got Antonio Brown in the 6th. Give me a break. I looked at 15 receivers they drafted. Was Limas Sweed a late pick? Was Sammie Coates a late pick? Was Marcus Wheaton a late pick? Get out of here with that. And Colberts first ten years weren’t part of the discussion since he wasn’t working with Tomlin and he is now.</p>
<p><strong>A guy named Ray</strong>: Do you think the Steelers have any interest in former Chiefs punter Colquitt? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I don’t know but if they don’t they should. They need a punter</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: If you were Aaron Rogers would you buy your one way ticket to Las Vegas or wait till 2022 <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I would wait until after this season and then force them to trade me. That will give Vegas one more year to build the offense a little more so it is ready to roll when he gets there</p>
<p><strong>Happy Day</strong>: The Steelers would be also rans or worse without Ben <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Sigh. The ten years before Roethlisherger arrived were better than the last ten years with Roethlisberger. That’s not to say he isn’t a great QB it is to say the franchise and organization are strong and as long as that is the case they will be fine</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Thanks for answering my question in your mailbox article. It feels like the decision to sign Ben to that big extension will hamstring this franchise for years. They are forced to build the office around his preferences, and don' <br> <strong>Jon</strong>: Big Ben has a HUGE cap hit next year (~$40M). That clearly means this is his last year, no? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Ben’s contract will only hamstring the Steelers this year and next. The big thing is they need to find out if Rudolph is his successor or not and if he isn’t, come up with a Plan B</p>
<p><strong>Blackhawk Bob</strong>: Do you think Ben Bell and Brown could be classified as the most talented and least successful trio of all time in the NFL ? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I would think they would be in the discussion. They won almost nothing with those three together but they did have some exciting moments</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I think Tampa jumped the gun signing Brady. It seems Rogers will be available looking at the draft by GB. What say you? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He won’t be available for at least two years - and by then Brady will be retired</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Do they really believe Mason Rudolph can carry this offense as presently constructed if Ben goes down? I know people are saying The helmet bashing and subsequent racial slur allegations really shook him up last year, but they seem to be forgetting what an ugly game he was having in Cleveland up until that point. Feels very short-sighted. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He has the tools, he just needs to put it all together. Last year was his first year as a starter so let’s give him some time before we decide he can’t play</p>
<p><strong>Jon</strong>: How will the Steelers handle Ben's $40,000,000 cap hit next year? Will he retire? Extend? Cut him? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: They are gonna hope that the salary cap goes up like $20 million as it is being predicted to</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: What up Paul...with the upswing of the local basketball programs, any chance the Steel Bowl will be resumed down the road? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Probably not - too many egos involved and there are way too many excuses for why those kinds of games can’t be played</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Hearing anything on what the NHL is planning? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Last plan I heard was one city per division would house all the teams in the division to finish the season and then playoffs at a centralized neutral site. But again these plans seem to change almost weekly with these leagues so who knows</p>
<p><strong>Bill</strong>: Some of the best QB's ever to play the game finish their careers with a different franchise because they thought they had a couple more productive years left while the team looked toward what was best for the future of the franchise. Montana, Manning, Farve all indeed had a couple more productive years, but the teams made the right decision, and time will tell as to whether the Patriots may direct decision moving on from Brady. But it feels like the Steelers made the wrong decision by giving Ben that huge extension. It's hard to believe that even if he stays healthy, this offense as presently constructed will be enough to get the Steelers past the top teams in the conference. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I agree and have said it several times - the Steelers would have been better off signing a guy like Teddy Bridgewater a year or two ago and letting him be the bridge quarterback to whoever is next. It would have saved them a lot of money they could have used to make the team better elsewhere</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: You’re assuming Winston would be an upgrade because of his starting experience. I understand that. But he is a turnover machine. The backups are supposed to manage the game by not throwing picks. Winston is a turnover machine. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: He was a turnover machine THIS year. And he got lasix surgery on his eyes. For his career he has like 122 TDs and like 80 Ints. He is absolutely better than Mason Rudolph right now</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Give me Andy Dalton over Winston any day of the week. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Give me Winston and you take Dalton and I’ll beat you just about every time</p>
<p><strong>Daniel</strong>: Do you see any legal problems between a player and owner if the player refuses to play and doesn’t feel safe because of the virus if and when sports are cleared to start up again? Would the players union get involved? Thanks . <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Nope. I think it a player doesn’t want to play because of the COVID-19, I’m sure the league and owners aren’t going to want a fight about that. I’m sure something would be worked out</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Have you seen the ESPN promo for Project 11 which chronicles Redskins QB Alex Smith attempt to recover from his catastrophic leg injury? I understand he’s had about 17 or 18 surgeries. Any interest in watching? Thanks Paul. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Sounds like a great story but I haven’t seen it. That was a gruesome injury</p>
<p><strong>Steve S</strong>: Paul, do you think the Steelers would have any interest in Dalton if he came in for a Winston-type minimum deal? Thanks! <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I can’t see it. They have been consistent in saying that Mason Rudolph is their backup quarterback</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: McFarland was a 5 star recruit even with broken leg in senior year of HS. Played 2019 with high ankle sprain and had ok year. His 2018 was lights out. I think he has the chance to be the steal of the draft. What say you? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Like I said - he has a chance to be a big-play player for them. He has that top end speed and can become a difference maker</p>
<p><strong>steelcity!</strong>: Paul . where do the steelers place in the North and in the pecking order of the AFC. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I think they finish third in the North but are a wild card team</p>
<p><strong>Sports Harder</strong>: Need a lunch suggestion Paul. Best fish sandwich in town ? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I’m allergic to fish!! But I’m sure Archie’s in the South Side has great fish sandwiches every Friday!!!</p>
<p><strong>gc</strong>: What proposed MLB plan to play this year is most appealing to you? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: The current one - three ten-team regional divisions and all the teams playing in their home stadiums with no fans. That seems like the most realistic</p>
<p><strong>Les</strong>: Hello, would yo rather have Big Ben for $30+ million a season or Andy Dalton for a few million? That's a lot of extra money that could go into other players. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: That’s a good question. If you could get Andy Dalton for like $3 or $4 million, I think I would rather do that. Think about how much better you could make the roster with an extra $32 million or so to spend</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: I’m only 31 so I don’t remember the NBA much in the 90s. Was Dennis Rodman really that dominating on defense? He only averaged 7 points a game but he is a hall of famer <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Rodman is the best defensive player I can remember. He is the best rebounder I can remember. Those Bulls teams were special for this reason: Rodman, Pippen and Jordan were the three best defensive players in the league and all three of them could defend multiple positions</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Was Big Ben listed on the injury list in his two starts last year? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I seem to remember them getting fined for him not being on it but don’t quote me on that. I don’t remember if he was or not</p>
<p><strong>gc</strong>: Thoughts on the Pats kicker controversey? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I have no idea. If he didn’t know there were some white nationalist implications with his tatoo, and at 18 he might not of, then there is nothing to see here. Who cares if he supports Trump and gun rights, it is a free country and that’s what he believes in. I get a kick out of this - 17 and 18 year olds do all kinds of dumb things and don’t realize the implications fully and then we want to kill them for it later in life when it comes out. I don’t know what is in the guys heart or not and if he says he isn’t a racist, I’ll take him at his word until he proves otherwise</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: I think what the steelers did with Minkah was genius &amp; should be the new trend: find a (disgruntled) pro-bowler still in his rookie contract and trade a 1st-rounder for him. Zero risk with your 1st round pick and the barely paying anything... would you agree? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Yeah if only it was that easy and guaranteed to work out that well every time. They did get a steal with that trade though if you ask me</p>
<p><strong>MD</strong>: Most of your colleagues won't touch this subject. I suppose they feel it is a sacrilege, but I think it is possible to have great admiration for what Ben has brought to the team over 15 seasons while still being able to point out that his 2 yr $68 million extension (with virtually all of it guaranteed) is looking like one of the worst deals in the history of the league. We could have just franchised him and spent only slightly more over two years, but had the flexibility to move on if he got hurt seriously (which he did). I'll be surprised if he ever plays again at a high level. Not only is it killing our cap, but we could have signed Winston, Newton, or Dalton on the cheap. If one of those guys goes onto have a stellar career, will Ben's deal look even worse? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Ben’s deal will be judged on what he does these next two years. If he plays well and the Steelers are successful nobody will talk about his contract.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Paul, I hate to say it but the lack of quality assistant coaches plus lessor talent is pointing to a repeat of the 80's when Chuck's teams were mediocre. Plus the division is getting much better. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I do agree that the AFC North is going to be much improved and getting better every year. The Browns and Ravens look like they will be very good for the next few years</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: I’m living on 2,500 a month and have a pocket full of $10.00 bill left , do you think Ben living on $3 mill a month would take a pay cut to get high end free agents, if he foresees SuperBowl. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I don’t. He could have taken a discount And told them to spend elsewhere when he signed his deal and didn’t. Why would he do it now?</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Oh my you have the browns finishing before the Steelers. Gimme a break. Haven’t we seen this story before? Get off the hype train. <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: I actually think the Browns will be better. Humility does a lot for a team and they were humbled last year. And I think they improved their offensive line and their coaching should be 100 times better than the clown show it was last year</p>
<p><strong>Rick in Delaware</strong>: Realistic to think Jake Guentzel could be a great bonus for Pens if/when season resumes? <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Absolutely. The longer this goes the better chance he has of being healthy and playing <br> <strong>Paul</strong>: Well thank you so much for all the questions, time flies when we are having fun and the hour blew right past us! Let’s do it again next Thursday!!!</p>
