<h1>City Theatre continues Momentum with a hand from City of Asylum</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City Theatre has entered into a collaboration with City of Asylum to present the South Side theater’s annual Momentum Festival of new plays at different stages in development.</p>
<p>Starting Wednesday and continuing into June, City will introduce three works through “The Show Must Go On(Line) Pittsburgh,” City of Asylum’s daily webcast that streams programs created by Pittsburgh’s arts organizations.</p>

<p>“The Show Must Go On(Line) Pittsburgh” is a shared programming channel, designed “to connect artists and audiences and continue to build community around the arts.” City of Asylum’s website notes that, while presentations are on hold at its North Side home, “this shared platform moves that home online.”</p>
<p>Digital Momentum will feature four in-development works for free, but registration is required at <a href="https://www.alphabetcity.org/show/" target="_blank">www.alphabetcity.org/show.</a> Last week, City artistic director Marc Masterson and festival artists gave a sneak peek into the festival, which will have readings at 7 p.m. on consecutive Wednesdays, starting this week.</p>
<p>Two of the four Momentum works have been announced, starting Wednesday with “Life-Changing Magic” by Olivia O’Connor, manager of new work development for Pittsburgh CLO, and directed by Monteze Freeland. O’Connor, a 2006 and ’07 winner of City’s Young Playwrights Festival, is this year’s featured alumni artist at Momentum.</p>
<p>Her play is described this way: “After receiving unsettling news, Vallerie turns to Marie Kondo’s wisdom to understand what sparks joy in her life,” launching a journey in which she leaves her family to explore “the things we truly need.”</p>
<p>On May 20, Momentum will feature “Bat Kitty,” a comedy about the dark side of Internet stardom&nbsp;by Amy Staats and directed by Marti Lyons (“Cambodian Rock Band” at City).</p>
