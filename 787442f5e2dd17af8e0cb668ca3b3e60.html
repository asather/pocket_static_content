<h1>WATCH: Casey to ask House Democrats about ‘public trust’; Toomey still considering his questions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Senators began a round of questioning on Wednesday in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, the first opportunity for senators to express their thoughts after sitting in silence for seven days. The round of questioning is expected to last eight hours and will be followed by another eight-hour session Thursday. The senators were asked to submit questions in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who will announce the questions to the House Democrats and White House counsel.</p>

<p><strong>1:02 p.m.: Pa. senators map out plans for question sessions</strong></p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., plans to ask the team of House Democrats that have led the prosecution in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial to talk about Mr. Trump’s abuse of power charge in relation to “public service and public trust,” an aide to Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey has written and submitted the question on an off-white card to Chief Justice John Roberts, and his office would not share the exact language before Mr. Roberts reads it aloud.</p>
<p>For Mr. Casey, the abuse of power charge is centered on the question of whether Mr. Trump betrayed the public trust, said the aide, who spoke on background to describe the senator's thinking. Mr. Casey thought about a quote inscribed on a government building in Harrisburg: “All public service is a trust, given in faith and accepted in honor.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey may also join on a question submitted by his colleagues pertaining to military aid. Mr. Trump is accused by House Democrats of withholding nearly $400 million in aid to Ukraine as a pressure tactic.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s other senator, Republican Sen. Pat Toomey, said he was still considering whether he would submit a question or co-sponsor other senators’ questions.</p>
<p>“We’ve got several we’ve been internally discussing,” Mr. Toomey told reporters on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The round of questioning is expected to last eight hours and will be followed by another eight-hour session Thursday. The questions will give insight into how senators have processed roughly 36 hours of arguments over six days.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told senators their questions should be “thoughtful and brief.” Mr. Roberts said he wants answers to be no more than five minutes — adhering to the standard set in former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999.</p>

<p><strong>Previewing Wednesday’s session</strong></p>
<p>WASHINGTON — Senators will begin a round of questioning on Wednesday in the impeachment trial of President Donald Trump, the first opportunity for senators to express their thoughts after sitting in silence for seven days.</p>
<p>The round of questioning is expected to last eight hours and will be followed by another eight-hour session Thursday. The senators were asked to submit questions in writing to Chief Justice John Roberts, who will announce the questions to the House Democrats and White House counsel.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told senators their questions should be “thoughtful and brief.”&nbsp;Mr. Roberts said he wants answers to be no more than five minutes — adhering to the standard set in former President Bill Clinton’s impeachment trial in 1999.</p>
<p>The framing of the senators’ questions could be more illuminating than the answers. The questions will show how key senators have processed about 36 hours of legal presentations and arguments — nearly 24 hours from the Democratic impeachment managers, about 12 from White House defense lawyers.</p>
<p>The days have stretched as long as nine hours, and many senators’ reactions have betrayed little insight into whether they have been swayed. They have been confined to their desks and instructed to be impartial.</p>
<p>The questioning will also be the first time Chief Justice Roberts, who has been virtually silent during the arguments, will step into the spotlight.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The White House defense team <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/28/trump-impeachment-trial-white-house-wraps-defense-support-grows-for-witnesses/stories/202001280147" target="_blank">wrapped up arguments on Tuesday</a> by framing the Senate impeachment trial as a dangerously partisan exercise by House Democrats that had failed to produce enough evidence to prove Mr. Trump should be removed from office.</p>
<p>The questioning sessions come ahead of a critical vote on witnesses and documents scheduled for Friday.</p>
<p>Support among Republicans for a deal to call a number of witnesses grew amid revelations this week that John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, detailed the president’s actions to pressure Ukraine in his upcoming memoir.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/16/donald-trump-impeachment-updates/stories/202001160145" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/01/21/trump-impeachment-landing-page-box-insert" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>Leaked details published by The New York Times revealed Mr. Bolton believed Mr. Trump froze nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine to pressure the American ally to investigate a political rival. The motivations behind the freeze on aid, which the White House team has disputed, was at the core of the House Democrats’ impeachment case.</p>
<p>Several moderate Republicans, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, said that Mr. Bolton’s manuscript makes a stronger case for witnesses.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has floated a “one-for-one” deal in which the two parties would each call an equal number of witnesses, according to multiple sources. His office declined to comment.</p>
<p>At least four Senate Republicans would have to join 45 Senate Democrats — and the two Independent senators who caucus with the Democrats — to approve a resolution to call witnesses. That decision is expected on Friday.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell acknowledged on Tuesday he does not yet have the votes to block witnesses.</p>
