<h1>Cam Heyward, Steelers want to back up their words with actions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cam Heyward said the Steelers do not want to merely make statements about racial injustice and social reform. He wants his teammates and other members of the organization to be actively involved in trying to make a change, make a difference in the community, even more so than if they already have.</p>
<p>To sit back and do nothing, Heyward said, is hypocritical.</p>
<p>“We’re not just going do this thing half,” said Heyward, the Steelers’ All-Pro defensive end and team captain. “We want to be full tilt, a part of the cause. If we just say things, we’re just doing half of our jobs.”</p>
<p>Heyward and inside linebacker Vince Williams teamed up on a Zoom call Saturday morning, one day after coach Mike Tomlin delivered a strong and passionate speech about social injustice and the need for reform at the start of practice Friday night. Tomlin spoke on a microphone at Heinz Field, flanked by team owner Art Rooney II and general manager Kevin Colbert with every Steelers player linked arm-in-arm behind them.</p>
<p>They said the Steelers are committed to not just delivering a message about reform but wanting to do something about it.</p>
<p>“We thought there’s nobody better than coach Mike Tomlin to deliver that because of who he is in the NFL and who he is as a person,” Williams said. “Make a stand to show compassion. Even though we’re professional athletes, we’re very sympathetic to things that are going on.”</p>
<p>Heyward and Williams each said they have had personal discussions with Tomlin about the matter and he was echoing what all the Steelers players wanted him to say. Like their coach, both players are Black and have young children, though Tomlin’s three children — two sons, ages 20 and 18; and a daughter, 14 — are older.</p>
<p>“What we’re looking at right now is not going to get it done for our children in the future,” Heyward said. “[That] they’re growing up in a world where they’re not accepted is unacceptable. They’re going to have to see this play out. In fact, it’s getting played out repetitively and it’s becoming a theme and it’s becoming something that is just so natural, and that is just unacceptable to me.”</p>
<p>Getting involved with the community, trying to enact change and make a difference, is nothing new for some of the Steelers players, including Heyward and Williams.</p>
<p>With the help of center Maurkice Pouncey, they started working closely with Pittsburgh police and other local departments since 2017 to help improve relationships with the Black community in an attempt to promote awareness and, hopefully, reduce violence.</p>
<p>“We understand we get to meet the good cops, but there are cops not being held accountable, simple as that,” Heyward said. “We had an opportunity to strengthen that and to strengthen that when we say, the good cops stay in place but the bad cops don’t get to keep policing us. Those are things we can do.”</p>
<p>Heyward said one of their goals is to help state legislators repeal Act 111, a half-century old legislation that allows police and fire unions to appeal disciplinary action or dismissals of one of their members. The system has sometimes reversed firings of police who were found guilty of misconduct by investigators.</p>
<p>He also said they will meet and lobby community leaders to ban chokeholds by police and demilitarize police.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to change our perception of police in the community because we understand the police relations with the community in Pittsburgh,” Williams said. “We’ve been getting it done, but we just have to be more diligent, apply more pressure. We have to be better about it. That’s what we’re going to focus on. That’s where you’re going to see our attention focused.”</p>
<p>Heyward said Steelers players got together in the offseason to form committees that will help enact change, such as voter registration, voter suppression, community and police forums, police culture and education investment in the community.</p>
<p>“We can’t be blind,” Heyward said. “We’ve seen too many injustices to be silent. Our communities hurt day in and day out. As we are held accountable on the field, we want to be accountable off the field, and we feel others should be as well.</p>
<p>“When we see these injustices happen day in and day out, we see ourselves, we see our children, we see our fathers, we see our friends being shot and killed. For us to stay idly by and not make a difference, that’s the responsibility we can’t give up.”</p>
<p>Williams said if his platform as a professional football player helps to deliver the message and get something done, all the better. He said he has always posted race-related messages on social media that get attention.</p>
<p>“A lot of times people say sports should stay out of politics and politics should stay out of sports, but if you look back at history, that’s never the case,” he said. “Me being able to talk to people about that is just going to help everybody. They’re going to listen to me because I’m a football player, then I’m encouraged about that.”</p>
