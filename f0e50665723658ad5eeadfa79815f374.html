<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 01.14.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, I'm back. And glad to be back. It was a byline-strike shortened season in football. But my holdout is over. We will be with you every Tuesday at 11 a.m. through basketball. Let's get started. Fire away.</p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Thoughts on section winners for 6A basketball, and how the seeding could shake out now that we're almost halfway through section play. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well Adam, there are only three sections. Section 1 Butler is first. Unbeaten in section. But Pine-Richland is right there with Butler. Lost in OT to Butler. USC and Mt. Lebanon clearly the two best teams in Section 2, play tonight for section lead. Fox Chapel clearly the best team in Section 3. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I think Pine-Richland and Butler are just about even. How will seedings go? Too hard to predict at midpoint. What if Fox Chapel goes undefeated? What if Fox Chapel loses a couple? Upper St. Clair has been rather impressive. Seen film on them. Only loss was to Pine-Richland. USC is very good. They might be playing better than anyone in 6A right now. Tonight's game with Lebo will be interesting. Should be packed and great atmosphere.</p>
<p><strong>Tom W</strong>: mike.....think of all the years of watching high school basketball.....the best Western PA. Boys team and girls team you have seen.....my boys would have been the South Hills Catholic team of 1965....Steve Litz, Hank South, Tom Donahoe, Steve Murphy, Val Madia, Dave Welty....girls 1978 Franklin Regional.....Miklasevich, Ellison, Basick......Loaded! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Geez, that's a pretty tough question. Believe it or not, I did not see the 1965 South Hills team. I was only 3 at the time. But I have heard they were very good. So were some of the other Catholic League teams. I started part time at P-G in 1979. Since then, I'd say Schenley 2007 team is the best. Blair, Kennedy, Kane, Blair brother and the one and only Onion. Blair played in the NBA. Kennedy had a few games in NBA. How many teams from WPIAL and City have two NBA players? And Kane was a standout in Big 12 at Iowa State. As for girls, I know 1979 Franklin Regional team was good. Saw them beat North Hills in WPIAL title game at Civic Arena. But wouldn't put them No. 1. Few of those Oakland Catholic teams and Mt. Lebanon teams were really good.</p>
<p><strong>EM the GOAT</strong>: What percentage chance do you give Big Ethan Morton to channel his inner Westbrook average a triple double this season? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Morton is tremendous and I say he gets close to a triple double average, but falls just short.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, sorry this is more <br> but still shaking my head at Butler football dropping out of WPIAL. I grew up in Aliquippa and the 60s-80s Art Bernardi and Lindy Lauro teams were like the gold standard in the Beaver-Lawrence-Mercer Counties. Heck, in the WPIAL. Hard to believe a program as rich in tradition as Butler is at this point. With still such a large enrollment. And reading your stories on it, it seems nobody really has a concrete reason(s) for why it’s happened or how to fix it? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yep, it is sad. And mystifying. How'd they get so bad for so long? What would Hanratty and the Saul brothers think? I don't know the reason. I do know when a program goes bad and it snowballs, it's tough to stop it. Main problem now is kids aren't playing. They started the season with 40. Forty??? You kiddin' me??? At one of the largest schools in WPIAL. By end of year, because of injuries and other reasons, were down to 24. I don't have the answer. But I will say I don't blame them for leaving the WPIAL. They're trying to save program. They would continue to get hammered if they stayed in WPIAL. High school football isn't like it was even 20-25 years ago. The sport has changed. This might be the best move for them. Maybe come back in a few years. What's mystifying is Butler so competitive in a lot of other sports.</p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>: Is Fox Chapel as good as their PIAA and WPIAL top rankings? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They have to be No. 1 in WPIAL. Only undefeated team. Are Foxes No. 5 6A team in the state? No way. No knock against them. Zach Skrinjar has gone a great job there, but too many teams in east that would be better than them. That said, what if they make PIAA playoffs and win two games? That puts them in quarterfinals. Then that would put them in top 8. That's possible.</p>
<p><strong>BJ</strong>: Do you think that any of the city league players will be receiving basketball scholarships this year? If so, then who? Thx. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No Division I guys. Best would be Division II.</p>
<p><strong>Whike Mite</strong>: What if any is the WPIAL doing to address the shortage of officials? The quality Of officiating has really suffered this year. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I wrote a big story on this in the fall. PIAA and WPIAL is trying to attract more officials, but people just don't want to do it, especially young people. They're trying to attract young people. It's a nationwide problem. As far as complaining about officials, get in line. But when you don't have a big pool of officials, you can't be choosy on who gets games. You take what you can get.</p>
<p><strong>Ace O’Malley-Heberling</strong>: Rich Moran, who passed away this past week, coached Duquesne High School for 16 years, compiling an impressive 273-156 record. He won 6 WPIAL Championships, 2 PIAA State Championships and 8 section championships. In you opinion, where does he stand among his peers. Thank you. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Had a great career. Not much more to say. Would I put him among top 2 or 3 all time in WPIAL? No. But he had tremendous career.</p>
<p><strong>Big guy</strong>: Does anyone in AA have a chance of beating OLSH? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No. No one has a chance. WPIAL should cancel the Class 2A playoffs right now. And just send the trophy to OLSH. C'mon, man. True, it would be a huge upset if OLSH didn't win the WPIAL, but to say no one has a chance????</p>
<p><strong>Denny</strong>: When is the WPIAL voting on the new football allignments ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Will be voted on and released Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Mon Valley Fan</strong>: for next year's Football Conference realignment, which proposal do you think will be chosen? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Almost assuredly will be the one that is mostly "status quo." Changes are non conference games will be in beginning of schedule and not spread throughout. Non conference games will also be selected. But there will still be huge disparity in some "haves" and "have nots." Just the way football is nowadays. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: One thing that needs to be pointed out about football. Many people comment to me and say on Twitter that WPIAL needs to go back to four classes. Well, guess what? The schools don't want that. They want to stick with six. They told the WPIAL that in a survey. Well, at least the majority of schools want to stay with six. So please stop the talk about going back to four classes. It ain't happenin'.</p>
<p><strong>Quaker joe</strong>: Mike, was glad to see you at the Quaker Valley/New Castle game a couple weeks ago. Looks like there are 5 contenders in that Class 4A-Section 2! What team (Blackhawk, QV, Ambridge, NC, CV) do you think will be on the outside looking in come February? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: That's a terrific section. Top to bottom might be best in WPIAL? How about Blackhawk? 0-6 outside of section play. 4-1 in section play, with wins against New Castle and Quaker Valley. Depending on what happens, maybe there will be a tie and all five teams will make playoffs. If you made me pick one that will be out, that's a tough one. I'll say Ambridge.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: who will be the final four in wpial 3A and then your final 2/champ <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Everyone wants predictions - and in the middle of the season!!!!! So teams can get mad and say, "We don't get any respect." But I'll go Lincoln Park, North Catholic, Seton LaSalle and someone else from Lincoln Park section.</p>
<p><strong>SteelersFan202</strong>: What sre your thoughts on the Ideas of the Bew football Alignments? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: My thoughts are: What in the heck is the "Bew football alignment?"</p>
<p><strong>Imperial</strong>: Mike- Have you had the chance to see this WEST A baseball player in person? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You're talking about Austin Hendrick. Not last season. But other seasons. Obviously, very good. But one of the most unusual stories ever in baseball around here. Coaches didn't even pick him all-section last season. That's the coaches. Not the media. Yet he is a projected first-round pick in MLB draft. Go figure. He obviously gets pitched to way differently than he does in travel ball and these showcases.</p>
<p><strong>6A Guy</strong>: I'm not sure i have seen a high school player with as smooth as a shot as Devin Carney has in the past 5-6 years? Thoughts? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It is nice. Legitimate jump shot, even from 3-point territory. And he's not exactly shy about shooting, either.</p>
<p><strong>Mon Valley Fan</strong>: in regards to the non-conference games, hopefully a better matchup is scheduled and not 1st place vs last place <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, WPIAL claimed in past non-conference matchups were made at random, which never made sense to me. Now, they will be hand selected and based more on competitiveness.</p>
<p><strong>Adam</strong>: What do you make of Jurkovec's transfer to BC? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Wrong place, wrong time at Notre Dame. Don't blame him for leaving. Ian Book is coming back. Phil would be No. 2 again. Plus, I don't think he was exactly overjoyed with how he was handled. Maybe more to the story than will ever be revealed. That's why he will try for NCAA waiver. People say Why BC? Well, he was looking for a good quarterback situation. BC has that. He was looking for someone that might improve him and maybe get him ready for a shot at next level. The new OC at BC has NFL experience. Frank Cignetti Jr. And so does new head coach Jeff Hafley. Both of those coaches have ties to Pittsburgh, one being assistants at Dave Wannstedt at Pitt. As for Pitt, I don't know if they tried to get Jurkovec - or wanted to try him. Doesn't matter. He wasn't going there and didn't have interest in going there. No way you can tell me that this kid still doesn't have a shot at being really good. No way everyone was wrong about him in high school, from coaches to college coaches. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: There is too much talent in Phil Jurkovec to be sitting for three seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Big guy</strong>: Sorry let me rephrase that ,who do you like in AA? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: That's easy. OLSH. Hands down.</p>
<p><strong>JP</strong>: I am excited the MLK Showcase is being held at Woodland Hills again this year. Tons of talent. Looking forward to seeing Butler vs Penn Hills and Allderdice vs Pine Richland. Do you plan on attending? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, I will be there Saturday for some of the games. Lebo vs. Math Civics &amp; Sciences is another good one. MCS is No. 1 in the state in 2A and is three-time state champ. Always a Philly power. That game is at 1:30. The Butler-Penn Hills game is scheduled for 7:30. It is like the seventh game of the day and there is only one and half hours between each game. No way that game starts at 7:30. More like 8:30. But should be a good one.</p>
<p><strong>Quad North</strong>: How will Butler look next year without Ethan Morton? Still a young team i do believe.. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Carney will be back. Mattix Clement back. Few others. They will be good again. But will be a much different team. They won't get everything set up for them by Morton like they do now. Morton is one of the best passing point guards I've seen in Western Pa. in 25 years. Tremendous passer.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, maybe you can do a public service announcement for me: for years I hear some parents remark something to the effect” oh really, so and so only has offers from IUP and Slippery Rock for basketball”, or even worse if it’s D-3 school. You Watch a lot of basketball, these people have no clue how good the kids are at that level, yes? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No doubt, Zman. Many basketball parents are clueless when it come to recruiting. First off, they don't realize how good (and usually big) you have to be to make it at Division I. And don't realize the talent at D-II. One of the things at D-II. The talent is a little similar to lower D-1. Difference is players aren't as big. And yes, you have to have some game to make at D-III also.</p>
<p><strong>Quad North</strong>: Who would you put on your Mt. Rushmore of 6a coaches? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'd start with Danny Holzer of Upper St. Clair and Joe David of Upper St. Clair. Hmmmmm. Hard to say from there. I'd really have to think about it.</p>
<p><strong>Football</strong>: Do you think there is any merit to having 5A &amp; 6A combine in football for regular season schedules, similar to option 2 of the WPIAL. To limit travel and keep some rivalries? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes there is merit to it. I'd like to see it. I think it makes sense. Here's the thing, though. Lot of those 5A schools don't want anything to do with 6A schools. And just about no one wants to play Central.</p>
<p><strong>Q Boy</strong>: is there a link to the schedule for the MLK showcase you can send out? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It's on our high school page on our web site. <a href="http://old.post-gazette.com/highschoolsports/stats/daybyday.asp?teamtypeid=3&amp;month=1&amp;day=18&amp;year=2020" target="_blank">http://old.post-gazette.com/highschoolsports/stats/daybyday.asp?teamty...</a> <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey that's it for now. Good first day back. See ya next Tuesday at 11 a.m. Be good.</p>
