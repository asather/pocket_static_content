<p>WASHINGTON — White House lawyers are set to close out their defense of President Donald Trump in his impeachment trial on Tuesday. It will be the last chance for Mr. Trump’s counsel to convince senators they should vote to acquit the president.</p>
<p>During an <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/27/Trump-impeachment-trial-defense-team-Hunter-Biden-Ukraine-witnesses/stories/202001270129" target="_blank">eight-hour session on Monday</a>, the defense team cast the House Democrats’ impeachment effort as a partisan exercise that lowers the bar for future impeachments.</p>
<p>The lawyers also spent hours discussing Hunter Biden’s involvement in Ukraine. They argued Mr. Biden defied long-standing conflict of interest and corruption concerns while sitting on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian energy firm, while his father, Vice President Joe Biden, pushed for the removal of a Ukrainian prosecutor investigating that company.</p>
<p>Yet the lawyers virtually ignored what could be the most significant development in the trial. On Sunday, The New York Times reported John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser,&nbsp;knew the president froze nearly $400 million in military aid specifically to pressure Ukraine to dig up dirt on the Bidens.</p>
<p>Some Republican senators, including Pennsylvania Sen. Pat Toomey, a Republican, are considering a deal to call witnesses.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen if Mr. Trump’s defense team will mention Mr. Bolton before wrapping up their arguments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, the lawyers sought to show senators that Mr. Trump’s pressure on Ukraine to announce an investigation into Burisma for corruption was — rather than targeting the son of a political opponent — rooted in legitimate concerns.</p>
<p>“What was Hunter Biden doing at Burisma in exchange for millions of dollars?” asked Eric Herschmann, an attorney for Mr. Trump. “Nobody has ever investigated why.”</p>
<p>Hunter Biden had few, if any, qualifications to oversee operations at an oil and gas firm, Mr. Herschmann added. “He did have one qualification: He was the son of the vice president of the United States,” he said.</p>
<p>The Senate convenes at 1 p.m.</p>
