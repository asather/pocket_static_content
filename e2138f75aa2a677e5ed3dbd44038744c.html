<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: What do you have against 'Field of Dreams'?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Roland:</strong> What do you have against “Field of Dreams”? It is a movie someone like you who has sons should enjoy, I would think.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> It’s a terrible movie. It’s too long, slow and boring. And both of my sons who love sports would agree and would kick me out of the house if I tried to make them watch it.</p>
<p><strong>Joey:</strong> I’ve noticed some mock drafts have the Steelers selecting a QB sometime in the draft. Do you think that will happen?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I have seen Jalen Hurts’ name a lot and can’t figure it out. The Steelers are not going to use their first pick (No. 49) on a quarterback. They need an impact player. They need someone who can help them this year. And if they believe in Mason Rudolph like they say they do, why would they take another player to be their quarterback of the future? It just doesn’t make sense. I could see them taking one later in the draft or signing an undrafted free agent to have another arm in camp, but I can’t imagine they will take a quarterback with one of their first few picks.</p>
<p><strong>Zach:</strong>&nbsp;Myles Garrett has seemingly backed off the statements he made about Mason Rudolph. Do you think Rudolph’s legal threats had anything to do with it?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> No. I think finally someone got to him and told him what a bad look this is for him, and he listened. It’s one of those things that he hopes sort of goes away and we forget about it. That’s probably why it’s been so quiet and why he hasn’t continued down that road.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Greg D:</strong> What do you think Matt Canada’s role ultimately will be with the Steelers offense? Do you think he will be calling plays or just game plans? I hope he has a big say because it will improve the offense.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> He will definitely have influence, and I think mostly on the running game. He has some really good run-blocking schemes and Lord knows the Steelers could use help in that area. I still think Randy Fichtner will call plays and the offense won’t change radically, but it will have some of Canada’s tweaks in areas that the offense needs to be tweaked.</p>

<p><strong>Prado:</strong> Do you think MLB’s latest plan to restart is even feasible? It sounds like a long shot at best.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I think so. The key will be testing. If they are set up for instant COVID-19 testing, then they can work out any of the details. There are plenty of hotels and places they could take over to keep their players away from most of the general public. There are 10 minor league stadiums and an MLB stadium available. The weather is obviously conducive to baseball. I don’t think the plan is a pipe dream. I think it could happen.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Is it possible that college football could start in January? Do you think if college presidents are faced with two choices — start in September without fans or start in January with fans — they will choose the latter?</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> It’s clear that is what they would choose. They want no part of football without fans because that is millions and millions in losses. They aren’t going to be able to function without the money they get from football. That’s why they will do whatever it takes — including starting in January — to make sure they can do it with fans.</p>
<p><strong>Karl:</strong> Do you think the pandemic will force universities to finally ask a basic question: What’s more important, education or football? We’re the only country in the world where a university gives a full scholarship to a student who can’t even read a college textbook.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I didn’t know it was an either/or proposition. Athletes graduate at a higher rate than the general student body. That’s not an opinion, that’s a fact. Unfortunately, the tiny majority of athletes who aren’t good students and probably shouldn’t be in school are who people focus on as opposed to the majority. A better question would be: Do you think all of this will cause universities to rethink the cost of athletics and especially salaries and buyouts of coaches? I think it will have some effect at least for a year or two but eventually will go back to the way it was.</p>
<p><strong>Mark:</strong> Did you see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rOO3Nm_n2Cg" target="_blank">rant by Mike Gundy</a>? Do you think he should he still have a job? I don’t think a man so irresponsible should be the mentor and father figure to young people.</p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong> I’m not smart enough to answer who should and should not be fired, but why do we care so much what these football coaches say? He said something that was completely self-serving because football coaches want to coach. I don’t know why we get so stuck on things like this. He isn’t a medical expert or politician. He isn’t even a college president or an athletic director. He is football coach and football coaches tend to say silly things.</p>
