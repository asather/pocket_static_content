<h1>Police describe short life of abuse, horror for Oakmont girl, 3, at hands of her family </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The little girl was beaten with a wooden spoon that had a gingerbread man design and an off-white leather belt with a gold buckle, police said.</p>
<p>Punched in the head so hard she was knocked out, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Thrown in a freezing cold shower. Sexually abused. Screamed and cursed at. Kicked down the stairs. Tied to a banister with blue-and-white shoelaces. Lashed to a crib while blindfolded and gagged.</p>
<p>She was so malnourished that her “skeletal structure was visible,” according to police.</p>
<p>When she died earlier this month at age 3, Bella Seachrist had lived a short life of torture, cruelty and horror.</p>
<p>Police have charged her father, Jose Eduardo Salazar-Ortiz Sr., 29, his common-law wife, Laura Ramriez, 27, and Ms. Ramriez’s sister, Alexis Herrera, 20, with homicide and other offenses after being called June 9 to the middle-class home in the 500 block of 10th Street, where an officer found Bella unresponsive.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/24/Oakmont-child-death-charges-homicide-abuse/stories/202006240143" target="_blank">All three defendants are in custody</a>, with Ms. Herrera turning herself in Thursday morning.</p>
<p>To some of their neighbors, the family seemed a bit withdrawn, but kind and polite. Lou Pappa, an area resident since 1983 who said he knows Mr. Salazar-Ortiz well, never detected any signs of abuse.</p>
<p>“They could have lived in that house for another five years and I still would have never expected anything like this.” Mr. Pappa said Thursday.&nbsp;“When he was home, Jose was always outside playing with his boys in the backyard, and I never saw him even yell at them.”</p>
<p>While the three adults are all charged in Bella’s death, according to a&nbsp;four-page Allegheny County police narrative that describes in chilling detail the terrors visited upon the girl, the father blamed most of the abuse on the women.</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz described Ms. Ramriez to police as someone with “a lot of temper” who took it out on Bella. And he explained that while he and Ms. Ramriez have three sons together, Bella was born from an affair he had. He said he went to court to gain custody of her because of concerns over substance abuse by the biological mother, the complaint said, and court records show that he won sole custody in August 2017.</p>
<p>Asked whether police believe Mr. Salazar-Ortiz's account casting blame on the women, homicide Lt. Venerando Costa said, "We’re going to stay impartial and not weigh in on that. We do believe that the child was neglected and abused by the very adults who were responsible for her care and safety."</p>
<p>The criminal complaint describes Bella being ostracized in her own home. Police said that she was even victimized by a younger sibling, a boy who was seen in a video on Ms. Herrera’s phone kicking and hitting her as she lies on the floor screaming and crying.</p>
<p>“This assault continues and Bella is ultimately required to stand in a blue plastic bucket, which is eventually picked up and placed on a small cabinet,” according to the complaint. “While Bella is being forced to stand inside the bucket, she is made to place her hands behind her back.”</p>
<p>There were other punishments, police said.&nbsp;Going to the bathroom was a terrifying experience, as depicted in one video reviewed by investigators.</p>
<p>“There is an adult female that can be heard, ordering Bella to&nbsp;remove her pants and sit on the toilet. Bella is crying and is visibly upset. She is made to climb onto the toilet, using a small&nbsp;step stool at the base of the toilet. The toilet seat is in the up position, and Bella is required to hold herself up to keep from falling&nbsp;into the toilet. As she sits on the toilet, this unknown female, kicks the step stool away, forcing Bella to dangle and hold herself&nbsp;up as she tries to use the toilet.”</p>
<p>Investigators said Bella didn’t have a room and slept on a cot in a hallway or inside the master bedroom closet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“As a punishment,” police wrote,&nbsp;“Ramriez would lock Bella in the closet&nbsp;for hours at a time.”</p>
<p>Bella wasn’t allowed outside, according to Ms. Herrera, the complaint said.</p>
<p>Neighbors said that they never saw the girl outside. Mr. Pappa said he never saw the girl at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Herrera stated that Ramriez would also yell at Bella, calling her&nbsp;‘stupid’ and tell Bella that she hated her. According to Herrera, Bella basically lived in the second-floor hallway and the closet,&nbsp;only being allowed in the living room if she was ‘good,’&nbsp;“ according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Cell phones reviewed by police yielded other evidence, investigators said.</p>
<p>In one thread of 73 instant messages between Ms. Ramriez and Ms. Herrera, for instance,&nbsp;“both Ramriez and Herrera commentate, compliment, and narrate an incident in which Bella is&nbsp;forcibly restrained, tethered, contorted, and placed in a closet for an extended period of time. The message conversation includes a digital image depicting Bella bound and positioned in the closet,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>“It is clear from the context of these messages that Ramriez is&nbsp;not in the home during the message exchange, but Herrera is present and the adult responsible for Bella in the absence of her parents.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were also 28 images&nbsp;“which clearly show Bella to be in&nbsp;extremely poor health, and/or depict her in some form of physical punishment. She is seen being forced to stand in the corner,&nbsp;with her hands above her head and one leg raised. She is seen in multiple photographs tied up and bound with her hands behind&nbsp;her back. One of the images depicts Bella tied to a crib, while being forced to stand between the openings in the mattress&nbsp;springs. She has a white cloth stuffed in her mouth and has a blindfold around her eyes.”</p>
<p>Police said the abuse was carried out behind closed doors in a middle-class neighborhood where Mr. Salazar-Ortiz Jr. operated L&amp;J Drywall. He told police he spent 12 or more hours a day, six days a week working outside the house.</p>
<p>Lt. Costa said local police received no calls about any child abuse at the house. He said the county's Children, Youth and Families Office had prior involvement with the family, but he deferred to the office for specifics. The county said by law it cannot confirm or deny involvement.</p>
<p>The case came to light June 9 when Oakmont police responded to a call for an unresponsive child.</p>
<p>When officers arrived around 1:45 p.m., they found Bella in the bathtub wearing a diaper. She was “extremely cold” and had bruises on her arms and legs.</p>
<p>Bella was taken to UPMC St. Margaret near Aspinwall, where she was pronounced dead an hour later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Doctors found signs of physical abuse,&nbsp;“extreme” sexual abuse and&nbsp;“extreme” malnutrition, police said.</p>
<p>Ms. Ramriez told police that in 2018, Mr. Salazar-Ortiz sent Bella to live with his family in North Carolina. She returned to Oakmont around August 2019, and police said pictures from that time show a&nbsp;“well-nourished child without any apparent injuries.”</p>
<p>Police were called to the house on a Tuesday, and Ms. Ramriez told detectives that the weekend before, she and Mr. Salazar-Ortiz were in Columbus, Ohio, where they were celebrating their 15th anniversary. She said they left Bella in Ms. Herrera’s care. When they got back on Monday night, Bella was sleepy and had no appetite, Ms. Ramriez told police.</p>
<p>On Tuesday morning, June 9, Bella seemed fine, Ms. Ramriez claimed, according to the complaint. She said she gave Bella Pedialyte and orange juice, covered her with blankets and put on a space heater. The family got Chinese food take-out, and when Ms. Ramriez checked on Bella, she told police that it appeared she had thrown up and that the girl wasn’t breathing.</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz told her to call an ambulance, the complaint said.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Herrera’s account to investigators, when Bella became unresponsive, she ran her under cold water in the shower to try to wake her up.</p>
<p>In an interview with police, Mr. Salazar-Ortiz said Bella was cold the day before she died so Mr. Salazar-Ortiz wrapped her in blankets and put her on a cot with a heater. The next morning, when he left, he said,&nbsp;“he gave&nbsp;Bella ‘a pound’ with his fist and she smiled at him.”</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Ms. Ramriez called with the update on Bella.</p>
<p>“Ortiz Sr. said that he told Ramriez to take Bella to the doctor, but Ramriez said that she&nbsp;responded, ‘I can't do that’ and ‘I'm scared.’ Ortiz Sr. stated that Ramriez called him back a few minutes later and told him that&nbsp;Bella wasn't breathing.</p>
<p>“During this interview, Ortiz Sr. admitted that he knows that Ramriez has been physically abusive with Bella. Ortiz Sr. stated&nbsp;that he has watched Ramriez beat Bella on the legs and thighs with a wooden kitchen spoon on several instances.”</p>
<p>Mr. Salazar-Ortiz detailed other instances of abuse by Ms. Ramriez, the complaint said, and then Ms. Herrera did the same. Ms. Herrera told police that Ms. Ramriez beat Bella almost daily, often because she urinated through her pull-up diapers.</p>
<p>Ms. Herrera also admitted her own role in hurting Bella, police said.</p>
<p>“Herrera also said she (Herrera) punched Seachrist in the face over the weekend directly preceding Bella's&nbsp;death, when Herrera was Bella's sole caretaker. Herrera stated that the blood on clothing we recovered was from that incident,” according to the complaint.</p>
<p>All three are charged with homicide and other crimes including aggravated indecent assault and conspiracy. The women are also charged with unlawful restraint and false imprisonment.</p>
