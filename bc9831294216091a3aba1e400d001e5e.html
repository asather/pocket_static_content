<p>NEW YORK CITY — The Atlantic 10 announced late Wednesday that the rest of its conference tournament will be played without fans in attendance, due to fears surrounding the spread of COVID-19, commonly known as coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Beginning tomorrow, all remaining contests in the championship will be restricted to teams, network television, working media, essential personnel and team-affiliated families/guests,” the conference’s statement partly read.</p>
<p>The announcement comes amid a wave of similar announcements from other sports governing bodies, including the NCAA, which mandated that the NCAA tournament games this season <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/03/11/Only-essential-staff-and-limited-family-at-NCAA-basketball-tournaments/stories/202003110148" target="_blank">will be played without fans in</a> attendance. Most other conference tournaments will also be played without fans.</p>
<p>The A10 tournament, which is taking place at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., actually began earlier in the day on Wednesday, before the conference decided to limit fan attendance. George Mason beat St. Joseph’s, and Fordham beat George Washington in the two Wednesday matchups.</p>
<p>Duquesne will begin tournament play on Thursday against Fordham, and coach Keith Dambrot commented on the matter Wednesday morning, prior to his team’s departure for Brooklyn.</p>
<p>“We’re kind of going into the den of it,” Dambrot told reporters. “All I do is get ready. I’m more susceptible than they are. I’m a 61-year-old old man with a high stress level.&nbsp;You can’t poo-poo it, though. It’s obviously serious stuff, but I try not to think about things that don’t happen until they happen.&nbsp;It cheats the experience.</p>
<p>“Would I like it? No. But if it’s in the best interest of everybody involved, we have to do what we have to do for health concerns.”</p>
<p>Dambrot went on to joke that his team would be used to playing in front of low fan attendance, referencing the Dukes’ unusual home arena situation, which saw them play at three different venues around Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>And while the comment was tongue-in-cheek, the reality of the situation is that Duquesne needs to win the A10 tournament to qualify for the NCAA tournament, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/duquesne/2020/03/11/dukes-basketball-atlantic-10-tournament-keith-dambrot-marcus-weathers/stories/202003110114" target="_blank">has been its goal</a> the whole season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This recent measure by the A10 throws an interesting, but likely appropriate, twist into that goal.</p>
