<h1>Fresh Fest is going digital this year </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fresh Fest, America’s first black beer festival that was scheduled to move to Pittsburgh’s Allentown neighborhood this August for its third year, has decided that due to COVID-19, it’s going digital instead.</p>
<p>In a Facebook post Monday evening, organizers recounted,&nbsp;“For weeks we have thought on how to further our goals of celebrating Black culture through art, education, collaboration, and representation. And now, we are excited to announce that we are producing America’s first Black (digital) beer festival – a live-streaming event that will be broadcast from the Work Hard Pittsburgh studios and surrounding venues in Allentown. Fresh Fest Digi Fest will offer: live art, music, deejays, podcasts, brewing, cooking, speakers from across the world, and much more!”</p>
<p>Organizer say they’re developing a free smartphone app that will awill provide an event schedule and information about and links to breweries and beer collaborations, vendors, artists and musicians.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A pass to this “54 hours of entertainment and education”&nbsp;are to be available starting June 8 for $10.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who already bought tickets to the in-person fest — starting at $50 for events Aug. 7-9 —&nbsp;don’t need to do anything more to be part of the digital one. They may also redeem already purchased tickets, upgraded to early-admission level, for a festival over the next three years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Thank you all for your continued support,” organizers noted, “and we look forward to making 2020 the #fresh3st and safest beer festival in America!”</p>
<p>Last year, USA Today readers voted the festival the No. 2 beer festival in America, a ranking that it repeated earlier this year. Both of those festivals were held at the North Side’s Nova Place.&nbsp;</p>
