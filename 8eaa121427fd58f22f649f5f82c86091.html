<h1>Pittsburgh United Methodist bishop helps launch anti-racism effort</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Area Bishop Cynthia Moore-Koikoi is helping launch an initiative throughout the United Methodist Church aimed at mobilizing members to work toward dismantling racism in their church and society.</p>
<p>She’s one of five bishops to launch the event via video on Friday, known as Juneteenth or the commemoration of the proclamation of freedom to slaves in Texas on June 19, 1865. The initiative is slated to continue through next summer’s General Conference of the United Methodist Church&nbsp;— which had been scheduled to be held in Minneapolis, Minn., even before it became ground zero for the worldwide protests against racial injustice erupted following the killing of George Floyd in police custody there.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But, she is insisting the church had better mean business this time as it confronts racism and prepares to do something about it.</p>
<p>“We have been here before,” said Bishop Moore-Koikoi, who leads the 23-county Western Pennsylvania Conference of the church.&nbsp;“This time, ... we need it to be different.” <a href="https://www.umc.org/en/how-we-serve/advocating-for-justice/racial-justice/united-against-racism?fbclid=IwAR31pMzWSGhVY7wpAd5XXUfoy3MBAI4hlQB6keXLYRzcO5WesStnOFpij8Q" target="_blank">She is speaking in the video in front of a mural memorializing Mr. Floyd on a ramp pillar at the Fort Duquesne Bridge</a>.</p>
<p>Bishop Moore-Koikoi is the first African-American woman bishop in the Western Pennsylvania conference of United Methodists, who comprise one of the largest Protestant groups both regionally and nationally.</p>
<p>Before coming to Pittsburgh, Bishop Moore-Koikoi was a church district superintendent in Baltimore, where she participated in a peace march and in coordinating churches’ responses to the death of Freddie Gray in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Bishop Moore-Koikoi noted that previous high-profile cases such as this led to “a few days of headlines, followed by a few days of protest, followed by short-lived initiatives, hollow acts of repentance and broken promises.”</p>
<p>Then, she said, some people emit a&nbsp;“sigh of relief” after&nbsp;“something else comes along to grab the headlines or to grab financial resources.”</p>
<p>She added:&nbsp;“I will not lead or participate in&nbsp;another effort full of sound and fury signifying nothing. The lives of my people, of all people of color, who have been&nbsp;systematically disrespected, disregarded and extinguished by the sin of racism are too important to settle for anything less than uncompromising&nbsp;action in dismantling racism.”</p>
<p>The United Methodist campaign will include worship services on the theme of dismantling racism, both locally and denomination-wide, including an online service of lament on Wednesday at 1 p.m.</p>
<p>It will also include town halls and online courses. And a national advertising campaign will be spread on social media as well as on digital billboards in Minneapolis and other cities most affected by recent killings of African Americans by police, including Atlanta, Houston and Louisville, Ky.</p>
<p>Church members are also asked to pray at 8:46 each morning and evening for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, the exact amount of time a Minneapolis police officer kept his knee on the neck of the dying Mr. Floyd on May 25 as he said,&nbsp;“I can’t breathe.”</p>
<p>These efforts are aimed at spurring members to concrete actions both in church and in wider society.</p>
<p>Bishop Moore-Koikoi added that change&nbsp;“must be unleashed in the church, interrupting business as usual until a breakthrough comes.&nbsp;This time it has to be different.”</p>
