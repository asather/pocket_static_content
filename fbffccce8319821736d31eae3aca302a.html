<h1>Penguins can't find spark against lowly Los Angeles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Three squandered power plays. A pair of clanged posts. And one frantic but fruitless goal-mouth scramble with less than 20 seconds left.</p>
<p>Yeah, Wednesday was just one of those nights for the Penguins, who out-played the Los Angeles Kings at Staples Center but lost, 2-1, largely due to an unknown, unflappable backup goalie and a few bounces that didn’t go their way.</p>
<p>“It just didn’t seem to want to go in,” Sidney Crosby lamented after the loss.</p>
<p>Added Patric Hornqvist, sighing in disbelief: “We were the better team. … Maybe they were better than us the first 10 minutes. The last 50, I think we out-chanced them, we out-played them. But we couldn’t find the back of the net.”</p>
<p>That has been one glaring problem for the Penguins during this season-long four-game losing streak. They have scored just six goals. Mustering one against a last-place Kings organization looking ahead to the draft lottery was extra frustrating, especially given who was between the pipes for them Wednesday.</p>
<p>That was Cal Petersen, a 25-year-old Iowa native who got called up earlier this month after the Kings traded Jack Campbell to the Toronto Maple Leafs. The unproven Petersen, an All-Star at the American Hockey League level this season, was making just his fifth NHL start of the season and 16th of his career.</p>
<p>The Penguins didn’t beat Petersen until the 13:18 mark of the third period, pulling within 2-1. Evgeni Malkin whipped a back-door pass to Bryan Rust, who poked it into an open net for his team-leading 24th goal of the season.</p>
<p>“Good play by those two guys,” said Hornqvist, who got it started by barging into the slot then dishing the puck over to Malkin. “That was a nice goal.”</p>
<p>The veteran forward expressed confidence that more will be on the way.</p>
<p>“Maybe we aren’t executing when we have the chances, but I think we’ve been hard on pucks, and we have been doing a lot of the right things,” Hornqvist said. “If we keep playing these kinds of games, we’re going to score goals.”</p>
<p>The Penguins kept pushing, but Petersen slammed the door shut. He made one last tough stop in the final seconds and finished the night with 36 saves.</p>
<p>“He made a lot of good saves,” his counterpart, Tristan Jarry, said. “That’s what got them the game. You see how many Grade-A saves that he had against our top guys. Maybe if we score one or two, the game goes a different way.”</p>
<p>The Kings didn’t have many chances, but they converted a couple of them.</p>
<p>They scored 2:34 into the game after a questionable penalty called against Kris Letang, a lost faceoff by Teddy Blueger and 94 seconds of zone time for the Kings. Eventually, Blake Lizotte tipped Sean Walker’s point shot past Jarry.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh penalty kill, which recently climbed into the league’s top 10, has given up four power-play goals on nine opportunities during this skid.</p>
<p>The Penguins appeared to tie it late in the first when a Justin Schultz pass hit Crosby’s skate then the crossbar before dropping straight down. A video review showed the puck somehow skipped along the goal line and stayed out.</p>
<p>The Kings pushed it to 2-0 with 32 seconds left in the second period. Jack Johnson got turned inside out by streaking Kings winger Trevor Lewis. Jarry made the initial save, but Lewis plowed through Jason Zucker to bury the rebound.</p>
<p>The Kings entered the night 7-15-2 since the NHL’s Christmas break and recently traded three more players away from their most recent Stanley Cup winning team. Jeff Carter sat out the game due to injury, and Jonathan Quick, the man between the pipes back in that 2014 run, worked the door to their bench Wednesday.</p>
<p>Penguins coach Mike Sullivan didn’t believe his players took the Kings lightly.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that was the case at all. We knew this team was going to play hard. It wasn’t a case where our guys went out and played a lackadaisical game,” he said. “I thought we had a pretty solid team game, and we just didn’t score.”</p>
<p>The Penguins have lost each of their last four games in regulation. They now trail the first-place Washington Capitals, who beat them Sunday, by four points in the standings. And they are only eight points clear of the surging New York Rangers, the seventh-place team in the NHL’s most stacked division.</p>
<p>“We know points are important and we want to be playing well this time of year. Obviously, you don’t want to drop four in a row. But that’s the reality we face,” Crosby said. “I feel like we probably deserved better the last couple of games, but you don’t get points for that. So we’ve got to find ways to win games.”</p>
<p>One silver lining in the loss was the play of their three deadline additions.</p>
<p>While he did not register a point and had just one shot, Patrick Marleau had a strong debut, displaying his skating and poise. He drew a penalty, too. Conor Sheary, back in black and gold, kept up on the top line. Evan Rodrigues played 13 shifts but looked like a good fit with his speed and pesky puck pursuit.</p>
<p>“They were really good,” Sullivan said. “I thought all three of them had a positive impact on the game. So it’s going to give us some options moving forward.”</p>
<p>The Penguins, on their four-game road trip, will next play the Anaheim Ducks on Friday before flying to San Jose for a Saturday matchup with the Sharks.</p>
