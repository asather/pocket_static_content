<p>Another resident at one of Citizen Care’s group homes has tested positive for COVID-19, Partner’s for Quality, the parent company of Citizen Care, announced in a statement on Friday.</p>
<p>According to the statement, the individual was living in the same group home with four others, one of whom tested positive on April 7. The two other residents also tested positive earlier this week, meaning that all four residents of the home have now contracted the virus.</p>
<p>“All four individuals are under the care of physicians and will remain hospitalized in quarantine until instructed otherwise by doctors,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Citizen Care, which operates several group homes in Allegheny County, is a subsidiary of Partners for Quality, which provides oversight for organizations that serve individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>The statement also said that a contracted professional that was working in the home has also tested positive and that that person is currently self-isolating.</p>
<p>“Staff and persons supported at all Partners For Quality agencies continue to adhere to Centers for Disease Control &amp; Prevention guidelines on hygiene and social distancing,” the statement said. “The safety and well-being of persons supported and staff remain a priority of Partners For Quality.”</p>
