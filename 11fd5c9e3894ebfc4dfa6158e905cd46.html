<h1>Hairstyle bill fails in Allegheny County Council committee; Juneteenth bill is held</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An amendment <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/09/08/hair-discrimination-Allegheny-County-Council-amendment-end-hairstyles-colors/stories/202009080109" target="_blank">adding hairstyle to Allegheny County’s anti-discrimination code</a> failed to get enough votes at the committee level Wednesday in county council.</p>
<p>The county already protects people from discrimination under 12 protected classes at work and when finding housing or public accommodations.</p>
<p>“Hairstyle policies often function as de facto racial discrimination. Such policies can have a disparate impact on Black [people] and African Americans,” said Councilwoman Anita Prizio, D-O’Hara.</p>
<p>But four of the seven county council members on the Government Reform Committee said they needed more information and could not yet support a bill that would add hairstyles as the county’s 13th protected class, among protections for race, age, gender, sexual orientation and others.</p>
<p>Committee members who opposed the amendment included Tom Baker, R-Ross; Sam DeMarco, R-at large; Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless; and Nick Futules, R-Oakmont.</p>
<p>The bill’s primary sponsor Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights; Paul Klein, D-Shadyside; and Ms. Prizio voted in favor of the amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. DeMarco said the legislation as written now could lead to “unnecessary litigation.”</p>
<p>The legislation remains in committee.</p>
<p>An amendment to the county’s personnel holiday calendar to recognize Juneteenth&nbsp;as a paid holiday will also remain in committee.</p>
<p>Juneteenth, marked on June 19, commemorates the emancipation of enslaved African Americans.</p>
<p>Declaring the holiday “was done statewide … and just recently at the Juneteenth ceremony at St. Benedict the Moor Church, Juneteenth was recognized as a city holiday,” said Ms. Bennett, the bill’s sponsor.</p>
<p>Mr. DeMarco said he opposed the legislation’s language that would replace primary election day as a holiday with Juneteenth. He also posed questions about union employees’ collective bargaining agreements regarding holidays and suggested the option of employees taking a floating holiday on Juneteenth.</p>
<p>Other members said they questioned whether county council had the power to enforce a holiday.</p>
<p>“It is the oldest African American holiday celebrated in this country, so as we’re having conversations around recognizing other cultures and being diverse, we should be doing that in recognition of holidays as well,” Ms. Bennett responded.</p>
<p>A late separate amendment by Ms. Prizio to rename Columbus Day to Indigenous People’s Day on the county level failed in committee in a 4-3 vote. Mr. Baker, Mr. DeMarco, Ms. Kirk and Mr. Futules voted against the measure.</p>
<p>Mr. Futules’ amendment to allow for a three-day weekend if Juneteenth falls in midweek unanimously passed the committee.</p>
