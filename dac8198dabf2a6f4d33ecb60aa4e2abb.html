<h1>Paul Zeise: Bill Belichick without Tom Brady is far less scary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It never ceases to amaze me how many dynasties have fallen because the key people involved allowed their egos to get in the way of their good senses. It happened to the Cowboys in the ’90s when Jerry Jones decided he was smarter than Jimmy Johnson. It happened about the same time to the Bulls, when Jerry Krause apparently decided he was tired of watching his team win championships.</p>
<p>It appears to be happening now to the New England Patriots. The franchise under the direction of Robert Kraft, Bill Belichick and Tom Brady has been maybe the best dynasty ever.&nbsp; The Patriots have won 17 division titles, nine AFC titles and six Super Bowls since 2001. They have been the standard by which every other team measured itself over this time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Yet, for some unknown reason, the three men couldn’t come up with a plan that enabled Brady to finish his career in New England. And the reports are all over the place about the why, but the details are rather boring to me. The only reason this is happening is because somebody, and maybe all three men, allowed their ego to get in the way of their brains.</p>
<p>Kraft wants us to believe it was all Brady. Reporters who cover the team said this split had its roots a few years ago and has been growing ever since. It doesn’t matter, though; this is really just dumb on all three of their parts regardless of who is to blame.</p>
<p>The one thing that will happen, though, is the rest of us will get to see just how great — or overrated — Belichick is as a coach. It will be difficult to judge just how much Brady needs Belichick because he is 43 and his skills have diminished. God help whatever team decides to pony up $60 million or so for a quarterback like Brady, whose best years are behind him,</p>
<p>There has always been this question about which man is more responsible for the Patriots’ success — Brady or Belichick. There are some who say both are responsible and either would be lost without the other. I have my suspicions, though, because we have seen Belichick without Brady but we haven’t seen the other way around.</p>
<p>Belichick has coached seven seasons without Brady as his starting quarterback. That isn’t a giant sample size, but it is large enough that we can get a good feel for Belichick the coach without having an elite quarterback.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In those seven seasons, Belichick has made the playoffs exactly once, and that was in 1994 with the Browns. He was with Cleveland for five seasons and he went 36-44 and had one playoff appearance and zero division titles. He then coached New England in 2000 without Brady and went 5-11. Then Brady missed the entire 2008 season and Belichick went 11-5 but missed the playoffs.</p>
<p>Add all of that up and what you have is a coach that, over seven seasons, went 47-55, made one playoff appearance and won a total of one playoff games. Those aren’t the numbers of an elite coach, they are the numbers of a slightly below average coach. I mean, I just took a random coach — Dave Wannstedt&nbsp; — and looked at his five seasons in Miami. He was 42-31, made the playoffs twice and won a division title.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to say that Wannstedt is a better coach than Belichick or anything like that, I’m just saying Belichick without Brady has not been spectacular. And it isn’t like Belichick had bums at quarterback those other seven years, as he had Bernie Kosar and&nbsp;Vinny Testaverde in Cleveland and Drew Bledsoe his first season in New England.</p>
<p>Belichick probably is an elite coach, but he has to prove he can do it with a quarterback not named Tom Brady. I don’t expect New England to fall to the bottom of the league, though, but looking at their offense — and lack of weapons — last season, I can’t imagine how they are going to be the favorites in the AFC East this year.</p>
<p>The Bills are definitely better than the Patriots, and I am not sure it is a given the Patriots will finish ahead of the Dolphins and Jets, either. And that’s especially given that we have no idea who their quarterback is going to be. And I am going to go out on a limb and say whoever it is, it won’t be anyone as good as Brady.</p>
<p>The Patriots’ run was impressive, but it is over now. And it is over for all the wrong reasons. The larger fallout, though, is that Belichick must prove he can win without Brady if he wants to continue to be seen as an elite coach, and there is no evidence to suggest he can do that.&nbsp;</p>
