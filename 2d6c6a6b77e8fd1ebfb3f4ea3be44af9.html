<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The COVID-19 crisis and economic and racial turmoil have greatly magnified problems around food&nbsp;— food insecurity and hunger, food waste, obesity and disappearing farm land.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Food Policy Council hopes to address those and other issues with the Greater Pittsburgh Food Action Plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The nonprofit, which started in 2009, has been working with many other groups, governments, businesses and individuals since 2017 on the plan, which it released at its monthly meeting Tuesday evening, held online due to the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 125-page plan&nbsp;“sets out a community-centered set of strategies that prioritize healthy, affordable and sustainable food for all in Allegheny County.”</p>
<p>During the recorded, two-hour meeting, council Executive Director Dawn Plummer cited great opportunities for improvement in the vast and complicated regional food system by continuing existing work, starting new work and filling gaps between the two.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The plan includes five main goals and strategies (150 of those) for realizing them. The Zoom meeting, with as many as 120 participants, broke into small groups to break it down into nine priorities:&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Support community-led efforts to address food apartheid by building resilience, community leadership and food sovereignty.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Evaluate food access impact of decision making at public agencies across all levels of government.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Advocate for more affordable public transportation. This was a top priority issue, according to an overview provided by the plan’s project coordinator, Sam Applefield, who described input from 130 municipalities and hundreds of individuals. &nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Maximize the scope and impact of governmental anti-hunger programs. As Just Harvest Executive Director Ken Regal summed up,&nbsp;“We can’t charity our way out of the problem we have” of providing food as a basic human right.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Support food entrepreneurship by addressing the barriers faced by women, immigrants, people of color and other marginalized communities. Breakout leader and chef Claudy Pierre noted, “There have been a lot of good things happening since COVID” to help some food entrepreneurs. Members of his group offered to help connect entrepreneurs to some of these new and developing resources.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Advocate for living wages and for the human rights of food systems workers. Mr. Applefield noted that food service alone counts for more than 54,000 jobs, but the average annual pay is less than $18,000.&nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Leverage the purchasing power of large institutions to support regional producers, a valued workforce and environmental stewardship.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Improve access to land, land ownership and capital for farmers, especially new and beginning ones, farmers of color and farmers from other marginalized communities. That includes,&nbsp;explained NaTisha Washington of Operation Better Block, those struggling to grow food on vacant city lots they don’t own. &nbsp;</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Secure financial support for regional and community food systems development.</p>
<p>Dennis McManus, government affairs director at the&nbsp;Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank, said that this is a&nbsp;“soft” rollout of the plan, which will take some time for people to read and digest. “We’re saving the fireworks for the new year.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, people in working groups will meet this fall to lay out work plans for these priorities, and the public is welcome to contact the Food Policy Council at <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodpolicy.org/" target="_blank">pittsburghfoodpolicy.org</a> to participate and follow that progress.&nbsp;The plan can be downloaded at <a href="https://foodactionplan.org" target="_blank">foodactionplan.org</a>.</p>
<p>“Our work is just getting started,” Ms. Plummer said.</p>
