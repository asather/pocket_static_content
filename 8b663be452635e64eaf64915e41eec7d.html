<h1>Chartiers Valley parents concerned about remote learning </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than two weeks into the new school year, some parents in the Chartiers Valley School District are frustrated with how online learning is functioning.</p>
<p>The parents spoke during Tuesday’s school board meeting held via Zoom.</p>
<p>“We’re into the third week now,” said parent Tara Bonysteele. “It seems that I’m the teacher,” she said, adding her child has to “do a lot on their own.”</p>
<p>The district opted for a hybrid approach to start the academic year, with students attending school in person two days a week and virtually two days.</p>
<p>“I’m just really frustrated at this point, because she wants to go back to school full time,” Ms. Bonysteele said.</p>
<p>Parent Catherine Neff, who has one child at the primary school and one at the intermediate school, said while the primary school has been very organized with its cyber instruction, that’s not the case at the intermediate school.</p>
<p>“It just seems like we’re going all over the place,” said Ms. Neff.“I wish the schools would be more uniform.”</p>
<p>Melissa Taylor said she has to block off time to help her child, who goes to the intermediate school, with Google Classroom each day.</p>
<p>“The consistency is just not there, and they do have a lot of teachers,” Ms. Taylor said.</p>
<p>Parent Kimberly Harris said she works 50 hours a week and is not home to teach her child.</p>
<p>“I’m so disgusted that the school has not given us what they promised us back in March, that this would be different,” she said.</p>
<p>Superintendent Johanna Vanatta said, “I know there have been bumps in the road,” relative to the start to the school year.</p>
<p>She said the district will continue to work with teachers to help them improve and assist with how they deliver their lessons. Ms. Vanatta urged parents to reach out to their child’s teacher, principal or herself if they have questions or concerns.</p>
<p>During her report, Ms. Vanatta said the district is moving toward five-days-a-week instruction for students by Oct. 5.</p>
<p>Parents who choose to also will be able to keep their children in the district’s cyber program. Currently, about 1,000 students are enrolled in the cyber academy.</p>
<p>Ms. Vanatta said a return-to-school plan will be presented to the school board on Sept. 22. If approved, parents will have the ability to change from online to full-time instruction.</p>
