<h1>Ohio man indicted in Robinson bank robbery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Ohio man has been indicted in federal court in Pittsburgh on a charge of robbing a Robinson bank on Jan. 15.</p>
<p>Montague Howard, 40, of Wintersville, is charged with one count of armed bank robbery.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury said Mr. Howard entered the First Commonwealth Bank on Park Manor Drive, pointed what appeared to be a gun at the tellers and made off with about $8,000.</p>
<p>Police caught him two hours later after stopping his vehicle near Steubenville.</p>
<p>A Robinson police officer initially saw a car driving fast and away from the bank around the time of the robbery, police said, and police then used traffic cameras footage to identify the license plate.</p>
<p>Officers tracked the plate and registration to an address in Wintersville, where police set up surveillance and saw Mr. Howard going into and coming out of a house.</p>
<p>Wintersville police then followed Mr. Howard's car and pulled him over without incident, according to Ohio authorities.</p>
<p>Police said they found a trash bag containing about $8,000 at Mr. Howard's home, as well as the ski mask authorities say he was wearing and the gun he is accused of using.</p>
