<h1>Penn State DT Judge Culpepper packing on pounds with a purpose</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A lot Penn State students can go from weighing 245 to 290 pounds pretty quickly with a few stops to the Berkey Creamery and, if they’re of age, Voodoo Brewery. Packing on pounds is easy — until you have to do it with a purpose.</p>
<p>Redshirt sophomore Judge Culpepper learned about the rigors of intentional weight gain transitioning from a tight end out of high school to a defensive tackle in college.</p>
<p>The redshirt sophomore has found a mix of fast-casual dining, his mom’s cooking in his hometown of Tampa, and grilling with his brother Syracuse quarterback brother Rex to keep the healthy gains going.</p>
<p>“I’ve been eating a lot of Chipotle,” Culpepper said to reporters on Tuesday. “It’s great since they give you a lot of chicken and get the carbs you need. My mom was happy to have me home. She cooked a lot. My brother and I grilled out either before or after every workout. I ate a lot of red meat, fish, and chicken. I’ve been taking care of business.”</p>
<p>It’s nothing particularly new to Culpepper, who has been gearing up to make the transition for a while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve worked on it a lot over the last two years. My body fat is way lower, and my muscle mass is much higher,” Culpepper said. “I’ve maintained that same 285 since when I got here.</p>
<p>“It’s a better weight. It just feels better on me. And that’s a testament to the strength training program, honestly.”</p>
<p>Culpepper can credit both his parents for his work ethic in the weight room — and at the dinner table.</p>
<p>His father, Brad, played college ball at Florida follwoed by nine years in the NFL. Plus, Brad joined Judge’s mom, Monica, on the reality show Survivor for two seasons. Culpepper fondly remembers seeing how intense his parents were.</p>
<p>“My mom got on it. I thought that was pretty cool,” Culpepper said. “On her second season, she did a food challenge and smoked a bunch of other people. She was eating grub worms and cow eyeballs, a bunch of crazy stuff.</p>
<p>“There were, like, 10 people in the challenge. My mom ate all that food the fastest. And I was impressed. I always knew my mom was tough, but eating grubs and cow eyeballs, that’s no easy feat.”</p>
<p>Culpepper has gained a more profound respect for his father, as he now plays the same position that defined his father’s pro career.</p>
<p>“My dad played football and was successful at pretty much every level. I look at him and aspire to be like him,” Culpepper said. “He’s an incredibly hard worker. He puts 100 percent of effort into everything that he’s invested in. Growing up and watching that, he’s set the path for me, the path that I want to follow.”</p>
<p>Culpepper played in 13 games last season, mostly on special teams. He did register two tackles and a sack. Now he’s hoping to get more playing time in a crowded defensive tackle room. Antonio Shelton and PJ Mustipher are the starters, while Cole Brevard, Fred Hansard, Hakeem Beamon, and Dvon Ellies will fight for playing time.</p>
<p>Culpepper knows it will be tough, but he’s excited about the challenge.</p>
<p>“We have a great room,” Culpepper said. “We have so much talent. I believe that we have a chance to be great. I’m looking forward to the season.”</p>
