<h1>WEATHER: Is a weekend warmup in the works?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The spring chill you’ve been feeling these past few days is not going to last much longer.</p>
<p>With today’s high expected to reach into the upper 40s, the weekend will bring warmer weather with plenty of sunshine.</p>
<p>The high on Saturday will be 50 degrees and on Sunday, a little higher at 59, according to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh. A possible dose of early-morning rain will give way to sun, and clear skies will continue into Sunday. The lows will dip back into the 30s at night.</p>
<p>But for the rest of today, rain is forecast for the afternoon, mainly in the southern counties of Western Pennsylvania, where they could see upwards of an inch of precipitation. Snow was expected along the ridges of Westmoreland and Fayette counties, and north of Interstate 80.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be the first time we’ve seen snow in April. Snowfall was recorded as recently as April 2008 and 2015.</p>
