<h1>Pittsburgh man charged with kidnapping ex-girlfriend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police said the text, which read, “cant talk right now,” led officers to believe the woman was in distress.</p>
<p>Kelvin Darryl Isom II, 30, took his former girlfriend late Wednesday night away from her house and child, police said. Now, Mr. Isom of East Liberty is facing charges of kidnapping, unlawful restraint and robbery.</p>
<p>The incident began in Pittsburgh’s Marshall-Shadeland neighborhood when Mr. Isom grabbed his car keys and told her they were going for a drive, the complaint reads. She thought they would drive around the block, but&nbsp;when the car drove by Ross Park Mall, she realized the ride would be longer than anticipated.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The woman asked Mr. Isom to go back to her house and her son, the complaint reads. Before she could call 911, he took her phone away and continued to drive for two hours — at one point about 20 miles away from her house, police said — despite the woman stating she wanted to go back.</p>
<p>When officers arrived on&nbsp;Smithton Street for the initial domestic call, they found the front door wide open and saw a 3-year-old child sleeping on the couch. The juvenile said he didn’t know where his mother was. Officers took the child to a house down the road where his sisters were staying.</p>
<p>Police then learned that the neighbor had tried to call the mother, who responded,&nbsp;“cant talk right now” in a text, according to the complaint. Officers used her phone number and tracked it to a number of locations: Ross Park Mall, Wilkinsburg, Monroeville and on the turnpike near Harmarville.</p>
<p>Eventually, officers located the phone on the parkway. Around 1 a.m., a Wilkinsburg police officer pulled over Mr. Isom’s black BMW, the complaint reads. There, officers detained Mr. Isom and took him to Allegheny County Jail. The victim was unharmed.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Mr. Isom is set for July 7.&nbsp;</p>
