<h1>Robert Morris believes little things will get them to NCAA tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before this season began, the Robert Morris basketball team gathered for a meeting.</p>
<p>Colonials coach Andy Toole stood at the front of the group and asked everyone in the room to raise their hand if they wanted to win the Northeast Conference tournament and reach the NCAA tournament. When everyone did, he told them to then raise their arms the rest of the way. The difference, he said, between making the NCAA tournament and not is the difference between raising your hand and extending it all the way.</p>
<p>He admits he stole the thought exercise from NFL head coach Ron Rivera, but the idea is perfectly applicable in this situation. Toole has been to the Big Dance as a coach and a player. If anybody with Robert Morris understands what it takes to make it there, it’s him.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There’s a number of things we can point to and say, ‘Hey, we didn’t take care of X, Y and Z, and that’s why we weren’t able to be successful, and if we want to continue to be successful, we’ve got to take care of those things,” Toole said on Tuesday.&nbsp;“Those are things we try and point out, whether it’s through practice setting, whether it’s through film, whether it’s through individual meetings, whether it’s through whatever we can, late-night text messages. It’s whatever way we can try to get that to sink in — how critical each and every thing is.”</p>
<p>Those lessons had better have taken hold by now, as the Colonials will play their first NEC tournament game on Wednesday, when they host St. Francis Brooklyn at UPMC Events Center.</p>
<p>The teams matched up twice during the regular season. Strangely enough, Robert Morris beat the Terriers by 26 at home, and then two weeks later, St. Francis beat the Colonials by 21 in New York.</p>
<p>Now, of course, there’s much more on the line for both teams, and Robert Morris will lean on its hard work and the attention it has paid to details to put it over the edge and extend the season at least a while longer.</p>
<p>“We never really have rest days as far as going out and competing the next day after practice or after the next game,” junior guard Jon Williams said &nbsp;“The focus is always to get better and to worry about the little things, because that’s what makes the difference in a game is the details. Just as raising your hand a little bit higher to want something more. So diving on the floor, guys clapping, guys cheering each other on. So we try to focus on the details as much as possible.”</p>
<p>The other emphasis the Colonials have is to focus all of their energy on the game at hand, as tempting as it may be to daydream about the NCAA tournament possibilities looming in the near future.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean the goal of making it to that point can drive Robert Morris in the present. The players say it does, and Toole wants to make it there for his players.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He remembers what it was like to make the tournament when he played at Penn, and he and his teammates from those teams still discuss those memories.</p>
<p>“My coach at Penn, Fran Dunphy, used to always say the greatest sound in the world is hearing your name called on Selection Sunday,” Toole said.&nbsp;“And you’d go eye roll to him every time he’d say it during the year, and then all of the sudden it happens, and you’re like,&nbsp;‘Holy. He’s right.’ That’s amazing to see your name flash up there on that screen. You know it’s coming and when that name goes up there, everyone still jumps up and down, because now it’s real.</p>
<p>“... As coaches, you want to make sure your guys walk out of here with that same kind of feeling. They don’t always understand how hard it is, and they don’t always understand how great it will feel when it happens. And so that’s your job as a coach, is to try and keep them on that path doing the right stuff.”&nbsp;</p>
