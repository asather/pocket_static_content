<h1>Central Valley's Isiah Warfield named to all-state team at second different school</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s fairly unusual for a Pennsylvania high school basketball player to make all-state at two different schools. But it has happened for the second consecutive year for a WPIAL player.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State Team for Class 4A was released Thursday, and Central Valley senior guard Isiah Warfield was a second-team pick. Warfield’s selection comes after he made the Class 2A teams the past two years when he played at Sewickley Academy. Warfield was a first-team selection in 2018 and 2019 before transferring to Central Valley.</p>
<p>It was only a year ago that<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2019/05/14/pennsylvania-all-state-basketball-team-2019-ethan-morton-purdue-moon-high-school/stories/201905140129" target="_blank"> Donovan&nbsp;“Puff” Johnson made first-team</a> Class 5A at Moon High School. In 2018, Johnson made second-team in Class 2A when he played at Our Lady of the Sacred Heart before transferring to Moon.</p>
<p>As for Warfield, he is a 6-foot-5 point guard who also made the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/29/2020-Post-Gazette-Boys-Fab-5-Ethan-Morton-Michael-Carmody-Isiah-Warfield-Jake-Hoffman-Rodney-Gallagher/stories/202003290026" target="_blank">Post-Gazette Fabulous 5</a>. Warfield averaged 21.2 points a game and shot 49% from the field. He did a little of everything for Central Valley, also averaging 8.5 rebounds and 4 assists. He finished his career with 1,679 points.&nbsp;Warfield has signed with Liberty University, which qualified for the NCAA tournament this season and in 2019.</p>
<p>Warfield is one of only two WPIAL players that made the Class 4A team. The other was Highlands senior forward Johnny Crise, who was a third-team selection. Crise is a 6-6 forward who plans to play football at Penn State as a walk-on. But Crise sure did have plenty of highlights from his final basketball season.</p>
<p>Crise was on a team that won the WPIAL Class 4A championship and he was selected the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/04/03/2020-Post-Gazette-Boys-and-Girls-Fab-5-Players-of-the-Year-by-classification/stories/202004030036" target="_blank">Post-Gazette Class 4A Player of the Year</a>. He averaged 14.7 points, 8.8 rebounds, 1.8 blocks and shot 69% from the field. Crise was a player who didn’t mind contact, evidenced by him taking 61 charges during his career.</p>
<p>The Class 4A player of the year on the all-state team is Jordan Longino of Germantown Academy. The coach of the year is Brendan Stanton of Pope John Paul II in eastern Pa.</p>
