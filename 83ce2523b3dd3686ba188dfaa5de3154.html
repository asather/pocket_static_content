<h1>Patrick Marleau 'grateful' for chance to earn elusive Stanley Cup with Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LOS ANGELES — Patrick Marleau, still chasing his first Stanley Cup at 40, probably would have settled for a trade to any contender. But to him, there is something special about joining the Penguins, and his wife has photos to prove it.</p>
<p>After the Penguins on Monday scored Marleau from the San Jose Sharks, his wife, Christina, tweeted out two of his school photos, presumably from the 1990s. In both of them, Marleau wore a crooked grin, poofy hair and a Penguins shirt.</p>
<p>Asked about how a kid from Saskatchewan, Canada, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/24/nhl-trade-dealine-news-rumors-deal-patrick-marleau-san-jose-sharks/stories/202002240104" target="_blank">fell in love with the Penguins</a> back in the day, his answer might be the same as a boy from Butler.</p>
<p>“I was just a big Mario fan and a big Penguins fan,” he explained after Tuesday’s practice at Toyota Performance Center, the other home of the Los Angeles Kings. “They were winning Cups back then and hopefully we win one this year.”</p>
<p>Marleau hasn’t publicly declared that this is his last NHL season. But one would think that he won’t get a better chance to win a Cup the rest of his career. And what a story that would be, one of this era’s most accomplished players — maybe even a Hall-of-Famer — finally winning one with Mario Lemieux’s team.</p>
<p>The Penguins did not acquire him for that narrative. And while his leadership won’t hurt, that’s not why he’s here either. They believe he can still skate.</p>
<p>“He’s very well-respected around the league and certainly well-respected by the Penguins’ players and coaches,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “He’s accomplished almost everything in the game, with the exception of the ultimate prize. Our hope is he’s going to help us achieve our common goal. We’re thrilled to have Patrick.”</p>
<p>Marleau, now on his fourth team in the past year, had just 10 goals and 10 assists in 58 games with the struggling Sharks prior to Monday’s trade. But they think he can still skate, rattle opponents on the forecheck and create scoring chances.</p>
<p>And as Tuesday’s practice suggested, they won’t heap too much onto his plate.</p>
<p>Marleau skated on what would be considered the third or fourth line, depending on the night. He was on the left wing and teamed up with fellow newcomer Evan Rodrigues and Dominik Simon. Marleau also worked with the second power-play unit Tuesday, drawing faceoff duties over Simon and Conor Sheary.</p>
<p>Sullivan downplayed the significance of Tuesday’s lines, which will likely hold for Wednesday’s game against the Kings. He said there will be tinkering.</p>
<p>Marleau also expects that there will be an adjustment period as he familiarizes himself with his new teammates, Sullivan’s system and Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We’ve been going over some stuff, doing some talking. I’m just getting used to the guys right now,” he said. “Practice was a huge help, getting the system and all that. But I imagine it will be the same — play hard and play the right way.”</p>
<p>Marleau would know. He’s had plenty of recent experience switching cities.</p>
<p>He spent his first 19 seasons with the Sharks, the team that selected him second overall at the 1997 draft that was held at the old Civic Arena, before he signed with the Toronto Maple Leafs in 2017. He put up decent numbers in his first season there but became a salary-cap casualty after his second.</p>
<p>Last summer, the Leafs sent a first-round pick to the Carolina Hurricanes to get them to take his salary off their books. Five days later, the Hurricanes bought out his contract, freeing Marleau to rejoin the Sharks on a cheap, one-year deal.</p>
<p>The Sharks have been one of the NHL’s most disappointing teams this season. Knowing he is running out of chances, he welcomed a trade to a contender.</p>
<p>“There’s no shortage of new and exciting things, that’s for sure,” the soft-spoken forward said. “One thing about this game, there’s always opportunities and there’s always challenges. I’m grateful for this opportunity I got coming here.”</p>
<p>Marleau has had chances to win it all on some stacked Sharks squads. He was a key player for the San Jose team that Pittsburgh beat in the Finals in 2016. But he is still looking to add a Cup to a resume that is pretty incredible otherwise.</p>
<p>He ranks fifth in NHL history in games played and trails Gordie Howe by 52 for the all-time record. He has 15 seasons with 20 or more goals, including in 2009-10, when he buried a career-high 44. And he won Olympic gold medals in 2010 and 2014 while playing alongside Sidney Crosby on the Canadian squad.</p>
<p>“Obviously, he’s got a ton of experience. He’s played in a lot of games, a lot of big games, over his career,” the Penguins captain said, adding, “He’s still a great skater. And with the way we play, I think he’ll really enjoy playing for us.”</p>
<p>Marleau joined the team in California on Monday evening, bumping into a bunch of his new teammates as they left the team hotel to grab some grub. Two he chatted with then were Crosby and Kris Letang. He also has had plenty of clashes with Evgeni Malkin over the years, both in the NHL and internationally.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be great seeing them in the same color, that’s for sure,” he said with a crooked grin. “Playing with those guys is going to be amazing. ... It was great to get those introductions right away. It seems like a pretty cool group of guys.”</p>
<p>One person who has yet to welcome him is Lemieux. Well, at least Marleau thinks he hasn’t. He’s been too busy to listen to all his new voicemails.</p>
<p>“I still have to check my phone, so it could be on there,” Marleau joked.</p>
