<h1>No 4th of July fireworks, city and county pools this summer due to pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Future generations may be one day told about the summer of the pandemic when pools were closed, no fireworks marked the Fourth of July and youth baseball games paused right along with the Major Leagues.</p>
<p>No, summer in the city — and the region — just won’t be the same in 2020, as city and county officials announced cancellations and closures to remain in accordance with health guidelines meant to stop the spread of the COVID-19.</p>
<p>City and county swimming pools will not open this year, and city-sponsored&nbsp;youth baseball, Independence Day celebrations, concerts and 5K races, including the Great Race, will not go on.</p>

<p>“Pittsburgh residents have done a great job during these trying times staying safe and looking out for each other. The data shows the battle against this pandemic is far from over, however, and we must keep social distancing and other measures in place to win this fight, even when we’re enjoying the outdoors,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a press release announcing the closures.</p>
<p>The city’s playgrounds, park shelters and spray parks will remain closed until further notice.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some activities will remain open or will be adjusted to comply with social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>City crews will begin reopening the following facilities starting today:</p>
<p>Rather than traditional movies in the park, the city will offer drive-in movies starting June 13. City farmer’s markets will begin with&nbsp;“safe purchasing requirements” June 3 in Carrick and then subsequently in Squirrel Hill, North Side and East Liberty on June 7, 12 and 15, respectively.</p>
<p>The city has not yet made final decisions on recreation and senior centers, block party permits, and other organized group sports including dek hockey, soccer and basketball.</p>
<p>The county on Monday will begin “physically distanced programming,” including outdoor yoga, bike riding lessons, nature programs and exercise groups.</p>
<p>County park shelter rentals will be allowed starting Sunday, but renters and guests must follow federal, state and the Allegheny County Health Department social distancing guidelines.</p>
<p>At least one other municipality in the county has already announced a pool closure for the summer; <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/05/04/Dormont-Pool-will-not-open-2020-coronavirus-COVID-19-PA/stories/202005040126" target="_blank">Dormont Borough decided on May 4</a> that its large public pool would not open in 2020.</p>
<p>Summer changes are coming to surrounding areas as well in an effort to stop the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Beaver County commissioners also announced in early May that the county-run swimming pool would remain closed this season&nbsp;“due to the uncertainty of COVID-19 status, staffing issues and other safety related concerns,” said Commissioner Jack Manning.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County does not run its own public swimming facilities, but county-run&nbsp;dog parks, skate parks and boating on the lakes are activities that residents can take advantage because those activities “are more amenable to following the current CDC guidelines, meaning people could distance themselves and wear masks for protection from aerosals. A mask and a pool don't seem congruent with current masks available,” said Douglas Chew, Westmoreland County Commissioner.</p>
<p>Fayette County officials say they have sent an inquiry to Gov. Tom Wolf to receive guidance on swimming pools.</p>
<p>“According to the DOH and CDC guidelines with the current yellow phase, I believe to stay in compliance no [pools will not open],” said Commissioner Vincent Vicities.</p>
<p>Gov. Wolf’s color-coded phase guidelines state that in the red phase — in which Beaver County remains -— any gatherings of 10 or more are prohibited. All other Southwester Pennsylvania counties are in the yellow phase, which allows gatherings of up to 25 people, according to Nate Wardle, Department of Health spokesman.</p>
<p>“Discussions are ongoing as to whether pools will be permitted to open in the yellow phase, and also the green phase, where we will need continued efforts to protect Pennsylvanians and guidelines will be needed on gatherings of individuals. Guidance will be provided regarding this in the near future,” he said.</p>
