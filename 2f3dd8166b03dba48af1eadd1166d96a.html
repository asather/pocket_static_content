<p>Allegheny County officials on Friday reported that 51 residents and 26 staff members at its four assisted living centers have tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>Four residents from the Glen Hazel Kane Community Living Center location <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/14/Resident-Kane-Glen-Hazel-died-COVID-19-coronavirus/stories/202004140070" target="_blank">died from the virus</a>, and Friday’s update revealed that confirmed cases are now being reported at the county’s three other locations.</p>
<p>One resident at the McKeesport facility has tested positive and is in isolation after returning from a local hospital where the resident was being treated for other medical issues, officials said.</p>
<p>Three staff members — one each from the McKeesport, Ross and Scott — are now positive for the virus, and officials say that the workers haven’t returned to the centers&nbsp;since April 13, April 10 and April 6 respectively.</p>
<p>As of Sunday,&nbsp;34 residents at the Glen Hazel nursing home had tested positive for COVID-19, and officials were awaiting results for two additional residents.&nbsp;Among that location’s staff, 19 workers had tested positive for the virus, and seven test results were pending. The numbers of confirmed cases at Glen Hazel now stand at 50 residents and 23 staff. Two residents are hospitalized.</p>
<p>“Our singular focus during this difficult time is protecting and caring for our residents and staff,” said Dennis Biondo, Kane director. “We have been grateful for the continued communication with and guidance from the Health Department and remain focused and committed to ensuring that we continue to provide the quality of care for which we have become known.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>County officials said Friday that all employees caring for residents who have tested positive, or whose test is pending, are required to wear N95 masks, gowns, gloves and face shields or goggles — though it is required for all patient care regardless of COVID-19 status at the Glen Hazel facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Health care workers are now able to swab for the virus on-site at the living centers and send the specimens for testing.</p>
<p>Visiting hours, group activities and outings, and communal dining have been prohibited at the facilities since March 13.</p>
<p>Families have been provided with a number to call at any time for an update.</p>
<p>The first positive case was reported at the Glen Hazel location on March 25, followed by two more on March 27.</p>
