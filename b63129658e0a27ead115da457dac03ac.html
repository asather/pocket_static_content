<h1>WEATHER: Hot and humid day on tap for Father's Day with summer's arrival</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The official start of summer will usher in a hot and humid Father’s Day throughout the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>The summer solstice officially arrives Saturday at 5:43 p.m., heralding the longest day and shortest night of the year.</p>
<p>The high temperature on Sunday should reach into the high 80s with a&nbsp;“calm wind,” according to the National Weather Service in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>But with humidity in the 60% to 70% range, it’ll feel more&nbsp;“like 91 to 93 degrees,” said weather service meteorologist David Shallenberger.</p>
<p>Pittsburghers will wake up to temps in the low-60s. It should stay mostly sunny during the daylight hours, then some precipitation is expected to move in.</p>
<p>“We have a really good chance of showers and thunderstorms,” Shallenberger said.&nbsp;“From 5 to 8 p.m. you’re looking at a 50% chance.”</p>
<p>Today’s high was expected to reach 83 degrees.</p>
