<h1>Penguins stay within organization with new hires in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins have picked from within the organization to name a new head coach and new general manager for their American Hockey League affiliate.</p>
<p>J.D. Forrest has been hired as head coach for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, and Jason Karmanos will be the general manager, the Penguins announced Friday. The two will replace Mike Vellucci, who last week left his dual role with the AHL club to become an assistant coach on Mike Sullivan’s staff in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Forrest, 39, joined Wilkes-Barre/Scranton as an assistant coach in 2016 and has worked primarily with the team’s defensive group and penalty kill unit.</p>
<p>Prior to that, the New York native was an assistant coach for the U.S. National Team Development Program, a team that included current NHL standouts Auston Matthews, Charlie McAvoy, Matthew Tkachuk and Clayton Keller.</p>
<p>Forrest played collegiately at Boston College, winning an NCAA title with former Penguins defensemen Brooks Orpik and Rob Scuderi, in addition to Ty Hennes, Pittsburgh’s skills development coach. Forrest, a former blue liner, briefly played in the AHL and ECHL before skating overseas several years.</p>
<p>Karmanos, in a statement, praised him for “consistently demonstrating a strong ability to develop the young defensemen in our system” as an AHL assistant.</p>
<p>He added: “His familiarity with the organization, our prospects and the style of hockey we want to play, together with his work ethic and team-first approach, gives us confidence that he will excel in his new role as head coach.”</p>
<p>Karmanos, who joined the Pittsburgh organization in 2014, will assume the role of Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s general manager in addition to his assistant GM manager duties with the NHL club. The 46-year-old has served in the latter role since 2017 after first joining the front office as VP of hockey operations.</p>
<p>He already oversees Pittsburgh’s amateur scouting and player development staffs under Jim Rutherford. Karmanos is also now in charge of player personnel decisions for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and will manage the team’s coaching staff.</p>
<p>Bill Guerin was the AHL club’s general manager before the Minnesota Wild hired him away last summer. With Guerin gone, Vellucci, already on staff as the coach, was given the dual role of coach and general manager for 2019-20.</p>
<p>The AHL team was in fifth place in the division and out of playoff position when the season shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Those Penguins missed the playoffs in 2018-19 and have not won a playoff series since 2015-16.</p>
<p>The Penguins believe icing a competitive AHL club is critical for the development of prospects playing at that level. Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and Brian Dumoulin are among their core players who spent time in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p>
<p>Noteworthy Penguins prospects playing there in 2020-21 could include forwards Drew O’Connor, Kasper Bjorkqvist and Sam Miletic; defensemen Pierre-Olivier Joseph, Cam Lee and Josh Maniscalco; and goaltender Emil Larmi.</p>
<p>The Penguins did not renew the contract of AHL assistant coach Jarrod Skalde. The Penguins say they will not make any additional decisions regarding the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton coaching staff until closer to the start of the AHL season.</p>
<p><strong>Dates set</strong></p>
<p>The NHL on Friday announced dates for the 2020 NHL draft, which will be held virtually.&nbsp;Round 1 will take place at 7 p.m. Oct. 6, while Rounds 2-7 will start at 11:30 a.m. Oct. 8. The league also announced that free agency will open at noon Oct. 9.</p>
