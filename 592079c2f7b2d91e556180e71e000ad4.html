<h1>PWSA: Lead levels are greatly reduced in Pittsburgh's water supply</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority announced Wednesday that the most recent round of federally mandated tests show water lead levels have declined to the lowest level in 20 years and well within safe drinking water standards.</p>
<p>The testing done on water samples collected from 158 homes with lead service lines or plumbing measured lead at 5.1 parts per billion, about 10 parts per billion below the federal and state action level of 15 parts per billion.</p>
<p>According to the PWSA that’s the lowest lead test result in more than 20 years and the second consecutive round of test results below the action level.</p>
<p>High lead water levels have been a concern for the PWSA service area since 2016, and have exceeded federal lead action levels in five of the last eight 6-month testing periods</p>
<p>The authority said the new results indicate the water supplier is reducing lead levels system wide through an aggressive lead water line replacement program and its use of orthophosphate, a food-grade water additive that coats the inside of pipes to reduce corrosion and the release of lead into the water supply.</p>
<p>PWSA began using the additive in April 2019.</p>
<p>“This latest round of testing not only brings us back into compliance with state and federal regulations, but also closes an unfortunate chapter in PWSA’s history,” said PWSA Executive Director Will Pickering. “Ensuring the safety of your water is our number one priority, and we’re aiming to restore our customers’ trust by continuing to optimize water treatment and replacing the remaining lead pipes in our system.”</p>
<p>Since June 2016, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority has replaced more than 7,400 public lead service lines and 4,700 private lead service lines throughout Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>"Water has long been Pittsburgh's most precious resource, and residents should be assured their drinking water is safe and will stay so for generations. It wasn't easy, but we faced this crisis down and will keep doing the work that is necessary to continually improve our water system," Mayor William Peduto said in a release.</p>
<p>Childhood lead exposure can have severe health consequences, affecting mental capacity and causing behavioral problems and learning disabilities.</p>
<p>Paul Leger, PWSA board chair, said eliminating lead has been a priority for the authority.</p>
<p>“We have passed all hopes we had for lead reduction,” Mr. Leger said, “and we will continue that work until the lead threat is totally eliminated."</p>
