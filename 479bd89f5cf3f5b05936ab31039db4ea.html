<p>BRUNSWICK, Ga. — Two Glynn County commissioners say District Attorney Jackie Johnson’s office refused to allow the Glynn County Police Department to make arrests immediately after the Feb. 23 shooting death of Ahmaud Arbery.</p>
<p>The Georgia Bureau of Investigation announced the arrests of Travis McMichael, 34, and his father, Greg McMichael, 64, on Thursday — more than two months after the fatal shooting. They were denied bond Friday.</p>
<p>“The police at the scene went to [Ms. Johnson], saying they were ready to arrest both of them. These were the police at the scene who had done the investigation,” said Commissioner Allen Booker, who has spoken with Glynn County police. “She shut them down to protect her friend McMichael.”</p>
<p>Greg McMichael, now retired, once worked as an investigator in Ms. Johnson’s office.</p>
<p>Commissioner Peter Murphy, who also said he spoke directly to Glynn County police about the incident, said officers at the scene concluded they had probable cause to make arrests and contacted Ms. Johnson’s office to inform the prosecutor of their decision.</p>
<p>“They were told not to make the arrest,” Mr. Murphy said.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson recused herself from the case within days of the shooting. Her office has not responded to a request to comment on the commissioners’ account of what happened, or on the case in general.</p>
<p>Mr. Arbery would have turned 26 on Friday.</p>
<p>On Friday morning, GBI Director Vic Reynolds said another arrest could be forthcoming. He also noted that by statute, the GBI’s involvement in a local case must be requested and declined to comment on how other agencies have handled the case.</p>
<p>“In a perfect world, would we have liked to have been involved in February? Of course,” Mr. Reynolds said. “But it’s not a perfect world.”</p>
<p>Mr. Reynolds confirmed the harrowing video capturing Mr. Arbery’s death on Feb. 23 was taken by William Bryan, who had helped Greg and Travis McMichael pursue Mr. Arbery as he ran through the Satilla Shores community.</p>
<p>“We’re investigating everyone involved in the case, including the individual who shot the video,” Mr. Reynolds said.</p>
<p>The arrests came roughly 36 hours after the GBI opened a state investigation.</p>
<p>“Probable cause was clear to our agents pretty quickly,” Mr. Reynolds said. “I’m very comfortable in telling you there’s more than sufficient probable cause in charging felony murder.”</p>
<p>Travis and Greg McMichael, who are white, told police they were trying to make a citizen’s arrest because they suspected Mr. Arbery, who is black, of committing burglaries in the neighborhood. Friends and family have said Mr. Arbery, who was unarmed, was only on his daily jog.</p>
