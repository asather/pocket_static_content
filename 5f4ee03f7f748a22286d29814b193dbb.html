<p>Four Chord almost got Blink-182 last summer, but the band’s tour plans changed when they hooked up with Lil Wayne. Four Chord then booked The Offspring, which had to cancel at the last minute. The event went anyway with the other bands at Highmark Stadium at Station Square.</p>

<p>It is presented by 105.9 The X, Four Chord Music &amp; Drusky Entertainment.</p>
