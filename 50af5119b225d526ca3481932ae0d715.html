<h1>Allegheny County Council bans conversion therapy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Council on Tuesday voted to ban sexual orientation and gender conversion therapy for minors.</p>
<p>In an unexpected move, 12 council members voted to bypass the committee process, and in the end, Councilman Tom Baker, R-Moon, moved to the majority for a 13-2 final passage of the bill that prohibits any licensed mental health provider from administering the so-called conversion therapy.</p>
<p>“I never thought it would happen tonight,” said David West, 52, of Franklin Park. “I thought we’d just lay the groundwork tonight. I’m pleasantly shocked.”</p>
<p>Mr. West, the father of a transgender teen, and 13 others — including several mental health professionals — delivered public comment in favor of the ordinance, sponsored by Councilman Paul Klein, D-Point Breeze, and five other members.</p>
<p>Mr. Klein credited the speakers’ “moving insights” as a reason the legislation passed.</p>
<p>The therapy “has been rejected by virtually every professional organization in the mental health universe,” Mr. Klein said, calling it a “public health and safety threat.”</p>
<p>One person delivered public comment in favor of a dueling bill, sponsored by Councilman Sam DeMarco, at-large Republican. Mr. DeMarco’s bill aimed to ban certain methods — for example, electroshocking or inducing vomiting — but to keep legal “gender dysphoria treatment” and other “self-determined objectives” for minors if a parent should choose to seek it for a child.</p>
<p>Mr. DeMarco said he was “disappointed” that the bills did not go through the committee process and argued that his bill was about “freedom of choice” for minors and parents.</p>
<p>In addition to Mr. DeMarco, Councilwoman Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless, also voted no.</p>
<p>Jill Grenda, 47, of Cranberry, drove from Butler County with her teen to show support for the LGBTQ youth.</p>
<p>“Whether they say it’s a choice or not for the kids, it’s not. It’s the parent’s decision&nbsp;… so banning it prevents that from happening,” she said.</p>
