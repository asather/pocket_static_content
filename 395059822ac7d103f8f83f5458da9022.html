<h1>GAO: Customer service reps deceptively marketed 'junk plans' to Americans with preexisting conditions</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Purveyors of low-value, temporary health plans have deceptively claimed they meet key consumer protections, including coverage of preexisting conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, asthma or cancer,&nbsp;federal auditors found in a covert investigation released by Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In a sampling of 31 calls seeking health coverage, eight customer service representatives engaged in deceptive marketing practices, the Government Accountability Office found.&nbsp;Two other representatives failed to consistently and clearly explain the type of coverage they were offering.&nbsp;The remaining 21 calls — just 67% — met federal marketing standards outlined by the Federal Trade Commission.</p>
<p>GAO investigators, posing as individuals needing to purchase health insurance to cover pre-existing conditions, placed phone calls from November 2019 through January 2020&nbsp;to see if customer service representatives directed them to a plan that met the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The GAO authors stressed the results were illustrative only of the sales behaviors they experienced during the calls and could not be generalized to the broader health insurance industry.</p>
<p>Still, the report pulls back the curtain on how Americans can be forced to wade through confusing customer service experiences to sign up for health care — even before tens of millions of jobless Americans lost their employer-sponsored health coverage and were forced to search for plans in the public marketplace.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey and Ms. Stabenow, who together requested the GAO investigation, said the results show that so-called&nbsp;“junk plans” continue to flourish in recent years amid the Trump administration attempts to change the Affordable Care Act.</p>
<p>The short-term, low-benefit plans fail to meet key tenets of the 2010 health law, like coverage for preexisting conditions and protections from large out-of-pocket expenses. But consumers may be more susceptible to mistakenly signing up for those plans as they try to patch together health coverage in between jobs.</p>
<p>“This is an outrage; this is an insult to the American people,” Mr. Casey said in a call with reporters. “The last thing a family should have to worry about in the midst of a pandemic and jobs crisis is their health insurance.”</p>
<p>“We indeed the protections in [the Affordable Care Act] more than ever,” he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The GAO report follows growing concern from Democrats about the pitfalls of&nbsp;“junk plans.”</p>
<p>Last October, Mr. Casey’s office released a report detailing how the plans can mislead consumers using <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/10/29/Bob-Casey-Obamacare-Affordable-Care-Act-junk-plans-Trump/stories/201910290096" target="_blank">paid advertisements on search engine websites</a> like Google, Bing and Yahoo.</p>
<p>That study, in which members of Mr. Casey’s staff searched online for health coverage, turned up results promising “$19 Health Insurance” and the “Best Health Plans 2019 — Compare Plans from $45 a Month” from sites like healthcare.org, a self-proclaimed “official site” for the “health insurance marketplace.”</p>
<p>The paid advertisements, Mr. Casey said at the time, were confusingly labeled and misled consumers to believe they were comprehensive health insurance plans offered at HealthCare.gov. The ads&nbsp;appeared in large groups before any of the real, search engine-generated results begin.</p>
<p>Two weeks after Mr. Casey’s report, Google took steps to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2019/11/12/Bob-Casey-Google-online-advertisement-search-results-Obamacare-junk-plans/stories/201911120082?cid=search" target="_blank">remove any false advertisements</a> for HealthCare.gov from its online search results — while leaving the paid ads largely intact.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Casey and other congressional Democrats have blamed the Trump administration for attacking the Affordable Care Act, the landmark legislation that has become embedded in the U.S. health care system in the last decade.</p>
<p>In 2017, Mr. Trump promised a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, but Senate Republicans came up just short. Also that year,&nbsp;administration cut the budget for ACA advertising to $10 million from $100 million the year before and cut funding for enrollment workers, called “navigators,” to $36 million from $63 million the year before.</p>
<p>More recently, the administration has supported a legal challenge, Texas v. United States, that could vacate the law entirely.</p>
<p>Such a decision would immediately affect the roughly 20 million Americans who have signed up for health coverage through programs created by the law. It would also threaten people who have coverage under the law for preexisting conditions — a politically explosive issue that helped Democrats win back a majority in the House of Representatives in the 2018 midterm elections.</p>
<p>In August 2018, the Labor Department issued a rule allowing consumers to purchase “junk plans” for up to a year, with options to extend up to three years.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s move to extend that coverage to up to three years led to a proliferation of online advertising for such plans, which were intended to be bought only for short periods of time, Mr. Casey said. Those ads now compete for space with the plans offered through the official government marketplace.</p>
<p>A 2018 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation found that expanding short-term plans could harm the Obamacare exchange, leading to higher premiums for the comprehensive plans and leaving more people uninsured.</p>
<p>Legislation supported by 44 Senate Democrats and the two Independents&nbsp;that caucus with Democrats would require the administration to withdraw the rule. It is unlikely to pass the Republican-controlled chamber.</p>
<p>The rise in short-term insurance plans have led to problems across Pennsylvania, said state Insurance Commissioner Jessica Altman, who joined the senators on Wednesday’s call.</p>
<p>The department has expended “significant energy into examining how companies selling these types of plans are advertising, representing and selling in Pennsylvania,” Ms. Altman said.&nbsp;“We have helped a number of consumers who felt stuck in plans that they never wanted in the first place and have had to take a number of enforcement actions against bad actors.”</p>
<p>Ms. Altman said one consumer complaint involved a $27,000 bill for a medical emergency the consumer was led to believe was covered by their plan.</p>
<p>“These plans are not a long-term alternative to comprehensive coverage,” Ms. Altman said. Consumers on skimpy plans “will run up against exclusions and limitations on coverage that, while making that sticker price more affordable, do so only as a trade-off for severe reductions in benefits and restricted access to care.”</p>
