<h1>Second Penn State fraternity is put on interim suspension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State University has put another fraternity on interim suspension, this time over alleged actions at an unregistered social event Jan. 30 “that potentially endangered students,” officials said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Office of Student Conduct on Penn State’s main University Park campus identified the organization as the Phi Rho chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon. The office gave no specifics about the event, but a statement from officials said there were “multiple allegations of serious misconduct made against the fraternity.”</p>
<p>Announcement of the Delta Kappa Epsilon suspension followed by three weeks the interim suspension of another fraternity, Alpha Epsilon Pi, involving a&nbsp;sexual assault alleged to have occurred Jan. 15 at the chapter house at 240 E. Prospect Ave. in State College.</p>
<p>In the latest case, officials said the interim suspension will proceed while the investigation of the Delta Kappa Epsilon case continues.</p>
<p>According to the university statement:</p>
<p>“Out of an abundance of caution for the safety and well-being of those associated with the chapter, the Office of Student Conduct is suspending all privileges otherwise accorded to recognized student organizations at Penn State, including membership recruitment, new member activities, participation in university-wide functions and hosting social events.”</p>
<p>The interim suspension is intended to minimize continuing risks while a full investigation is conducted</p>
<p>Lisa Powers, a&nbsp; spokeswoman for Penn State, was not immediately available for additional comment.</p>
<p>Penn State officials said Delta Kappa Epsilon’s national organization had already restricted the chapter’s activities for claims not related to the Jan. 30 incident. Officials said the national fraternity is cooperating with the investigation.</p>
<p>A call Tuesday to the fraternity’s national headquarters in Ann Arbor, Mich., was not&nbsp; returned.</p>
<p>In 2017, Penn State initiated the latest in a series of reforms involving Greek Life following incidents including the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2017/05/05/Charges-filed-Penn-State-frat-beta-theta-pi-piazza-manslaughter/stories/201705050180" target="_blank">death of</a>&nbsp;Timothy Piazza, 19, of Lebanon, N.J. The sophomore and Beta Theta Pi pledge was fatally injured that year during a hazing ritual involving alcohol, which led to criminal cases, lawsuits and a new Pennsylvania anti-hazing law.</p>
<p>The university in its statement asked that individuals who have information pertaining to this investigation to contact the university’s  <a href="https://studentaffairs.psu.edu/conduct" target="_blank">Office of Student Conduct.</a></p>
