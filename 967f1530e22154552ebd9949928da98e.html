<h1>Pittsburgh's Prime Stage Theatre gains new sensory inclusion status</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prime Stage Theatre is Pittsburgh’s first theater to receive Sensory Inclusive Certification by KultureCity, a global organization dedicated to&nbsp;“daily accessibility not limited by time and location.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>KultureCity has created more than 350 Sensory Inclusive venues and events in four countries, including the Super Bowl and the Major League Baseball All-Star Weekend. The nonprofit was named one of the world’s most innovative companies for 2019 by Fast Company.</p>
<p>In making the announcement Monday, Prime Stage explained that the process included staff training “by leading medical professionals through KultureCity on how to recognize those guests with sensory needs and how to handle a sensory overload situation.”</p>
<p>The tools of helping audience members with those needs include bags equipped with Puro Sound Labs’ noise-canceling headphones, fidget tools, verbal cue cards (produced in conjunction with Boardmaker) and weighted lap pads, now available to all Prime Stage attendees who feel overwhelmed by the environment.</p>
<p>“We are keenly aware of the power of theater to provide an opportunity for people on the autism spectrum and other disabilities to experience storytelling in an entertaining way, offering the opportunity to observe social communication and interaction and stimulate imagination.”said Wayne Brinda, producing artistic director, of Prime Stage, which focuses on adaptations that bring literary works to the stages.</p>
<p>Prime Stage’s next production, at the New Hazlett Theater, is “The Outsiders,” Christopher Sergel’s play based on the S.E. Hinton novel. Attending families with sensory needs can download the free KultureCity app to check on access, availability of resources and a checklist of what to expect at the theater company’s shows.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.kulturecity.org/our-story/" target="_blank">Dr. Julian Maha, co-founder of KultureCity, </a>said, “To know that you soon will be able to see families attend a live theater production, a true community-finding experience, with your loved ones who have a sensory challenge and who were not able to previously attend, is truly a heartwarming moment.”</p>
<p>The Snee-Reinhardt Charitable Foundation provided funding to allow Prime Stages to gain the certification.</p>
