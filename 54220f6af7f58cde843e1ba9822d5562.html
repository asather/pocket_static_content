<h1>With Tom Brady's exit, which team will take the AFC throne?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s the end of an era in New England, though some might argue that came on January 4, when the Tennessee Titans beat the Patriots in an AFC divisional round playoff game on their home field. If there was any remaining doubt, the final confirmation came Tuesday when six-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback Tom Brady announced his career with the Patriots was over.</p>
<p>The Patriots won six Super Bowls and appeared in nine over the past 19 years with Brady at the helm. He will sign with Tampa Bay in the NFC, much to the delight of every team in the AFC.</p>
<p>With Brady’s decision to leave New England, the balance of power in the conference shifted. Right now, the quarterback atop New England’s depth chart is Jarrett Stidham, a fourth-round pick last spring who has thrown a total of four passes in the NFL.</p>
<p>Patriots coach Bill Belichick is likely to add a veteran to the mix; former Bengals quarterback Andy Dalton has been mentioned among others.</p>
<p>Regardless, the Patriots won’t be the same. It’s a new era in the AFC, too, and teams are jockeying to grab control of power in the conference.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at how the AFC shapes up after the first wave of moves in free agency:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><em><strong>CO-FAVORITES</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Kansas City:</strong>&nbsp;Of course the Super Bowl champs are going to be atop the conference. The Chiefs were an offensive juggernaut in the playoffs, averaging 39 points per game. Patrick Mahomes put on a show, throwing 10 touchdowns and only two interceptions in three postseason games. And he has a bevy of playmakers returning in his supporting cast. What could slow them down in 2020? Well, slow starts plagued them throughout the playoffs. They had to overcome a 24-point deficit against Houston in the division round, a 10-point deficit against Tennessee in the conference title game and a 10-point fourth-quarter deficit against the 49ers in the Super Bowl. If not for some bone-headed decisions by Texans coach Bill O'Brien, we might still be talking about Andy Reid choking in the playoffs. The Chiefs definitely have the quarterback and talent to repeat, but they won’t be able to live as dangerously in do-or-die games.</p>
<p><strong>Baltimore:</strong>&nbsp;After winning 14 games during the regular season the Ravens were the top seed in the AFC playoffs. Behind MVP Lamar Jackson, they led the league in scoring with a whopping 33.2 points per game. Their downfall was their defense, and it was exposed by the Titans in the playoffs. Derrick Henry stomped all over the Ravens, running for 195 yards in a dominating 28-12 victory. It wasn’t just a problem in the playoff game. The Ravens gave up 4.4 yards per rush during the regular season. It didn’t hurt them because opponents couldn’t afford to run a lot, as they were constantly in catch-up mode while dealing with Jackson and the offense. The Ravens traded for Calais Campbell and signed Michael Brockers to bolster their defensive line. Whether that’s enough to get the Ravens over the top next season remains to be seen.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><em><strong>NEXT IN LINE</strong></em></span></p>
<p><strong>Tennessee:</strong>&nbsp;Why did the Titans choose Ryan Tannehill over Brady? Well, maybe his 2019 performance should not be overlooked. Sure, the Titans sneaked into the playoffs with a 9-7 record,&nbsp; but four of those losses came with Marcus Mariota as the starting quarterback. Once Tannehill took over, the Titans went 9-4 and reached the AFC title game. The Titans recognized his importance and signed him to a $118 million deal. They also placed the franchise tag on Henry, the second-team All-Pro who rushed for 1,540 yards during the regular season and another 446 in three playoff games. With Houston’s decision to trade All-Pro receiver DeAndre Hopkins, the Titans are now the favorites in the AFC South and appear poised to show their postseason run was not a fluke.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo:</strong>&nbsp;Just as the Titans are now the favorites in their division, the Bills will be looked at as the top dogs in the AFC East now that Brady is out of New England. Like the Ravens and Chiefs, the Bills have a young and productive quarterback playing on a rookie contract that has enabled the front office to build a contender in short order. The Bills have a rock-solid defense that ranked among the best in the NFL last season. This week they traded for receiver Stefon Diggs, who had back-to-back 1,000-yard seasons in his final two seasons with the Vikings. He’s another weapon for quarterback Josh Allen, who showed he can lead a team to the playoffs. Now he has to take the next step in his development and show he can make the Bills a Super Bowl contender.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong><em>WILD CARD CALIBER</em></strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Pittsburgh:</strong>&nbsp;The Steelers almost made the playoffs with fourth-string quarterback Devlin Hodges. If Ben Roethlisberger can return to form after elbow surgery, the Steelers should be in position to push the Ravens in the AFC North. The Steelers had one of the best defenses in the league last season and return all but one starter. A more balanced offense that doesn’t put as much pressure on Roethlisberger could be the ticket back to the playoffs.</p>
<p><strong>Indianapolis:</strong>&nbsp;It was a rough season for the Colts after they lost Andrew Luck to retirement only weeks before the season started. Jacoby Brissett stepped in and led the Colts to a 7-9 record, but they tumbled all the way to 25th in the league in total offense. Unhappy with the drop in production, the Colts signed Philip Rivers to a one-year contract in hopes he can boost the offense. The Colts have a strong offensive line and receiver T.Y. Hilton. In a weakened AFC South, Rivers can get the Colts back to the postseason.</p>
<p><strong>New England:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, Brady is gone, but who remembers 2008? After Brady was injured in the first game of the season, Matt Cassell took over and led the team to an 11-5 record. The Patriots didn’t make the playoffs — one of the few occasions in league history an 11-win team didn’t qualify for the postseason — but they remained competitive without their superstar quarterback. Belichick has a top-ranked defense to keep the Patriots competitive; how competitive will depend upon the quality of his quarterback play.</p>
