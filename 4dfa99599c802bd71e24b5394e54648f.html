<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Was Jack Johnson the worst signing in Penguins history?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Larry Murphy and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Quasar Funk, @FunkQuasar:</strong> Which Jack Johnson song title most accurately describes Jack Johnson’s career as a Penguin?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Interesting question, Dr. Funk, and before I answer, another springs to mind: Was Johnson the worst free-agent signing in Penguins history?</p>
<p>Ziggy Palffy (three years, $13.5 million) and Rob Scuderi 2.0 (four years, $13.5 million) would beg to differ, I’m sure, but Palffy actually wasn’t a horrible signing. He was a point-per-game guy before he abruptly quit — and let’s be honest, his parting words got him off the hook forever. Or should.</p>
<p>“One morning is more beautiful than the previous one, and you have other opinions,” Palffy said upon quitting. “At this point, I believe that I quit. Definitive. Already I do not want to travel anywhere. Did it enough.”</p>
<p>How can you blame a guy for that? The Penguins were off the hook for the rest of his money, too. Scuderi 2.0 was horrifying, to be sure, but Jim Rutherford miraculously got rid of that contract in the Trevor Daley deal.</p>
<p>Matt Hunwick and a few others might like a word here, but given the fact that the Ghost of Jack Johnson will remain on the books for six — SIX!— more years, his signing wins the prize:&nbsp;<em>Worst free-agent contract in Penguins history</em>.</p>
<p>We can’t even call it the end of an error, because the error lives on.</p>
<p>And here’s the thing: Plenty of people predicted this. It never made a shred of sense the Penguins would sign a 31-year-old, freshly scratched, underachieving, plodding defenseman to a five-year contract. Something seemed amiss.</p>
<p>Of course, you had people here who knew better consistently minimizing the damage.</p>
<p>“He’s only a third-pair defenseman,” they said, ignoring the fact that coaches live to torture such defensemen in playoff matchups (Exhibit A: Penguins vs. Capitals and Sharks in 2016).</p>
<p>“The Penguins have other problems,” they said.</p>
<p>“It’s not his fault,” they said.</p>
<p>Yes, well, let me refer to the website pensburgh.com for a stat that should tell you all you need to know about Johnson’s disastrous tenure here.</p>
<p>“In the two seasons Johnson played with the Pens … if a goal was scored while (he) was on the ice at 5v5, 55.6% of the time the opponent scored that goal. Remove just that one player and any time a goal was scored at 5v5 in the last two years there was a 55.9% chance the Penguins scored it. He was the one variable that turned the team from ‘incredibly good’ while he wasn’t on the ice into ‘disastrously bad’ when he was out there.”</p>
<p>How did Mike Sullivan feel? I learned all I needed to when he scratched Johnson for the playoff opener two years ago after Johnson played all 82 games. Can’t un-ring that bell. Maybe he shouldn’t have soured on Ian Cole.</p>
<p>And now we know how the organization at-large feels about Johnson the player (nobody would disagree that he’s a good dude): They are paying him millions to not play. Remember when Rutherford said he “knew” why the Columbus Blue Jackets scratched Johnson in the playoffs the year the Penguins signed him, intimating that it wasn’t because of his play?</p>
<p>It was because of his play.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> What about the guy’s question?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Sorry. Jack Johnson, noted American singer-songwriter, had at least two songs that speak to Jack Johnson’s tenure here …</p>
<p>“Sitting, Waiting, Wishing” — Penguins fans, for two years.</p>
<p>“Breakdown” — The Johnson-Schultz pairing against Montreal.</p>

<p><strong>steve robinson, @stevero44531796:</strong>&nbsp;Is there one free agent you would like to see the Penguins pursue?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> There are many, Mr. Robinson, but all of them require money, and it would appear the Penguins don’t have much to spare. Would it help ease your frustration if I told you they’ll pay the Ghost of Jack Johnson $1,166,667 million to not play for them this season?</p>
<p>Didn’t think so.</p>
<p><strong>Halvy Buckets, @halvybuckets:</strong> Is Narduzzi the man to get Pitt to 10 wins eventually?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Please define “eventually,” Mr. Halvy Buckets. The year 2040? So far, the Narduzzi era looks very much like the Walt Harris era and the Dave Wannstedt era. Which is to say, it features a record that hovers around .500 against major-college competition, give or take a few games, and a bunch of disappointing losses mixed with some memorable wins.</p>
<p>I happen to believe Pitt can do better, but the evidence over the past 37 years or so would indicate otherwise.</p>
<p>Very disappointing.</p>
<p><strong>Mike D, @TheRealMikeD3:</strong> Hey Joe, if you could trade for one player on each side of the football for the Steelers, without losing a starter or cap room, who would they be?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Offense — Dalvin Cook, to electrify the backfield.</p>
<p>Defense -- Tyrann Mathieu, to electrify the strong safety position.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. @TheRealMikeD3.</p>
<p><strong>MFH, @FakeHoltzy22:</strong> What would you name the @ThePoniExpress baby?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Carl.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Telek, @mktelek:</strong> Met a dog at the dog park named Jarry. Good dog name. Whats the best/worst dog names you’ve come across?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong></p>
<p>Best: Bailey (our dog).</p>
<p>Worst: Candy.</p>
<p><strong>Padraig Rodgers, @pmrodgersx:</strong> Joe. Excluding Cookie. Since moving to Pgh, who are or were your 5 favorite local sports columnists to read?</p>
<p>Starkey: I’ll give you two …</p>
<p>Gene Collier, Bruce Keidan — and here is Gene’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2010/12/02/Obituary-Bruce-Keidan-Brilliant-former-sports-editor-for-Post-Gazette/stories/201012020388" target="_blank">beautifully written obituary on Keidan</a>:</p>
<p><strong>Donald Hilenbrant, @Hildebeest24:</strong> Where will the Space Force football team play their home games?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Uranus is building a stadium, I hear, Donald, but if I’m looking at the roughest road environments, I would have to consider Venus, which, according to physicist Steve Tufte, has “conditions well-matched to Dante’s vision of hell.” That sounds almost as bad as earth in its current state.</p>
<p>Yes, I’m thinking eight home games on Venus and eight on Earth. But I wouldn’t count out Uranus, where temperatures can get as low as minus-224 Celsius.</p>
<p>And you thought the Ice Bowl was cold.</p>
<p><strong>Manko, @MikeDaFicus:</strong> Do you think you could beat Big Ben in a foot race on a good day?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not even close, Michael. He’s still a decent athlete. Did you see his run against the Giants?</p>
<p><strong>Zack Hough, @Hoagie7187:</strong> What do you think Pirates management can do to improve ratings?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Win.</p>
