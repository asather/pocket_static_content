<h1>Kyle DeGregorio expected to be new girls basketball coach at Pine-Richland</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kyle DeGregorio was let go as Baldwin High School’s girls basketball coach early last month, but he wasn’t long without a job.</p>
<p>DeGregorio is expected to be the new girls coach at Pine-Richland. The Post-Gazette has learned that DeGregorio was offered the job and accepted, but his hiring is not official until the Pine-Richland school board approves it at a meeting Monday.&nbsp;DeGregorio declined comment on the matter.</p>
<p>DeGregorio has been a coach for 37 years, including stints as the Baldwin boys and girls coach, and the Belle Vernon boys coach. He also was a head coach in Eastern Pennsylvania. He&nbsp;had been Baldwin’s girls coach the past two seasons and had turned around the Highlanders after they won only 12 games in the two previous seasons. Baldwin was 13-11 in 2019-20 and had almost its entire team back next season.</p>
<p>But the Baldwin school board opened DeGregorio’s position May 6, a move that shocked DeGregorio. He said he wasn’t given a reason for his dismissal, but DeGregorio, 60, said he wanted to coach again. The Pine-Richland job opened when Tom Reighard resigned after this past season.</p>
<p>DeGregorio is retiring later this month as a guidance counselor at Baldwin.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pine-Richland boys basketball position is still open. Jeff Ackermann resigned to become the Baldwin boys coach in May, and Pine-Richland athletic director Sean Simmons said the school board will most likely hire a boys coach later this month.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly in line for Penn-Trafford job</strong></p>
<p>In another WPIAL basketball coaching move, Doug Kelly is expected to be hired as Penn-Trafford’s boys coach. Kelly is the recommended candidate to the school board, but the board still has to approve his hiring later this month.</p>
<p>Kelly was a Penn-Trafford girls assistant coach this past season and before that spent time as a boys assistant under Jim Rocco, who resigned at the end of the season. But Kelly has head coaching experience. He was Franklin Regional’s coach for eight seasons (2002-10) and his 2008 team was 20-8 with a section championship.</p>
<p><strong>Southmoreland hires Cernuto</strong></p>
<p>Amber Cernuto is the new girls basketball coach at Southmoreland. She succeeds Brian Pritts, who resigned after leading the Scotties to the WPIAL Class 4A championship game this past season.</p>
<p>Cernuto was an assistant under Pritts from 2017-19. She is the mother of Olivia Cernuto, who was a standout freshman guard for the Scotties this past season.</p>
