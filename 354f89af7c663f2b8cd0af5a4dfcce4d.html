<h1>Clay Holmes hoping to capitalize on full health</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Strange as it sounds, the months-long layoff to the 2020 season may have been a blessing for Pirates reliever Clay Holmes.</p>
<p>Holmes suffered a fractured foot after being hit with a comebacker Feb. 29 in a spring training game against the Minnesota Twins. At the time, that seemed an extremely unfortunate event for Holmes, who was and is doing everything he can to make the Pirates’ opening day roster.</p>
<p>The time off, however, gave Holmes the opportunity to heal up before baseball returned for summer camp.</p>
<p>“For my foot health, it was good,” Holmes said. “I feel like, growing up, I’ve had a lot of broken bones. I’ve kind of dealt with it before. Time was definitely on my side this time. I didn’t really have to rush things. I got to work on some stuff I brought into spring training. It turned out to be a very positive thing for me.”</p>
<p>The bones Holmes referenced, he said, stem from growing up with two brothers. He said he broke wrists twice and his leg once. Now, his foot can be added to that list.</p>
<p>Truly, though, the other side of Holmes’ time off is just as important. While his fellow pitchers were spending the time off working on specific improvements and maintaining any momentum gained during spring training, Holmes couldn’t afford to miss out on his own chance to do the same.</p>
<p>So Holmes did his best to mitigate the time lost, working with bullpen coach Justin Meccage while rehabbing at Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p>“Maybe a week in, I started doing some throwing just on my knees, kind of without my feet. Then when I was able to put some pressure on my foot, I was doing some throwing in a boot. Just enough to keep my arm in shape, so on the back end it didn’t take as long coming back,” Holmes said.</p>
<p>“… I feel like we got some really quality work in. There were some things I was trying to accomplish within my delivery, specifically with my back foot, in spring training. It just gave me a chance to put even more focus on it and hammer some things out. I think I got a lot of good work and positive things from it.”</p>
<p>If Friday’s intrasquad scrimmage was any indication, his progress has been strong. He pitched one inning, striking out catcher Luke Maile and shortstop Kevin Newman before forcing left fielder Bryan Reynolds to ground out to first base.</p>

<p>“That was really good to see,” manager Derek Shelton said Friday. “I think he threw 10 or 11 pitches. The slider was really, really good. He was one of the guys I was sitting behind the plate on, and just watching the action on it, that was good to see. I mean, coming off the injury he had in spring training and working as hard as he did to get back, to see that inning today, that’s a positive step in the right direction.”</p>
<p><strong>Socrates Brito returns after positive COVID-19 test<br></strong></p>
<p>Though there may have been more positive COVID-19 tests among Pirates players and staff, just two players have given consent to publicize their positive results: right-handed reliever Blake Cederlind and outfielder Socrates Brito.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Brito returned to his team at PNC Park for summer camp, participating in drills and batting practice before sitting out the intrasquad scrimmage to end the night.</p>
<p>“We’ll work him back in gradually,” Shelton said. “You probably won’t see him in a game — or what we’re doing as a game — for a few days, just to get him back. We’ll let our medical guys assess him, see how he feels, see how he feels tomorrow after moving around because he’s been sitting in a hotel room. Just slowly. Nothing that we would risk some sort of other injury with him coming back, just see where his body is at.”</p>
<p>The Pirates now have five outfielders at PNC Park: Brito, Reynolds, Jarrod Dyson, Guillermo Heredia and Gregory Polanco.</p>
