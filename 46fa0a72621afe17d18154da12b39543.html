<h1>Jason Zucker fits 'identity' that Mike Sullivan has forged with Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Throughout the course of a hockey season, Penguins coach Mike Sullivan is in constant communication with general manager Jim Rutherford and the front office in an attempt to answer one question.</p>
<p>“How can we get better?” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>As an injury-plagued 2019-20 season unfolded, that question began to answer itself.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/10/Alex-Galchenyuk-trade-Jason-Zucker-Phil-Kessel-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Minnesota-Wild/stories/202002100144" target="_blank">Alex Galchenyuk experiment failed</a> — and failed quite miserably — eliminating what was supposed to be a left winger who could play in the top-six. Then Jake Guentzel <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/31/jake-guentzel-shoulder-injury-penguins-news/stories/201912310095" target="_blank">collided violently with the boards and underwent surgery</a> that will end his regular season, wiping out another top-six winger and leaving Sidney Crosby without a linemate. Now, with Dominik Kahun still recovering from a concussion he suffered about three weeks ago, the Penguins were without three players who looked like top-six options at the beginning of the season.</p>
<p>The need became obvious. The Penguins could use a top-six forward, preferably one who could play on the left wing and help fill the void created by Guentzel’s absence.</p>
<p>On Monday, Rutherford pulled the trigger. He acquired Minnesota Wild winger Jason Zucker in exchange for a package featuring blue-line prospect Calen Addison, a conditional 2020 first-round pick and Galchenyuk. Zucker is signed through the 2022-23 season on a deal that carries a $5.5 million average annual value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re thrilled to have Jason,” Sullivan said. “We really think he’s going to make us a better team.”</p>
<p>When Sullivan spoke with reporters about the trade Tuesday afternoon, it became clear this deal was about more than just getting any player. It was about getting a very specific type of player, with the style and makeup to play the Penguins’ brand of hockey.</p>
<p>“Whenever we’re talking about adding players to the existing group, we always have the conversation around the style of play that we’re trying to play, the identity of this team and how a player can fit in and help us to play to that identify,” Sullivan said. “When you look at a player like Jason and the attributes that he brings, we believe that he can fit in and play to this identity.</p>
<p>“He brings a speed game. He brings an offensive dimension. He’s got a defensive conscience as well. He’s a versatile player. He’s a competitive guy. We think he has a lot of attributes that we value in our players.”</p>
<p>Rutherford told the Post-Gazette on Monday night that the Penguins have been interested in Zucker for about three years. As recently as last summer, they had a deal in place to bring him to Pittsburgh before Phil Kessel nixed it as a part of his partial no-trade clause.</p>
<p>It’s clear why the Penguins coveted the scoring wing. At 28, he’s an offensive weapon who as recently as 2017-18 scored 33 goals in a season. With 14 goals this season, he’s just six away from becoming a 20-goal scorer for the fifth time in the last six seasons.</p>
<p>Sullivan said he anticipated Zucker would be available for Tuesday night’s game against the Tampa Bay Lightning. He’s slated to begin the game playing on Crosby’s line. Eventually, Zucker will contribute on one of the Penguins’ two power play units; however, Sullivan said there will be a “feeling-out” process before the staff throws everything at him.</p>
<p>“Obviously, this is a guy that is a top-six forward that has real good offensive instincts and an ability to score goals,” Sullivan said. “We’re going to try to put him in positions where he can play to his strengths.”</p>
<p>The move will likely have a ripple effect on the Penguins forward group, adding depth, quality and versatility. In the short term, that should give the Penguins some lineup options, specifically when it comes to a player such as Jared McCann.</p>
<p>When the Penguins suffered numerous injuries at the center-ice position earlier this year, McCann skated the bulk of this season at center, a position he played virtually his entire life before coming to Pittsburgh. But the team’s hands were somewhat tied when Guentzel went down, and McCann became the next obvious option to play left wing.</p>
<p>Now, with a scoring left winger in the fold, the Penguins should at least have the option of playing McCann at center when Kahun returns from his concussion.</p>
<p>“Depending on the health of our group and who starts to come into our lineup, it may provide an opportunity for us to use Jared McCann in different capacities,” Sullivan said. “We have some ideas on what that might look like. But having said that, we’re going to watch and see how the team plays and we’ll try to utilize the players accordingly based on what we have and how the team is playing at the time.”</p>
<p>In the longer term, when Guentzel returns from injury — which might not be until next season — the Penguins believe they will have a pair of top-six caliber left wingers. One to play with Crosby. One to play with Evgeni Malkin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what looked like such a glaring hole just a few weeks ago seems to be a growing strength next season and beyond.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about the group that we have,” Sullivan said. “Now we have to go out and earn it each and every night. We’ve got to make sure that we play to the identity that we’ve established this year, for this team and specifically how we have to play to give us the best chance to win each and every night.”</p>
