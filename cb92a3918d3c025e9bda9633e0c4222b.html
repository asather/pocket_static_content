<h1>Man accused of killing woman in Nevada desert waives Pittsburgh hearing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Maryland man accused of killing a Bethel Park woman in the Nevada desert appeared briefly in federal court in Pittsburgh on Monday and will be sent to Nevada to be prosecuted.</p>
<p>The FBI and Bethel Park Police allege that John Matthew Chapman, 39, kidnapped Jaime Feden, drove her into the desert outside of Las Vegas, tied her to a post and left her to die.</p>
<p>Chapman was being held in the Allegheny County Jail on state charges, but federal prosecutors in Nevada filed a complaint against him last month charging him with kidnapping resulting in death.</p>
<p>Typically in such cases, a federal grand jury will bring an indictment within the next few weeks. The case will play out in Las Vegas federal court.</p>
<p>Chapman, who has a prior federal record in Pittsburgh for wire fraud, lied to Ms. Feden by telling her that a trip to Las Vegas in September was a vacation with the possibility of buying a house, according to the U.S. attorney's office in Las Vegas. Prosecutors said he led her to believe she was his girlfriend but planned to kill her before they left Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>They arrived in Las Vegas on Sept. 23. Two days later, Chapman convinced Ms. Feden to drive into the desert on the pretext of engaging in a bondage-themed photo shoot, authorities said.</p>
<p>In Lincoln County, Nev., he bound her hands and feet with zip ties and tied her to a signpost, then covered her mouth and nose with duct tape until she couldn't breathe, according to the FBI. After she was dead, he returned to Bethel Park, lived in her house and posed as her on Facebook Messenger.</p>
<p>He waived a detention hearing Monday before a federal magistrate judge, who transferred the case to Nevada.</p>
