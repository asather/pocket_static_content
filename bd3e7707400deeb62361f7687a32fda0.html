<h1>Pirates' Kevin Kramer out 4-6 months after hip surgery</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates announced Wednesday that 26-year-old outfielder Kevin Kramer underwent surgery on his right hip last week, which will keep him out four to six months.</p>
<p>The surgery, performed by Dr. Marc Philippon in Colorado, was a labral repair to “address&nbsp;recent and chronic symptoms that prohibited Kramer from continuing his training in preparation for the 2020 season,” according to the Pirates.</p>
<p>Kramer played in spurts with the Pirates in both 2018 and 2019 and struggled to gain traction in the batter’s box. In 79 at-bats, he hit just .152 with 10 RBIs over the span of 43 games. His ability to play multiple outfield positions as well as second base, however, did make Kramer valuable when he was on the big-league roster.</p>
<p>Kramer, the Pirates’ 2015 second-round pick, did prove himself in Class AAA Indianapolis last year, hitting .260 and finishing second on the team with 54 RBIs over 113 games.</p>
<p>Because of that track record, along with the likelihood of an expanded roster for the 2020 season, Kramer seemed a possible candidate to play for the Pirates. Nobody can say for certain what his opportunities would look like in the delayed, shortened season, but any opportunity would have given Kramer a chance to put the offensive struggles from the last two years behind him. Now, the prospects of that are grim.</p>
<p>The silver lining for Kramer, if there is one, is that a delayed 2020 season could run into September, which would theoretically give him a chance to get healthy again by the end, if everything goes perfectly and he and the Pirates deem it necessary. Still, this certainly complicates any plans Kramer had to establish himself in the big leagues, as he will now have to focus on getting back to full health before he can get back to baseball.</p>
