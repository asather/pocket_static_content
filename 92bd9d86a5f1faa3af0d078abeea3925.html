<h1>Judge Tranquilli argues he should not have been suspended without pay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark V. Tranquilli asked the Court of Judicial Discipline to reverse its order suspending him without pay, arguing the decision was made without due process.</p>
<p>In a filing dated Sept. 3, Judge Tranquilli’s attorney argued the suspension was done&nbsp;“without any argument, hearing, briefing” and that the court’s only evidence against the judge was a complaint from the Judicial Conduct Board.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/06/Allegheny-County-Common-Pleas-Judge-Mark-Tranquilli-racist-remarks-forbidden-hearing-cases/stories/202002060120" target="_blank">reassigned to administrative duties</a> in February after multiple allegations of misconduct, including making racist statements about a juror.</p>
<p>Following an investigation into those comments, the Judicial Conduct Board filed a complaint against him to the Court of Judicial Discipline and requested he be suspended, otherwise&nbsp;“the public’s confidence in the judiciary will continue to erode.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli’s attorney disagreed. The February reassignment “properly safeguarded the integrity of the judicial system and would continue to do so” while the judge was on trial at the Court of Judicial Discipline.</p>
<p>Since that reassignment kept the judge from hearing cases, the judiciary’s integrity was not and would not be compromised, the attorney argued in the latest filing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The court’s decision to suspend without pay also has caused&nbsp;“significant hardship” on the judge as&nbsp;“his salary and benefits were (and are) the only source of income and health insurance for himself and his children.”</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli’s annual salary is $186,665.</p>
<p>The suspension “deviated starkly” from the court’s prior actions in similar circumstances and deprived Judge Tranquilli of due process, according to the filing, signed by attorney John E. Quinn. He pointed to two other cases where suspension without pay was ordered; both of those cases allowed judges to retain their health benefits.</p>
<p>Mr. Quinn also requested an evidentiary hearing and oral argument.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli’s conduct <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/03/08/Allegations-of-racism-put-Judge-Mark-V-Tranquilli-under-scrutiny/stories/202003040183" target="_blank">came under scrutiny</a> earlier this year when he was accused of calling a juror&nbsp;“Aunt Jemima” during a discussion with a prosecutor and defense attorney.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The judge has disputed that characterization of the conversation, claiming that he made a reference to “the juror with the Aunt Jemima on her head” because he could neither remember her juror number nor the word&nbsp;“kerchief.”</p>
<p>He also told the prosecutor that he knew when she&nbsp;“goes home to her baby daddy, he’s probably slinging heroin, too.” He called that remark&nbsp;an “insensitive attempt to make a possible explanation” for the juror’s “perceived hostility” after she seemed to glare at the prosecutor in a drug case.</p>
<p>“In retrospect, my words were pejorative and offensive — in any context,” he wrote in a letter to his colleagues. “I should have known better. I should have done better. I am truly sorry I said them and for the harm my words caused.”</p>
<p>His apology also said that he “was physically, intellectually and emotionally spent” following three back-to-back jury trials in one month.</p>
<p>Other accusations against the judge included a number of alleged off-color remarks including calling another juror a&nbsp;“knucklehead,” speaking in ebonics and telling a female defendant that&nbsp;“for the cost of three shiny quarters in any bathroom in any rest stop in Pennsylvania” she could have avoided having children out of wedlock.</p>
<p>His trial at the Court of Judicial Discipline is set for Oct. 5.</p>
