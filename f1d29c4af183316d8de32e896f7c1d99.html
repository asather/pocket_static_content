<p><em><strong>This story will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p>Schools in two local districts have been closed Thursday out of concerns over possible exposure to COVID-19 by students.</p>
<p>At the same time, two more Pittsburgh universities have announced they are moving classes online in an attempt to limit the spread of the pandemic known as coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Colfax K-8 was closed Thursday after the Pittsburgh Public Schools learned a student may have been exposed to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The school in Squirrel Hill will remain closed Thursday&nbsp;“out of an abundance of caution” while it is cleaned using an electrostatic machine — which uses disinfectant across&nbsp;large areas —&nbsp;according to a statement from district spokeswoman Ebony Pugh.</p>
<p>The student might have been exposed to the virus through a relative outside of school, district officials said.</p>
<p>“Please note there are no confirmed cases in Allegheny County,” Ms. Pugh said in a statement.&nbsp;“The district will receive additional guidance from the Allegheny County Health Department regarding the opening of school.”</p>
<p><strong>WOODLAND HILLS SCHOOL DISTRICT</strong></p>
<p>Also Thursday, the Woodland Hills School District announced the closure of the Intermediate School because of a student’s interaction with a staff member of Colfax.</p>
<p>The closure was “an over abundance of caution,” the Woodland Hills district said, and there were no presumptive cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The district said the school building will be disinfected Thursday.</p>
<p>The Intermediate School is expected to resume as normal on Monday.</p>
<p>In addition to the city and Woodland Hills school closures, hundreds of college students across the state and beyond are moving from classrooms to remote instruction as officials scramble to slow the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p><strong>CARLOW UNIVERSITY</strong></p>
<p>In a statement released Thursday, Carlow University announced classes will be taken online or alternatively&nbsp;for the remainder of the spring term. Face-to-face courses are being postponed by one week to allow school officials time to finalize plans with faculty for online and alternative methods moving forward.</p>

<p>Classes will resume March 23 in their new format, according to Drew Wilson, a spokesman for the university.&nbsp;Students currently enrolled in online courses will resume class as scheduled March 16.</p>
<p>“At this point in time, the residence halls will remain open, and the regularly scheduled athletic events will continue following the guidelines of the NAIA,” Mr. Wilson said in a statement.&nbsp;Attendance policies will be lenient this term, university officials said.</p>
<p><strong>POINT PARK UNIVERSITY</strong></p>
<p>Point Park University on Thursday canceled classes for Friday through Tuesday and will resume next Wednesday with instruction delivered online or remotely, the latest in a flury of Pittsburgh-area campuses to rethink face-to-face instruction amid COVID-19 fears.</p>
<p>“Faculty will receive further instructions and guidance from Provost John Pearson and his team later today. Students will receive information from their faculty,” a mid-morning statement from the university said. “ For those students involved in internship, cooperative education and student teaching, please adhere to schedules provided at your placement sites.”</p>
<p>A decision on commencement activities will be determined at a later date, it added.</p>
<p>The Downtown university has about 4,000 undergraduate and graduate students. Classes resumed after spring break on March 2.</p>
<p>“The residence halls will remain open to students. Students will also have access to dining services, libraries and campus facilities,” the statement continued. “The University will continue evaluating this situation as it develops in relation to University operations and facilities.”</p>
<p>Performances at the Point Park Playhouse will be reviewed daily and on a case-by-case basis. Point Park said it has been in communication with local arts organizations and will continue to follow best practices. The production of “Pippin” will continue as scheduled.</p>
<p><strong>OTHERS</strong></p>
<p>On Wednesday, the University of Pittsburgh, Penn State University, Carnegie Mellon University and Duquesne University joined several State System of Higher Education schools including Edinboro and Slippery rock universities in move to remote instruction. The president of one of those campuses, West Chester, said a campus survey of how many students were traveling for spring break — hundreds from abroad and many more on mass transit and cruises — factored into the decision.</p>
