<p>The 26-year-old man who was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/04/10/Man-26-shot-and-killed-in-New-Castle-Santiago-Hernandez/stories/202004100102" target="_blank">gunned down last week in New Castle</a> was killed after a dispute over cigarettes between his wife and another man, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Police said Juan Aviles Suarez, 33, shot Eiram Alfonso Santiago-Hernandez last Thursday evening during an argument near the accused shooter’s apartment in the 1100 block of Pin Oak Drive in the Oak Leaf Gardens housing complex.</p>
<p>Mr. Suarez turned himself in and was arraigned Monday afternoon on one count of homicide, according to New Castle police, who had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/04/12/New-Castle-PA-shooting-Pin-Oak-Drive-police-charge-Juan-Aviles-Suarez-homicide/stories/202004120122" target="_blank">obtained a warrant for his arrest</a> on Friday, the day after the homicide.</p>
<p>Police responded to the complex in response to calls for multiple shots fired around 7:48 p.m. Thursday.</p>
<p>They passed a car speeding in the opposite direction, as the driver flashed the lights and honked the horn. Police figured that a shooting victim might be in the car, and they were right. They gave the car an escort to UPMC Jameson, where Mr. Santiago-Hernandez died.</p>
<p>Police and security at the housing complex reviewed video, which showed an argument between two men outside the victim’s apartment and then the shooting, police said. The video showed a muzzle blast and a plume of smoke, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>A security officer told police that he recognized the shooter as Mr. Suarez.</p>
<p>The victim’s wife, Franchaly Shymko, said problems started when she was attending a birthday party near Mr. Suarez’s house. She started to argue about cigarettes with Mr. Suarez, whom she knew only as&nbsp;“Finito,” and she called her husband, who was at work, the complaint said.</p>
<p>When Mr. Santiago-Hernandez got home, he got into an argument with Mr. Suarez outside 1105 Pin Oak Drive, just down from Mr. Suarez’s apartment, police said.</p>
<p>Ms. Shymko told police she tried to separate the men, but Mr. Suarez pulled a gun and shot her husband, according to the complaint. He then ran away.</p>
<p>Two men helped Ms. Shymko get her husband into a car and drove to the hospital.</p>
<p>Before leaving the scene, though, one of the men — Ramon Luis Ramos Vasquez — grabbed the victim’s handgun and chased Mr. Suarez, firing several times, according to police.</p>
