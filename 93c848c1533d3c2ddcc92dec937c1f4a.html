<h1>Pitt coaches, pro sports teams donate $800,000 to Center for Vaccine Research</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt athletics’ leaders, along with the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, have linked up to financially support the university’s Center for Vaccine Research, which is working to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The families of Pitt football coach Pat Narduzzi, men’s basketball coach Jeff Capel, women’s basketball coach Lance White and athletic director Heather Lyke made a combined $500,000 donation to Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research, the university announced Wednesday morning. The Steelers, Penguins and Pirates each donated $100,000, as well, for a grand total of $800,000.</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Duprex, the vaccine center’s director, said those at CVR are “stunned” by the support and generosity Pitt’s leaders and the city’s three major pro teams have provided over the past few months and specifically with the donation. In a statement, Duprex — as well as Lyke and Pitt’s coaches — referenced Jonas Salk, who created the polio vaccine while working with Pitt’s School of Medicine in the 1940s and ‘50s.</p>
<p>“Nothing great is ever achieved alone,” Lyke said in a statement. “Pitt athletics is honored to join forces with the Penguins, Pirates and Steelers in support of the Center for Vaccine Research and its extraordinary researchers. April marked the 65th anniversary of Dr. Jonas Salk’s victory over polio and it is apparent that funding for vaccine research remains as crucial as ever.”</p>
<p>“The University of Pittsburgh is a remarkable place with so many people doing life-changing work right here on our campus,” Narduzzi added. “We’re facing this challenge together, and we will only overcome it by working together. My wife Donna and I are honored to support Pitt’s scientists, and we can’t wait to yell ‘Hail to Pitt!’ when they achieve victory with a vaccine.”</p>
