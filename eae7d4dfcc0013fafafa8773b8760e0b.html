<h1>Traffic pattern to change on Pittsburgh’s Second Avenue for Parkway East wall work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Second Avenue will have a different traffic pattern between the Armstrong Tunnel and Brady Street for the next eight months while crews rebuild retaining walls supporting the Parkway East.</p>
<p>The city’s&nbsp;Department of Mobility and Infrastructure said Thursday that beginning Sunday the inbound lane of Second Avenue will be closed and traffic will travel in both directions on what is now the outbound side.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The closure will allow crews from Joseph B. Fay Co. to rehabilitate two sections of the retaining wall. The company has a $7.2 million contract with the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation for the work.</p>
<p>PennDOT said the project will involve&nbsp;installing solider pile and lagging walls in front of the existing retaining walls in two locations. The first location is about 1,400 feet long and begins just east of the Philip Murray (10th Street) Bridge along Second Avenue and the second is about 600 feet long along the Eliza Furnace Trail between the Boulevard of the Allies and Bates Street.</p>
<p>Part of the work also will include repaving the trail in the area where the wall work occurs. The trail will remain open throughout the project, which should be finished by December.</p>
