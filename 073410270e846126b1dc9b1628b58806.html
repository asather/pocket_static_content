<h1>Brian O'Neill: Lake Elizabeth is all muck and no luck </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s a biennial rite of spring on the North Side: Volunteers are recruited to scrape and shovel dried algae, litter, goose droppings and other goo from drained Lake Elizabeth, because the city hasn’t lived up to its promise to aerate the water.</p>
<p>Festive? No, fetid.</p>
<p>This draining experience has too long a history, which I’ll get to, but it’s emblematic of a city that often talks Big Picture but neglects too many little things. Thus a walk in the park becomes a reason to scream. Or to be glad masks are handy to stem the smell.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Erin Tobin of the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy managed to get more than 50 volunteers to scrape up 328 bags of muck on the blistering hot Saturday of Memorial Day weekend. The city hauled that away and refilled the cement pond in Allegheny Commons Park with an estimated 1.3 million gallons of water last June 14.</p>
<p>Tim McNulty, spokesman for Mayor Bill Peduto, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/brian-oneill/2018/06/24/Pittsburgh-Lake-Elizabeth-Allegheny-Commons-Park-koi/stories/201806240031" target="_blank">promised</a>&nbsp;then that aerators would be installed so the algae did not return. The Public Works Department needed only to figure out the safest way to provide electric power, Mr. McNulty said.</p>
<p>This wasn’t President John F. Kennedy declaring late in 1962 that “<a href="https://spacecenter.org/exhibits-and-experiences/starship-gallery/kennedy-podium/" target="_blank">we choose to go to the moon</a>&nbsp;in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard.” (Apollo 11 did the hard thing less than seven years later.) This was something as easy as installing aerators, but that never happened.</p>
<p>Ms. Tobin announced nine days ago on the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AlleghenyCommonsInitiative/?__tn__=kC-R&amp;eid=ARCk9iaHDENBnIt3iPe-4DWmhtLYfUDk9N9by2EKsoDIjre1pLSKr5rsbwLd59QeqX825NvN5-axv_KG&amp;hc_ref=ARS7JZtoi84XvJBtIBwUE9NtPvtmBk1rNCRQVGrrmRRlY6xjjLhD5X8yh3F46HAyPCs&amp;fref=nf&amp;__xts__[0]=68.ARA7AlzeV9KMC-hmkACdW62mhdcUSY3RWfPrPsNcY6hHnxj_MvmJmXUEkcRDIOaJiY1D8DLpvWxBblGFUOxmqgDQx6f2hr6aMcReE-GumzV2kUR6cZL0WnE96Bq6oyfrqzRZK8w4RswiawN5JP9h7b8NF-AFDf6E0U-LKcSPhFx8bUThjhNxFfKHi24Qoo8r_u2riQPyYAGwPCr0pffJncPxryvNOEgMe78x5O9AqWKOdrHVbGotH9mC66L1DnGTFrE1G38Wi_AoFmcG-l4g1S87rVBRVHCJOIUWhHzY_042jkFCrFZBv4Pr1PHk_wsdZ2hdKv0W4YuzWJeXoBfgrO7ZHQ" target="_blank">Allegheny Commons Park Facebook</a>&nbsp;page that the city would be draining the lake and, when it dried out enough, she’d coordinate another cleanup — during a pandemic.&nbsp;“Social distancing&nbsp;and all the proper safety measures” will be shared at the events next Tuesday, June 23, and Thursday, June 25.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tom Little, of the Mexican War Streets, who walks his 12-year-old mutt, Shadow, past the lake most mornings, rescued 30 or 40 goldfish from the lake’s remaining puddles last week, putting most of the fish in <a href="https://www.facebook.com/tom.little.7902/videos/10214886277585263/?__tn__=%2CdC-R-R&amp;eid=ARAp7xrHnG2h0vIptkEieoTFQiye1M6pYs22clBXlWnXN2a9f6NVj7WYh6k_ml-BirqQTjTTYxPEOk3j&amp;hc_ref=ARQ2eKdquooinOBWEEDFJalk9BWBLPqDBF3GE-Gh9RATqnGHVbkMp00onCECn5CXUQ0&amp;fref=nf" target="_blank">his backyard pond</a> and giving a handful away. Lauren Eyth, of Observatory Hill, had done much the same two years ago, with about 100 of her rescues finding homes all over Pittsburgh, leaving her&nbsp;“with all the ugly ones.” She dumped those fish back in the lake when it was refilled, but most of them and their descendants died ugly last week.</p>
<p>It shouldn’t be this way. The problem could have been solved in 2015 by the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority with $21,000 for a new aeration system. The lake was leaking then, turning over 62 times in five months, and the authority said it would begin selling — rather than giving — its water to the city.</p>
<p>Park regulars endured a dry lake from the spring of 2015 until midsummer 2016, when the city Department of Public Works plugged the leak. But when the Allegheny Commons Initiative critiqued the design of a proposed aerator that would shoot water into the air, the punishment for such cheek was getting no aerator it all. The aerators were installed in Lake Carnegie in Highland Park.</p>
<p>Tom Barbush, of Allegheny West, recently complained to the parks conservancy that parks in the East End seem to get first-rate attention while North Side parks get second- and third-rate care. Walking past an ex-lake on some of the most beautiful days of the year only reinforces that conclusion.</p>
<p>Public Works Director Mike Gable said the real capital issue is not aerators; it’s getting a power source to the lake and also housing protection for the aerators’ pumps, motors and tubing. Mr. McNulty, of the mayor’s office and a North Sider himself, said those power sources would support conservancy plans to improve lighting on that side of the park. In the interim, the algae has been treated “with an environmentally friendly” <a href="https://cwsnaturally.com/" target="_blank">moss product</a>&nbsp;that costs $2,600 a month (and is evidently no match for what Canada geese leave behind).&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lake is so shallow and ravaged by nature, Mr. McNulty said, it would have to be drained every year even with aerators.</p>
<p>Well, there’s a way to find that out for sure. When I asked Mr. McNulty if he could name another lake in the city in this situation, he said Lake Carnegie is also regularly cleaned, but allowed that’s “from the shoreline and from a boat.”</p>
<p>City voters narrowly approved a parks referendum in November that will raise property taxes by a half-mill. That’s another $50 to the tax bill for every $100,000 in property value, which would raise $10 million a year to support improvements and maintenance in parks. When that would be levied is uncertain because City Council hasn’t passed the enabling legislation to divvy up the money yet.</p>
<p>Meantime, volunteers will assembling at Lake Elizabeth again next <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/309952590008579/" target="_blank">Tuesday and Thursday</a>&nbsp;morning. BYO tools, gloves and masks. The muck stops there.</p>
