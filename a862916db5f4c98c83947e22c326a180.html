<h1>Sweat Equity: During COVID-19, Boom Concepts takes it to the streets (and sidewalls)</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before COVID-19 turned most people into involuntary shut-ins, visits to art galleries weren’t all that unusual. That isn’t to say that most galleries ever achieve the popularity of an arcade or pizza parlor, but an art space with a good reputation can count on regular foot traffic, neighborhood respect, and enough patrons and foundation support to keep the lights on.</p>
<p>At Boom Concepts,&nbsp;a Garfield-based art gallery founded five years ago by Darrell S. Kinsel and Thomas Agnew, the mission has always been a seamless blend of artistic mentorship and economic self-sufficiency.</p>
<p>“Boom Concepts is a workspace and incubation hub that is drilling down and centering on black and brown practitioners — including folks across identities from that starting point,” Mr. Kinsel said, emphasizing its mentorship of LGBTQ artists, femmes and others.</p>
<p>The gallery, which has an operating budget of under $200,000 a year, employs four staff members and typically contracts between 30 and 60 artists a year for performances, youth outreach, exhibitions and public art opportunities.</p>
<p>Typically, Boom uses its gallery space and storefront to incubate new talent and train artists in skills that will help them reach their goals. But when the gallery setting goes away because it is deemed “nonessential” by the government during a pandemic, what to do?</p>
<p>In the case of Boom Concepts, an alternative to going dark for months was already happening by the time the coronavirus arrived.</p>
<p>In nearby Bloomfield, “Sidewall,” a 5-year-old privately run public art project on the side of a private residence at 608 S. Millvale Ave., had arranged for Boom Concepts to curate the murals that would adorn its exterior wall for 2020.</p>
<p>“Two years ago, [Sidewall] was opened to guest curatorship,” Mr. Kinsel said. “Last year was the first year of the guest curatorship.” The first year featured the yearlong project by the #NotWhite Collective called “Manifesto Project II.”</p>
<p>Because Mr. Kinsel had exhibited at the space three years ago, Sidewall’s Ashley Brickman asked if the gallery&nbsp;would be interested in taking over the second year of its guest curatorship.</p>
<p>“It was the perfect fit,” Mr. Kinsel said. Boom Concepts would be responsible for programming an 8- by 6-foot framed billboard on the side of the house. He put out a call to artists to submit proposals for consideration.</p>
<p>Instead of imposing pressure to come up with new work, he asked the artists to submit work that already existed. It would have to be reproduced as a foam core digital print that could resist the elements and fit the space.</p>
<p>Boom Concepts selected three artists to start the year. First up in mid-January was Sakony Burton of Desir USA. Mr. Burton is a Pittsburgh-based graphic designer. His piece “Nothing Lost To Father Time” has been on display on the wall since the lockdown. It is coming down this weekend.</p>
<p>It will be replaced by Jameelah Platt’s gestural figurative painting “We bloom in September,” a playful exploration of vibrant color and visual narrative.</p>
<p>In either 30 or 60 days, Ms. Platt’s mural will be replaced by Takara Canty’s “Oshun,” a colorful portrait of someone seemingly occupying several planes of existence at once.</p>
<p>The shift to an exterior exhibit space is a boon for Boom Concepts because the gallery is closed for now, but it keeps some art visible to the public in a responsible socially distant way. People walk by the murals and get a taste for what Boom Concepts is about.</p>
<p>“This partnership grew out of an authentic relationship,” said Mr. Kinsel, who lives in Garfield with his wife and child.</p>
<p>He’s pleased with the collaboration. “Public art is such an important part of city life and to have a chance to present work in that space is great.”</p>
<p>Because COVID-19 upset everyone’s best-laid plans, Boom will not be programming 12 artists but expects to exhibit at least eight. Mr. Kinsel and his collaborators are still selecting artists for the remaining months.</p>
<p>“Public art is us being really flexible about how we grow our portfolio and support artists,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Boom Concepts is providing a very modest stipend to the artists who will be on display. Like most galleries in the city, it hasn’t made any sales during the lockdown.</p>
<p>“We keep the lights on through diverse funding streams that include philanthropic partners, individual donors, art sales, rentals and partner contracts,” the 35-year-old Hill District native said.&nbsp;“It also takes a little bit of magic to keep everything going.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has also injected the entire art scene with a dose of realism about the future, especially when it comes to funding and selecting projects and exhibits. How does one make art usually centered in a gallery accessible when galleries are ordered closed? Is a new paradigm for display needed that brings art outdoors more often, but not necessarily as a mural?</p>
<p>“We are changing how Boom operates and how we serve artists, to ensure we are thriving in the next five years,” Mr. Kinsel said.&nbsp;“We want to continue to be agile and always center blackness at the space and in our productions as a guiding principle. Our big challenge is to adjust to programs that do not involve as much live audience interaction.</p>
<p>“Our team also wants to respond to see where artists and creative entrepreneurs need support. Everyone’s big challenge during the COVID-19 crisis is to stay healthy, wealthy and wise.”</p>
