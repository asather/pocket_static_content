<p>There are 1,145 new confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 63 new deaths in Pennsylvania, according to the latest statewide data released Wednesday.</p>
<p>With the new cases, the state has a total of 26,490 and 647 deaths.</p>
<p>Locally, Indiana County reported its first death. Westmoreland has three new deaths, increasing its total to 18,&nbsp;and Lawrence County reported a new death, increasing its total to five.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported 11 new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday, bringing its total to 904, highest in Western Pennsylvania. It&nbsp;also reported two new deaths, bringing the total to 26. Since the first case was confirmed on March 11, there have been 146 hospitalizations due to COVID-19. The county said it has administered 10,689 tests.</p>
<p>Allegheny’s 11 new positive cases is the fewest number of new daily cases reported in Allegheny County in three weeks and the first time there have been fewer than 20 new cases in three straight days since March 24, when there there were 10, with 8 on March 23 and 9 on March 22.</p>
<p>There were 30 cases reported on March 25, which began a two-week surge in cases as more test sites opened up, peaking at 76 new positive cases in the county on April 4. Cases have generally continued to go down since April 4.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Dr. Rachel Levine, the state’s health secretary, praised Allegheny County’s response to the pandemic, which has seen falling numbers of new cases in recent days, as “fantastic.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about Allegheny County, the secretary praised county Health Department Director Dr. Debra Bogen, with whom she has a daily phone call.</p>
<p>“I think that they’re doing a fantastic job in Allegheny County in terms of their mitigation and in terms of their testing, and we hope that that trend continues,” Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>Based on Tuesday’s data, Pennsylvania had 1,250 cases among healthcare workers, and 1,869 are in nursing homes, underscoring the vulnerability of both to the deadly disease. A fourth resident at the Kane Community Living Center in Glen Hazel, for example, has died due to COVID-19, the center reported Tuesday.</p>
<p>The center reported 34 residents at the nursing home have tested positive for COVID-19 as of Sunday, according to the Allegheny County-run assisted-living facility. Two additional residents are still awaiting results for tests.</p>
<p>Among the staff at the facility, 19 workers have tested positive for the virus, while an additional seven also wait for pending results. Due to the outbreak at Kane, tiny Glen Hazel is by far the most impacted neighborhood per capita in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>Around Western Pennsylvania, here’s a snapshot of Wednesday’s cases in each county with the previous day’s number of cases:</p>
<p>● Armstrong: 29 (up one case from Tuesday)</p>
<p>● Beaver: 158 (up two from 156)</p>
<p>● Butler: 150 (up seven from 143)</p>
<p>● Cambria: 14 (no change)</p>

<p>● Clearfield: 9 (no change)</p>
<p>● Crawford: 16 (no change)</p>
<p>● Erie: 42 (up one from 41)</p>
<p>● Fayette: 58 (no change)</p>
<p>● Forest: 5 (no change)</p>
<p>● Greene: 23 (no change)</p>

<p>● Venango: 6 (no change)</p>
<p>● Washington: 71 (up one from 70)</p>
<p>● Westmoreland: 237 (up six from 231).</p>
<p>The death toll in Westmoreland County is now 18, an increase of three from Tuesday, the county coroner’s office confirmed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coroner’s office publishes a live count of COVID-19 related deaths on its website. The count says that nine men and nine women are among the victims, and that the ages of the deceased range from 63 to 109. The average age is 82, and all those who have died are white (Westmoreland County is 93% non-Hispanic white, according to the U.S. Census Bureau).</p>
<p>All but one of the deaths are connected to long-term care facilities in the county. County coroner Kenneth Bacha said that though the deaths are concentrated in just three facilities, he has not heard about any state intervention in the affected facilities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The coroner office’s count differs from the state health department’s official count of deaths, which listed Westmoreland County as having just 11 COVID-19 related fatalities as of Wednesday. The first deaths in the county were reported on April 5.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County has 237 confirmed cases on Wednesday, up six cases from 231 on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
