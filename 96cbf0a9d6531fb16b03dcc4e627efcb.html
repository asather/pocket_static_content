<h1>Pitt's defense flails on the road as Notre Dame smokes Panthers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NOTRE DAME, Ind. — On Wednesday, Pitt found itself in an entirely unfamiliar but incredibly welcome spot given how the past few years have transpired for the program.</p>
<p>Five days into February, with the end of the regular season just a month away, the Panthers were listed as the sixth-place team in the ACC standings, not even two full years removed from a season in which they spent the entirety of it at the bottom, staring up at 14 other teams that quickly distanced themselves.</p>
<p>Improvement has, quite obviously, been made and with that come expectations, meaning that early February road games in arenas with large pockets of empty seats take on an importance they didn’t once have. Wins and losses measure progress, but they also help build a resume for postseason consideration (including whatever faint NCAA tournament aspirations remain).</p>
<p>It’s a position that makes victories that much sweeter and setbacks that much more staggering. Pitt’s 80-72 loss Wednesday at Notre Dame showed how the latter can be true in more ways than one.</p>
<p>Though it came against a Fighting Irish team ranked 25th (among 353 Division I teams) in offensive efficiency entering the matchup, the Panthers’ defense flailed in a way it largely hadn’t prior to Wednesday at Purcell Pavilion. They allowed their opponent to score 80 points on 68 possessions, an average of 1.18 points per possession. Notre Dame shot 46.2% from the field and 37% from 3-point range.</p>
<p>It was an onslaught that began early, with the Fighting Irish making seven 3s (on 13 attempts) in the first half, nearly matching the total Pitt (14-9, 5-7 ACC) was allowing opponents to make this season in entire games.</p>
<p>“They’re a really, really good offensive team and they got into a rhythm shooting the basketball, especially in the first half, that gave them separation,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We can’t allow a team that shoots it so well to make seven 3s in the first half. I thought that’s what hurt us. We were never able to fully recover from there.”</p>
<p>Between how the game unfolded and against whom it was played — a solid, but hardly spectacular Notre Dame squad — it stands as very likely Pitt’s worst loss against an ACC opponent this season.</p>
<p>In the days leading up to the meeting, Capel knew the Fighting Irish presented the kind of offensive challenge the Panthers hadn’t seen this season, even on a schedule that has featured five games against teams ranked in the top 15 of the national polls. Those teams, as Capel saw it, had at least one player, and sometimes more, that Pitt could relax a bit on defensively. Notre Dame (14-8, 5-6), for whatever difficulties have faced it at times this season, didn’t.</p>
<p>That potency and that balance were evident.</p>
<p>Guard T.J. Gibbs, the younger brother of former Pitt standout Ashton Gibbs, led his team with 21 points. The ACC’s No. 3 player in field goal percentage and No. 2 player in 3-point percentage made eight of his 13 shots and five of his eight 3s. John Mooney added 17 points and 10 rebounds, giving him his 17th double-double this season. Two other Irish players, Juwan Durham and Nate Laszewski, the latter of whom was averaging just 5.5 points in ACC play, both finished with 11 points apiece, making eight of their 10 combined shots.</p>
<p>All those numbers added up to say one thing — coach Mike Brey’s offense, regularly among the best statistically and most appealing visually in the country, worked as it was meant to.</p>
<p>“That’s the beauty of our offense — it’s a constantly moving offense,” Gibbs said. “Everybody is going to get a shot. Everybody is going to get a look. Just be ready to step up and knock it down. That’s something Coach has always preached since I’ve been here.”</p>
<p>Three Pitt players — Justin Champagnie (20 points), Xavier Johnson (17) and Trey McGowens (15) — finished in double figures. Champagnie had an especially pronounced role in the team’s offense, attempting 20 of its 62 shots. The freshman forward also had a team-high 11 rebounds, giving him his third double-double in the past seven games.</p>
<p>Though they made a late offensive push to lead to a more respectable final score, the Panthers missed 32 of their first 47 shots.</p>
<p>Part of those struggles came from a lack of depth created by circumstances largely out of their control.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive game, Pitt played without guard Ryan Murphy, who suffered a concussion at a practice last Thursday. Without Murphy, it was down its best 3-point shooter (at 35.5% on the season), which was a notable loss against an opponent that spent parts of the evening playing a zone defense.</p>
<p>What few reliable bodies the Panthers had remaining at guard vanished in an instant in the first half, when walk-on Onyebuchi Ezeakudo suffered what appeared to be an ankle injury after landing awkwardly on a contested layup in transition with 6:35 remaining in the first half. He had to be helped off the court, unable to put hardly any weight on his right foot.</p>
<p>Capel didn’t have updates on either player after the game, saying Murphy’s return “all depends on the tests” and saying he hadn’t gotten a chance to talk to the team’s trainer about Ezeakudo’s injury.</p>
<p>With the way Wednesday’s loss unfolded, their absences matter, but only so much. There was little, if anything, Pitt was able to do defensively against a team that, for so much of the night, had it in a different kind of unfamiliar, and far less welcome, spot — on its heels.</p>
<p>“It’s just hard,” Champagnie said. “Even their five man, when Mooney played the five, he could shoot 3s. We couldn’t sag off on anybody. It kind of disrupts our defense a little because we’re more of a help defense team. But it’s no excuse. Eventually, we’re going to see them again in the ACC tournament.</p>
<p>“We’ve just got to play harder and key in on the right things to do.”</p>
