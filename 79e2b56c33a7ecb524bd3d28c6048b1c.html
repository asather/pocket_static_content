<h1>Uniontown High School flips, will participate in fall sports</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s like reversing field. Uniontown High School has decided to participate in all fall sports after all.</p>
<p>The school announced Friday that it will play football and boys and girls soccer in the WPIAL. This comes a little more than three weeks after the Uniontown Area school board <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/08/04/uniontown-cancels-football-fall-contact-sports-2020-covid-19-pandemic-wpial/stories/202008040089" target="_blank">voted to cancel football and boys and girls soccer </a>this fall because of COVID-19 concerns.</p>
<p>Uniontown football coach Cedric Lloyd learned of the news Friday morning when he got a phone call from superintendent Charles Machesky. Suddenly, Lloyd had to get his team ready to start practicing again. The Raiders hadn’t worked out since early August.</p>
<p>“I think we’re excited to get the opportunity to play,” Lloyd said.&nbsp;“We’ll put our best foot forward and just get after it.”</p>
<p>Apparently, the Uniontown school board decided to change its mind. The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/08/26/wpial-schools-who-will-participate-fall-sports-piaa-pennsylvania/stories/202008260151" target="_blank">Post-Gazette polled all 117 WPIAL football-playing schools </a>earlier this week and Uniontown was one of only two to cancel any fall sports. The other was Summit Academy, which has only football and boys golf teams. The WPIAL wants to know by Tuesday of any schools that are not going to participate in fall sports.</p>
<p>When asked if the actions of other WPIAL schools might have helped change the school board’s mind, Lloyd said,&nbsp;“I know they met (Thursday), but I wasn’t privy to the meeting. It’s hard for me to speak for someone else because I wasn’t there. All I can tell you is we’re looking forward to getting some work in preparation for playing.”</p>
<p>Uniontown hasn’t won a game the past three seasons and heads into the season with a 32-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Lloyd said he hopes his team will get in a workout Saturday. Under PIAA rules, Uniontown must go through five consecutive days of heat acclimatization practices and then 10 more days of practices before it can play a game. Lloyd was not certain when Uniontown would play its first football game. WPIAL soccer teams can start playing games Sept. 14.</p>
