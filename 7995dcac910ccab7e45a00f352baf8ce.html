<h1>New Castle woman charged with taking, selling nude photos of daughters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A New Castle woman has been charged with taking nude photos of her young daughters and sending them to a man who, in some cases, paid for them, police said.</p>
<p>Police on Thursday charged the woman, the childrenâ€™s father and the man who received and bought the photos.</p>
<p>The girls are between 11 and 13 years old, police said.</p>
<p>The mother was charged with conspiracy to commit sexual abuse/photographing or filming sexual acts and other counts. The father was charged with child endangerment because authorities said he had knowledge his children were being photographed.</p>
<p>Police decided not to release the names of the parents in order to protect the identities of their daughters, who have been placed into the custody of child welfare officials.</p>
<p>Police charged David Bates, 60, of Ellwood City, with six counts of conspiracy to commit sexual abuse of children/photographing or filming sexual acts, six counts of solicitation to commit sexual abuse of children/photographing or filming sexual acts and six counts of sexual abuse of children/child pornography. It could not be determined if he had retained a lawyer.</p>
