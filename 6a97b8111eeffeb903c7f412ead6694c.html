<h1>Commitment from Pitt's leadership sold Jeff Capel on a contract extension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was no hesitation, Jeff Capel said, when it came to accepting a two-year contract extension he was offered by Pitt’s administrative and athletic leadership, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/08/jeff-capel-contract-extension-pitt-basketball/stories/202001080088" target="_blank">a move made official</a> on Wednesday.</p>
<p>He had, after this season, five more years remaining on a seven-year deal he signed in March 2018. But even with that measure of security, there was, for him and the school, an importance of tacking on a couple extra years, if only for what it would represent and symbolize.</p>
<p>“I think for potential recruits and for parents of potential recruits, it does signal that, that this place is committed,” Capel said Friday. “I think the university and athletic department, they’ve done a lot of things since I’ve been here to signal that, as well, whether it’s facilities and stuff they’ve done there, locker room stuff, obviously in the Pete, our office area. There are a lot of exciting things that are going on.</p>
<p>“The contract extension signals it from both sides that we’re both committed to doing something and feel like we can do something special here.”</p>
<p>There is, not unfairly, skepticism that comes with deals of this ilk. In modern college athletics, where the money pumped into the highest-profile programs and the pressure to win with those teams is as drastically high as ever, contracts are frequently broken, regardless of how expensive or onerous they may be to exit.</p>
<p>Capel was asked Friday morning on his weekly appearance on 93.7 The Fan about how he would respond to such doubts — namely the sentiment he’ll ultimately leave Pitt for Duke, his alma mater, whenever it is that Blue Devils coach Mike Krzyzewski retires. He said that he feels that fans in the area can sometimes be “Debbie Downers” and a “little bit insecure.”</p>
<p>He has, in his 22 months at Pitt, been pleased with his experience, which he reaffirmed by signing the extension. The vision and steps to achieving that goal that he was pitched nearly two years ago have, to him, either come to fruition or started to move in that direction.</p>
<p>“I believed in them,” Capel said of Pitt chancellor Patrick Gallagher and athletic director Heather Lyke. “I believed in their vision. I believed in their commitment to what it’s going to take and them understanding what it’s going to take in order to turn this thing around. They’ve done that. They’ve followed through on everything we’ve talked about, everything we talked about that day, that night and a couple of days before that and then some since we’ve been here.</p>
<p>“There have been some things that have come up since we’ve been here that we’ve talked about. They’ve been committed to it.”</p>
<p>Though the extension is a much more telling measure for recruits — be it the Panthers’ three-player 2020 class or five-star 2022 commit Jalen Hood-Schifino — than it is current players, there is still a level of pride that comes with it for those on the team’s roster right now.</p>
<p>“It’s really big,” guard Xavier Johnson said. “It just lets us know I guess that we’re helping him with his job. We’re on the right track.”</p>
<p><strong>Champagnie no longer ice cold</strong></p>
<p>After missing 11 of its first 12 3-pointers in Wednesday’s win at North Carolina, Pitt was in a trance in the game’s final 17 minutes, making eight of its final 10 attempts from deep. In that time, it outscored the Tar Heels, 41-22.</p>
<p>For a team that entered the night making just 29.1% of its 3s, it was a borderline shocking development. Nobody embodied that sharp uptick more than Justin Champagnie, who made four of his seven 3s Wednesday after shooting just 22.4% from beyond the arc in the first 14 games.</p>
<p>“Once the first one went in, I was just like, ‘C’mon, let’s keep it going,’” Champagnie said Wednesday after the win.</p>
<p>It’s an undeniable streakiness that shouldn’t be too surprising given that he’s a freshman. Fourteen of Champagnie’s 15 made 3s this season have come in just four games. In those contests, he’s 14 of 29 from 3 (48.3%). In the remaining 11 games, he’s just one of 27 (3.7%).</p>
<p>Moving beyond that occasionally erratic play will be a crucial next stage in his development.</p>
<p>“We want to continue to help him develop and continue to help him grow and learn more about the game, to learn more about the preparation and the work it takes to become a really, really good player,” Capel said. “He has a chance to do that, but the really, really good players are consistently good. That’s the next step for him, to try to find the understanding of how to do that.”</p>
<p><strong>Toney set to return</strong></p>
<p>The Panthers’ game Sunday at Miami will come complete with a crucial addition.</p>
<p>After missing the team’s previous two games with an elbow injury, forward Au’Diese Toney will be ready to play against the Hurricanes “unless something happens,” Capel said Friday. Pitt went 1-1 without Toney, toppling North Carolina but losing close at home to Wake Forest in a game in which the sophomore’s absence <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/05/pitt-panthers-basketball-au-diese-toney-wake-forest-demon-deacons-jeff-capel-danny-manning-acc/stories/202001050155" target="_blank">was difficult to ignore</a>.</p>
<p>For the season, Toney is averaging 6.4 and 4.7 rebounds today while serving as one of Pitt’s best and most versatile defensive players. His return, for an inconsistent team looking to build some sense of momentum, can’t be minimized.</p>
<p>“That’s really big,” Johnson said. “He’s a really good defensive guy on our team. He’s always aggressive. He does anything to win. We need that.”</p>
