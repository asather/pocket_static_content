<html><head><title>Pittsburgh-area unemployment rate ticks up to 4.3% in November</title></head><body><p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the Pittsburgh region rose two-tenths of a percentage point in November to 4.3% — matching the statewide unemployment rate, but higher than the national rate of 3.5%, new government workforce data indicate.</p><p>The seven-county Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area had a historically low unemployment rate of 3.8% from April through July, so 4.3% is “still really a great rate,” said Lauren Riegel, industry and business analyst for the Pennsylvania Department of Labor &amp; Industry.</p><p>Pittsburgh’s MSA and the Bloomsburg-Berwick’s tied for the ninth lowest unemployment rate among Pennsylvania’s 18 metropolitan areas, which saw jobless rates ranging from 3.2% in the Gettysburg and State College areas to 5.4% in the East Stroudsburg and Johnstown metropolitan statistical areas, according to the state labor department.</p><p>On a county basis in November, Fayette County had the highest unemployment rate in Pennsylvania at 6.6%. Butler County had the lowest rate at 4.4%.</p><p>Education and health services showed employment weakness in November compared to a year ago, as the Pittsburgh MSA data showed fewer jobs in hospitals and ambulatory health care services.&nbsp;Hospital jobs were down 800 from a year ago to 56,800 in November, according to state data — a hefty portion of the overall 2,200 job decline in education and health services during the same 12-month period.</p><p>Part of the decline in jobs in that sector was due to the bankruptcy of LifeCare Hospitals, which operated facilities in Wilkinsburg and Harrison Township, Ms. Riegel said.</p><p>Colleges and universities —&nbsp;the other part of the Pittsburgh region’s eds-and-meds economic engine —&nbsp;gained 900 jobs for the 12 months ending in November, bringing the sector’s total employment to 44,000.</p><p>During the 12-month period, employment in financial activities shrunk by 1,100, leaving the total at 74,500 jobs. Manufacturing jobs, including ones in primary metals, iron and steel mills, declined by 2,000 to 84,600 jobs.</p><p>The state unemployment rate represents people who were searching and available for work, but who were unable to find a job.</p><p><em>Kris B.
