<h1>Episcopal bishop: Halt services through Easter</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Pittsburgh is asking “with a heavy heart” that area parishes suspend all public worship through Holy Week and Easter, with the coronavirus expected to be widespread by the time of the central events of the Christian year.</p>
<p>“I know that this past Sunday many congregations maintained effective social distancing and observed other best practices around hygiene,” <a href="http://www.episcopalpgh.org/coronavirus-update-from-bishop-mcconnell/" target="_blank">Bishop Dorsey McConnell wrote to parishes and clergy on Wednesday</a>. “I dearly wish we could continue to gather with little risk in this way. However, as the number of COVID-19 cases increases exponentially — and it will — so will the number of people who are carrying the virus without immediate symptoms. Each contact, before coming to a service, and after going home, poses additional risk. Under these conditions, there is simply no ‘safe’ number for a public gathering.”</p>
<p>Most churches, denominational and independent, have similarly closed to public worship for the time being, but this is one of the first explicit indications that this would likely last through Easter. Area Roman and Byzantine Catholic bishops have suspended worship until further notice.</p>
<p>Bishop McConnell encouraged clergy to continue to lead liturgies in the church, with no more than three attending, as a way of maintaining some form of physical worship there. He also urged them to continue livestream services, and he cited ways that churches have held midweek activities through video or phone conferencing.</p>
<p>When to resume worship after Easter, which is April 12, will be decided closer to that date, he said.</p>
<p>“Our churches are not closing. We are continuing to do what we have always done, to love, teach and heal in the name and power of Jesus Christ,” he wrote.</p>
