<h1>Tuned In: Fox succeeds with familiarity, including new ‘9-1-1’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – When it was announced in 2017 that the Walt Disney Company would acquire Fox’s studio arm, sending the Fox network off on its own, there was much speculation that this would be the end of Fox Broadcasting as viewers knew it. Scripted series would give way to news hours and more sports.</p>
<p>While the news programs never materialized, there are more hours devoted to sports and/or sports entertainment – NFL games on Thursday, wrestling on Friday – and it is a changed network.</p>
<p>Less edgy than it once was, Fox proved it can still deliver popular scripted entertainment with the September premiere of “Prodigal Son,” which became the season’s No. 1 new drama series. Fox also ranked No. 1 in adults ages 18-49 in Fall 2019 for the first time in a decade.</p>
<p>For the remainder of the 2019-20 TV season, Fox appears poised to stick with what works even as its brand inches closer to CBS territory. (Recently-premiered Fox drama “Deputy” feels like an update of CBS’s ‘90s staple “Walker, Texas Ranger.”)</p>
<p>Like “9-1-1,” Fox’s No. 1 drama? Then try spin-off “9-1-1: Lone Star” (10 p.m. Jan. 19, WPGH-TV) starring Rob Lowe as a 9/11 survivor tasked with rebuilding a Texas fire house rocked by tragedy.</p>

<p>Tim Minear (“Firefly”), executive producer of “9-1-1” and “9-1-1: Lone Star,” didn’t dismiss the idea of a crossover with the original or a third “9-1-1” similar to Dick Wolf’s Chicago-set series on NBC, but he said “Lone Star” was built differently than the original “9-1-1.”</p>
<p>“On ‘9-1-1’ we started with spectacle,” Mr. Minear said Tuesday, the first day of the Television Critics Association 2020 winter press tour that previews broadcast, cable and streaming series debuting over the next six months. “With ‘Lone Star’ we felt like we earned the good graces of our audience and we build from character whereas on ‘9-1-1’ we started with cases and built to character.”</p>
<p>Sad to see “Empire” end this year but still crave soapy shenanigans? Maybe give “Filthy Rich” a try (no air date announced). It stars Kim Cattrall (“Sex and the City”) as a televangelist embroiled in family turmoil. Corey Cott, a 2012 Carnegie Mellon University drama grad, co-stars as Cattrall’s son.</p>

<p>If reality show “The Masked Singer,” returning for its third season after “Super Bowl LIV” (10:30 p.m. Feb. 2), is more your speed, perhaps brick building competition series “Lego Masters” (9 p.m. Feb. 5), already a hit in England and Australia, will draw you to Fox. (And if not “Lego Masters,” Fox has “The Masked Dancer,” featuring celebrities costumed head-to-toe while dancing, in the works.)</p>
<p>The programming may not be cutting edge the way Fox once was – think: “The X-Files,” “24,” “Glee,” “Ally McBeal,” “Arrested Development” etc. – but maybe in the streaming era a broadcast network has to follow the audience rather than push the envelope.</p>
<p><strong>Working on her big break</strong></p>
<p>Caitlin Frain, a native of Conway, Beaver County, will be among the performers participating in this month’s CBS “2020 Showcase,” a run of six shows at a Los Angeles theater. Executives, showrunners and casting directors attend “Showcase,” which is designed to highlight diverse talent.</p>
<p>Ms. Frain, a 2011 Freedom High School grad, studied film and media at Temple University and now lives in Los Angeles where she studies improv with the Groundlings and sketch with Upright Citizens Brigade while booking commercials, music video shoots and modeling gigs as she attempts to break into TV.</p>
<p>Alumni of “Showcase” include Kate McKinnon (“Saturday Night Live”), Tiffany Haddish (“Girls Trip”), Geoffrey Arend (“Madam Secretary”), Nico Santos (“Superstore”) and Nicole Byer (“Nailed It!”).</p>
<p><strong>Kept/canceled</strong></p>
<p>Netflix renewed “Raising Dion” for a second season.</p>
<p>BBC America renewed “Killing Eve” for a fourth season in advance of the show’s third season return sometime in the spring.</p>
<p>The CW renewed its entire roster of 2019-20 TV series, with the exception of midseason “Riverdale” spin-off “Katy Keene,” which has yet to debut, for the 2020-21 TV season.</p>
