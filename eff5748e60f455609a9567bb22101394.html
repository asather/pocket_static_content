<h1>Retailers boost benefits, bonuses for workers during pandemic </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As people are warned to keep their distance and only leave their homes for necessities, workers at supermarkets and drug stores on the front lines during the global pandemic have been playing a key role in making sure essential items are available to the public.</p>
<p>CVS Health was one of the latest companies on Monday to announce it would award bonuses and boost benefits in response to the COVID-19 outbreak.&nbsp;</p>
<p>United Food and Commercial Workers 1776KS, which represents retail and health care workers and others, announced that employees across Pennsylvania at Acme, ShopRite, Giant Eagle, Fresh Grocer and Rite Aid will receive temporary premiums and improved benefits.</p>
<p>“Our members are performing the essential work necessary to keep people safe during this unprecedented outbreak,” said UFCW 1776KS President Wendell Young IV. “Thanks to the hard work that these frontline responders are doing, Pennsylvania families can shop in safety.”</p>
<p>UFCW 1176KS represents 35,000 workers in industries including retail, grocery, food manufacturing, healthcare and cannabis in Pennsylvania, the Hudson Valley and the Ohio Valley.</p>
<p>For CVS workers, bonuses will range from $150 to $500 and will be awarded to pharmacists and other health care professionals, store associates and managers, and other site-based hourly employees.</p>
<p>“Our colleagues have demonstrated an extraordinary commitment to providing essential goods and services at a time when they’re needed most,” said Larry J. Merlo, president and CEO, in a statement. “As they continue to be there for the individuals and families we serve, we’re taking extra steps to provide some peace of mind and help them navigate these uncertain times.”</p>
<p>The drug store chain also said it is offering to help employees with both child and elder or adult dependent care needs. Working with the Bright Horizons network of national in-home and center-based daycare providers, employees will be able to take advantage of up to 25 fully covered days of backup care.</p>
<p>CVS also is extending its paid sick leave during the pandemic to part-time workers, who will have 24 hours of paid leave in addition to the 14-day paid leave provided to any employee who tests positive for COVID-19 or needs to be quarantined as a result of potential exposure.</p>
<p>CVS Health also plans to fill 50,000 full-time, part-time and temporary positions, including store associates, home delivery drivers and distribution center employees. The company will use a hiring process that includes virtual job fairs, virtual interviews and virtual job tryouts. Many roles will be filled by existing CVS Health clients who have had to furlough workers, including Hilton and Marriott.</p>
<p>Other retailers have been making such moves in recent days. On Saturday, O’Hara-based Giant Eagle said employees at its supermarkets and GetGo convenience stores would receive $10 million in bonus pay as they work through the COVID-19 pandemic. People working in warehouses and delivering products to stores will also receive bonus pay, according to a release from the company.</p>
<p>The O’Hara-based chain employs around 32,000 people across 400 retail locations, plus support centers and offices.</p>
<p>Last week,&nbsp;Walmart, the world’s largest brick-and-mortar retailer,&nbsp;said it would offer a cash bonus for all U.S. hourly associates in stores, clubs, supply chain and offices. The bonus will be $300 for full-time hourly associates and $150 for part-time hourly associates and will add up to more than $365 million. Every hourly associate employed by the company as of March 1 will qualify, and it will pay out on April 2.</p>
<p>Big-box retailer Target said it is investing more than $300 million in added wages, a new paid leave program, bonus payouts and relief fund contributions. The move includes a&nbsp;$2-per-hour wage increase through at least May 2 for&nbsp;full and part-time workers in stores and distribution centers. Employees who are 65 or older, pregnant or who have underlying medical conditions as defined by the CDC also will have access to paid leave for up to 30 days if they prefer not to work.</p>
