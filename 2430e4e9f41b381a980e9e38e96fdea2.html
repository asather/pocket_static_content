<h1>Ailing outboard shifts course of man sailing the length of the Ohio River</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just before he departed Pittsburgh in his 15-foot sailboat <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2020/07/15/Pittsburgh-to-Cairo-Illinois-Ohio-River-sailing-trip-sailboat/stories/202007130116" target="_blank">to sail the length of the Ohio River</a>,&nbsp;Dennis Simpson fully expected to have difficulties to overcome. Testing himself was part of the, well, point of covering the nearly 1,000 miles from Pittsburgh’s Point to the Point in Cairo, Ill., where the Ohio joins the Mississippi River. He left July 14.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Day 2 last week, a sputtering outboard motor forced the&nbsp;66-year-old teacher&nbsp;to dock at Chester, W.Va., and call his son to come rescue him. He’d had to break out his emergency oars to row out of the path of a barge-pushing towboat, which blew its horn to add to the disappointing drama.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Back home in Elizabethtown, Ohio, near Cincinnati, he figured out that the problem was a gas cap that wasn’t properly venting and fixed it. But rather than going back to West Virginia to resume where he left off, Mr. Simpson decided to sail from where he was, on the Great Miami River, and trailer the boat back later to do the Chester-to-home part of the journey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He kept followers apprised of the unexpected pause on his blog at <a href="https://sailingpointtopoint.blogspot.com" target="_blank">point2point.me</a>, where he chronicled his restart Monday on the Wandering Wisp. He had to rely on the motor because, as he illustrated with a photograph of smoke going straight up from a smokestack, ”there wasn’t any wind to speak of.</p>
<p>“I thought I might be sailing maybe 25% of the time, but due to starting this late in the summer, I may not be able to sail much at all.”</p>
<p>He covered 51 miles Monday, and that included being hailed by the pilot of a bigger boat who said he’d read about him in the Post-Gazette last week.</p>
<p>He covered 50 more miles on Tuesday, stopping for the night at Harrods Creek, Ky., just outside Louisville. The man from whom he bought his boat gave him a berth, a chance to take a shower and get ice, and a cool hat.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Simpson expected the full trip to take about 20 days and to be back home in time for back to school.&nbsp;Unexpected difficulties notwithstanding.&nbsp;</p>
