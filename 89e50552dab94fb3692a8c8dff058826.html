<h1>Commissioner Rob Manfred losing confidence with MLB’s potential return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Now, Rob Manfred isn’t so sure.</p>
<p>Less than a week after saying he was “100%” sure there would be baseball in 2020, Major League Baseball’s commissioner says he feels differently about the sport’s potential return.</p>
<p>“I’m not confident,” Manfred <a href="https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/29315408/mlb-commissioner-rob-manfred-now-less-confident-2020-season" target="_blank">told ESPN’s Mike Greenberg</a> as part of the network’s “The Return of Sports” special that will air Monday night. “I think there's real risk. And as long as there's no dialogue, that real risk is going to continue.”</p>
<p>The MLB Players Association over the weekend said it was done negotiating any sort of return-to-play agreement after restart talks never got off the ground.</p>
<p>Players think they should get 100% of their prorated salaries, per a March 26 agreement. Owners disagree, saying another pay cut is required because fans can’t come to games.</p>
<p>The MLBPA told the league and its owners that it would wait for word on a shortened season dictated by Manfred and expected to fall somewhere between 48 and 54 games.</p>
<p>MLB owners met on a conference call Monday, but thus far no season has been proposed.</p>
<p>“It's just a disaster for our game, absolutely no question about it,” Manfred said. “It shouldn't be happening, and it's important that we find a way to get past it and get the game back on the field for the benefit of our fans.”</p>
<p>The news breaking even forced Pirates player union representative Jameson Taillon to offer his thoughts on Twitter.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The union also isn’t happy about it, as evidenced the statement issued by MLBPA executive director Tony Clark on Monday night:</p>
<p>After the players said they were done with this, it’s entirely possible Manfred is trying to scare them back to the table or at least convince them to reopen talks.</p>
<p>Manfred is right about the point he made when it came to the perception of baseball: The sport is getting skewered right now, with the majority of people calling both sides selfish and saying they’re not going to watch if/when it does come back.</p>
<p>Manfred could potentially be talking about health and safety protocols, as COVID-19 has picked back up in various spots around the country.</p>
<p>However, at least in what we’ve seen of the interview so far, Manfred does not explicitly say that’s his reason for a sudden change in heart.</p>
<p>If an agreement can’t be reached, Manfred has the power to implement a season of his choosing — obviously with input from owners. That would not include any sort of expanded playoffs, which would hurt all parties involved from a financial perspective.</p>
<p>“The owners are 100% committed to getting baseball back on the field," Manfred said. "Unfortunately, I can't tell you that I'm 100% certain that's going to happen."</p>
<p>Manfred did say one issue at play is the MLBPA making it known that it will likely file a grievance with the league, contending owners did not try to play as many games as possible.</p>
<p>The league could potentially counter with the claim that the players did not negotiate in “good faith.”</p>
<p>"I had been hopeful that once we got to common ground on the idea that we were gonna pay the players full prorated salary, that we would get some cooperation in terms of proceeding under the agreement that we negotiated with the MLBPA on March 26," Manfred told ESPN. "Unfortunately, over the weekend, while [MLBPA executive director] Tony Clark was declaring his desire to get back to work, the union's top lawyer was out telling reporters, players and eventually getting back to owners that as soon as we issued a schedule — as they requested — they intended to file a grievance claiming they were entitled to an additional billion dollars.</p>
<p>“Obviously, that sort of bad-faith tactic makes it extremely difficult to move forward in these circumstances."</p>
