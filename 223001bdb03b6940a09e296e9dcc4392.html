<p>A Jefferson Hills police officer and another person were flown to Pittsburgh trauma units following a head-on crash in the borough Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>The crash was reported at 8:15 a.m. in the 200 block of Old Clairton Road, according to Allegheny County emergency officials.</p>
<p>Jefferson Hills police Chief Gene Roach said that based on a preliminary investigation, the male police officer was traveling northbound in a marked police cruiser along Old Clairton when his vehicle collided head on with a pickup truck that was traveling southbound. He said the crash occurred in the northbound lane.</p>
<p>Both the officer and male driver of the other car were trapped in their vehicles until emergency crews arrived on the scene and were able to extricate them. They were flown to Pittsburgh hospitals&nbsp;“due to the seriousness of the injuries,” the chief said.</p>
<p>Their conditions and identities have not been released.</p>
<p>The drivers were the only occupants in their vehicles, the chief said.</p>
<p>Chief Roach said a reconstruction team with the South Hills Area Council of Governments has taken over the investigation into what caused the crash.</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and prayers are with both,” Chief Roach said. “As you can imagine, because it involves one of our own, our officers are shook over this and are rallying behind him and hoping he can have a full recovery.”</p>
<p>Old Clairton Road was closed for several hours from Gill Hall Road to Wakefield Road.</p>
