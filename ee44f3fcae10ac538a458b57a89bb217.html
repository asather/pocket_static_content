<h1>Pitt lifts quarantine inside Litchfield B student highrise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh late Wednesday said it has lifted the quarantine within three floors of its Litchfield Tower B residence hall as well as other building restrictions after tests turned up no additional cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The discovery of nine cases in 10 days prompted the university to ask students living in that portion of the 22-story high rise to stay in their rooms except for meals, bathroom trips and medical needs. About 60 students on those three floors live in rooms converted this fall from double to single occupancy for social distancing.</p>
<p>The quarantine began Friday evening, and building-wide testing in Litchfield B commenced Monday. Tests of 75% of the residents that day turned up no new cases, nor have any been discovered since, though testing continued Wednesday and some results are pending, according to a statement released by Pitt.</p>

<p>“Based on these results and the continued low number of positive cases on the campus generally, we have ended the shelter-in-place protocol for the building and the three-floor quarantine put in place over the weekend,” the statement read. “Those students in quarantine due to known exposure will continue to quarantine until released by the contact tracing team. All students who previously tested positive will complete their isolation.</p>
<p>“While this is good news, it also highlights the importance of quick action and ongoing vigilance,” it said.</p>
<p>Pitt earlier reported 39 active cases among approximately 250 logged since Aug. 1.</p>
<p>Litchfield B is part of the three-building Litchfield Towers complex.</p>
