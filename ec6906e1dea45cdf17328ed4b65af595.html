<h1>Pirates embrace chance to support social justice initiatives</h1>

<p>ST. LOUIS — Shortly after 5 p.m. local time Friday, under the Gateway Arch and a sun-splashed summer sky, Pirates players began trickling onto the field at Busch Stadium for batting practice wearing two sets of black T-shirts — both impactful.</p>
<p>One had “Black Lives Matters” in big, block letters across the front. The other commemorated the 100th anniversary of the Negro Leagues. It, too, delivered a powerful message: “THEY PLAYED FOR US SO WE CAN.”</p>
<p>The messages geared toward ending social injustice were only starting.</p>
<p>As the Pirates and Cardinals stood along the third- and first-base lines for the pregame introductions and the playing of the national anthem, they did so with a black, ribbon-like fabric at their feet. When the anthem started, Jarrod Dyson dropped to one knee in protest, and manager Derek Shelton walked up the line to stand next to his center fielder, supporting Dyson.</p>
<p>As Major League Baseball has encouraged its players to raise their voice and say something, many — including the Pirates — have been ready and willing to seize the opportunity, especially amid the pomp, circumstance and excitement of opening day.</p>
<p>“I think it’s amazing,” Pirates pitcher Trevor Williams said before the season opener against the Cardinals. “I’m proud of the guys on the team that are stepping up and taking that initiative — not only my Black teammates but all my teammates have been stepping up and really looking in the mirror and becoming more educated in all facets.”</p>
<p>With baseball becoming the first North American professional team sport to return, MLB and its clubs have been trying to use the attention for good and advocate for social justice.</p>
<p>As the Nationals hosted the Yankees in the first game of the season Thursday night, the teams kneeled together and held a gigantic black ribbon before the National Anthem. They, too, wore “Black Lives Matters” shirts. “BLM,” along with MLB’s logo, were stamped on the pitcher’s mound at Nationals Park.</p>
<p>Players wore “Black Lives Matter” and “United for Change” patches on their jerseys, and all of those things were made available by MLB.</p>
<p>The league also changed its policy on cleats, allowing players to freely express themselves and stand up for what they believe, while MLB, the MLB Players Association and The Players Alliance have worked together to formulate a document that outlines what they believe and want to do.</p>
<p>“MLB stands in solidarity with the Black community in the right for racial and social justice,” the document reads. “MLB recognizes more needs to be done. MLB will continue to listen to the Black community, including MLB players, The Players Alliance and MLB and club staff about this issue; enhance initiatives to improve Black representation in baseball on and off the field; expand charitable donations to social justice organizations; and continue to amplify the voices of our players.”</p>
<p>Back in Pittsburgh, the Pirates tweeted a photo of the left-field rotunda at PNC Park, with a gigantic “BLACK LIVES MATTER” sign draped from top to bottom, with MLB logo at the bottom where the silhouette was of a Black baseball player.</p>
<p>The introductions Friday were accompanied by a video featuring the voices of many prominent Black baseball players and a second one narrated by Morgan Freeman before both teams picked up the black ribbon. A few Cardinals players and coaches briefly dropped to one knee during this time.</p>
<p>Whether it has been T-shirts, wristbands, patches or gestures, Williams said players have appreciated the opportunity to stand up for what they believe. He’s also been happy to see players growing more willing to use their platform.</p>
<p>“I’m glad that MLB and sports have kinda taken the reins off of the ‘stick to sports’ narrative,” Williams said. “I think people are using their platforms to speak out against what they want to speak out against. I think it’s awesome to see guys take control of their platform and take control of what they want to change.”</p>
<p>The killings of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others also struck a chord with Williams, who said he’s tried to educate himself more.</p>
<p>Williams and Bell have had several conversations, and he said the key to affecting change has been having an open dialogue between all involved.</p>
<p>“It was an awakening of some sorts to a lot of ignorances, especially for me personally,” Williams said. “It’s something where we’re going to have to continue to educate and continue to talk about and be open with. We can’t just gloss over this and have a bunch of blanket statements.</p>
<p>“We actually have to follow through and live it out. I think as athletes, we have a platform to use our voice. I think more and more guys are going to start using that and inspire change. I’m looking forward to not only this season and seeing responses from guys but going forward in all sports.”</p>
<p>That was something Shelton — who after the anthem shook Dyson’s hand and hugged him — discussed as well. T-shirts are great. Talking is great. Signs of unity are great. None should be ignored.</p>
<p>But becoming better throughout all of this also means that it’s a daily endeavor.</p>
<p>“I think the most important statements that happen are how our players act and what they say not only [Friday] but publicly and moving forward,” Shelton said. “That’s why I’ve been really happy with our group and how they’ve been not only on social media but how they’ve been outwardly in the community.</p>
<p>“That’s the most important statement. The most important statement isn’t something we do opening night or we do [Saturday]. It’s how we continue to live, how we continue to grow, how we continue to educate ourselves.”</p>
