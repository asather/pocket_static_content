<h1>Allegheny County president judge remembers meeting 'rockstar' Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Judge Kim Berkeley Clark, now Allegheny County’s president judge, didn’t know Ruth Bader Ginsburg in 2017 — but she wasn’t going to pass up an opportunity to meet her.</p>
<p>When Judge Clark learned she would be going to Washington to receive a prestigious award, she was hoping Justice Ginsburg would attend a congratulatory dinner. Instead, Judge Clark ended up in the Supreme Court justices’ chambers discussing family photographs and the collars Justice Ginsburg so often wore over her robes and had received as presents.</p>
<p>“It was really probably the best way that could have happened,” Judge Clark said. “She is so much of a rock star, I probably wouldn’t have gotten to spend as much time with her [at the event.]”</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg died Friday at age 87 due to complications from cancer she had been battling for over a decade. The Supreme Court justice, well known for championing women’s rights, left behind a legacy of fighting for equality, whether based on gender, race or ethnicity, Judge Clark said.</p>
<p>“Throughout her legal career, as a lawyer and even as a judge and justice on the court, she was deeply concerned about equality for all,” she said. “As a Black woman, I feel sort of a kinship to Justice Ginsburg, and feel that people like me might not be where I am without the Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s in the world.”</p>
<p>Judge Clark worked for 16 years as an assistant and deputy district attorney, prosecuting crimes-against-persons cases, before starting work at the Allegheny County Common Pleas court in 1999. In her more than 20 years there, she has turned the family division into a model for the rest of the state and nation.</p>
<p>In 2017, she was awarded the William H. Rehnquist Award for Judicial Excellence in her work as a judge. When preparing for the dinner and the celebration of the award, Judge Clark learned all the Supreme Court justices were typically invited to the event but usually only the chief justice attends.</p>
<p>Recipients could reach out to the other justices and ask them to attend, so Judge Clark’s husband asked Duquesne University President Ken Gormley to reach out, using a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/09/18/Duquesne-University-President-Gormley-shares-fond-memories-impact-Justice-Ruth-Bader-Ginsburg/stories/202009180164" target="_blank">connection Mr. Gormley had forged after attending law school</a> with Justice Ginsburg’s daughter Jane.</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg declined to attend the award dinner but invited Judge Clark to her chambers for a more intimate meeting where the two women discussed things like the photos displayed in Justice Ginsburg’s office, the women she graduated law school with and her relationship with former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall.</p>
<p>“She is very charming, very witty and very funny,” Judge Clark said. “She’s such a gracious person, I feel privileged to have met her.”</p>
<p>Though both professionals practiced different types of work, Judge Clark said she tries to follow Justice Ginsburg’s lead to make sure her opinions are “written for the people.” In other words, making her decisions and opinions easy to understand for the general public.</p>
<p>The now vacant seat in the Supreme Court has already become a hotly contested political debate as it is unclear whether President Donald Trump or his Democratic challenger, Joe Biden, will nominate a successor.</p>
<p>For Judge Clark, the decision about filling the seat comes down to precedent. Four years ago, the Senate blocked former President Barack Obama from nominating a Supreme Court justice during his last year in office.</p>
<p>“I don’t really see any reason to do something different,” Judge Clark said. “I think they should have consistency in what they do but it certainly is political so I won’t be surprised if there is a different path that is taken.”</p>
<p>Justice Ginsburg’s career — and the barriers she had to overcome because of her gender, her religion and her role as a mother — has been an inspiration for many women practicing law, including Judge Clark.</p>
<p>“She really inspired all of us, even in our most difficult moments, to keep going forward,” she said. “I think you need someone to help sort of lead the way and I think the sad part about it is that we’re still fighting to get there.”</p>
