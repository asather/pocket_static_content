<h1>Hillary on Bernie: 'Nobody likes him' and no one will back him if he's Democratic nominee</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2012/12/20/us/hillary-clinton---fast-facts/index.html" target="_blank">Hillary Clinton</a> blasts Sen. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/election/2020/candidate/sanders" target="_blank">Bernie Sanders</a> in a new documentary, saying “nobody likes him” and declining in an interview with <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/hillary-clinton-full-a-fiery-new-documentary-trump-regrets-harsh-words-bernie-1271551?utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=THR%20Breaking%20News_2020-01-21%2004:00:00_kkilkenny&amp;utm_term=hollywoodreporter_breakingnews" target="_blank">The Hollywood Reporter</a> to say whether she would endorse and campaign for him if he’s the Democratic 2020 nominee.</p>
<p>“He was in Congress for years. He had one senator support him. Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done,” Ms. Clinton says in the film, according to The Hollywood Reporter. “He was a career politician. It’s all just baloney, and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it.”</p>
<p>The comments in the documentary are aimed directly at his core campaign appeal — that he’s a political outsider pitching revolutionary change.</p>
<p>The new round of lacerating attacks come less than two weeks before the Iowa caucuses, which Ms. Clinton narrowly won in 2016 and where Mr. Sanders is locked in a tight four-way race this year. They also have the potential to reignite a divisive, four-year-old fight that has never fully faded from Democrats’ minds. More recently, and in comments since her loss to President Donald Trump, Ms. Clinton has blamed Mr. Sanders for damaging her campaign.</p>
<p>The Sanders campaign declined to comment in response to Ms. Clinton’s remarks.</p>
<p>In the THR interview, Ms. Clinton also pointedly questions the “culture” around Mr. Sanders’ campaign, from “his leadership team” to “his online Bernie Bros.”</p>
<p>“It’s not only him, it’s the culture around him. It’s his leadership team. It’s his prominent supporters. It’s his online Bernie Bros. and their relentless attacks on lots of his competitors, particularly the women,” Ms. Clinton said, before suggesting that Mr. Sanders himself was complicit in promoting those voices.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-meeting/index.html" target="_blank">recently denied</a> telling Elizabeth Warren, his friend and longtime political ally, that he did not believe a woman could win the presidency. Ms. Warren <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/13/politics/warren-sanders-2020/index.html" target="_blank">has said publicly</a> that Mr. Sanders told her this during a 2018 meeting.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth between the campaigns and their supporters led to a contentious exchange between the candidates after the most recent debate in Iowa.</p>
<p>Ms. Clinton said Mr. Sanders’ conduct was part of a pattern.</p>
<p>“Then this argument about whether or not or when he did or didn’t say that a woman couldn’t be elected, it’s part of a pattern,” she told the THR. “If it were a one-off, you might say, ‘OK, fine.’ But he said I was unqualified. I had a lot more experience than he did, and got a lot more done than he had, but that was his attack on me.”</p>
<p>She continued, “I just think people need to pay attention because we want, hopefully, to elect a president who’s going to try to bring us together, and not either turn a blind eye, or actually reward the kind of insulting, attacking, demeaning, degrading behavior that we’ve seen from this current administration.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders and Ms. Warren appeared arm-in-arm at a march to mark Martin Luther King Day on Monday, appearing to have put the controversy behind them.</p>
<p>But the ill will from 2016 does not figure to subside so quickly — if ever. Shortly after the THR interview posted, Mr. Sanders’ supporters took to social media to slam Ms. Clinton, who less than two months ago launched a similar round of broadsides against the Vermont senator during an appearance on Howard Stern’s radio show.</p>
