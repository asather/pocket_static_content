<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University-Silicon Valley is suspending face-to-face instruction on its campus in Mountainview, Calif., and will conduct classes remotely until further notice starting March 16 when students return from spring break.</p>
<p>A statement on the university’s web site early Tuesday cited&nbsp;“increasing cases of the coronavirus (COVID-19) in the County of Santa Clara, California.” The campus, in Mountain View, is within that county.</p>
<p>The decision follows by one day an announcement that CMU would shutter the university’s campus in Qatar at midnight Monday, postpone classes there for two days and the resume instruction online indefiinitely on Thursday. Neither Carnegie Mellon’s New York City site or the main Pittsburgh campus have announced any similar moves.</p>
<p>It and other Pittsburgh-area campuses, though, have been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/09/COVID-19-coronavirus-Pitt-CMU-Penn-State-contingency-teaching-plans-outbreak/stories/202003090109" target="_blank">drawing up contingencies</a> including giving faculty aisstance in ways to move face-to-face courses&nbsp;online should any of the schools decide to pause in-person instruction.</p>
<p>The Silicon Valley campus opened about two decades ago at the NASA Ames Research Center.&nbsp;There are 45 faculty and staff and about 300 engineering graduate students in various programs there.</p>
<p>"Over the past several weeks we have been actively monitoring the coronavirus outbreak and working on plans for social distancing to ensure the health and safety of our students, faculty and staff," Bill Sanders, dean of Carnegie Mellon's College of Engineering, said in a statement. "We have been preparing for remote teaching and are now in a position to begin to operate in support of the local guidelines."</p>
<p>In recent days, a number of major universities, including those on the West Coast, have paused in-person instruction. Among the schools are the University of Washington, Stanford, the University of California at Berkeley and, most recently, the University of California at San Diego.</p>
<p>On the East Coast, Harvard University said it too will switch to remote teaching. Earlier, Columbia and Princeton univeresities announced similar moves. Ohio State University says it also is suspending in-person classes effective immediately and with deliver them virtually at least through March 30, saying it wants to slow spread of the virus by minimizing close-up interaction.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon’s statement said its Silicon Valley branch “will continue ongoing operations and will allow non-essential staff and faculty to work remotely,’ hte statement added.</p>
<p>Officials reiterated that there are no COVID-19 cases at any Carnegie Mellon location in the U.S. or abroad.</p>
<p>"The health and safety of our campus community is our top priority," said Sanders. "We encourage CMU-SV faculty, staff and students to be aware of the County of Santa Clara Health Department guidance for social distancing as the university continues to work to address all issues in this rapidly-evolving situation."</p>
