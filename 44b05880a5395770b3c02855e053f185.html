<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Is JuJu Smith-Schuster a cinch to be the Steelers’ best receiver next season?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Ronnie Lester and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Jeremy Miller, @11JustBreathe11:</strong> Did JuJu have a meaningful impact on the Steelers in any way this season?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not a positive one, Jeremy.</p>
<p>He had too many botched plays, including the one against the Jets that might have cost the Steelers the game. He had another season-changing fumble (Baltimore this year, New Orleans last year).</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster played through injuries as the season wore on — but none to his hands that I know of. Yet in November and December, he played in five games and caught just 12 passes (on 23 targets) for just 109 yards and no touchdowns. His longest reception was 20 yards.</p>
<p>In their “fragile state,” to borrow Mike Tomlin’s term, the Steelers needed JuJu badly. Not necessarily for 150-yard games — that wasn’t going to happen given the state of the offense and his health — but to make a key catch now and then. He failed.</p>
<p>Hopefully, this will serve as a learning experience. I still believe in this guy’s ability, big time. I don’t care who’s on the opposite side — Antonio Brown or anyone else — only a monster talent puts up the kinds of numbers and makes the kinds of plays (like two 97-yard touchdowns) JuJu made in his first two years.</p>
<p>The question now becomes — who is the Steelers’ go-to guy in the immediate future? JuJu, Diontae Johnson or James Washington?</p>
<p>You could make a case for all three. Johnson already looks like a polished route runner with game-breaking ability. JuJu has a track record. Washington came on and made some spectacular plays in his second year.</p>
<p>I ran a 10-minute Twitter poll on the following question Tuesday: Who will be the Steelers’ best receiver in three years?</p>
<p>Johnson won in a landslide, garnering 68.4% of the 244 votes. JuJu was second at 23%, Washington a distant third.</p>
<p>Recency bias, as one tweeter suggested? Maybe. I’m still gonna bet on JuJu, but Johnson’s abilities and JuJu’s bad year have me wavering. He might not even be here if the Steelers don’t re-sign him. His contract expires after next season.</p>
<p><strong>Mick McCarthy, @theetti66:</strong> Where do you see the Penguins in 5 years</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Shouldn’t your name be&nbsp;<em>Mike</em> McCarthy, Mick? Anyway, great question. And for better or worse, we know this much: The next five years will bring profound change to this franchise.</p>
<p>Will a 56-year-old Mike Sullivan still be coach? Will a 75-year-old Jim Rutherford still be GM?</p>
<p>On this day, five years from now, Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang will be 37 (Letang, incidentally, has just two years left on his deal). Evgeni Malkin will be 38, although he, too, has just two years left on his contract.</p>
<p>The easy answer is to say the Penguins will hit upon hard times — but who knows? I could see them still winning with a team build around an aging Crosby. Jake Guentzel, Bryan Rust and Jared McCann might be key players, plus whichever goaltender the Penguins choose to move ahead with, be it Tristan Jarry or Matt Murray. Brian Dumoulin, if he signs a new deal, will be 33. John Marino will be 28.</p>
<p>Brandon Tanev will be in the final year of his deal, believe it or not.</p>
<p>Rust could become an unrestricted free agent in 2022 at age 30. Wasn’t he 23 about five minutes ago?</p>
<p>The problem moving ahead is a significant one: The Penguins’ farm system isn’t exactly bubbling with prospects. It ranks anywhere from No. 28 to 31 (last), depending where you look.</p>
<p>The take from hockeywriters.com: “The Penguins have been a threat ever since Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin came into the league. Due to them being perennial contenders, the organization has been in ‘win-now’ mode for that time. The result? An extremely thin prospect pool. In order to build the team around the core, picks and prospects have been sent away for immediate help.”</p>
<p>Fair enough, but they also said, “There’s also no goaltender of the future right now after the team traded Filip Gustavsson to the Ottawa Senators.” That was before Tristan Jarry’s sudden rise. Plus, Murray’s only 25. Jarry is proof that perception can change fast.</p>
<p>Lower-round picks (Guentzel, Rust, Murray, Letang) coming through and undrafted college free agents can turn the fortunes of a farm system. So can trading for excellent young talents such as Marcus Pettersson and McCann.</p>
<p>The Sporting News’ take from preseason: “How much longer (Penguins in perennial contention) lasts is something to ponder, especially when you consider how bare the cupboard is. … Some of the issues — aging roster, expensive contracts, onrushing division rivals, thin prospect pool — are symptomatic of a franchise on the brink of collapse.”</p>
<p>That seems a bit much, but the next five years will be mighty interesting.</p>
<p><strong>al, @dispatcher44:</strong> Why do the Pirates exist?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Allegedly to win baseball games, Al.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Fitzmaurice, @RFitzmaurice21:</strong> What’s your karaoke song?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> “If You Could Read My Mind.” — Gordon Lightfoot. And while we’re on the subject, top three Gordon Lightfoot songs (because there aren’t five):</p>
<p>3. “Carefree Highway”</p>
<p>2. “Sundown”</p>
<p>1. “If You Could Read My Mind”</p>
<p>Gordon Lightfoot song I hope to never hear again, even in a 5-second clip: “The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald.”</p>
<p><strong>Planeguy, @Planeguy43:</strong> Over/under on Mike McCarthy finishing out his (five-year) contract in Dallas!!!</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m gonna say under, Mr. Planeguy. Feels like the safe pick, for sure, but what was that old John Tortorella saying? “Safe is Death.”</p>
<p>McCarthy did plenty of winning in Green Bay, but how much of that was Aaron Rodgers? When Rodgers went down in 2017, the Packers did, too.</p>
<p>Last season was a disaster — and I can’t help but notice that the Packers bounced back under Matt LaFleur to go 13-3. McCarthy claims to have updated his methods. We’ll see.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Danowski, @DanowskiMichael:</strong> If Ben retires, or can’t return, should the Steelers try to sign Brady?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Yes, and Duck should go to New England.</p>
<p><strong>Frankie J Ryan, @Frankie32110332:</strong> Would you be willing to do a one-on-one with Bob Nutting, asking him point blank, all of the tough questions, that all of the fans want answered? I know you got it in you, Joe!!</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I would. And I have, Frankie, but just because tough questions are asked doesn’t mean they will be answered. Plenty of reporters have asked Nutting “the tough questions” over the past several years.</p>
<p>The main one is this: Will you put more money into payroll?</p>
<p>In fact, he was asked about that a year ago and spoke of needing “to focus on the things we believe are controllable.” And how he believes “payroll scale and range, broadly, is not controllable.” And how the club is “always going to have limitations” and needs to “maximize the impact of every dollar.”</p>
<p>You know the drill.</p>
<p><strong>Sidelines Bar&amp;Grill, @sidelinesbar:</strong> In a league full of dumb rules, why does the NHL insist on making icing a judgment call? The puck goes over the goal line from behind the red line. Very black and [white]. Easy to understand. Why is it so hard?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Player safety, Bar&amp;Grill. They don’t want those races taken to the finish line, which is made of boards and glass. The no-touch icing was instituted six years ago, though it wasn’t popular in some circles.</p>
<p>Sounds like you would have agreed with then-Coyotes GM Don Maloney, who said, “I am not for no-touch icing whatsoever. Watching enough other leagues that have the no-touch, what I don’t like is when the play stops. The puck is still moving but all the players stop and wait for it to go over the goal line. It’s a speed game and you’re supposed to play to the whistle. I just don’t like that. It just aesthetically looks poor.”</p>
<p><strong>Jared Catherine, @Jared_Catherine:</strong> Are the Pirates going to sign somebody? Anybody?!</p>
<p><strong>Starkey</strong>: Nah. What’s the point?</p>
<p><strong>Nathan, @Gorall007:</strong> What’s the land speed of a laden swallow?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Roughly 24 mph. <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/what-is-the-airspeed-velocity-of-an-unladen-swallow" target="_blank">Read all about it</a>.&nbsp;</p>
