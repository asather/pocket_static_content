<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 04.16.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Zeise</strong>: Welcome back my friends!! Let‚Äôs get started</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: How do you see Ben‚Äôs career playing out, as far as years if he plays decentlyand when do you think they start looking to draft a new QB of the future? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think he will play his two seasons and be done. And I think the Steelers will settle on Mason Rudolph as their QB of the future. But they may look at the crop of young QBs next year to see if there is anyone they think might have a chance to be a starter for them</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Jalen Hurts keeps popping up on National mocks for Steelers either 2nd or 3rd round. Saw his combine.....great athlete. Like Mark Malone and Kordell Stewart, could he be drafted with an eye to using him as a receiver ahead of eventually QB? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don‚Äôt think Hurts is wide receiver material. I don‚Äôt think the Steelers are gonna be in the market for a QB this season.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Based on the Steelers history under Tomlin/Colbert should they avoid drafting DBs? They have been MUCH more successful filling those positions via trades and free agency. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: You can‚Äôt just give up trying. I mean I don‚Äôt think corner or safety will be a priority but if they need to do it, I‚Äôm sure they will. They should go linebacker or defensive lineman.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Why do you think so few African American kids want to play baseball in favor of football and hoops?. Jackie Robinson broke the color line and at one time about 25% of players were Black. Now it‚Äôs less than 7%? Baseball is missing some great athletes. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Andrew McCutchen said it in his Players Tribune article ‚Äî he said it comes down to money. Football and basketball is quicker, more direct path to a pay day. There aren‚Äôt levels of minor leagues it could take years to get through. Also baseball is very expensive to play at the club level.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Is bowling a sport? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes as is poker. And anyone who says poker is not a sport has never played it at a higher level than for quarters at their uncle Joe‚Äôs house...</p>

<p><strong>Mike</strong>: If I were the Steelers I would consider trading down in the 2nd Round to get more drafts picks (since they only have 6 total this year) especially if they think one of their top choices will still be available when it‚Äôs their turn to pick later in the 2nd Round. Maybe give MIA the 49th pick and we take their 56th and 70th picks. Or give the LA Rams the 49th pick and we take their 52nd and 84th picks. I would rather have 3 picks in the top 102 instead of 2. Thanks, and everyone be safe. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Right now they have one pick in the top 100. That‚Äôs not good in terms of trying to get multiple impact players. If you trade back you might get more picks but what quality will they be? I think they need to stay at 49 and take the best player available</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: As Pitt‚Äôs roster is currently constituted(hopefully they add the Jeffress kid) do you think they are a 10 ACC win team this upcoming season? Depending on non conf schedule 20 overall? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well they won six games this year so I would hope so. There are 20 ACC games so, without seeing their ACC schedule, I do think 10-10 should be possible. And if they get 10 conference wins, I‚Äôm assuming they will yet to 20 total wins because the nonconference schedule will be built to get wins</p>
<p><strong>Zeke</strong>: Hey Paul, with the great number of quality receivers in the draft, do you think the Steelers might try to trade up to get another pick in the second round in addition to their pick at #49? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No they have talked pretty openly about how steep the cost would be for them to move up this year because they don‚Äôt have many picks. I think they will stay put</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Paul, thanks for the chats! Do you think Steelers will draft offensive (RB, WR or lineman) or linebacker (inside or outside) with pick 49? What position would you go with if you were GM? Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: if I were GM I would draft a linebacker, preferably an inside linebacker but an outside linebacker would work, too. I think they will probably go wide receiver or offensive lineman with that pick, though</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Paul, non-related Steelers question: would you trade up for Joe Burrow if you were the Dolphins? Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No because the Bengals want him so bad I would imagine that the price would be absurd</p>
<p><strong>DJ</strong>: Which Steelers player do you dislike the most? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: This would have been an easy question to answer two years ago...</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: With colleges starting already to ask to be able to drop sports and keep D1 status, could this be the beginning of the end of NCAA? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don‚Äôt think so. The NCAA provides a structure and a league that would be hard to rebuild. The NCAA makes a lot of money for the schools. It is Already in place. As much as we complain about the NCAA it does more good than harm</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: I could see a group of major schools keeping just a few sports (basketball and football of course) and leaving the NCAA umbrella together. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There has been talk of the power conferences doing this. There is one major obstacle - the NCAA Tournament. The fact that all those smaller conferences get a bid and if you remove them you would have to cut the field down. I just think that tournament is worth way too much money and to get rid of.</p>
<p><strong>Rick</strong>: Afternoon., Is WR Michael Irvin a HOF In your eyes? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would have said yes just off the cuff. Now looking at his numbers, no. He is a classic example of a great player for some great teams who didn‚Äôt quite do enough to be a Hall of Famer.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="‚Äú_blank‚Äù"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Pyshekeydoodle</strong>: Which is better rn; Pitt football or basketball? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Football. There is no question basketball is on the rise but I‚Äôd say next year is still an NIT year unless a whole lot goes right. The expectations for football should be 10 wins or more next season.</p>
<p><strong>Richy</strong>: Hi Paul, The division opponent teams have a good number of picks in the upcoming draft to continue to build around; especially the Ravens. I think due to this the Steelers need to pick a player who can have an immediate impact. My guess the best opportunity for this type of player by position on offense is a RB or WR. On defense I would tend to think a lineman. What are your thoughts on which positions are more likely to have an immediate impact for the Steelers? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well immediate impact - the one position they don‚Äôt have a starter right now is nose tackle. So I would say a big interior defensive lineman. Beyond that you are right, a receiver would probably be the player who could have the quickest impact on the field on his side of the ball. However, a defensive player probably would have an impact on special teams</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Which of the current Pirates do you see as the most old school/hard nosed type of players? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Joe Musgrove is definitely old school, hard nosed kind of player. I mean he is a guy who will run someone over and is ready to drop his glove and fight if a bean brawl thing breaks out. His intensity makes him fun to watch</p>
<p><strong>Andy Russell34 HOF</strong>: Hi Paul....Steelers draft Taylor or Akers at number 49, then trade Conner to move up in round 2 to get a wr, linebacker or lineman and draft aj Dillon in a later round. What do you think? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: So the Steelers are going to draft a running back at 49 then trade Conner to get another second round pick and then draft AJ Dillon too? I would be OK with the plan except nobody is giving you a second round pick for James Conner. You MIGHT get a fourth round pick for him, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Do you really think Mason Rudolph is a starting quarterback in the NFL? When you go back and read his scouting report from the combine it‚Äôs been spot on albeit with only half a season of starting. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Well if you listen to the NFL scouts on the Fan Morning Show he is better than Jameis Winston! ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I think he has a chance to be an NFL starting QB. He has a big enough arm and can make all the throws. He just has to get less robotic and play more loose and relaxed</p>
<p><strong>YNWA</strong>: Being a former soccer player, do you still follow the game? Have a favorite team? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do follow the game some. I watch the Champions League a lot on ESPN and love the World Cup. The first soccer jersey I ever bought was Manchester United so I root for them but I just like watching great soccer. In the World Cup I always root for the South American teams because I like the way they play versus the European teams. Well I mean I root for the US but since they usually don‚Äôt hang around long in the World Cup I have to find others to root for!!</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Likelihood that we will be able to watch a football game (pro or college) in an actual stadium this fall? <br> <strong>Guest</strong>: What about a basketball or hockey gams? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think we will see basketball, hockey and football this year. I don‚Äôt think we will see fans in the stands until maybe November or December</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Signing Shady McCoy would seem to be a move that would not help the Steelers. He didn‚Äôt dress for the Super Bowl. To use your term, he‚Äôs a CNP. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes I don‚Äôt understand why anyone would endorse that. I love McCoy, he was a great player when he was younger. But Father Time never loses.....</p>
<p><strong>Because</strong>: Baseball is dying <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say the revenue streams that sport still generates would disagree.....</p>
<p><strong>Vince</strong>: It‚Äôs a shame MLB could not once again honor Jackie Robinson because of the virus. Do you think MLB will ever retire Roberto Clemente‚Äôs number? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don‚Äôt think MLB will retire No. 21 nor do I think they should. Clemente is a great, great player and an even better human. But I don‚Äôt think he is a pioneer on the level of Jackie Robinson</p>
<p><strong>Xanadu</strong>: Go Olivia Newton-John, poker a sport? Let‚Äôs see then, chess? checkers? candy land? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Chess, at the highest level, yes. Checkers and Candy Land, no.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Did you watch HBO‚Äôs ‚ÄúThe Scheme?‚Äù If so, your thoughts? Huge NCAA coverup? How is Miller still coaching? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I did and thought the same thing I thought when I first heard about the FBI investigation - how are there not more coaches fired and more programs on probation</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Watching these old Pirate replays made me realize that Al Oliver is the most underappreciated Pirate over the last 50 years. The man could flat out hit and was denied 3,000 hits because of the owners collusion. He should get more attention for the Hall of Fame. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He was a great, great player but like Michael Irvin, probably not quite a Hall of Famer</p>
<p><strong>Southside Jimmy</strong>: How do you rate WR Michael Pittman as a second or third round pick? Also, if the Steelers draft a wideout/returner like Brandon Aiyuk, would that spell the end of Ryan Switzer? Thanks Paul. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Pittman is a second rounder, his stock seems to be on the rise. He ran 4.52 in the 40, though, if that was a tough faster he would be a first rounder. And if Ryan Switzer is on the roster this year it is only because he goes to Ben‚Äôs house for dinner or whatever. There is no reason Switzer should make the roster</p>
<p><strong>This guy</strong>: Do you think the Riverhounds will have a season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I do but it will be modified greatly and probably take place without fans</p>
<p><strong>This guy</strong>: Jefress to Pitt? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Stay tuned</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, would you prefer the MLB option of all games being played in Arizona, or the version where half the teams are in Florida and the other half in Arizona? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The Arizona plan seems far more realistic and seems like it makes more sense. I‚Äôm not sold they can pull it off but if they are going to be able to it will be the Arizona plan where all the teams are in one place <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: As I said before - I see Pitt as a 10-2 team that wins the Coastal. The Panthers probably won‚Äôt have quite enough to beat Clemson in Charlotte but they could win a bowl game. So I‚Äôll say 11-3</p>
<p><strong>Treesmann</strong>: Paul thanks for the chat. I was firmly in the -at 49 draft a RB or WR camp. But as we get closer to the draft I‚Äôm leaning more towards a NT. Address the WR later and look for the RB next year. What say you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: As of right now their starting nose tackle is Dan McCullers so, yeah I‚Äôm on board with that plan!!!</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, how far can we push back the start of the college football season and still play a full schedule? Or, would simply playing just the conference games during a shortened schedule be a better option? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don‚Äôt think there is any chance they shorten the season. All these schools need home games with big crowds and so if they have to delay it a few months I‚Äôm sure they will</p>
<p><strong>Steelers22</strong>: I just watched a re-air of ‚ÄúThe Cobra at Twilight‚Äù and was surprised to learn that Dave Parker has yet to make the MLB Hall of Fame. Would you agree there‚Äôs a strong case to be made for his inclusion? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think he has a strong case and especially if you value his defense like you should. But he may be another guy who is just below a Hall of Famer.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Paul, are there any intriguing ‚Äúsleeper type‚Äù players that you would consider if you were Steelers GM? Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I‚Äôll give you one name - tight end Colby Parkinson from Stanford. He will be a late (4th or later) pick but he has a chance to be a really good pass catching tight end in the NFL <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That‚Äôs it for us, thanks for all the great questions!!! Let‚Äôs do it next week</p>
