<h1>PPS board adjusts student codes of conduct, but disorderly conduct remains</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board on Wednesday approved several changes to the district’s student code of conduct but narrowly decided to&nbsp;keep the disorderly conduct violation that can sometimes lead to criminal charges against students in grades 6-12.</p>
<p>Board member Pam Harbin motioned to remove disorderly conduct, saying it was one of the most&nbsp;“subjective” violations used by the district and that it was imposed disproportionately on Black students.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think this is one of the areas where there’s lots of subjectivity and, frankly, racial bias that comes into it about what constitutes a child being disorderly,” Ms. Harbin said.&nbsp;“I think this is one of the highest used infractions that we give to our students in 6-12, and I don’t believe we should have anything in our code of conduct that is so subjective.”</p>
<p>David May-Stein, the district’s chief of school performance, noted that the violation does not automatically lead to criminal charges. He said the district's version of disorderly conduct gives the school an action plan for when a student creates an enormous disruption or the potential for a crisis to occur and refuses to be redirected.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“When it elevates to a criminal charge, that’s the decision of either a school police officer or, if it’s happening outside of school, a city police officer,” Mr. May-Stein said. “That’s not a decision that is made from the teacher or from the administrator. This code allows principals to provide consequences to students that refuse to be redirected and extremely disrupt the environment within the school building.”</p>
<p>Mr. May-Stein said the principals and school-based administrators do everything they can to de-escalate and not file criminal charges against students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In response, Ms. Harbin said 37% of all arrests in the district over the past five years were for disorderly conduct.</p>
<p>“It’s too subjective,” Ms. Harbin said.&nbsp;“Disorderly conduct has been way overused to criminalize students, not just in Pittsburgh Public Schools, but everywhere.”</p>
<p>The board voted 5-4 to keep disorderly conduct for grades 6-12. The K-5 code of conduct does not include a disorderly conduct violation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board members Veronica Edwards, Cynthia Falls, Bill Gallagher, Terry Kennedy and Sylvia Wilson voted in favor of keeping disorderly conduct, while Ms. Harbin, Kevin Carter, Devon Taliaferro and Sala Udin voted to get rid of the violation.</p>
<p>The board approved two other adjustments to the code of conduct initiated by Ms. Harbin.</p>
<p>The board overwhelmingly voted to make a change so that repeated Level 1 violations, which the district deems nonviolent and less serious infractions, cannot lead to suspensions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Kennedy, the lone board member to vote against the change, wondered what a school is supposed to do when a student continually disrupts a class or pesters other students.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At what point do the rights of the other students outweigh the rights of the one student?” Ms. Kennedy asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Harbin said suspensions do not improve behavior, and more effective interventions can be put in place.</p>
<p>The board unanimously approved a change to the guidelines for informal hearings on suspensions or expulsions. The hearings will now occur within three days instead of five, which board members hope will lead to children missing less school.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said the district removed an infraction titled “Other Disruptive Behavior” from the student codes of conduct for all grades. The violation, which critics decried as vague, punished “behavior which is disruptive to the educational environment but not&nbsp;defined elsewhere” among Level 1 infractions.&nbsp;</p>
