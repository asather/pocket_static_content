<h1>Steelers agree to terms with first draft pick, third-round linebacker Alex Highsmith</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not that it’s a distinction that means much, but someone had to be the first. Pass-rusher Alex Highsmith became the first 2020 Steelers draft pick to agree to terms with the team, according to his agent CJ LaBoy.</p>
<p>NFL Network first reported the news Tuesday afternoon. A compensatory pick at the end of the third round out of Charlotte in April, Highsmith has already been in Pittsburgh to scope out his new city. Rookie contracts in the NFL are four-year deals (with a fifth-year option for first-rounders), so the process of negotiating and signing them is little more than a formality.</p>
<p>But in this unusual offseason, the Steelers and other teams have been slow to make their draft picks official. While their salaries are predetermined, they still take up salary cap space, and many franchises are simply waiting for a clearer picture on that front.</p>
<p>The Steelers have five more picks left to sign, including their first selection this year, second-round wide receiver Chase Claypool. Several rookies reported to Pittsburgh for training camp Tuesday, as per the NFL’s schedule, and some participated in an informal workout at Cupples Stadium on the South Side. Unlike draft picks, undrafted free agents are already under contract with the team.</p>
