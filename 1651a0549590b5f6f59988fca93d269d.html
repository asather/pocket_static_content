<h1>Obituary: Michael B. Diven: Former state rep who stood up to powerbrokers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Growing up on the rough and tumble streets of Brookline, Michael Diven learned to master the intricacies of politics, fighting and family.</p>
<p>The lessons he learned served him well in life, leading to a career as a state representative and Pittsburgh city councilman, and later as a volunteer who promoted and organized youth boxing matches between fighters from Pittsburgh and Ireland, Italy and even Cuba.</p>
<p>Mr. Diven, 50, died Tuesday of complications from cancer of an unknown origin that he battled for nine years.</p>
<p>As a boy, his brother used what they termed the “Brookline entertainment card,” an all-access pass&nbsp;— courtesy of a few bucks slipped to a promoter or usher&nbsp;— for concerts, sporting events and other events, said Joey Diven Jr.</p>
<p>“Somehow, he would find a way in,” he said, laughing at the memory. “We would go everywhere and Michael loved doing that.”</p>
<p>“Michael would always say that everything from the Super Bowl to the Preakness was a ‘Once in a lifetime opportunity,’” said his wife Shannon Diven.</p>
<p>A standout offensive lineman for the Brashear High School football team that won two City League championships, Mr. Diven played ball for East Carolina University, then Duquesne University, where he earned a bachelor's degree in political science and history in 1993.</p>
<p>During his senior year at Duquesne, he ran for the 4th District seat in Pittsburgh City Council, and though he didn’t win, Mr. Diven got noticed by people like Allegheny County Commissioner Tom Foerster.</p>
<p>The late Mr. Foerster hired Mr. Diven as a staff member and taught him the fine art of constituent services.</p>
<p>Four years after his initial defeat, Mr. Diven won a seat on council as a 27-year-old, the youngest person to be elected to council at the time.</p>
<p>Councilman Anthony Coghill, who has represented District 4 since 2017, grew up with Mr. Diven and played football alongside him at Brashear.</p>
<p>“He was a great guy, who was super smart, super intelligent,” said Mr. Coghill, who was 3 years ahead of Mr. Diven in school. “In politics, we weren’t always on the same side and we fought against each other, but we also fought for each other and with each other. He was a warrior and I’ll miss him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Diven went on in 2000 to secure the 22nd Legislative District seat previously occupied by the late Frank Gigliotti, who was indicted for extorting bribes.</p>
<p>But Mr. Diven, a Democrat, balked at the strong-arm tactics of then-party leaders like Bill DeWeese and Mike Veon, and quickly found himself on the outs in Harrisburg.</p>
<p>When your dad was Joey Diven Sr., a legendary tough guy dubbed by Sports Illustrated as “the best street fighter who ever lived”&nbsp;— who taught you and your brother to play “one-punch,” a game in which one brother would stand still to take the other’s best shot (and could return the favor if he was still standing)&nbsp;— you probably aren’t a guy who is going to back down to political leaders wearing suits that cost more than your first car.</p>
<p>And Mr. Diven didn’t temper his moderate viewpoint, calling out leaders in an email&nbsp;— “a 2 a.m. ramble” his wife recalled&nbsp;— that he sent to the entire House delegation, part of which said, “I’m 6’5” 280 lbs. and a former Golden Gloves fighter, so don’t let your mouth write checks your body can’t cash,” according to news reports at the time.</p>
<p>“He was applauded the next morning, walking down the hall of the state House floor by both Democrats and Republicans,” his brother said. “Staff members walked out of their offices to shake his hand.”</p>
<p>Afterward, party leaders did their best to oust him from office during the 2004 primary election, steering an unprecedented $100,000 in funding to the opposition candidate. Mr. Diven won.</p>
<p>In 2005, Mr. Diven switched party affiliations after breaking ranks with the Democrats over several key issues and ran as the GOP candidate for state Senate in the 42nd District in a race to replace Jack Wagner, who had been elected state auditor general.</p>
<p>He lost to Democrat Wayne Fontana and returned to his Democratic Party roots in 2009 in an unsuccessful bid for an open district judge seat in the South Hills.</p>
<p>After his career in politics, Mr. Diven worked as a consultant and developed a youth boxing program in which amateur fighters from Pittsburgh would travel to and host members of the Drimnagh Boxing Club in Ireland.</p>
<p>“Boxing was a love of his because of my father’s history and his relationship with [light heavyweight champion from Pittsburgh] Billy Conn,” Joey Diven Jr. said. “Michael fought for the Brookline Golden Gloves and loved what it did for him and he knew what it meant for the kids. He knew that for some of them, it was their way to get out.”</p>
<p>Mr. Diven organized the first bout&nbsp;—&nbsp;called the Donnybrook&nbsp;— on St. Patrick’s Day 2014 at the Priory Hotel on the North Side with promoter Tom Rooney, cousin of Steelers owner Dan Rooney, and John Graf, president and CEO of the Priory Hospitality Group.</p>
<p>“We never hosted a boxing match before,” Mr. Graf recalled. “We literally sat down in January and they wanted to do this thing in the middle of March. I was skeptical, but he was supremely confident that we could work it out.”</p>
<p>Not only did Mr. Diven organize the event and secure sponsorships with Mr. Rooney’s help, they arranged free travel for the Irish team and packed the hotel’s Grand Hall with 800 spectators. The proceeds benefited local nonprofits.</p>
<p>“He got these massive, 6-foot-tall posters of old-time boxers and wrapped them around the columns,” Mr. Graf said. “It really made the place shine and there was such polish to the event. It was elbow to elbow, and I was stunned that he and a group of buddies from Brookline did it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Graf wasn’t the only person who was impressed.</p>
<p>“A movie scout came to the Donnybrook and they recreated it for the movie ‘Southpaw’ with Jake Gyllenhaal,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Diven organized similar exchanges between amateur boxers from Pittsburgh and Italy and later Pittsburgh and Cuba, with the “Battle of the Bridge,” held before a capacity crowd&nbsp;— and an estimated 11 million Cubans watching on live television — on the Roberto Clemente Bridge in 2016.</p>
<p>“At one time, Pittsburgh had something like more than half of the boxing champions in the country and Mike wanted to keep the flame going,” Mr. Rooney said. “He was an avid boxing historian and he kept the sport alive.”</p>
<p>Mr. Diven persevered through challenges in his life with defiance and determination, loved ones said.</p>
<p>“When Mike was told he couldn’t do something, he doubled down and did it anyway,” said his wife, who met him at a wedding. “It was kind of like that with me&nbsp;— he told everyone at our table that I was the girl he was going to marry. He would ask me out, and I always said, ‘No, thank you.’ I finally agreed to go out with him to the groundbreaking for PNC Park [in 1999] as long as it wasn’t a date. But I liked his sense of humor and how he was able to bring people together. That’s kind of what won me over&nbsp;— he just had a way with people.”</p>
<p>The couple recently celebrated their 15th wedding anniversary and have three children between the ages of 9 and 13.</p>
<p>“That was his biggest job, and his biggest accomplishment was raising his kids,” his brother said. “He was with them every day.”</p>
<p>Along with his wife, children and brother, Mr. Diven is survived by his mother, Barbara E. Diven. He was preceded in death by his father.</p>
<p>Family and friends will be received from 2-8 p.m. Friday at Frank F. Debor Funeral Home, 1065 Brookline Boulevard, 412-561-0380. Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Saturday, at 10 a.m., in the Church of the Resurrection (St. Teresa of Kolkata Parish) in Brookline.</p>
