<h1>Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board loosens rules for outdoor service</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is loosening up the procedure by which bars and restaurants may serve and sell alcoholic beverages in outdoor areas as they reopen to customers in the green phase of the statewide reopening plan.</p>
<p>An establishment typically must go through an approval process to be able to extend their licensed premises to sell or serve alcohol in an adjacent but unlicensed outdoor area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Wednesday the agency announced that, to facilitate outdoor dining and service, it is temporarily adopting an expedited approval process&nbsp;that immediately allows licensees to sell and serve in adjacent, previously unlicensed outdoor areas, waiving both the $220 application fee and the minimum&nbsp;30-day waiting period.</p>
<p>A licensee -—&nbsp;club, restaurant, retailer, hotel, distillery, winery or&nbsp;brewery&nbsp;— still must submit a plan, which must prove that it has approval to occupy an adjacent space not under its control, such as a city sidewalk. The licensee need only to make a printout upon applying online to operate in the outdoor area for as long as the public health crisis lasts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existing rules allow establishments to sell some beer, wine and even mixed drinks on their licensed premises for customers to consume off-premises and in unlicensed areas, but the PLCB reminds everyone that social distancing guidelines must be followed in either case, and that the State Police Bureau of Liquor Control Enforcement will issue citations if the rules are not followed.&nbsp;</p>
