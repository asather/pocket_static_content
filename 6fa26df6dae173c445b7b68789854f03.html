<p>NEW YORK — New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Thursday the state would ban all gatherings with 500 or more people to battle the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The governor said the ban would start for most places on 5 p.m. Friday. Broadway theaters would be affected earlier.</p>
<p>Mr. Cuomo said venues of under 500 people can only be filled to half their capacity.</p>
<p>Some of New York City’s most esteemed cultural institutions announced Thursday that they are shutting down because of the coronavirus, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall.</p>
<p>“The Met’s priority is to protect and support our staff, volunteers, and visitors,” Daniel Weiss, the museum’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. The museum will close its three locations starting Friday. No date for reopening was given.</p>
<p>The opera company said all performances have been canceled through March 31. Carnegie Hall also announced it was closing its doors at midnight Thursday for all public events through the end of March.</p>
<p>The announcements came after Mayor Bill de Blasio said he hoped to avoid closing all public events such as Broadway shows.</p>
<p>Mr. De Blasio said on CNN, “I don’t want to see Broadway go dark if we can avoid it. I want to see if we can strike some kind of balance.”</p>
<p>A part-time usher and security guard who worked at two theaters in recent days tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and is under quarantine, according to the Shubert and Nederlander organizations, Broadway’s largest theater chains.</p>
