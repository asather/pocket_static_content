<h1>Pitt dominates North Carolina to sweep season series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At times, it was jarring, unbelievable and, for many of the 12,376 fans gathered inside the Petersen Events Center, jubilant to see what was unfolding on the court Saturday between Pitt and North Carolina.</p>
<p>For extended stretches of the Panthers’ 66-52 victory, one of the most powerful and iconic programs in the sport wasn’t just getting overpowered and outmanned. It was getting dominated, falling behind by as many as 23 in the game’s opening 17 minutes. It’s undeniably a down year for the Tar Heels, who lost a handful of first-round NBA draft picks from last season’s team and have fallen to 8-9 this season amid a slew of injuries to key players, but to see players in those baby blue, argyle-studded uniforms representing that program was, among any number of suitable adjectives, stunning.</p>
<p>The contest didn’t remain in that state, as a late push from North Carolina and some cold second-half shooting from its opponent led to a more palatable final score, but for the Panthers, they still ended with a perfectly suitable result. After going 59 months without a victory against the Tar Heels, Pitt now has two in the past 10 days.</p>
<p>Sophomore guard Xavier Johnson provided the team’s most forceful offensive push, matching a season high with 20 points and dishing out six assists. Junior guard Ryan Murphy also finished in double figures, scoring 13 points and making three of his eight 3-pointers.</p>
<p>The game’s surprisingly lopsided tone was set early.</p>
<p>Pitt, which entered the day shooting 41.3 percent on the season, made 10 of its first 15 shots and after North Carolina went 4:40 without a point, the Panthers’ lead was up to 16, 26-10. Over a stretch of 11:18, the Tar Heels made just two field goals, a span in which they were outscored by Pitt, 26-8. In the final 11:30 of the first half, Johnson nearly outscored North Carolina by himself (scoring 12 points to his opponent’s 13).</p>
<p>By halftime, an uneven and unpredictable Panthers (12-6, 3-4 ACC) offense had scored 43 points, shot nearly 50 percent from the field, averaged 1.34 points per possession and led one of the sport’s most decorated all-time programs by 20, 43-23, controlling every facet of the game they could.</p>
<p>Pitt’s offense was sparked by an overbearing, unrelenting defense, one that had five steals in the game’s first 12:16 and forced 11 turnovers in the first half. Off those miscues, the Panthers got 18 points.</p>
<p>Pitt missed 17 of its 22 shots in the second half, but the Tar Heels (8-9, 1-5) were never able to get closer than 10 points.</p>
