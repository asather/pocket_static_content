<h1>Beacon of truth: Dr. Fauci is America’s straight shooter </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In this time of great uncertainty over the spread of the COVID-19 virus, the nation has found a true beacon of integrity and hope in Dr. Anthony Fauci.</p>
<p>The country’s top infectious disease expert, who is leading the White House effort to stem the coronavirus pandemic, constantly provides information, analysis and projections based on sound medical science and research. In the course of his briefings, we find hope — and determination — that the country will defeat this aggressive, invisible enemy.</p>
<p>The 79-year-old physician, who has been a top adviser to six presidents on health issues ranging from HIV/​AIDS to Ebola, has offered tempered responses to President Donald Trump’s sometimes overly optimistic comments about the COVID-19 outbreak. While the president promotes a malaria drug as a possible treatment, Dr. Fauci calmly points out that although there have been anecdotal positive results, there is very little testing to date on such treatment and there are considerable health risks. When Mr. Trump expressed hope of restarting the economy by Easter, it was Dr. Fauci and other medical professionals who provided the models and projections — again based on science — that the virus could claim more than 100,000 American lives, and that social distancing must remain in place.</p>
<p>He has become the face of the battle against the coronavirus, a straight-shooter in a time when the country needs to hear the truth above all else.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it has also made Dr. Fauci an online target for those who don’t see him as a full-throated devotee of Mr. Trump and his outlook on the crisis.</p>
<p>What has emerged are online conspiracy theories that try to discredit Dr. Fauci. Conservative groups promote the hashtag #FauciFraud and post anti-Fauci messages throughout social media platforms.</p>
<p>Health and Human Service Secretary Alex Azar was concerned enough about the online attacks that he asked the department to conduct a threat assessment. The Justice Department then approved a request to deputize security for Dr. Fauci.</p>
<p>While others might be alarmed at such developments, Dr. Fauci has taken it all in stride.</p>
<p>“I’ve chosen this life. I mean I know what it is,” he told NBC’s “Today” show. “There are things about it that are sometimes disturbing. But you just focus on the job you have to do, and just put all that stuff aside and try as best as possible not to pay attention to it.”</p>
<p>America will get through this crisis by relying on science and medicine, and for that we can be thankful Dr. Fauci is leading the way.</p>
