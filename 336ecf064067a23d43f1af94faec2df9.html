<h1>Gov. Wolf botches good-luck message for Pirates and Phillies on MLB's Opening Day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Wolf heard quite a lot from Pirates fans yesterday, and he got himself in hot water again with the Pittsburgh sports faithful Thursday evening.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Pennsylvania’s governor <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/22/Pirates-Blue-Jays-PNC-Park-official-summer-Buffalo-home-games-Canada/stories/202007220078" target="_blank">vetoed a proposed plan</a> that would have the suddenly homeless Toronto Blue Jays play some of its home games at PNC Park during the 2020 MLB season. Wolf’s decision was made due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19, and it disappointed some Pirates fans who were looking forward to hosting a second MLB team in Pittsburgh this year.</p>
<p>Earlier this evening, though, Wolf made a gaffe on Twitter while trying to wish the state’s pro baseball teams good luck on Opening Day that will probably be even more objectionable to Pirates fans. See if you can spot his mistake.</p>
<p>Yes, that is the governor of Pennsylvania getting the Phillies’ hashtag right but misspelling “Bucs” in the rally cry #LetsGoBucs. To be fair, he eventually deleted that original tweet and posted an amended one with the correct spelling of “Bucs.”</p>
<p>However, Pittsburgh Twitter’s reactions to the original tweet are still around in all their indignant glory.</p>
<p>The #LetsGoBucks hashtag has been used in support of the Ohio State Buckeyes, an egregious mistake in the minds of some Pittsburghers.</p>
<p>Some also pointed out that the hashtag also sounds like he’s wishing the Milwaukee Bucks good fortune during the upcoming restart to the NBA season.</p>
<p>Wolf obviously has much more important things to worry about than getting the Pirates’ secondary nickname right in a tweet. Luckily for his mental bandwith, Pirates fans made it abundantly clear exactly how he botched this otherwise innocuous message.</p>
