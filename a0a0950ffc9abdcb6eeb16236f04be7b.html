<h1>Pa. Commonwealth Court panel hears argument over Marsy's Law</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An attorney representing the League of Women Voters told a panel of the Pennsylvania Commonwealth Court on Wednesday that the Marsy’s Law proposed amendment for victims’ rights is unconstitutional and would take away protections for those accused of committing crimes.</p>
<p>During oral argument before a five-judge panel, Steven Bizar said that the proposed amendment violates the single-subject rule required under the law.</p>
<p>The initiative, which was included on November’s general election ballot, asked whether a new amendment, known as the Crime Victims’ Rights Amendment, should be added to the state Constitution.</p>
<p>However, the League of Women Voters, with support from the American Civil Liberties Union, filed a lawsuit weeks before the election, arguing that the ballot question was too vague and did not properly inform voters on the actual issues encompassed by the proposed amendment.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Court granted a preliminary injunction that prohibited the votes on the general election ballot from being counted.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court upheld that decision, and Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar asked for an en banc hearing before the Commonwealth Court.</p>
<p>During argument broadcast by the court on YouTube, Mr. Bizar said that the ballot question is unconstitutional because it covers multiple subject areas and because it failed to include each provision of the amendment in the language — meaning voters would not be aware of what, exactly, they were voting for.</p>
<p>Commonealth Court President Judge Mary Hannah Leavitt repeatedly interrupted Mr. Bizar with questions during his 20 minutes of argument and suggested that the already existing Crime Victims Law isn’t much different than the proposed amendment.</p>
<p>Mr. Bizar said to comport with the single-subject rule, consideration must be given to content, purpose and effect.</p>
<p>“We’re focused on the process of amending the Constitution,” he responded.</p>
<p>Mr. Bizar said that the proposed amendment covers 15 issues, ranging from notifying victims about hearings; to giving them a say in bail considerations to allowing them to refuse to turn over discovery, which would directly impact the rights of a defendant to obtain evidence in his or her favor.</p>
<p>“These rights are not connected to one another,” he said. When a voter is considering the question, he continued, “they can’t reject some and approve others under this combo meal.</p>
<p>“It’s all or nothing.”</p>
<p>Judge Leavitt replied, “To me, 15 different rights are given to crime victims.”</p>
<p>She asked, “Is it your position that it requires 15 different amendments?”</p>
<p>Mr. Bizar replied, “No.”</p>
<p>But he continued, “The rights are not so sufficiently interrelated that they can be presented as a single subject. They are implicating different phases of the criminal justice process.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bizar also suggested that the amendment violates the doctrine of Separation of Powers because it intrudes upon the prerogative of the judiciary.</p>
<p>Later, when asked by Judge Leavitt if there was any manner the proposed amendment could be presented to the voters without violating Separation of Powers, Mr. Bizar replied, “The proposed amendment has too many things going on.”</p>
<p>David H. Pittinsky, who represents a group of voters and crime victim advocates who sought to intervene in the case, told the Commonwealth Court that the ballot question satisfies the single-subject rule.</p>
<p>Mr. Pittinsky argued that the issue is governed by a 2005 state Supreme Court case, which requires that to pass muster, an amendment must be “sufficiently interrelated to just one question.”</p>
<p>All 15 victims’ rights enumerated in the ballot question “relate to enhancing victims’ rights and enshrining them in the Pennsylvania Constitution.”</p>
<p>“All 15 are germane to a common goal of protecting victims and their families,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The test, Mr. Pittinsky continued, isn’t whether the question touches other subjects, but whether it “facially affects” them.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to imagine any amendment approved by voters that wouldn’t have some arguable affect on other provisions,” he said.</p>
<p>Nicole Boland, who represented Ms. Boockvar in the argument on behalf of the state attorney general’s office, said the language of the ballot question was sufficient.</p>
<p>“Amendments don’t have to be short or simplistic,” Ms. Boland said. “They can address many rights. The fact that it may be long and complex doesn’t render it void.”</p>
<p>She also argued that the amendment does not infringe on the judiciary’s ability to do its job.</p>
<p>“It would have to facially affect compulsory process, and that doesn’t happen,” she said. “This is just their rank pessimism about how the provision is going to be applied.</p>
<p>“The voice of the people should be heard.”</p>
<p>Although the Commonwealth Court and state Supreme Court ordered that November’s ballot question not be tabulated, the amendment was approved by more than 70% of voters.</p>
