<h1>Covestro employees take pay cut as pandemic takes toll on sales, income </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Covestro employees are taking a temporary pay cut as the plastics and chemicals producer copes with staggering losses from the global pandemic.</p>
<p>The pay cut impacts about 750 employees who work at the German-based company’s North American headquarters in Robinson.</p>
<p>“Effective in June, Covestro in North America implemented a temporary compensation reduction for a period of six months,” said Bob Walker, a company spokesman. “This decision is part of the company wide approach to help offset challenges resulting from the coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
<p>The pay cut includes workers across the board but the company declined to specify the amount of the reduction.</p>
<p>Covestro employs about 3,000 total workers in North America and 17,200 in 30 countries worldwide.</p>
<p>In second-quarter results released Thursday, the company swung to a loss of 52 million euros ($60 million) from net income of 189 million euros in the second quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>Sales dropped by 33% to 2.2 billion euros from 3.2 billion last year.</p>
<p>Covestro makes plastics and chemicals used in insulation, electronics and for other applications including the automotive industry, which was experiencing a slowdown even before the pandemic forced carmakers to shutter factories.</p>
<p>In April, it lowered its full-year guidance for earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to between 700 million and 1.2 billion euros, from previous guidance of 1 billion to 1.5 billion euros.</p>
<p>While it confirmed that guidance Thursday, the company said “the uncertainties associated with the consequences of the coronavirus pandemic for economic development remain high.”</p>
<p>Markus Steilemann, chief executive, said in a statement, “As anticipated, the global coronavirus pandemic had a significant impact on our results in the second quarter.</p>
<p>“We took the right measures in timely fashion to protect our employees, maintain production and supply chains, and ensure continuous supply to our customers,” said Mr. Steilemann. “We have managed to accomplish that very successfully to date and will continue to steer Covestro resolutely through this crisis.”</p>
