<h1>Bridgewater police sued on federal excessive force claims after marina incident</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Beaver County man has sued the borough of Bridgewater and two of its former police officers in federal court, saying they shocked him with a Taser and beat him unconscious after handcuffing him on his boat docked at a marina.</p>
<p>David Mileham and his lawyer, Joel Sansone, named the borough and two officers, Jeremy Conley and Nathan Swierkosz, as defendants. Officers&nbsp;Conley and&nbsp;Swierkosz now work for different municipalities.</p>
<p>Mr. Mileham accuses the two officers of using excessive force and the borough of not properly training them.</p>
<p>Mr. Mileham does maintenance for Bridgewater Marina and Landings and the management lets him keep his boat there. He said he's allowed to be at the marina, use its dock and parking lot, its garage and its bathrooms at all times.</p>
<p>On June 12, he and a guest arrived at the marina at 11:30 p.m. and boarded his boat. He then got off and walked to the garage to get a propane lighter.</p>
<p>The two officers pulled up in a patrol car and Officer Conley asked Mr. Mileham for his name. He told the officer his first name. When the officer asked for his last name, Mr. Mileham said, he did not give it and walked away towards the garage, retrieved the lighter and then boarded his boat.</p>
<p>He said he didn't act in a dangerous or threatening way at any time, but the two officers boarded his boat. He told them to get off.</p>
<p>"Without provocation," the suit said, one of the officers used a Taser on him, with one prong entering his back.</p>
<p>Officer Conley then grabbed him, pinned him on the floor and handcuffed him, the suit said. The officers moved him to the back of the boat and used the Taser on him again while he was handcuffed, then removed him from the boat and threw him on the dock. There, according to the suit, Officer Conley punched him in the face.</p>
<p>Mr. Mileham's guest witnessed the episode, as did Officer Swierkosz, who did nothing to stop Officer Conley, according to the suit.</p>
<p>The two officers then dragged Mr. Mileham by his arms and legs and Officer Conley got on top of Mr. Mileham and punched him repeatedly in the face until he lost consciousness, the suit said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mileham said he suffered injuries to his eyes and face and couldn't see for two days.</p>
<p>The suit said there have been other incidents involving Officer Conley and Bridgewater police officers that involve similar allegations of excessive force.</p>
<p>The suit also said the borough "knew, or should have known, that Defendant Conley previously engaged in illegal, aggressive and excessive conduct" and didn't do anything to stop it.</p>
<p>Mr. Mileham is seeking unspecified damages for his injuries and emotional trauma.</p>
<p>Bridgewater's municipal offices were closed Thursday evening and no one could be reached there.</p>
