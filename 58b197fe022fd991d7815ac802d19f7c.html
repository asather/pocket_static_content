<h1>You might have a better chance now at filling your Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits online cart</h1>

<p>The struggle to put wine or spirits in those online shopping carts has been real, but the situation could ease up. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has increased the order fulfillment facilities from three to 49, and more are on the way soon.</p>
<p>The PLCB announced Thursday afternoon that it ”has&nbsp;significantly increased the number of orders it is accepting on a daily basis at FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Board Chairman Tim Holden said the PLCB aim to have 121 fulfillment centers picking and packing e-commerce orders this weekend. “We’ve made significant progress in improving service to Pennsylvania consumers seeking access to wines and spirits.”</p>
<p>After March 16, the liquor control board shut all 600 of its stores and its online sales to reduce the risks and spread of COVID-19. It moved to&nbsp;reopen online sales April 1, but the online store was open only in a limited and random way — and&nbsp;that meant many people could not actually buy anything. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/04/15/PA-PLCB-special-order-sales-online-wine-spirits/stories/202004150059" target="_blank">A lot have been frustrated.</a>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Holden said Thursday, “We’re accepting 6,500 orders through our website, an 850 percent increase since April 1, when limited e-commerce sales resumed, and a 261 percent increase over the 1,800 orders we had been consistently accepting each day for a number of days.”</p>
<p>The 121 fulfillment facilities&nbsp;— existing Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits stores and licensee service centers — that are “anticipated” to be operating by this weekend include 18 in Allegheny County, which previously had one.</p>
<p>The others and their locations are: One in Adams, two in Berks, one in Blair, nine in Bucks, one in Butler, two in Centre, 10 in Chester, one in Clearfield, one in Crawford, four in Cumberland, four in Dauphin, 10 in Delaware, one in Erie, one in Franklin, one in Indiana, one in Lackawanna, four in Lancaster, four in Lehigh, one in Luzerne, one in Lycoming, two in Monroe, 17 in Montgomery, three in Northampton, 11 in Philadelphia, one in Union, one in Washington, one in Wayne, three in Westmoreland and four in York.</p>
<p>Access to the online store is still randomized, the PLCB says, “to avoid overwhelming the site with high traffic, prevent order abuse, and prolong access throughout the day so that order availability isn’t exhausted in seconds or minutes each day.”</p>
<p>Mr. Holden said that while consumer interest continues to be bigger than the PLCB’s ability to process orders, “We ask consumers’ patience as we explore options to serve our customers while honoring public health guidance during this unprecedented disruption.</p>
<p>“We believe that continuing to expand access to FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com in a controlled manner will allow us to provide access to consumers while also protecting our employees and consumers from unnecessary risk, but we acknowledge our website can’t handle the daily volume our network of nearly 600 stores supported.”</p>
<p>If you do get “in’ to the online store, you may order up to six bottles —&nbsp;per single transaction per day — from a reduced selection of top-selling wines and spirits. All orders must be shipped to a home or other address where someone 21 or over can show a valid ID to accept it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Shipping costs, calculated at the end of the ordering process, vary with delivery location, but standard rate is&nbsp;$12 for one to three bottles, plus $2 for each additional bottle.&nbsp;Orders totaling more than $99 before sales tax and shipping ship to homes for free.</p>
<p>The PLCB is not considering reopening stores yet, although the agency continues to monitor the situation in consultation with the Wolf administration and public health officials.</p>
<p>The agency reminded people that they still can buy alcoholic beverages for off-premises drinking from nearly 1,000&nbsp;breweries, wineries, and distilleries in the state.</p>
<p>They can also purchase beer from distributors as well as from some&nbsp;restaurants and eating places. Wine is available from some&nbsp;grocery stores and convenience stores as well as from more than 1,200 licensed direct wine shippers.</p>
