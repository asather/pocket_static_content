<h1>Monroeville Mall movie theater bans unaccompanied minors on weekend nights </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Starting Friday, minors looking to catch a movie at Monroeville Mall on weekend nights will need an adult to accompany them.</p>
<p>Cinemark Monroeville Mall and XD implemented a new policy that does not allow anyone under the age of 18 to see a movie at 6 p.m. or later on Fridays and Saturdays without an adult present, according to Cinemark spokesperson Caitlin Piper.</p>
<p>Ms. Piper said the new policy is “in-line with the Monroeville Mall policy currently in affect.”</p>
<p>The mall implemented a permanent youth escort policy in 2017 that prohibits visitors under the age of 18 from entering the mall without a parent or guardian 21 years or older on Fridays and Saturdays after 6 p.m.</p>
<p>The guidelines apply to the the entire mall except stores with exterior entrances, according <a href="https://www.monroevillemall.com/content/Security" target="_blank">to the Monroeville Mall website</a>.</p>
<p>Although visitors must enter through the mall to access Cinemark, the theater that opened in 2013 was exempt from the mall’s policy as there is an exit adjacent to the theater, Monroeville Mall spokesperson Stacey Keating said.</p>
<p>Ms. Keating referred all questions to Cinemark as to why the theater decided to abide by the mall’s policy now.</p>
<p>Ms. Piper said the theater could confirm that the policy has been put into place at this time.</p>
<p>Monroeville Mall’s escort policy was one of several steps taken over the years, including placing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2017/03/16/Monroeville-security-surveillance-video-cameras-police-camera-system-crime-prevention-mall-Monroeville-safety/stories/201703160144" target="_blank">additional surveillance cameras</a>, to tighten up security after several incidents of loitering and fighting led to arrests and citations.</p>
<p>Ms. Keating said the escort policy was the result of feedback from the community, retailers, and local officials.</p>
<p>But disturbing incidents have continued on mall grounds as recently as 2019.</p>
<p>In September of last year <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/06/shots-fired-outside-Monroeville-Mall/stories/201909060124" target="_blank">two men were charged</a> after shots were fired in the parking lot outside of the Cinemark Theater, which sits on the south side of the mall.</p>
<p>Months earlier in April, police <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/04/12/Gunshots-Monroeville-Mall-Pittsburgh/stories/201904120144" target="_blank">responded to gunfire</a> outside of the mall that prompted a lock-down.</p>
<p>No one was injured in either shooting, which involved adults ages 18 or older.</p>
