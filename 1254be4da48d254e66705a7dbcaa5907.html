<h1>Pitt makes routine work of Austin Peay to start season that's far from normal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Where many saw a nondescript, season-opening game between a major-conference program and a woefully overmatched opponent from a smaller school, Pat Narduzzi saw Pitt’s matchup Saturday against Austin Peay as something much different.</p>
<p>It was a chance to play, sure — which can’t be discounted during a global pandemic that has forced two of college football’s Power Five conferences to postpone their seasons — but more than that, it was an opportunity to show that this Pitt team, Narduzzi’s sixth with the program, was different. In recent years, the Panthers have made an aggravating habit of eking out uncomfortably close wins against inferior opponents from lower levels of the sport. Last season, it was a 17-14 win against Delaware. Eight years ago, they beat Maine by only six. Youngstown State alone has given them all kinds of fits, taking them to overtime in 2017, losing by just eight in 2015 and even decisively beating them, 31-17, in 2012.</p>
<p>With virtually all of a dominant defense and a third-year starting quarterback returning, the pieces are in place for this Pitt team under Narduzzi to distinguish itself from its predecessors. Against the Governors, it did its best to show it, scoring touchdowns on each of its first six drives and building a 42-0 lead by halftime en route to a 55-0 thumping at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“We talked all week just about coming out and making a statement,” Narduzzi said. “I told the guys probably about a week and a half ago, maybe two and a half weeks ago, I guess when camp broke we started working on Austin Peay, that we were going to come out and make a statement. And since I’ve been here I felt like we haven’t come out and exploded against anybody. I don’t want to say played down, but the big emphasis today was to come out and play up and we were going to show that we were a different football team and really make a statement to the country about who we are and what kind of weapons we have on really all three phases of the game.”</p>
<p>Even as the season began, bringing a semblance of normalcy to a world so thoroughly devoid of it the past six months, the scene at Heinz Field was still decidedly off. Due to gathering limits imposed in Pennsylvania, the stadium was empty. The Panthers were facing an opponent they had <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/08/28/Pitt-football-Austin-Peay-Panthers-Governors-NCAA-ACC-Gerald-Harrison-Heather-Lyke-Pat-Narduzzi/stories/202008280041" target="_blank">added to their schedule just 18 days earlier</a>, an oddity in a sport in which contests are often negotiated several presidential administrations in advance. Pitt was without seven of its players, not due to the kind of injuries a violent game has a way of creating, but <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/09/12/pitt-panthers-football-covid19-pandemic-austin-peay-acc-pat-narduzzi-rashad-weaver/stories/202009120082" target="_blank">due to “COVID-related protocols.”</a></p>
<p>Strange and surreal as everything away from the field may have felt, what transpired on it was routine.</p>
<p>A 27.5-point favorite, Pitt almost shattered whatever faint hopes Austin Peay may have had entering the day. In building their six-touchdown halftime lead, the Panthers were unrelenting. They outgained Austin Peay, 420-92, including a 139-1 margin in rushing yards. They averaged 9.5 yards per play, meaning they gained nearly a first down on every snap, and 18.7 yards per completion. With his parents nearby, watching at a local hotel after making the drive from New Jersey, senior quarterback Kenny Pickett threw for 277 yards, which included three completions of at least 51 yards. Five different Pitt running backs found the end zone.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve got more speed, guys running by people and getting some separation,” Pickett said. “I think that will be a huge asset to our game.”</p>
<p>“Some of the things we did with the passing game is going to open up our run game,” Narduzzi said. “He was on fire. He led our offense. He’s the key to our offense. He’s a captain, but he has been a leader for the last three years. He did an outstanding job. I don’t know if you could have played any better than Kenny Pickett played today.”</p>
<p>The game had become so lopsided that the teams mutually agreed at halftime to shrink both the third and fourth quarters from 15 to 10 minutes, the closest thing college football has to the “mercy rule” seen at the high school level.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p>The defense was equally domineering, even without standouts like Rashad Weaver and Keyshon Camp not in attendance (Narduzzi declined to specify whether it was due to COVID-19-related concerns). Outside of a 57-yard completion they allowed in the first quarter, an Austin Peay drive that ended with a missed field goal, the Panthers gave up just 35 yards on 26 plays in the first half, an average of 1.3 yards per play. Seventeen of those plays went for one yard or fewer, many of which were blown up before they could even begin as Pitt’s imposing defensive line manhandled a Governors offensive line that featured only one player heavier than 290 pounds.</p>
<p>With most of its starters sitting for the final 20 minutes, the Panthers added two touchdowns, both of which came off of or were set up by botched Austin Peay punt attempts. The final margin was its most lopsided win since a 62-0 throttling of Delaware in 2014.</p>
<p>“With all the stuff going on in today’s world, I feel like we’re a mentally stronger team,” safety Paris Ford said.</p>
<p>The expectations Pitt’s coaches and players have for themselves are created largely by what the program has brought back from an eight-win 2019 squad, but some of its newcomers showed how much they might be able to add. Freshman Dayon Hayes, a Westinghouse graduate, had two sacks and a forced fumble. DJ Turner, a recently added graduate transfer from Maryland, had a team-high 76 receiving yards, which included a 51-yard touchdown. In his first college game, Jordan Addison had a team-high seven receptions (for 35 yards). Freshman Israel Abanikanda averaged 5.2 yards per carry and scored a touchdown.</p>
<p>Only so much can be taken from a 55-point win against a Football Championship Subdivision team two weeks removed from a loss to Central Arkansas. But, if nothing else, the Panthers provided few reasons to doubt them. The 10 games that follow will show whether this Pitt team truly is different and whether it can shake four decades of mediocrity, but Saturday provided no reason to show it can’t.</p>
<p>Which, as previous years have shown, is something that can’t be discounted.</p>
<p>“A new year and a new team,” center Jimmy Morrissey said. “We expect to have a great season and that was a great game for us.”</p>
