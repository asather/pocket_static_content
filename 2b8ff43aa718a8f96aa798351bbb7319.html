<h1>Democrats to fight ruling to let Green Party stay on state ballot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Democrats on Thursday signaled their intent to appeal a lower court decision ordering election officials to put the Green Party’s candidate for president on the ballot in the battleground state of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>They filed an intent to appeal the case to the state Supreme Court, where the Democratic majority-panel could decide the last remaining legal hangup before ballots can be mailed out to voters who applied for one.</p>
<p>The Democrats’ protest targets what they say are disqualifying irregularities in how the Green Party candidates for president and vice president filed affidavits that accompany paperwork to get them on the ballot.</p>
<p>The lower court judge, a Republican, dismissed arguments that the presidential nominee, Howie Hawkins, should be barred from the ballot, but agreed that the Green Party’s vice presidential nominee should be barred.</p>
<p>In 2016, Republican Donald Trump beat Democrat Hillary Clinton by 44,292 votes in Pennsylvania, helping him win the White House. The Green Party’s nominee that year, Jill Stein, drew slightly more votes than that, 49,941.</p>
<p>Democrats have already dropped their challenges to Green Party candidates for three statewide offices, attorney general, treasurer and auditor general.</p>
