<h1>UPMC to roll out more COVID-19 testing, bolstering push to restore non-emergency procedures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>UPMC is rolling out broader COVID-19 testing of patients and medical staff, with the eventual goal of collaborating with public health agencies in widespread public testing for the highly contagious disease.</p>
<p>In a briefing Tuesday, Donald Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at UPMC, said that patients will be tested before having procedures done at the hospital and that medical staff also would be screened. UPMC’s walk-in surgery centers will remain closed, so non-emergency procedures will be done at the Pittsburgh-based health system’s hospitals.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf and public health officials have said that wider access to testing for COVID-19 was key to the decision to restart commerce and ending coronavirus mitigation efforts, which include banning non-essential travel and social distancing. Less than 1% of Allegheny County residents have been tested for the new coronavirus, Health Department Director Debra Bogen has said.</p>
<p>UPMC’s plans for expanded testing dovetails with the health care giant’s goal of ramping up non-emergency operations to full surgical capacity in six weeks, which conflicts with a March 19 directive by Mr. Wolf and guidelines from four physical and medical trade groups.</p>
<p>Dr. Yealy said he didn’t think there would be a problem.&nbsp;“We don’t believe it will put us in conflict with the state Department of Health and county,” he said, both of which had been notified of UPMC’s plans.</p>
<p>Hospitals considering the restoration of non-emergency operations should be “authorized by the appropriate municipal, county and state health authorities,” according to an April 17 recommendation by the American College of Surgeons, American Society of Anesthesiologists, Association of periOperative Nurses and American Hospital Association.</p>
<p>UPMC said Monday it was following guidance issued Sunday by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which emphasized flexibility in restarting services to “allow facilities to provide care for patients needing non-emergent health care.”</p>
<p>In a press briefing Tuesday, Mr. Wolf said opening the state would be an “evidence-based, data driven decision.”</p>
<p>“We need to be driven by what the virus is doing,” he said. ”We’re all dealing with the same enemy here.”</p>
<p>Responding to a follow-up inquiry, state Health Department spokesman Nate Wardle said Tuesday that the Wolf administration does “not feel now is the time that hospitals should resume these services.”&nbsp;Some hospitals in the state, which were at near capacity, were running out of protective equipment and 1,200 new cases of COVID-19 were reported statewide Tuesday, he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Yealy saw reason to be encouraged. The number of COVID-19 cases that UPMC, which has 40 hospitals, has seen did not significantly increase from a week ago and only 2% of the system’s 5,500 hospital beds are filled by people with the disease, he said.</p>
<p>“We are on the other side of what was supposed to be our worst week, our Pearl Harbor,” Dr. Yealy said. “What we’re not comfortable with is disruption in care for patients without COVID-19. We want to serve every patient who needs essential care.”</p>
<p>UPMC Chief Quality Officer Tami Minnier said results from the system’s internally developed COVID-19 test can be available in six hours or less and some 600 patients can be tested per day.</p>
<p>“We’re not waiting for the problems to be solved by others,” Ms. Minnier said. “And we don’t let anything in this pandemic stop us.”</p>
