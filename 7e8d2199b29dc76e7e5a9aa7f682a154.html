<h1>In Washington, COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes turn focus to federal oversight of long-term care facilities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Last June, Pennsylvania Sens. Bob Casey, a Democrat, and Pat Toomey, a Republican, teamed up to unveil a list of nearly 400 troubled nursing homes, including four in the Pittsburgh region, that had been singled out for federal scrutiny&nbsp;yet put on the back burner&nbsp;by the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The list included the Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center, where the state’s worst COVID-19 outbreak has prompted the state to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/08/State-will-impose-a-temporary-manager-at-troubled-Beaver-County-nursing-home-again/stories/202005080110" target="_blank">impose a temporary manager</a> and call in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/10/National-Guard-help-Beaver-County-nursing-home-Brighton-Wellness-COVID-19/stories/202005100104" target="_blank">40 troops from the&nbsp;Pennsylvania National Guard</a>&nbsp;for a weeklong stint.</p>
<p>The devastating spread of COVID-19 in Brighton and other nursing homes has cast a spotlight on gaps in federal oversight and the long-standing dearth of&nbsp;resources available to facilities tasked with housing some of the most vulnerable residents.</p>
<p>In Washington, lawmakers from both parties and nursing home experts recently have ratcheted up pressure on the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency that sets nursing home standards and defers much of the inspection and oversight work to state agencies.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>As most of the country begins to gradually reopen their economies, experts have advised that many of the nation’s 15,000 nursing homes will urgently require more COVID-19 testing and protective equipment to rein in the virus.</p>
<p>CMS, an arm of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, has defended its COVID-19 response as “rapid and aggressive,” pointing to <a href="https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-independent-commission-address-safety-and-quality-nursing-homes" target="_blank">a series of actions taken since February</a> to advise nursing homes. Next month, the agency plans to launch a commission that will draw up recommendations, by Sept. 1, to improve nursing home safety amid the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This inherent challenge makes a comprehensive review of the nation’s response in this area imperative, as we seek to protect nursing home residents both today and in the future,”&nbsp;CMS Administrator Seema Verma said this month. The agency did not respond to questions for this story.</p>
<p>Last Thursday, at the first Capitol Hill hearing on nursing home oversight, Mr. Casey criticized CMS for failing to release data showing COVID-19 cases by facility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We know that nursing homes have unfortunately became ground zero in this pandemic, yet there’s still no national strategy,”&nbsp;said Mr. Casey, the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, which called the hearing.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about basic information,” Mr. Casey said, “so we can direct and target the resources to the nursing homes that need it the most.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania officials released&nbsp;data last Tuesday on COVID-19 cases and deaths at nursing homes and personal care homes in the state, which <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/20/Pennsylvania-nursing-homes-COVID-19-outbreaks-cases-deaths-data-St-Barnabas/stories/202005190159?cid=search" target="_blank">revealed several significant outbreaks</a> at facilities in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>Sen. Susan Collins, R-Me., chair of the aging committee, said she also asked CMS to provide more supplies and expand testing and data collection. She noted half of all deaths in her state of Maine — the oldest state by median age — have been reported in nursing home facilities.</p>
<p>The outbreak in Brighton, has led Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, to demand a federal investigation, calling for CMS to step in where the Pennsylvania Department of Health&nbsp;had been slow to act, he said.&nbsp;Brighton has reported at least 358 positive cases among its 460 residents who lived there at the beginning of the pandemic, and at least 76 of them have died from COVID-19 related causes.</p>
<p>He also called for more frequent inspections, which are required every 9 to 15 months.</p>
<p>“It’s clear from looking around the country that there are infection disease protocols not followed adequately enough at a lot of these facilities,” Mr. Lamb said earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;“While we believe that inspections are taking place, it obviously has to be a lot more than once a year.”</p>
<p><strong>Changing the narrative</strong></p>
<p>Yet the calls for more oversight rankle many in the nursing home industry, who argue the pandemic exposed how a lack of funding for nursing homes&nbsp;created chronic shortages in staffing and supplies.</p>
<p>“Our outbreak has really brought to the forefront shortcomings as a result of the underfunding,” said Cynthia K. Morton, executive vice president of the National Association for the Support of Long Term Care, in an interview.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to make people who need 24/7 care a priority, and it’s been tough to get prioritization thus far in this pandemic,” Ms. Morton said.</p>
<p>In response to questions, the American Health Care Association/National Center for Assisted Living, an industry trade group, released a statement calling for more federal aid.</p>
<p>“We need the government and public health officials to focus on getting widespread testing and much needed supplies to our long-term care providers instead of focusing the narrative on more penalties,” David Gifford, the group’s chief medical officer, said in a written statement. “More oversight or additional fines and penalties on nursing homes could reduce critical resources these centers need, or even put them at risk of closing.”</p>
<p>Industry lawyers said their clients had faced unfunded mandates in recent years that required additional staffing, training, disaster and emergency preparedness.</p>
<p>“We don’t think there needs to be any more regulation, but there needs to be more funding to be able to implement what they’re requiring,” said Terri Harris, a partner with Fox Rothschild.</p>
<p>Nursing homes run mostly on a patchwork of government reimbursements through Medicaid and Medicare, said R. Tamara Konetzka, professor of health services research at the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>Ms. Konetzka — who said she is considering sending in an application for CMS’ nursing home commission — said the COVID-19 pandemic should force a tougher conversation about how long-term care is paid for.</p>
<p>“Unless we rethink this whole structure, all quality improvement initiatives and policies are going to be somewhat limited in their effect,” Ms. Konetzka said.</p>
<p>Though Congress appropriated $175 billion in emergency funding for health providers, the Trump administration has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/05/12/health-providers-federal-aid-funding-Medicaid-home-care-COVID-19-Pittsburgh/stories/202005130017?cid=search" target="_blank">not yet released guidelines</a> on how Medicaid providers can qualify.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>More testing and PPE</strong></p>
<p>In last Thursday’s Senate hearing, Mr. Casey said he recognized the funding shortfalls. He pressed for Congress to approve his bill that would deliver $20 billion in aid to help facilities conform with federal health guidelines, purchase medical supplies and boost health workers’ pay and benefits. More than two dozen trade associations, including AARP, have endorsed the measure.</p>
<p>But those who gave testimony said the scale of the problem is staggering and will only get bigger.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steven H. Landers, president and CEO of the Visiting Nurse Association Health Group, a nonprofit home health care provider based in Holmdel, N.J., said his company has burned through 17,000 surgical masks and 3,500 N95 masks each week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“That’s what they’re trying to find on the market, and it still remains a challenge for them to track down enough vendors,” said Dr. Landers, whose organization treats&nbsp;9,000 patients at home, including 650 patients with COVID-19.&nbsp;“That’s how we’re able to continue to serve, is by having that protective equipment.”</p>
<p>He added, “I’ve never seen the system so stressed.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Capitol Hill aides said there remains no immediate movement to expand CMS’ Special Focus Facility program — the oversight program targeted by Pennsylvania senators last year. The program designates for more stringent reviews 88 facilities that have shown a pattern of poor care.</p>
<p>Yet the senators uncovered four times the number of&nbsp;facilities that qualified for the program but weren’t being actively investigated, a shortcoming CMS has blamed on lack of resources from Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said earlier this month he believed the Brighton facility was unprepared for the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“Many nursing homes face extreme challenges in controlling the spread of COVID-19 infection, but for those like Brighton, whose documented histories of poor performance would qualify them as a Special Focus Facility, heightened safeguards should have been implemented in the weeks leading up to the outbreak,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
