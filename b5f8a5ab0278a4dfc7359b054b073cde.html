<h1>Sources: AT&amp;T SportsNet to offer compensation for lost Pirates, Penguins work</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>AT&amp;T SportsNet, the TV home of the Pirates and Penguins, will compensate production personnel for lost work because of the COVID-19 pandemic, multiple sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Friday.</p>
<p>Those who would normally be working Pirates games will be paid through their first 10 scheduled home assignments, plus for a March 13 spring training contest that never happened because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>On the Penguins side, those people will be paid for three additional dates (March 12, 14 and 15) as a gesture of goodwill while all parties involved hope that regular season play will eventually resume.</p>
<p>The group affected — everyone from camera operators to audio and video techs — was told today, sources told the Post-Gazette. The move affects a total of about 50 Pittsburgh-based freelancers, independent contractors and union folks.</p>
<p>Major League Baseball suspended the start of its season for at least eight weeks on March 16, following recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NHL wants its players to self-quarantine through April 15, meaning it probably also won't restart until May, if at all.</p>
<p>The Pirates would be two games into a seven-game homestand. Ten home games translates into the first three series, taking those part-time/freelance employees through April 23. Full-time employees are unaffected by any of this.</p>
