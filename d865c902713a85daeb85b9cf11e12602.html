<h1>Disclose supply spending: Few details available about government purchases </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State governments working through this crisis can’t dispense with providing open access and transparency about spending on emergency supplies.</p>
<p>That’s exactly what’s happening in many cases — billions spent by states, primarily for medical equipment, and little information available online or even in printed form.</p>
<p>Yes, the nation is facing a crisis, but that doesn’t excuse the possible waste of taxpayer money to procure and stockpile equipment. Without good information, it’s impossible to know money spent wisely from money thrown away.</p>
<p>The information needs to be available promptly. If possible fraud or waste is detected months after funds are spent, it’s much harder to make a fix — and not avoid a second round of spending mistakes. Disclosure matters because most states have abandoned bidding requirements during the pandemic. And many suppliers now require prepayment.</p>
<p>The Associated Press conducted a survey of 50 states and found only limited public information on purchases of items such as masks, gloves, gowns and other supplies.</p>
<p>States must disclose the details of coronavirus emergency spending. General totals of spending on supplies won’t cut it. That’s all some states offer at this point.</p>
<p>Other questions beg to be answered: How much money is being spent on each purchase? What supplies is the money being spent for? Who is being paid to produce the supplies?</p>
<p>Ideally, states would follow the practice of Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza. She posts information on the items purchased, the vendor, the date of the purchase and the cost. Cost is a critical factor since it allows comparisons and would make it possible to spot problems, whether of price gouging or good old- fashioned wasteful spending by the government.</p>
<p>It could best be accomplished by getting the information out online. In an age where governments place all sorts of documents, including bids for services online, it shouldn’t be impossible to publish the numbers on coronavirus spending.</p>
<p>The coronavirus crisis cannot justify keeping people uninformed and unable to judge for themselves if governments are making wise decisions in spending on coronavirus supplies.</p>
<p>Let the people see how their government spends the money. That is true at all times — even, and specially, in pandemic times.</p>
