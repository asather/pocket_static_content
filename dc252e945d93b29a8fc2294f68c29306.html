<p>Three people were taken to local hospitals after a Port Authority bus and private vehicle crashed in Allentown Thursday.</p>
<p>The victims’ conditions are unknown but do not appear to be life threatening, said Adam Brandolph, Port Authority spokesman.</p>
<p>The crash occurred about 5:30 p.m. as a Y46 Elizabeth Flyer route bus was traveling inbound at the intersection of Arlington Avenue and Newton Street, on the border of Allentown and the South Side Flats.</p>
<p>“The private automobile apparently crossed a double yellow line and made contact with the bus head on,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Both the bus driver and male driver of the other vehicle were taken to UPMC Mercy. A male bus passenger was taken to Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>The crash temporarily closed Arlington Avenue from East Warrington Avenue to P.J. McArdle Roadway, delaying several Port Authority bus and light rail routes that are using the Arlington Avenue detour while the Mount Washington <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/01/08/Mount-Washington-transit-tunnel-closed-to-inbound-traffic-due-to-faulty-sewer-drain/stories/202001080138" target="_blank">transit tunnel remains closed to inbound traffic due to a landslide</a>.&nbsp;</p>
