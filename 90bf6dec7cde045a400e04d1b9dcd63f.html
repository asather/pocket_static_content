<h1>Steelers WR Diontae Johnson practices after missing previous session with a foot injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Second-year receiver Diontae Johnson was back on the practice field Friday one day after missing practice due to a foot injury. It was a bit of good news for the Steelers, as they already know they’ll be without starting right guard David DeCastro, who will miss the opener with a knee injury.</p>
<p>Johnson first appeared on the injury report Thursday, but it appears the starting receiver opposite JuJu Smith-Schuster will be able to play.</p>
<p>“He means a lot to us,” Smith-Schuster said. “He knows the playbook, he can play inside and outside. He did a great job today. He’s going to be a huge asset for this offense moving forward.”</p>
<p>The Steelers will release the injury report later this afternoon.</p>
