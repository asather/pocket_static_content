<h1>Biden will visit Shanksville on Sept. 11</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like he did twice as vice president, Joe Biden will travel to Shanksville this Sept. 11 to commemorate the anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks.</p>
<p>His presidential campaign announced Wednesday that he'd make the trip alongside his wife, Jill, to Shanksville -- a few miles south of the Flight 93 National Memorial.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Mr. Biden will speak at the memorial, which holds an annual service to honor the passengers and crew members on Flight 93 who fought back against hijackers and forced the plane to the ground -â€”thwarting another attack.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, as vice president, spoke at the memorial in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>Last year, the current vice president, Mike Pence, delivered remarks at the anniversary ceremony.</p>
<p>No further details were immediately available</p>
