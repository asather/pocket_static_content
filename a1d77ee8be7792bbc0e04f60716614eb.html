<p>Pat Narduzzi isn’t a fan of college football’s transfer portal. Back in March, he called it the “ugly toilet portal.”</p>
<p>But a couple weeks ago, Narduzzi acknowledged that Pitt would be open to taking a transfer from a school that isn’t playing this fall due to COVID-19. “If we have a scholarship left and it’s the right player at the right position, there’s no question about it,” Narduzzi said. “We’ve always got our ears open.”</p>
<p>That approach landed quarterback Kenny Pickett another player to target this fall.</p>
<p>Former Maryland wide receiver DJ Turner has transferred to Pitt, Narduzzi said on Tuesday afternoon’s Zoom call with reporters. Turner is a graduate transfer with one year of immediate eligibility.</p>
<p>Turner, a preseason 2020 All-Big Ten selection by Athlon Sports, recorded 24 receptions, 294 receiving yards and one touchdown in 30 games with Maryland.</p>
<p>Turner arrived on campus last week and practiced with Pitt for the first time Tuesday. The former four-star prospect and DeMatha Catholic (Md.) standout has a previous relationship with Pitt wide receivers coach Chris Beatty, who mentored Turner while a Maryland assistant prior to his time at Pitt.</p>
<p>Narduzzi said it “won’t take long” for Turner to forge a relationship with Pickett and noted that the wideout’s impact will be felt “Week 1,” when the Panthers open their season against Austin Peay on Sept.12 at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>Turner, a fifth-year senior, redshirted last season after playing in just three games. He was charged last September with driving under the influence of alcohol and suspended before Maryland’s game against Penn State, <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/terps/bs-sp-maryland-wide-receiver-turner-transfer-portal-20200821-nnefgxax4bhxnmwxfdluo5mn3a-story.html" target="_blank">according to The Baltimore Sun</a>.</p>
