<p>HARRISBURG — Republican leaders in Pennsylvania’s House of Representatives called Thursday for one of their members to resign after a newspaper disclosed the existence of videos posted to a since-deleted social media account in which he encourages his 5-year-old son to draw from a cigar and use profane language.</p>
<p>In a two-sentence statement, House Republican leaders said they are “disgusted” by the conduct of second-term Rep. Aaron Bernstine, R-Lawrence.</p>
<p>“In order to take the time necessary to focus on his family and repair his relationships, we call on Rep. Bernstine to immediately resign,” they wrote.</p>
<p>House Democratic leaders urged him to heed the call to resign.</p>
<p>The existence of the videos on a since-deleted Snapchat account was disclosed by the Beaver County Times.</p>
<p>In a brief video posted to Twitter on Thursday, Mr. Bernstine apologized, saying the videos were recorded on a vacation with his son, his son’s friends and several of the boys’ parents.</p>
<p>“It was jokes that went way too far,” Mr. Bernstine said. “For that, I’m truly sorry, I have to do a much better job as a role model for my child. I’ll continue to work on that and me and my family are addressing it as a private matter.”</p>
<p>He also said he intended to keep running for re-election next month and warned that “party bosses will try to take advantage of the situation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bernstine is on the Nov. 3 ballot for a third two-year term, facing a Democratic challenger and a United Party challenger.</p>
