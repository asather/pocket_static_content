<h1>Pitt mailbag: Will February struggles ail the Panthers again?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Aileen</strong>: February has been a notoriously tough month for Pitt in years past. Is physical/mental fatigue a real issue for a young team? I realize that kids that play D-I basketball are playing a lot of basketball in HS — a lot more than the average HS kid. It is a long season.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: That it is, Aileen, and you make a great point about Pitt’s February struggles in recent years.</p>
<p>In the past five seasons, the Panthers have gone 15-41 from the start of February on. Though it’s obviously bogged down a bit by it, that figure’s not a product of the winless 2017-18 squad. Pitt didn’t finish better than 5-7 in any of the four other seasons. Over the past three seasons, they have gone 6-26. Part of that has to do with competition picking up that time of year, as a team is less likely to have a great record in a conference as tough as the ACC, but ... woof.</p>
<p>I think there’s certainly the possibility for the team this season, especially for someone like Justin Champagnie, a freshman on whom Pitt leans quite a bit. He may very well be the team’s most important player, so any dip he experiences would hurt considerably. But I think part of last season’s swoon happened because two of your top players, the ones who had the ball in their hands an overwhelming percentage of the time, were both freshmen who did hit something of a wall, especially Trey McGowens. I think that year of experience helps a ton. The team then also didn’t have quite as much talent as it does now, so that fall-off had a pronounced effect.</p>
<p>The good news for Pitt the next few weeks: its schedule isn’t all that difficult, especially in a year in which the ACC isn’t close to what it normally is. After Tuesday’s game at Duke, its next five contests are against teams that are ranked 62nd or worse on KenPom.com. Nothing is guaranteed in this sport, but that’s a favorable setup.</p>
<p><strong>Todd:</strong> On Capel's radio show, he gave some really high praise to Ithiel Horton. Is he going to be a major contributor to this team next year, or is it "Malik Ellison has been our best player in practice" syndrome?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think he’ll make an immediate impact. There wasn’t a rush on the coaching staff’s part to try to get him eligibility this season (not that it was even a likely outcome) because they believe he can be an important contributor for teams that are in a better position to excel in the years to come. In his lone season at Delaware, he was impressive, averaging 13.2 points per game while shooting about 41% from 3-point range. He’s more of a combo guard than a point guard — his assist average and assist rate at Delaware were both pretty low — but presuming Xavier Johnson is back next season, that position won’t be a concern.</p>
<p>I feel for Ellison because I think a lot of that rhetoric, and it was definitely out there, was rooted in coaches (understandably) desperate to keep their jobs. I don’t deny that he was probably one of the team’s better players in practices — after all, it did finish 8-24 — but seeing what even Jared Wilson-Frame was in his two years at Pitt, I have a hard time believing Ellison was <em>that</em> much better than the rest of his teammates. In the end, it just created unrealistic expectations he was unable to meet.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: Since most ACC teams have a frontcourt size advantage on Pitt, why do you think Coach Capel seems adverse to having two big guys (Any combo of Brown, Hamilton,Coulibaly) in the game.A few earlier games it worked quite well. If one gets in foul trouble you just adjust to normal.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: A lot of it depends on matchups. Against Wake Forest, a game in which the Panthers were without Au’Diese Toney, it was disastrous, as a team with a stretch 4 was able to force one of Pitt’s big men into uncomfortable situations on the perimeter. Even against teams that employ two big men, like North Carolina, I don’t think it would be all that effective, mostly because Pitt’s frontcourt is far from a strength right now. It’s just height for the sake of it.</p>
<p>As things stand, I think they’re best off with a lineup featuring McGowens and Johnson in the backcourt, Champagnie and Toney as versatile wings, and a big man. That, or three guards — Johnson, McGowens and Ryan Murphy — with Toney/Champagnie and whichever big man is playing the best that day, be it Terrell Brown, Eric Hamilton or Abdoul Karim Coulibaly. Lineups generally work best when you roll with your best players rather than trying to fit what can be an arbitrary construct.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: How much of the “stand around for 25 seconds then have X or Trey throw up a ridiculous shot” offense is Capel allowing it because the options on offense are so limited, and how much of it is just X and Trey going rogue? If it’s the latter, why hasn’t Capel been able to stop them?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> It’s a product of his options. For as great as Champagnie has been, Johnson and McGowens are the team’s only two playmakers off the dribble, so they invariably have to lean on them much more. That makes for some gruesome offensive possessions, with the ball being hoisted up late in the shot clock after little movement or progress was made in the first 20-25 seconds, but I don’t think that’s a result of them going rogue in any kind of way.</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: In honor of the Grammys, what are the musical artists you view to be the most overrated?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’m going to tread lightly on this, mostly because I rarely begrudge folks for their taste in music. What sounds good to you sounds good to you, even if it may not to me or other people. But mostly, it’s because some of these artists have insanely overzealous fans who I don’t want to upset too much, should they stumble upon this mailbag for whatever reason.</p>
<p>Let’s give this a try (in no particular order):</p>
<p>The Eagles: Jeffrey Lebowski was right on these dudes.</p>
<p>KISS: They’re brilliant promoters and marketers, but their song lyrics could be written with a crayon.</p>
<p>Weezer: We touched on them in last week’s mailbag.</p>
<p>Nas: Part of this stems from their one-time beef, but the fact he regularly gets brought up alongside Jay-Z is baffling. Illmatic might be the best hip-hop album ever, but he hasn’t done a whole lot since.</p>
<p>Eminem: A groundbreaking artist whose talent is unquestionable. Some of his music has aged REALLY poorly, though.</p>
<p>Basically any modern, chart-topping country artist: It’s just pop with a twang.</p>
<p>Daughtry: I don’t know how highly he’s regarded, but he deserves more scorn. For as much crap as Nickelback and Creed get, they at least had a couple of good songs, which is more than I can say for this guy.</p>
<p>Taylor Swift: I don’t get it.</p>
<p>Beyonce: I think the image and iconography of her outstrips her musical catalog. Having said that, though, I’m going to announce my resignation from the Pitt beat so that I can enter witness protection.</p>
