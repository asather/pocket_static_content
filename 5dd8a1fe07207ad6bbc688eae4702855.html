<h1>Eight students at Pitt barred from campus over violations of COVID-19 related safety guidelines</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh has barred eight students from campus over violations of health and safety guidelines implemented this month as the school returns students to the university for fall classes amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In recent days, Pitt placed nine fraternities and sororities on interim suspension. The school's Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner had warned that large gatherings and parties as students were moving in had placed reopening plans in jeopardy.</p>
<p>Pitt officials on Wednesday did not specify the transgressions and or if the eight students now barred from campus belong to the Greek Life system.</p>
<p>"Pitt has placed eight students on interim persona non grata status, meaning these students are restricted from campus and all university facilities," university spokesman Kevin Zwick said.</p>
<p>"While this figure shows the majority of Pitt students are respecting health and safety guidelines, the university will continue to take action when bad behavior puts our campus community at risk."</p>
<p>As the second week of classes began on the campus of 29,000 students, Pitt reported that 11 students and five employees had tested positive for the virus, a positive rate of less than 1% that officials called encouraging.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, spikes in infections on college campuses have led schools to sanction organizations and individual students. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill switched its fall undergraduate semester to be entirely online, after clusters developed in residences and at least one fraternity house.</p>
<p>The nine Greek Life organizations sanctioned at Pitt include: Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Delta Delta Delta and Delta Chi, Alpha Tau Omega, Chi Omega, Kappa Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi Epsilon.</p>
