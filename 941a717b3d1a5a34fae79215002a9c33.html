<h1>Parks Conservancy disagrees with Peduto administration's bill to establish tax</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two separate developments occurred this week surrounding the city’s planned implementation of the parks tax, and several parties, including council members and the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, are asking whether voters are going to receive what was promised.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy on Monday hand delivered a letter to Mayor Bill Peduto and all city council members taking issue with language in the Peduto administration’s tax-establishing legislation that states council must approve the half mill property tax levy each year.</p>
<p>Voters on Nov. 5 approved the .5 mill property tax increase — $50 on every $100,000 of assessed real estate -— to fund city parks. The tax is expected to raise roughly $10 million a year.</p>
<p>In the letter signed by conservancy CEO and President Jayne Miller, Ms. Miller writes that she applauds&nbsp;“prompt action to implement the charter amendment” but expressed concern that the “tax levy is optional on the part of city council.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>An attached legal opinion addressed to the city’s Law Department argues that the annual approval by council is&nbsp;“at odds with both the expressed language of the charter amendment and the understanding of the voters,” wrote&nbsp;attorney Clifford B. Levine, of the Downtown-based firm Dentons Cohen &amp; Grigsby.</p>
<p>Mr. Levine further argues that while the city’s Home Rule Charter — the city’s governing document&nbsp;— assigns taxation power to council, there are a “few exceptions,” one of those being when a tax is outlined in the Home Rule Charter.</p>
<p>“This was not a simply advisory referendum ... It’s set in stone in the charter,” Mr. Levine said by phone after the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette obtained a copy of the letter.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s administration said Tuesday that funds have to be approved by city council, according to Timothy McNulty, the mayor’s spokesman.</p>
<p>The administration introduced the ordinance Feb. 4, codifying that revenue must be allocated to a parks trust fund and that the millage rate is only effective for 2020, pending council approval for subsequent years.</p>
<p>The ordinance is expected to be discussed by council Wednesday and is being held for a public hearing.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to work with the conservancy and with council,” Mr. McNulty said.</p>
<p>The conservancy did not respond to request for comment on the legal opinion.</p>
<p>Council President Theresa Kail-Smith called the letter “unfortunate” because “the very first communication from them, at least for my office, came in the form of a certified letter.”</p>
<p>In a late addition to the council agenda Tuesday, Councilman Ricky Burgess, chair of the Urban Recreation Committee, introduced a resolution that would adopt the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy’s&nbsp;“Parks Plan” as the “official plan of the City of Pittsburgh’s Parks Trust Fund,” according to resolution language.</p>
<p>The plan was touted by the conservancy during a listening tour in the months that led up to the Nov. 5 ballot referendum for which the nonprofit petitioned.</p>
<p>The six-year plan calls for&nbsp;$22 million for waste pickup, playground and pool maintenance, landscaping and other maintenance, followed by $11.6 million in rehabilitation of benches, restrooms, lighting and other general fixes.</p>
<p>Next, roughly $10.2 million would go toward large capital projects that would be decided using a equitable scoring formula that also takes into consideration environment issues. The smallest amount, about $2.5 million, would be devoted to family activities, sports, music performances and other programming.</p>
<p>“What struck me was the voters voted on a plan that had never been received by the city. ... I want to bring the plan directly into city government,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>According to his resolution, any changes to the plan would need to originate from the mayor’s office and approved by council.</p>
<p>The conservancy is&nbsp;“pleased” with Mr. Burgess’ proposal, according to a written response.</p>
<p>“The Parks Plan, developed by the Parks Conservancy in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, is a comprehensive equitable investment strategy, driven by data and community input. Ultimately, it is the plan that the people of Pittsburgh voted ‘yes’ to on November 5, 2019. We look forward to working alongside City officials, as we have for the past 24 years, as we continue our mission of restoring Pittsburgh’s parks to excellence,” wrote John Pepper, conservancy spokesman.</p>
<p>Though the conservancy presented the plan at several public meetings, the ballot referendum did not explicitly outline the six-year plan.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess’ bill is the third to be introduced in relation to the parks tax revenue.</p>
<p>Initial legislation to establish a parks trust fund sponsored by members Anthony Coghill and Deb Gross — that aimed to establish council as the governing board of the funds and split it equally among the nine districts —&nbsp;was found to be illegal by the city’s Law Department and has been overhauled by bare-bones amendment language. The bill is also being held for a public hearing.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith had instructed Mr. Coghill and Mr. Burgess to work together on a new plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Coghill said he had&nbsp;“zero notice” about Mr. Burgess’ new proposal Tuesday.</p>
<p>“To go all in with the [conservancy] at this point is way too early,” Mr. Coghill said.</p>
<p>Ms. Gross said she and Mr. Coghill are first waiting to see an audit of the city’s existing agreements with the Parks Conservancy before approving any agreements with the organization.</p>
<p>“I think everyone should understand that though the voters, by a slim margin, supported the referendum, that was not an endorsement of the Parks Conservancy as an organization,” Ms. Gross said.&nbsp;“Nor was it an endorsement of this plan that I do not believe many public citizens have read or know about it.”</p>
<p>The Parks Conservancy did not respond for comment on either issue.</p>
