<p>CLEVELAND — It wasn’t long ago that the finish line to the 2020 season felt excruciatingly far away for the Pirates, the two-month sprint appearing more like a marathon because things had gone so poorly.</p>
<p>Now, it looks like the Pirates are energized and would rather keep playing after finally getting the offense and defense to match the exemplary starting pitching they’ve enjoyed over the past dozen games.</p>
<p>In fact, after Saturday’s 8-0 victory over the Indians at Progressive Field, it’s interesting to think what would happen to the Pirates if the season was extended another month or so.</p>
<p>Would things even out? Would the Pirates be more competitive? Manager Derek Shelton thinks so.</p>
<p>“I think we would have been a different team to watch,” Shelton said. “We're seeing a lot of encouraging signs. And when you see more encouraging signs, you wish you had more games to see how this would play out.</p>
<p>“I’m not saying by any stretch of the imagination that we would be in the playoffs or win the World Series, but I think our record would indicate that we're getting better.”</p>
<p>Where this sudden stretch of decent baseball stems from is interesting. And it’s due to more than simply the emergence of Ke’Bryan Hayes, although the rookie did have an incredible night Saturday with five hits in five plate appearances (more on that shortly).</p>
<p>After another impressive start, Joe Musgrove (seven shutout innings, 10 strikeouts) talked about a discussion that was had among the Pirates’ starting pitchers. The playoffs were toast, the same for many of the goals that were previously thought to be attainable. So the message shifted.</p>
<p>The new impetus became improving individually, whether that’s with a mentality, the execution of pitches, game-planning, whatever. Just get better and forget worrying about the big picture. The message seemingly sprouted legs.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 games dating back to Sept. 16, Pirates starting pitchers have a 1.46 ERA that leads Major League Baseball. They’ve struck out 75 in 74 innings and have allowed just three home runs, limiting opponents to one or no runs in 10 of those 12. Over the past eight, Pirates starters have a 0.72 ERA.</p>
<p>“When you’re still in the race and still in the hunt, there’s a lot more on the table, and there’s a lot more at stake,” Musgrove said. “We’re professionals. We should be able to perform and put everything forth regardless of the scenario or the circumstances. But I think once that pressure was removed, we were able to take a step back.</p>
<p>“There are so many things that we can improve on, and I feel like as a staff we did a really good job these last two weeks of making that jump.”</p>
<p>The Pirates starting pitchers are hardly alone. Defensively, the Pirates made it through another game without an error, bringing their season-best stretch to 59 innings. They’ve made just one error in their past eight games overall.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a few guys who have scuffled are starting to hit the ball better of late, including Bryan Reynolds and Colin Moran, who both homered Saturday.</p>
<p>Reynolds drove one the opposite way to left-center field, a spot at Progressive Field that Shelton described as “big boy land.” Moran obliterated a breaking ball into the second deck in right.</p>
<p>“Really good, aggressive swings,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Especially the ones that came from Hayes, whose all-fields approach is mature beyond his years. Musgrove said that Hayes was beating himself up over a 1-for-3 night Friday, thinking that the world was going to end.</p>
<p>However, by late Saturday, he said he had flushed those thoughts and actually had Indians players talking about the possibility of him going 5-for-5.</p>
<p>“It feels really good,” Hayes said. “I just feel a lot more free at the plate. I feel like I’m in my backside more, and I’m able to read pitches. Honestly, I don’t even feel like I’m having to swing as hard to hit the ball as hard.”</p>
<p>The win helped the Pirates (19-40) win for just the third time in 19 tries against the American League Central this season. They also snapped a five-game losing streak against Cleveland and improved to 6-21 on the road.</p>
<p>Musgrove was especially impressive, specifically with the number of swings and misses he was able to generate. The right-hander induced 52 swings from Indians hitters, 20 of them whiffs (38%).</p>
<p>Musgrove actually hasn’t allowed a run over his past two starts, totaling 13 innings and 21 strikeouts.</p>
<p>“The stuff’s good,” Musgrove said. “Just locking in the delivery and the movements, being able to be repeatable and try to attack each inning as a singular inning and not look at the outing as a seven-inning performance. Just get three outs at a time. Really focusing on getting the first guy out in the inning takes a lot of pressure off of you. It allows you to flow better, and when your offense puts up runs like they did [Saturday], it takes a lot of pressure off and allows you to go into attack mode and really just challenge guys.”</p>
<p>From the looks of things, Musgrove isn’t the only one who has enjoyed the benefit of less pressure, which has allowed the Pirates to start thinking some positive thoughts about next season.</p>
