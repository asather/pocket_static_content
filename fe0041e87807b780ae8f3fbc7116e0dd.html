<h1>In just 3 hours, 10,000 sandwiches were donated at Oakmont Bakery</h1>

<p>Two white tents stood empty in the back parking lot of Oakmont Bakery on the rainy Monday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four cars drove past the tent at 12:30 p.m. to check out whether Oakmont Bakery was still handing out 10,000 sandwiches for free. According to the bakery’s general manager Tony Serrao, they had already given away the sandwiches at 11 a.m.</p>
<p>Since a line of cars had wrapped around Third Street all the way around Pennsylvania Avenue by 8 a.m., organizers decided to start the drive-through early.&nbsp;</p>
<p>People from all walks of life — those working from nursing homes, truck drivers and children who rely on free school lunches — came through Oakmont Bakery’s parking lot amid financial crises related to the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Serrao said about 25 people, including the owner of Turner Dairy, staff from Oakmont Bakery, Lamagna Cheese Co., Oakmont Deli, Giant Eagle in Verona, members of the Riverside Community Church and Oakmont police officers directing traffic, helped keep the drive-through giveaway organized and safe.</p>
<p>Steve Turner, the marketing manager of Turner’s Dairy, said he was at the event from 7 a.m. to 9:30 a.m., gathering sandwiches and milk for people. Turner’s Dairy donated 20,000 half pints of milk cartons to the giveaway. Mr. Turner said his company jumped to the occasion because they’ve always focused on taking care of the community through helping out at local food banks.</p>
<p>“The way that Pittsburgh in general just takes care of their own and the sense of community is extremely important,” Mr. Turner said.&nbsp;“We’re all in the same boat and we’re all going to get through this one way or another together.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Drivers just had to pull up to the drive-through giveaway and workers placed the food directly into the trunks of their car. Health officials came down to check on how the event was going, Mr. Serrao said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the thousands of people estimated to have come through this morning, Mr. Serrao said 412 Food Rescue was able to take 2,500 sandwiches to deliver to neighborhoods across the area.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just within a couple of hours working the event, Mr. Serrao had the opportunity to hear a lot of positive feedback from attendees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Just hearing the stories from people was just so heartwarming. Everyone was like&nbsp;‘you have no idea what you’re doing for us and this other family,’” Mr. Serrao said, in reference to those who were picking up sandwiches for neighbors who couldn’t get out of their house.</p>
<p>Mr. Serrao said he would be interested in collaborating again with other businesses to help those in need. For now, the bakery will continue to donate leftover food at the end of each night to homeless shelters, women abuse centers and nursing homes, according to Mr. Serrao. Ruled as an essential business, Oakmont Bakery hopes to continue keeping the business running its normal hours of 6 a.m. to 7 p.m. to help support their customers and workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was really just something to shine a little light during this dark time for everybody,” Mr. Serrao said.&nbsp;“Just to see everyone come together at this time, this is what Pittsburgh is all about.”&nbsp;</p>
