<h1>State officials report 71 more COVID-19 deaths; 3 more in Western Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials on Friday reported 71 more deaths and about 1,600 new cases due to COVID-19, with&nbsp;Allegheny County announcing 2 new deaths and 28 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There were 38,652 total cases — confirmed and probable — in Pennsylvania and 1,492 total deaths, as of Friday.</p>
<p>Of Allegheny County’s 71 reported total deaths, 64 were confirmed (had a positive test) and 7 probable. One of the deaths was at a nursing home. A probable death is one in which COVID-19 is listed on a death certificate, but the person never had a positive test for the virus. Those who have died from the novel coronavirus range in age from 42 to 103, the county said.</p>
<p>The new data brings the county’s total number of cases to 1,177 —&nbsp;with 1,146 confirmed and 31 probable.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;Western Pennsylvania, there was 1 new death reported in Fayette County, for a total of 4.</p>
<p>The county has the highest totals in Western Pennsylvania. Philadelphia County has the state’s highest totals in cases and deaths, with 10,507 and 272, respectively.</p>
<p>Since the first case was confirmed on March 14, Allegheny County has administered 14,358 tests. Of its cases, 208 people have required hospitalization, with 82 of those requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit and 50 needing mechanical ventilation, according to the county.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine&nbsp;stressed on Thursday that the state would only use data about confirmed cases and deaths — those in which the patient received a positive test result — in making decisions about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/22/Pennsylvania-Governor-Wolf-color-coded-plan-begin-reopening-lockdown-coronavirus/stories/202004220164" target="_blank">reopening regions of the state</a>.</p>
<p>She explained that the reopening process under <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/22/Pennsylvania-Governor-Wolf-color-coded-plan-begin-reopening-lockdown-coronavirus/stories/202004220164" target="_blank">the governor’s new color-coded plan</a> would be region-by-region, not county-by-county. To be moved from the current “red” to “yellow,” which under the governor’s plan would allow the reopening of some retail locations, raise the cap on gatherings to 25 and open childcare facilities, a region must first have an average new caseload of no higher than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over the previous 14 days.</p>
<p>“It’s not going to be counties that are isolated,” Dr. Levine said. “If we have a county where the rest of the region is having significant outbreaks of COVID-19, but they might meet that criteria, we would not open that region.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County would need to have less than 625 cases in 14 days to meet the state’s threshold. In the 14 days before Friday, the county reported 424 positive cases out of about 5,000 people tested, county officials noted. But they added that there needs to be more testing to have a better estimate of the case rate, and the county’s estimate does not address other counties in the region that the state will be considering.</p>
<p>There are other factors the state will consider — meeting the numerical criteria is not a guarantee of a change from red to yellow. A host of other metrics, including the availability of testing, the strength of contact tracing in the region and the capacity of hospitals will also be considered, Dr. Levine said.</p>
