<h1>Rod Woodson: Steelers defense reminiscent of 'Blitzburgh' units from 90s</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers are blitzing more than any team in the NFL, bringing back memories of the 1990s “Blitzburgh” era defenses that perfected the zone blitz and rode that success to three AFC championship game appearances in four seasons.</p>
<p>The Steelers are blitzing 51.2% of the time, by far the most of any team a quarter of the way through the season. The Steelers led the league in sacks in each of the past three seasons and blitzed somewhere between 36-38% of the time.</p>
<p>This year they’re leading the league again, averaging five per game. If there is a downside to bringing so much pressure, it’s the added responsibility it places on the secondary.</p>
<p>The Steelers have given up some big plays early in the season, and opposing teams are throwing for an average of 236 yards per game. That’s an increase of 42 yards per game compared to last season, when the Steelers were the NFL’s third-ranked pass defense.</p>
<p>The Steelers secondary has been the subject of some criticism early in the season, if for no other reason than something to nitpick. But it’s not concerning at all to one of the more famous players from those Blitzburgh Steelers.</p>
<p>Rod Woodson, the Pro Football Hall of Fame defensive back who played for the Steelers from 1987 until 1996, likes the tweaks the Steelers have made early in the season, including the increased blitz rate.</p>
<p>“That’s not a lot,” Woodson said, in reference to the increased passing yards allowed. “I’m a believer in putting pressure on opposing quarterbacks and speeding up their reads. I like that. They have all the pieces to the puzzle to have a great defense.”</p>
<p>Woodson played on some great defenses with the Steelers, but he also played for the 2000 Ravens, who are considered among the greatest defenses in the history of the NFL. That Ravens team set the NFL record for fewest rushing yards against in a season, allowing just 60.6 yards per contest over 16 games.</p>
<p>Those Steelers defenses of the 1990s were stout against the run, as well, and Woodson believes the improved run defense can help the Steelers be even better than they were last season, when they ranked among the league’s top defenses in almost every statistical category.</p>
<p>“What are they giving up, 54 rushing yards a game?” Woodson said. “That’s amazing. I love the Steelers culture. I just remember the edge we played with back when I was there, and I see that same edge in these guys. I see guys like Minkah Fitzpatrick and T.J. Watt and the way they play. It’s going to be fun to see where they end up.”</p>
<p>Woodson considers the Steelers among the contenders in what is shaping up to be a strong AFC.</p>
<p>“Absolutely they are,” Woodson said. “They have a stud quarterback. Listen, everyone is happy Big Ben is back, right? We all had our questions about what was going to happen, but if the elbow was right we all knew it could look like this.</p>
<p>“All great quarterbacks make a difference. Last year JuJu Smith-Schuster and the other receivers struggled. The running game struggled. But I think a lot of that had to do with the quarterback play. Now JuJu looks like a Number 1 receiver again, not a Number 2 or a Number 3.&nbsp;My only concern is the running game. You have to be able to run the ball at certain times. You have to have a good four-minute offense. That’s my only question. But this is an extremely good football team. It’s going to be fun to watch.”</p>
<p><strong>Getting out the vote</strong></p>
<p>Woodson is taking part in an NFL campaign to encourage citizens to vote in the Nov. 3 presidential election. Woodson did not vote when he was younger, but he shared what ultimately changed his mind.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until his father, James, passed away in 1992 that he became enlightened on the subject. After his father’s death, family members shared his father’s beliefs on the importance of voting. Woodson grew up in a biracial family in Fort Wayne, Ind. His father was Black and his mother white.</p>
<p>“My father grew up in Gallatin, Tennessee, and he didn’t have the right to vote in his younger years,” Woodson said. “But I didn’t listen to him until he passed away. That really opened my eyes. My uncle and my aunts told about what he went through when he was younger and the importance of change — the Martin Luther King idea behind equality and the right to vote.”</p>
<p>Woodson believes players of this era are more in tune to what’s happening in the country than his generation. He believes social media plays a role in that, but he acknowledged there are more causes that are engaging younger people.</p>
<p>“If we want to create change and have our voices heard, we have to exercise our constitutional rights,” Woodson said. “Voting is a key initiative we have this year. We’re trying to get people to do that.”</p>
