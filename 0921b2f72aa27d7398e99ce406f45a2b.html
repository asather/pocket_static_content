<h1>Pitt postpones pro day as NFL bans in-person scouting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt’s pro day has been “indefinitely postponed” due to an NFL directive to halt in-person scouting amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The NFL canceled all prospect visits, both at NFL facilities and college campuses, on Friday afternoon. Only online communication is permitted on an indefinite basis as the country and sports world practices social distancing due to the coronavirus spread.</p>
<p>Pitt was originally scheduled to host NFL scouts, coaches and executives at its South Side facility on March 18. Several prospects, including cornerback Dane Jackson and wide receiver Maurice Ffrench, were expected to participate.</p>
<p>This move isn’t a surprise given the past couple of days. The ACC announced Thursday that it suspended all athletic-related activities, including practices, games and recruiting. Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke issued a statement supporting the conference and its commissioner, John Swofford.</p>
<p>“The decision was made with one priority in mind — the health and well-being of our student-athletes,” Lyke said.</p>
<p>Though pro day would not involve current student-athletes, it was hard to see how it would continue as scheduled, with winter and spring sports — at the collegiate and professional levels — suspended or canceled.</p>
<p>As far as other Pitt football events, the state of the Blue-Gold spring game remains in doubt, and spring practice will not continue until the ACC’s suspension of play is lifted.</p>
<p>The NCAA also enacted a recruiting dead period until April 15, restricting official and unofficial visits to campus for high school prospects. Phone calls and text messages between coaches and prospects are still permissible.</p>
<p>“Unfortunate circumstances will not allow us to host unofficial recruiting visits this spring, but we want to make sure everyone stays safe,” Pat Narduzzi said in a statement in regards to recruiting on Thursday. “Take care of yourself and your families, get the job done in class, and we look forward to hopefully getting together in the not too distant future.”</p>
