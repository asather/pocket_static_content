<p>WASHINGTON — The Trump administration is distributing $459 million for Pennsylvania hospitals and health care providers, an effort to get money to providers that had been largely excluded from the first round of medical funding allocated by Congress last month.</p>
<p>The new round of funding, announced Tuesday by Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., will go to 766 health providers and health systems in the state that may have not seen much federal help since the COVID-19 pandemic shut down routine appointments and procedures.</p>
<p>Last month, Congress approved $100 billion in health care funding as part of its $2.3 trillion economic rescue package, intended&nbsp;to cover expenses related to treating COVID-19 patients and make up for lost revenue.</p>
<p>The economic damage caused by postponing services at&nbsp;hospitals and health care providers is expected to be a lasting problem for providers.</p>
<p>Last week, Andy Carter, president and CEO of The Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania, said the state’s providers would lose a combined $10.2 billion in 2020. Even with the CARES Act funding,&nbsp;providers are expected to lose $7.1 billion in 2020.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is indeed a staggering number,” Mr. Carter said on a call with reporters. The economic report “provides the first verified projections of financial toll and confirmed our worst fears.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He added that 34% of Pennsylvania hospitals reported operating losses in 2019.</p>
<p>Yet the initial round of federal funding — which totaled $1.25 billion for nearly 13,000 Pennsylvania health care providers — was allocated by the Trump administration based on 2019 Medicare fee-for-service reimbursements.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Department of Health and Human Services said it based funding on Medicare revenue to speed up the initial disbursement of aid.</p>
<p>“This simple formula used the data on-hand to get the money out the door as quickly as possible,”&nbsp;the department stated in its online materials announcing the distribution.&nbsp;“The administration was transparent and upfront additional funds would be going out quickly to help providers with a relatively small share of their revenue coming from Medicare fee-for-service, such as children's hospitals.”</p>
<p>The second round announced Tuesday will be disbursed based on 2018 net patient revenue. After this round, a total of $50 billion will have been distributed nationwide.</p>
<p>More help will be on the way.&nbsp;Last week, Congress passed a bill allocating another $75 billion, bringing the health fund’s total to $175 billion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funding is reserved for providers located in areas with high numbers of COVID-19 patients and rural areas, Mr. Toomey’s office noted in a media release. Skilled nursing facilities and those that solely take Medicaid patients will receive separate funding.</p>
<p>Details on the distribution of those funds, as well as the additional $75 billion, have not been released, Mr. Toomey’s office stated.</p>
<p>But as the health care funding shows, the authorization of funds by Congress is only the first step. The Trump administration has discretion over how the money is distributed.</p>
<p>Earlier this month,&nbsp;the Democratic lawmakers from Pennsylvania signed a letter protesting the department’s disbursement of health care funding based on Medicaid revenue — not according to how many COVID-19 patients the state has treated.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey estimated Pennsylvania would receive $50,000 per COVID-19 case, while other states with significantly fewer cases would receive more than $300,000 per COVID-19 case.</p>
<p>A Kaiser Health News report on April 10 estimated states like Minnesota, Nebraska and Montana&nbsp;are getting more than $300,000 per COVID-19 case while New York would receive only $12,000 per case.</p>
<p>“To promote one group of providers over another or groups of states over others is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,” the lawmakers wrote.</p>
<p>“We understand that you plan to address these discrepancies through future allocations of the $100 billion provided under the CARES Act and will seek to achieve rough parity — fairness in this case cannot simply be a goal, it is imperative that you achieve it,” they wrote.</p>
<p>Reached for comment Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Casey called the second round of funding “a positive step forward.”</p>
<p>“Senator Casey will continue to push HHS to fairly distribute these funds to the Pennsylvania hospitals and providers on the front lines in this pandemic,” the spokeswoman said.</p>
<p>The state hospital association did not&nbsp;immediately respond to comment Tuesday on the second round of funding.</p>
