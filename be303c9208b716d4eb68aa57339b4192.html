<p>The Steel Valley School District has asked two staff members to stay home after learning they traveled to areas where active transmission of the coronavirus has been confirmed, according to a statement from the district.</p>
<p>The two staff members, who the district did not identify, traveled to areas outside the U.S. where the COVID-19 virus is being actively transmitted, though the district did not clarify where.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steel Valley administration were not immediately available for comment Friday evening.</p>
<p>“Because the district makes the safety and overall health of all staff&nbsp;and students a top priority, these employees have been instructed to not report to work&nbsp;until the incubation period for the virus has passed and they have been cleared by a&nbsp;medical professional,” superintendent&nbsp;Edward Wehrer said in a statement Friday.</p>
