<h1>Two preteen girls start Little Lime Pantry to help people in need</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bolstered by their Christian faith and concern for the homeless and the jobless, two young girls have launched a pop-up pantry in Friendship.</p>
<p>Kate Sharbaugh, 12, of Upper Burrell, Westmoreland County, and Emma Schartner, 11, of Highland Park, this month started an open pantry where people in need could find food and toiletries. Cindy Schartner, Emma’s mother, said the effort is a reflection of the girls’ Christian faith.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping that our little gift in the hands of God will be multiplied to more than we can imagine,” said Mrs. Schartner, citing the miracle of Christ multiplying fish and loaves of bread. “We really don’t know how it will turn out. We’re trusting in God with this.”</p>
<p>Kate and Emma, both sixth graders, became friends after meeting in 2015 at a writers workshop for home-schoolers in Monroeville. With many volunteer activities geared to teenagers, Kate’s mother, Jessica Sharbaugh, had a problem finding volunteer work for her preteen children. But when she read an article about children in Alexandria, Va., starting a food pantry, she considered that the perfect project for Kate and Emma.</p>
<p>The girls embraced the idea and opened their Little Lime Pantry.</p>
<p>“Jesus told us to help other people that need help. This is the way that I can help,” Kate said.</p>
<p>The Schartners bought a 6-foot-tall china cabinet at Construction Junction and moved it to the Sharbaughs’ basement. The Sharbaughs painted it lime green with blue trim and converted it into a food pantry.</p>
<p>“We want it to be bright so people can see it,” Emma explained.</p>
<p>The girls located their pantry next to Fourth Presbyterian of Pittsburgh, but people do not have to be a member of that church or even be Christians to use the pantry.</p>
<p>The girls’ churches — the Pittsburgh Seventh-day Adventist Church in Observatory Hill, which Kate’s family goes to, and Fourth Presbyterian, which the Schartners attend — collected food and toiletries from their members to stock the pantry. The supply includes crackers, granola bars, canned vegetables, toothbrushes and toothpaste.</p>
<p>The pastors of the churches said they were impressed that Kate and Emma would take on such an enterprise.</p>
<p>Pastor Stewart Pepper, of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, describes Kate as being quiet, cheerful and resolved. “She’s a determined little girl,” he said.</p>
<p>During the current lockdown, Emma and her mother sing while her father plays the piano during online services for Fourth Presbyterian. The church’s pastor, Eric Amundson, said of Emma, “She’s just pure sweetness — always smiling, always happy.”</p>
<p>The pantry is located outside the church so that it is available at all hours. It is also a self-service operation. “I think it’s better that way because people will feel less shy [about taking what they need],” Emma said.</p>
<p>The families admit, though, that having an unstaffed pantry does pose potential problems.</p>
<p>“The whole thing is kind of a gamble,” said Ms. Sharbaugh. “We have no control over people stealing things, taking more than what they need or vandalizing it. We hope the community takes ownership of the thing.”</p>
<p>But early returns from the first two weeks of operation are promising.</p>
<p>“I’m very satisfied. I wasn’t expecting people to start donating,” Emma said. She noted that some donors have stocked the pantry with applesauce, coffee, even dog food and the always popular toilet paper. And, her mother added, users apparently have been taking only what they need.</p>
<p>The response has prompted the families to rethink their strategy.</p>
<p>“We’re realizing we could do a few more pantries ourselves, but it would be better if people in their own communities caught the vision of helping their neighbors with something like a Little Lime Pantry,” Mrs. Schartner said. As a result, the girls have developed a website — littlelimepantryproject.weebly.com — with information on how communities can start their own pantry.</p>
<p>Charity and county health officials have hailed the girls’ work.</p>
<p>“These two young women are an inspiration to me,” said Lisa Scales, president and CEO of the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank. “What has touched my heart the most during the past month has been the action of so many people in our community who have found ways to give back, and that is so important in this time of great uncertainty.”</p>
<p>Ms. Scales said the increased demand has taxed the food bank’s supply. The charity distributed over 1 million more pounds of food in March than it does in a normal month, and she predicted the demand will grow this month and in May.</p>
<p>Donna Scharding, food safety program manager for the Allegheny County Health Department, also praised Kate and Emma’s pop-up pantry.</p>
<p>“During these difficult times, we recognize that access to food is important as ever, and we commend everyone in our community that has been stepping up to get food to those that need it most,” she said in an email.</p>
<p>To meet safety guidelines during the COVID-19 pandemic, the girls posted a sign urging users to keep 6 feet away from others and to wash their hands before and after using the pantry. The girls also have provided wipes to use when opening the pantry and a trash can for their disposal.</p>
<p>Emma’s mother called the county’s COVID-19 hotline to ensure that the pantry would not break any health regulations. She was heartened by the response.</p>
<p>“This is a time when people need hope,” Ms. Schartner recalled the man telling her. “And this is a symbol of hope.”</p>
<p>Call 724-257-1031 to make a donation or for more information about the Little Lime Pantry.</p>
<p>Limit donations to money or gifts of food and toiletries. Do not send clothes. The county health department does not permit pantries to offer meals or refrigerated food. For more guidelines about pantries, call the county’s food safety program at 412-578-8044.</p>
