<h1>Shutdown concerts are a big hit for Pittsburgh musicians</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There’s an almost endless amount of slickly produced material — at least, we hope — to be found on cable and the various streaming sites like Netflix and Hulu.</p>
<p>But there’s still nothing quite like the live experience — even if it’s virtual.</p>
<p>With the social distancing caused by the coronavirus, a number of Pittsburgh musicians, following the cue from Code Orange and Bastard Bearded Irishmen, went live on Facebook over the weekend —&nbsp;some with great success.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Blasey</strong>, frontman for The Clarks, did a storyteller session from his basement for “an audience of one” -- his wife on the couch — that drew 135,000 views.</p>
<p>He mixed Clarks songs and the stories behind them in a great-sounding set.</p>

<p>“It was a little odd at first but I got in a nice groove pretty quick,” he says. “Having my wife play Ed McMahon to my Johnny Carson was invaluable. I was genuinely moved and got a little emotional when I saw how many people were watching and realized how much our fans needed that.”</p>
<p>Blasey will be in the same spot, on his Facebook page, on Saturday at 8 p.m. with some new stuff.</p>
<p>“As soon as it ended,” he says, “I started thinking about how to make it better. First thing I did was learn ‘Nobody Told Me’ by John Lennon for this week: Strange days indeed.”</p>
<p><strong>DJ Selecta</strong>, who can be found mixing soul, R&amp;B, house, hip-hop and more in clubs and on the Friday evening WYEP show Grand Groove Radio, started what he planned to be a two-hour set at 10 p.m. last Saturday.</p>
<p>Selecta, whose real name is James Scoglietti, ended up spinning for almost six hours, until 3:45 a.m., for almost 25,000 fans. It’s the longest he’s ever gone, he says, without a break in the middle.</p>
<p>He’ll do another “lockdown mix” at 8 p.m. Saturday, as well as a “virtual” UNION party Friday from 3 to 7 p.m. with Blakk Steel and Big Phill.</p>
<p><strong>Justin Sane</strong>, of Anti-Flag, hopped on Facebook last Friday afternoon with an acoustic set and an uplifting Q&amp;A with fans that drew more than 41,000 views.</p>

<p>On Wednesday at 8 p.m., another Pittsburgh institution, <strong>Joe Grushecky</strong> of the Houserockers, will go live from his home with an acoustic set.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of songs and a lot of stories,” Grushecky says.</p>
<p>If you’ve followed his career over the last 40-plus years, you know that.</p>
<p>Saturday was supposed AntiFest night at the Roxian with Anti-Flag topping a bill with The Suicide Machines, Punchline and more.</p>
<p>One of those bands, Pittsburgh’s <strong>Swiss Army</strong> will do an acoustic live stream on Saturday to replace it.</p>
<p>Watch for <strong>Lo Fi Delphi</strong> and <strong>Liss&nbsp;Victory </strong>on Tuesday and <strong>Ryan Haynes</strong> on Saturday at 5 p.m.</p>
<p>There will be many more. We’ll keep you posted.</p>
