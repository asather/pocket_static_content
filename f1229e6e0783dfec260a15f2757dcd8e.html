<h1>Some of state's waterways reported improving</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Abandoned mine pollution and agricultural runoff into Chesapeake Bay are declining, according to Pennsylvania’s 2020 draft Water Quality Monitoring and Assessment Report, but urban runoff, sewage overflows and acidification of streams remain significant problems.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection report, released earlier this month, shows 66,037 miles of rivers and streams in the state meeting aquatic life standards, 17,547 miles listed as impaired and 1,984 miles as unassessed.</p>
<p>A total of 10,370 miles of rivers and streams meet fish consumption standards, while 2,817 miles do not.</p>
<p>The biennial <a href="https://www.dep.pa.gov/Business/Water/CleanWater/WaterQuality/IntegratedWatersReport/Pages/2020-Integrated-Water-Quality-Report.aspx" target="_blank">report</a> mandated by the federal Clean Water Act is an in-depth evaluation of the environmental health and water quality of the commonwealth’s 86,000-plus miles of streams in six river basins and more than 160,000 acres of lakes.</p>
<p>It is open for public comment through Aug. 11.</p>
<p>“In a state as rich in water resources as Pennsylvania it is important to be able to show people how their local streams, lakes, and rivers are doing,” said DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell, in a news release. “The online report lets people focus in on their local waterways to see how healthy they are or what is causing any impairments. Local input on impaired waters can help DEP restore those waterways.”</p>
<p>A little more than 150 streams previously assessed as attaining aquatic life standards are listed as impaired in the new report. Seventy streams were newly listed as impaired due to urban runoff and sewer runoff. Six streams made the impaired list due to modifications by golf courses that removed stream-side vegetation or caused siltation.</p>
<p>The report identifies 633 streams as maintaining the same “aquatic life” standards they attained in the previous assessment.</p>
<p>Another 77 streams, previously listed as impaired, are still impaired, though the cause has changed and is now listed at “atmospheric deposition,” causing acidification of the waterway. Those impairments occurred even as many of the state’s coal-fired power plants, which emit pollutants that combine in the atmosphere to produce acid rain, closed.</p>
<p>“There is still acidic rain, and testing equipment and methodology has gotten more sophisticated to be able to more readily identify causes (though not necessarily a specific source),” Neil Shader, a DEP spokesman, said in an email response to questions.</p>
<p>Many impaired streams are so designated due to abandoned mine pollution, and many of the streams taken off the list — that is, no longer impaired — were polluted due to mine drainage. Eight new streams were reassessed as impaired due to acid mine drainage.</p>
<p>“Stream designation changes don’t necessarily identify the reason for a change in designation, so we can’t say how many designation changes resulted from AMD. That said, the continued efforts to remediate AMD and abandoned mine lands is definitely a success story and is highlighted in the report,” Mr. Shader stated.</p>
<p>The report does not identify specific impacts from shale gas development.</p>
<p>Almost 4,000 streams or sections of streams that were not previously assessed are listed as attaining recreational use status in the new report.</p>
<p>Abby Jones, legal and policy vice president at PennFuture, a statewide environmental organization, said the report found that while overall water quality is flowing in the right direction, a significant number of the state’s waterways still suffer from historic and ongoing pollution.</p>
<p>“We are still seeing a good amount of streams listed as impaired due to historic pollution, abandoned mine drainage, sediment, storm water runoff and sewer overflows,” Ms. Jones said. “The fact that we continue seeing these same causes year after year after year is problematic.”</p>
<p>According to the report, agricultural runoff and abandoned mine drainage each cause impairment of close to 6,000 stream miles, and urban runoff impairs 3,000 miles. More than 9,000 miles of stream impairment is attributed to “unknown” causes.</p>
<p>“Recognizing and providing information on what is causing water quality problems and where they are coming from is a critical factor in determining how to protect our water resources,” Ms. Jones said.</p>
<p>She said the DEP is doing a good job assessing more waterways to establish water quality baselines, but more work is needed.</p>
<p>That’s especially true in the Chesapeake watershed, she said, where the state has consistently fallen far short of its agricultural nutrient reduction goals.</p>
<p>The 2020 draft report also includes, for the first time, a map viewer that allows users to zoom down to individual stream or river sections and export information about those flows, according to the DEP release. That information can be used by individuals seeking more information about their local waterways and by municipal or county planners.</p>
<p>Jenifer Christman, vice president of watershed conservation at the Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, which oversees a half dozen watershed and stream conservation and restoration programs, said the report’s formatting will aid collaboration with the DEP on stream restoration.</p>
<p>“I hope more people will access the report, inform themselves about their local streams,” Ms. Christman said, “and get involved to help clean up our local waterways. WPC has and will continue to work collaboratively with our local conservation partners and DEP to improve streams that they have prioritized for restoration in this report.”</p>
<p>The DEP is accepting public <a href="https://www.ahs.dep.pa.gov/eComment/" target="_blank">comments electronically on the report</a>.</p>
<p>Written comments should be submitted by email to ecomment@pa.gov, or by mail to Department of Environmental Protection, Policy Office, Rachel Carson State Office Building, P.O. Box 2063, Harrisburg, PA 17105-2063. All comments must include the commentator's name and address.</p>
