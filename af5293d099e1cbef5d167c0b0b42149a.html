<h1>Wesco's "Hail Mary" bid for Anixter deemed superior for the first time</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wesco International Inc. has again increased its bid to acquire an Illinois-based supplier of electrical equipment and, for the first time since the bidding war began, its proposal was deemed the better one.</p>
<p>Station Square-based Wesco <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/03/Private-equity-firm-offer-buy-Wesco-bidding-war-Anixter-electrical-CD-R/stories/202001030121" target="_blank">has been pursuing</a> Anixter International for months. It is battling private equity firm Clayton, Dubilier &amp; Rice, LLC which is also trying to acquire Anixter and, in the middle of this proxy battle, offered to buy Wesco as well.</p>
<p>A large distributor of products for utilities, industrial and construction clients, Wesco has been on the prowl for a large acquisition that would consolidate the electrical distribution space.</p>
<p>In its latest proposal, Wesco offered Anixter shareholders $100 in Wesco stock (both common stock and a new category of preferred stock) for each of their Anixter shares. This is Wesco’s eighth proposal and the first one that Anixter’s board deemed to be the “superior company proposal.”</p>
<p>This kicks off a period of five business days where CD&amp;R, which already has a merger agreement in place with Anixter, has the right to respond and up the ante. If, at the end, Anixter breaks its agreement with CD&amp;R, Wesco has agreed to pay the $100 million termination fee.</p>

<p>“Basically this is a Hail Mary for the (Pittsburgh) company,” said Hamzah Mazari, a managing director with Jefferies who covers Wesco.</p>
<p>Not only is Anixter the only large, publicly-traded electric distribution company up for sale, satisfying Wesco’s declared thirst for a “transformational deal,” Mr. Mazari said, but CD&amp;R’s $68 per share offer for the Pittsburgh firm is now menacing Wesco’s current existence.</p>
<p>“If they don’t win this asset, they’re probably subject to a takeover from CD&amp;R,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mazari said it is likely that CD&amp;R will counter the latest Wesco proposal, but once the offer price per share gets above $103, the deal would be hard to justify financially.</p>
