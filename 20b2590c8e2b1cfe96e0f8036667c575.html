<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning consumers not to buy hand sanitizer from a company based in Mexico, saying it contains a toxic substance.</p>
<p>The FDA said the nine different hand sanitizers manufactured by&nbsp;Eskbiochem SA de CV may contain “methanol (wood alcohol), a substance that can be toxic when absorbed through the skin or ingested.”</p>
<p>“On June 17, 2020, FDA contacted Eskbiochem to recommend the company remove its hand sanitizer products from the market due to the risks associated with methanol poisoning,” the FDA said in a statement. “To date, the company has not taken action to remove these potentially dangerous products from the market.”</p>
<p>The products include:</p>
<p>▪ All-Clean Hand Sanitizer (NDC: 74589-002-01)</p>
<p>▪ Esk Biochem Hand Sanitizer (NDC: 74589-007-01)</p>
<p>▪ CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 75% Alcohol (NDC: 74589-008-04)</p>
<p>▪ Lavar 70 Gel Hand Sanitizer (NDC: 74589-006-01)</p>
<p>▪ The Good Gel Antibacterial Gel Hand Sanitizer (NDC: 74589-010-10)</p>
<p>▪ CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 80% Alcohol (NDC: 74589-005-03)</p>
<p>▪ CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 75% Alcohol (NDC: 74589-009-01)</p>
<p>▪ CleanCare NoGerm Advanced Hand Sanitizer 80% Alcohol (NDC: 74589-003-01)</p>
<p>▪ Saniderm Advanced Hand Sanitizer (NDC: 74589-001-01)</p>
<p>FDA officials said methanol is not an acceptable ingredient for hand sanitizers and anyone exposed to methanol “should seek immediate treatment.”&nbsp;The FDA said substantial methanol exposure can result in nausea, vomiting, headache, blurred vision, permanent blindness, seizures, coma, permanent damage to the nervous system or death.</p>
<p>The agency tested samples of Lavar Gel and CleanCare No Germ and found that Lavar Gel contains 81 percent methanol and no ethyl alcohol, and CleanCare No Germ contains 28 percent methanol.</p>
