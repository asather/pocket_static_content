<h1>North Allegheny clinches playoff spot with win at rival North Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Whenever North Hills and North Allegheny collide — no matter the sport — no added stakes are needed to get the teams and their fans fired up.</p>
<p>Friday night, though, the stakes were the highest they’ve been on the basketball court in 38 years between the neighborhood rivals.</p>
<p>Both teams entered their final section game of the season tied for fourth place in Class 6A Section 1, meaning the winner would clinch a postseason berth and the loser’s season would come to an end.</p>
<p>The previous time the Tigers and Indians met in a win-or-go-home showdown was 1982, when North Hills won to end North Allegheny’s season. This time around, the Tigers (9-11, 4-6) ventured into foreign territory and punched their ticket to the WPIAL playoffs with a convincing 61-40 win, ending a five-game losing skid and sending the Indians packing.</p>
<p>“I’m very happy right now. These kids deserved it,” North Allegheny coach Keith Noftz said. “They hung in there, and they didn’t quit on us.”</p>
<p>Senior guard Zach Andreykovich led the way for the Tigers with 17 points. High-flying junior forward Khalil Dinkins added 16, including nine in the fourth quarter, while senior forward Grant Timmerson tallied 14 points and seven rebounds.</p>
<p>“It feels really good,” Andreykovich said. “We came in energized, for sure, and with a lot of focus.”</p>
<p>Sophomore forward Devin Burgess led North Hills (8-13, 3-7) with 15 points in the defeat, while fellow sophomore Alex Smith chipped in 14.</p>
<p>“It’s always sweet,” Noftz said about winning in a rival’s gym. “But I’m not looking forward to playing them the next three years, either. They’ve got a really good young group and they’re well-coached.</p>
<p>“Their day is coming, and it’s coming really soon.”</p>
<p>The game got off to an exciting start as the teams traded buckets throughout an action-packed first quarter. Smith made a nifty pass on a fastbreak to senior guard Christian Heinl to give the Indians a 12-10 lead, then followed it up with a 3-pointer to make it 15-13.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for North Allegheny to reclaim the lead, though, and Andreykovich nailed a buzzer-beating 3-pointer at the end of the first quarter to put the Tigers on top, 20-15.</p>
<p>“If we come out in the first quarter hot, I think we’re pretty good throughout the course of the year,” Andreykovich said. “It gets everybody going. It gets the whole gym going on our side, and it’s really important to the team.”</p>
<p>Andreykovich stretched the lead to 10 with back-to-back 3-pointers late in the second quarter, and North Allegheny took a 37-29 lead into the half. The Tigers came out of the break ice cold on offense, though, and North Hills began to chip away at their lead.</p>
<p>North Allegheny didn’t score its first points of the second half until 2:30 remained in the third quarter, but the Tigers soon found their rhythm and started to pull away. They consistently fed the ball inside to Dinkins, who used his powerful 6-foot-4 frame and impressive athleticism to convert his baskets in the post.</p>
<p>“It’s still just a team sport,” Dinkins said. “I do my best to get as many points as possible, but if I know I don’t have a good shot, I’m going to pass it.”</p>
<p>At one point in the final quarter, the Indians cut North Allegheny’s lead to six at 45-39. But the Tigers closed out the game on a 16-1 run to put the finishing touches on a huge road victory.</p>
<p>“It feels great, because we haven’t had our whole team since day one,” Noftz said. “We’re fun to watch when we play this hard.”</p>
