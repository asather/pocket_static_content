<h1>Mt. Lebanon’s Lindsey Powanda makes history as 1st girls golfer to win WPIAL title at Oakmont</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time ever, the WPIAL Class 3A girls individual golf championships came to Oakmont Country Club, one of the most renowned and challenging courses in the world.</p>
<p>Oakmont has hosted the U.S. Open a record nine times, most recently in 2016, and has served as the site of the WPIAL boys individual championships several times, as well. But for the 35 girls who set out on Thursday to conquer the unforgiving greens and treacherous sand traps that have bewildered even some of the world’s top professionals, this was a once-in-a-lifetime experience they won’t soon forget.</p>
<p>And for Mt. Lebanon junior Lindsey Powanda, it was also a chance to make history. Powanda shot a 5-over 80 on the day to capture the championship and become the first Blue Devils girls golfer to win a WPIAL title — not to mention the first girls golfer ever to win a WPIAL title at Oakmont.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely amazing,” Powanda said. “I was not expecting to win today, so it’s really exciting.”</p>
<p>Powanda edged out South Fayette junior Caroline McConnell, who finished with a 7-over 82 as part of the day’s first pairing. Powanda played right behind McConnell in the second group, but she said she didn’t keep track of the leaderboard until she was already finished.</p>
<p>“I try not to look at the scoreboard whenever I’m competing,” Powanda said. “Caroline and I, we’ve been really close friends ever since we were really little, so we both probably knew we both were going to be right by each other, and whoever had a better day was going to pull it off.”</p>
<p>After finishing as the WPIAL runner-up as a freshman, Powanda seemed destined to win a WPIAL title eventually. But she had a bit of a rough time at last year’s WPIAL championships at Diamond Run Golf Club, finishing in a tie for eighth place with an 11-over 83 and missing out on a trip to the state championships by just one stroke.</p>
<p>Determined to come back and make things right this year, Powanda raced out to an early lead on the front nine and never looked back.</p>
<p>Powanda peaked at 2-under par through seven holes before a pair of bogeys on No. 8 and 9 and back-to-back double bogeys on No. 11 and 12 narrowed the gap considerably. She saved her best golf for last, though, making her fourth birdie of the day on No. 15 and then escaping No. 16 with a bogey after an impressive uphill chip from behind the green to within a few feet of the hole.</p>
<p>No. 17 and its famed “Big Mouth” bunker&nbsp;got the best of nearly every golfer on the course on Thursday, but not Powanda. She made par to keep a three-shot lead on McConnell going into the final hole, and after McConnell made a birdie on No. 18, Powanda simply needed a bogey or better to win the championship outright.</p>
<p>Powanda’s approach shot landed in the bunker to the left of the hole, but she didn’t let it faze her. In fact, Powanda’s coach, Pete Bouvy, said she sometimes aims for bunkers on purpose because she’s so comfortable hitting her way out of them.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Powanda landed her next shot safely onto the green, and she finished things off by sinking a 5-foot par putt to finish off her round. Peters Township senior Ella McRoberts made a solid push down the back nine, but she never made it to within less than two strokes of Powanda’s score.</p>
<p>“I just kept telling myself this is one of the hardest courses in the country, if not the world, so I just needed to really stay focused,” Powanda said. “You never know what the other girls are doing, so you just have to keep playing your game.”</p>
<p>Fox Chapel junior Nina Busch finished in third place with a 12-over 87, narrowly beating out McRoberts, who shot a 13-over 88. Four golfers tied for fifth place at 16-over par, and Butler junior Paige Scott emerged from a sudden-death playoff to claim the fifth and final qualifying spot for the PIAA championships, to be held Oct. 19-20 at Heritage Hills Country Club in York.</p>
