<h1>Duquesne Light urges customers to be 'extra cautious' of phone scams</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne Light Co. is urging customers to stay ”extra cautious” after the company said multiple incidents of phone scams have occurred in recent days.</p>
<p>Customers told the utility company they have received calls from scammers “spoofing” the Duquesne Light number through computer programs in order to appear legitimate on a person’s caller ID. Scammers then claim the customer has an unpaid balance and that their service will be terminated if they don’t pay the balance that day. The call-back numbers from the scammers also used greetings and messages that mimic Duquesne Light’s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While on the call, scammers are also attempting to direct customers to purchase pre-paid credit cards to pay off their alleged overdue amount. Duquesne Light said it does not ask customers to purchase any type of “pre-paid” card.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>David Johnson, Duquesne Light’s chief customer officer, said the company would “never threaten to shut off power the same day because of non-payment.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The utility also said that some customers have reported instances where individuals, posing as utility workers, knock on their doors claiming to be from the power company to try to gain access inside the home.</p>
<p>“In these instances, the criminals often work in pairs, with one person distracting the customer while the accomplice steals money and/or valuables in another part of the residence,” the company said.</p>
<p>The company states it would be a “rare incidence” when an employee may enter the home without scheduling an appointment in advance, and that employees usually wear company ID badges and usually drive marked vehicles with a company logo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to avoid scams, Duquesne Light advises customers to not provide their credit card or other payment information over the phone. To help verify if a call is legitimate, the utility urges customers to hang up and call the company directly at&nbsp;412-393-7100. Customers who have been targeted can also report the incident to the Pennsylvania Bureau of Customer Protection at 1-800-441-2555, and their local police.&nbsp;</p>
