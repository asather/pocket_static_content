<h1>Fox News reportedly cuts ties with Diamond and Silk after duo spreads virus misinformation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fox Nation personalities Diamond and Silk will no longer appear on the streaming service or its cable parent Fox News, according to a report by the Daily Beast.</p>
<p>The YouTube vloggers, sisters Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson, hosted a weekly video series on Fox Nation and made occasional appearance on Fox News. But the pair, who are two of President Donald Trump’s most visible African American supporters, haven’t appeared on either since April 7.</p>
<p>Their apparent banishment comes after the duo continues to make dubious claims about the coronavirus. On their March 30 live stream, for example, they suggested the number of deaths from COVID-19 was being exaggerated to make Trump look bad.</p>

<p>“What I need to know is: Who has the bodies?” Diamond asked.</p>
<p>A week later, their Twitter account was locked for violating the platform’s rules about spreading coronavirus misinformation, Politico reported.</p>
<p>“The only way we can become immune to the environment; we must be out in the environment. Quarantining people inside of their houses for extended periods will make people sick!” the offending tweet said.</p>
<p>On Monday, Diamond and Silk called the pandemic and resulting economic shutdown a “Deep State experiment that we’ve all been suckered into.”</p>
<p>While not acknowledging their departure from the $6-a-month service, which Fox launched in 2018, the pair posted Tuesday on Twitter: “Haters keep saying they hate Diamond and Silk, but you can’t hate what you ain’t never loved!”</p>
<p>The president retweeted that post and added: “But I love Diamond &amp; Silk, and so do millions of people!” A spokesperson for Fox News didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The move comes about a month after Fox Business Network parted ways with primetime host Trish Regan after she called the coronavirus an “impeachment scam.” Fox News personalities Sean Hannity, Laura Ingraham, Jesse Watters and others have also come under fire for downplaying concerns over the virus, particularly during early coverage of the pandemic.</p>
