<h1> Ruth Ann Dailey | Steelers caused division instead of healing </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers voted as a team to put the name of Antwon Rose II on their helmets for the entire 2020 season.</p>
<p>Alejandro Villanueva decided not to participate in the team’s gesture. Some of his teammates were shocked. Antwon Rose’s mother is upset and vows to hold the team “even more accountable.”</p>
<p>Team, team, teammates. Maybe it’s time to ask everyone which “team” they really want to be on.</p>
<p>Right now there are too many to choose from, anywhere you look, but in this particular instance, it’s the fault of the NFL and the Steelers. They keep cramming ideology into a game that ideally — no, not ideally; reasonably, very reasonably — should be free of it.</p>
<p>Some are frustrated that Army veteran Al Villanueva would quietly question their decision by putting on his helmet, instead, the name of Alwyn Cashe, an Army sergeant first class and Black man, killed in Iraq and posthumously awarded the Silver Star for heroism.</p>
<p>Antwon Rose II seemed destined for a life of great meaning and blessing to others. He was an AP student and community volunteer, endearing, well-mannered and hardworking.</p>
<p>Despite all these cherished attributes, he was killed by East Pittsburgh police officer Michael Rosfeld on June 19, 2018. The 17-year-old was a passenger in a car that Mr. Rosfeld pulled over because it matched the description of a vehicle that had just been in a drive-by shooting. As Mr. Rosfeld was handcuffing the driver, Antwon and the other passenger exited the vehicle and ran.</p>
<p>Experts later found gunshot residue on Antwon’s hands, a spent 9 mm cartridge in his pocket and his DNA on the 9 mm gun in the bullet-riddled car. The survivor of the drive-by said Antwon shot at him, that the dispute was between the two of them.</p>
<p>A jury of 12 Harrisburg citizens — with three Black members, one of whom was jury foreman — heard all the admissible evidence. They know more than could possibly be put forth here, and they found Mr. Rosfeld not guilty of criminal homicide. Which is not to say that he doesn’t bear a profound responsibility for Antwon’s death.</p>
<p>This is all tragic. As a mom, I can’t imagine what I would do with all the anguish and anger I would certainly feel (some of it at my own son, I’m sure). Ms. Kenney has spoken eloquently of the pain and devotes her life to making a better future for other kids.</p>
<p>She said she struggled for words to describe her feelings when Coach Mike Tomlin called to tell her “that the sports team right here in my city wants to represent my son and tell his story.”</p>
<p>But it’s a complicated story, and if they want to tell it, then they have to tell the whole thing. You can’t do that on a helmet.</p>
<p>Which cynics might say is the whole point: Compassionate people are not going to challenge a grieving family. They avoid the issue and are thereby silenced. By addressing this, by revisiting the terrible choices made by many people that night, I run the risk of causing unwarranted pain.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, because of the Steelers’ choice and the resulting uproar. If their gesture is sincere, it’s misguided.</p>
<p>The fact that a jury had to be brought here from Harrisburg should be a powerful reminder that this is a very fraught episode in Pittsburgh’s history. It is a recent wound.</p>
<p>By injudiciously choosing a “team” in a complicated conflict that doesn’t fit a simple “us vs. them” choice, the Steelers have done damage. They have divided instead of healing.</p>
<p>What team do we really want to be on?</p>
<p>I want to be on a team that does everything humanly possible to keep our beloved children alive, wise and free.</p>
<p>I want to be on a team that seeks liberty and justice for all and that knows this quest is eternal.</p>
<p>If someone finds a way to put all that on a football helmet, or in an anthem, then I’ll have something to cheer.</p>
