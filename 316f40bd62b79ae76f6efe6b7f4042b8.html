<h1>Gilfillan Farm receives grant to restore summer kitchen in Upper St. Clair</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Alexander Gifillan came from Scotland in the 1780s, he settled his family where St. Clair Country Club is located today.</p>
<p>Among the structures he built on the 15-acre Upper St. Clair farm, which sits on Orr Road off Washington Road, was a summer kitchen that still stands. Erected in the 1850s, it was separate from the farmhouse and used for cooking and washing during the summer.</p>
<p>Today, that kitchen is part of a restoration and preservation effort overseen by the Historical Society of Upper St. Clair, which has received a $98,000 grant to pay for about half of the project.</p>
<p>Rachel Carlson, president of the historical society and a descendant of the Gilfillan family, said the brick structure of the summer kitchen has become soft, thus unstable.</p>
<p>“They did all the brick onsite,” Ms. Carlson said. “They weren’t worried about a building lasting 200 years,” she added, laughing.</p>
<p>The orange brick, which Ms. Carlson referred to as “pumpkin brick,” is hard to come by these days, but the historical society was able to find some from a church that was being remodeled.</p>
<p>“On Craigslist, we found a church in Meadville,” that was getting rid of its old “pumpkin brick,” which will now be used on the visible portion of the summer kitchen.</p>
<p>Ski Masonry LLC of Pittsburgh is the contractor on the project, which began in mid-December. The company also completed a similar brick restoration on the smokehouse at Gilfillan Farm.</p>
<p>All of the visible “pumpkin brick” is set to be stripped by first using heat and then paint stripper and water to remove the paint. Bricks that are damaged will be replaced with the bricks from the Meadville church.</p>
<p>“It needs to be done with historical methods where you see it,” Ms. Carlson said of the brick restoration.</p>
<p>Other improvements, including a new foundation and a revamped drain, will be done using modern techniques because they will not be visible to the public.</p>
<p>The entire project is expected to take 90 to 120 days with crews working through the winter.</p>
<p>Ms. Carlson said there are a number of long-term projects planned for the farm, which has been placed on the National Register of Historic Places, including restoration of the barn, workshop, spring house, tool shed and the house itself.</p>
<p>Alexander Gilfillan, who was the first justice of the peace in Upper St. Clair, married Margaret Boyd, and they had 10 children.</p>
<p>Several generations of Gilfillans lived in the house up until 2001, when Margaret Gilfillan died at the age of 100 and left the farmhouse and its surrounding buildings to the historical society. The township of Upper St. Clair owns about 60 acres surrounding the farm.</p>
<p>Ms. Carlson said it was Margaret Gilfillan’s wish that the house be maintained as an operational farm and a historical, cultural and educational resource. One of the members of the historical society keeps his cows on the property, and another keeps bees.</p>
<p>The money awarded to the society for the kitchen restoration came from a Keystone Historic Preservation Grant from the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.</p>
<p>Anyone interested in donating to the farm or taking a tour can contact the historical society via the Gilfillan Farm website at ​www.gilfillanfarm.org.</p>
