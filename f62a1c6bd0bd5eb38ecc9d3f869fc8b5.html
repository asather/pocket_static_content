<h1>Ramping up coronavirus lockdown, Italy orders closure of nearly all shops and businesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ROME - Italy on Wednesday dramatically ramped up the severity of its national lockdown to control the spread of the coronavirus, ordering a halt to nearly all commercial activity in shops and businesses except supermarkets and pharmacies, while bringing the country to a near-total economic standstill.</p>
<p>The measures marked one of the most drastic policies imposed by a modern democracy, and followed a day in which cases accelerated across Europe.</p>
<p>In Italy, where there are now more than 10,000 confirmed cases and 631 deaths, the health crisis is escalating so quickly that the country has found itself willing to upend normal life absolutely and take an economic dive - all in a bid to keep people indoors, reduce infections and stave off an even deeper emergency in their hospitals.</p>
<p>“Right now the whole world is looking at us,” Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte said, telling Italians to leave the house “only when strictly necessary.”</p>
<p>Once the new steps take effect - Conte did not specify when - only the most essential parts of society will continue to function. Farms can still produce food, and factories can still churn out products, and public transportation will still function.</p>
<p>The steps might have seemed unimaginable to Italians even a week ago. But the pace of the virus’s growth - mixed with worrying depictions of a teetering health system - has caused a day-by-day national transformation, with people moving from grief toward acceptance about the extent of the changes in their lives.</p>
<p>“You’re changing your life’s habits, making sacrifices, but these renunciations are offering a great, precious contribution to the country,” Conte said. “Italy is showing it’s a great community, united and responsible.”</p>
<p>On Monday, Conte had imposed a nationwide lockdown, limiting travel abroad and across regions. With it came other restrictions: the closure of theaters, museums, sporting events. But Italy had still been operating at a crawl. Gelaterias were open, with people lining up one meter away from one another. Barber shops were open. Cafes were open, with limited hours and restrictions on the number of people allowed inside.</p>
<p>Conte received strong political pressure from politicians in Italy’s northern regions, at the epicenter of the outbreak, to further tighten the measures.</p>
<p>For other countries in Europe, Italy is the example they are trying to avoid. The country has seen more than 12,000 total cases, and in the past three days the number of people who have died of the virus has risen from 366 to 827.</p>
<p>In Italy, Giovanni Rezza, head of the infectious disease department at the Italian National Institute of Health, said it appeared that Germany was giving up on containment and they should take heed of the toll coronavirus is taking further south. “What is happening in Northern Italy, is happening in front of their eyes,” he said, urging more stringent distancing measures. (His statement came after German&nbsp;Chancellor Angela Merkel warned that more than two-thirds of Germany’s nearly 83 million people could be infected before the outbreak ends.)</p>
<p>Policymakers across Europe have watched the rapid mushrooming of cases in Italy, where there are now more than 10,000 confirmed cases and 631 deaths. Despite having one of the best health-care systems in Europe, Italian hospitals are pushed to their limits. Other countries are worried about having to confront the same stresses.</p>
<p>Hungary, with 12 confirmed cases, said Wednesday that it was banning travelers from Italy, China, South Korea and Iran. Austria and Slovenia had announced the previous day that they were closing their borders to Italians. Meanwhile, Switzerland was allowing entrance by Italian workers, and France kept its border with Italy open.</p>
