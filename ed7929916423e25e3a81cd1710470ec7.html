<h1>'Independence Day deserves fireworks': Communities find creative ways to celebrate the holiday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many annual Independence Day festivals, parades and fireworks that have become traditions were canceled this year. However, communities across the region won’t let that stop them from celebrating, and they may create new traditions along the way.</p>
<p>Sara Marie, 33, of North Huntingdon, said her family typically spends the holiday weekend watching fireworks or roaming the Westmoreland Arts &amp; Heritage Festival in Twin Lakes, which was canceled in May.</p>
<p>This summer, her family is camping at her husband’s private property in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>“We’ve been going out there a lot just because of everything that’s been going on,” Mrs. Marie said. “This is the first time we’ve done this [on Independence Day]… It’s going to be quite different.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Marie said she is at high risk for COVID-19 due to a medical condition, so celebrating in a private area is ideal to combat her anxieties about contracting the virus. However, she said cancellations for Fourth of July celebrations dating a month in advance have been “ridiculous.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be excited when everything can get back to normal,” Mrs. Marie said.</p>
<p>Until then, Mrs. Marie said she’ll be hunkering down with a cookout, bonfire and store-bought fireworks with her three children and husband.</p>
<p>Cancellations are prompting many people to consider hosting their own Independence Day celebrations at home. Tammi Iams, owner of DNT Fireworks in Washington, Pa., said early this week that she expected a sales boom.</p>
<p>“Most people are going to go to more of a family picnic setting since there are no open public displays,” Ms. Iams said.</p>
<p>To combat significant dangers taking place from at-home firework displays, the city of Pittsburgh created a Fireworks Taskforce in June after reporting a 398% increase in fireworks complaints throughout June.</p>
<p>Community members are not limiting themselves to backyard barbecues and residential fireworks. Ryan Covert, 41, of Highfield, Butler County, is organizing his own patriotic celebration at McDonald Stadium, where people can watch from their cars or porches to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>When Butler County canceled its annual summer fair and fireworks, Mr. Covert said he felt a need in the community to organize a professional fireworks show. Mr. Covert is working with friends to sponsor the event with several businesses he owns in the community.</p>
<p>“It’s a tradition we’re trying to keep going,” Mr. Covert said. “On the Fourth of July, we’ll have fireworks in Butler, there’s no doubt about it.”</p>
<p>The Butler BlueSox, the county’s summer collegiate baseball team, are scheduled to play a doubleheader in McDonald Stadium preceding the fireworks on July 4. With hot dogs and vendors to wrap up a day of baseball, Mr. Covert said it’s “Independence Day the way it should be.”</p>
<p>Marcus Wisneski had the same idea when he began planning “Here Comes the Boom” in Westmoreland County in early June. With the Westmoreland Fair canceled, Mr. Wisneski chose to revisit a past hobby in which he put on a fireworks show in his own yard.</p>
<p>“It’s something enjoyable for us all to look forward to when we’re constantly being told ‘no,’” said Jessica Skinner, Mr. Wisneski’s fiancee. “Independence Day deserves fireworks.”</p>
<p>The show will be held at the Westmoreland Fairgrounds, and is intended to be drive-in only. According to Ms. Skinner, they chose not to have vendors to encourage people to stay with their own groups. She expects many will have their own cookouts at home before coming to the show.</p>
<p>Celebrations aren’t limited to fireworks. Beaver County is hosting its first annual Firecracker Run, a 5K to raise funds for a new children’s museum named Neighborhood North. Registrations are open until July 8, and participants can submit their 5K times when the holiday begins until July 11.</p>
<p>To put a patriotic twist on the 5K, Catherine Baker, organizer of the event, said participants who run in patriotic costumes can receive a special prize. Ms. Baker hopes the 5K can become a Fourth of July tradition, taking place after the annual Beaver County Independence Day parade, which was canceled this year.</p>
<p>Elizabeth Hough, 33, of New Brighton, Beaver County, has been running since February of 2019, and is looking forward to the chance to run her first Independence Day race at home though she isn’t quite ready to run in costume.</p>
<p>“A lot of the Independence Day races are in Ohio, and I’ve had friends that have run those, because there’s nothing here,” Mrs. Hough said.</p>
<p>After the 5K, Mrs. Hough said her family plans to have a cookout at home before watching Beaver County Boom, the county’s fireworks show which had been canceled until late June. Typically, the event isn’t held on Independence Day, so Mrs. Hough was happy to know there would be fireworks on the Fourth.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s so exciting this year that the fireworks are actually on the Fourth of July, and that the community can all be a part of it,” Mrs. Hough said. Additing, with a laugh, “with social distancing.”</p>
