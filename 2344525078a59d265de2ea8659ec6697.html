<p>The roof of a Brighton Heights church collapsed Monday, according to KDKA-TV, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s news partner.</p>
<p>No injuries have been reported, but the collapse sent debris onto McClure Avenue.</p>
<p>It’s unclear if the structure is still in use. Signage indicates it was once used as Christian Fellowship Center and the Church of God in Christ.</p>
<p>McClure Street has been closed off while the structure’s stability is assessed, KDKA said.</p>
