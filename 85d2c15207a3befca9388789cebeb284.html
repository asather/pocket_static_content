<h1>Ex-girlfriend of convicted pill mill doctor gets federal prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former girlfriend of a convicted pill mill doctor who acted as his office manager is headed to federal prison for 63 months.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak imposed that term Monday on Marcia Arthurs of Mt. Lebanon after an eight-hour hearing over two days.</p>
<p>Arthurs, who is in her early 60s, conspired with the former doctor, Paul Michael Hoover, to dole out narcotic painkillers to addicts at a rented Coraopolis office that had no medical equipment or exam rooms.</p>
<p>The two of them flew to Pittsburgh from California four times a year to sell drugs in cash-only transactions and then fly back to California to enjoy the money.</p>
<p>Hoover, who formerly practiced in Beaver, where Arthurs worked for him, is serving more than 11 years in prison.</p>
<p>Arthurs' lawyer, Efrem Grail, asked for leniency for his client, saying she was submissive to authority figures and especially to Hoover, whom he described as controlling and manic. He also said her part in the drug dealing was minimal.</p>
<p>"Her small role in the practice can best be described as one of a glorified notetaker and recordkeeper," he wrote in sentencing papers.</p>
<p>He also said she has mental health problems.</p>
<p>But prosecutors said she played a significant role in the scheme and asked Judge Hornak to reject her "attempt to downplay her involvement in the crimes for which she has pleaded guilty."</p>
<p>Hoover wrote prescriptions for up to 60 patients a day, whom he called "peeps." He didn't examine anyone or do any follow-up checks on them. Customers paid $200 in cash.</p>
<p>After he and Arthurs returned to California, they also mailed prescriptions to customers in Pittsburgh in exchange for cash or money orders.</p>
<p>The pair also lied in representing that the prescriptions were legitimate so that Medicare and Medicaid would pay for the pills at pharmacies.</p>
<p>The government estimated that between 2015 and 2018, the couple distributed 262,000 pills.</p>
<p>Hoover considered the pill mill his retirement plan and hid his income from it in a series of shell corporation accounts, safe deposit boxes and safes in California.</p>
<p>The pair bought a $325,000 property in Nevada and traveled all over the world, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Part of the case included detailed notes that Hoover kept of how he was laundering money. He marked some of these records as "covert" and wrote boastful notes to himself that he couldn't be caught.</p>
<p>In addition to dealing pills and defrauding Medicare, the pair also ripped off Social Security by saying Hoover could not work from 2012 to 2018 when he was working. Arthurs' role in that fraud was to lie about her living and financial arrangements with Hoover.</p>
<p>The federal investigation of the couple was based in part on recorded office visits by confidential sources and an undercover agent.</p>
<p>In addition to the prison term, Judge Hornak ordered Arthurs to pay $48,617 in restitution.</p>
