<h1>Pa. allocates $51M in federal funds to help reopen child care centers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State officials will distribute $51 million to child care providers in an initial round of payments from federal stimulus funds, according to an announcement Wednesday from Gov. Tom Wolf's office and the state's Department of Human Services.</p>
<p>With many child care providers having been closed since mid-March to halt the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/03/24/Pennsylvania-child-care-centers-aid-needed-COVID-19-closures-coronavirus/stories/202003240095" target="_blank">some have expressed concern that they won't be able to reopen</a> due to the loss of tuition payments, an inability to cover their costs if they can't operate at full capacity, or concerns over liability and safety, among other issues.</p>
<p>The funds will be released in June and will go to about 7,000 licensed centers, according to state officials.</p>
<p>“Child care providers are the backbone of our economy in many ways,” Mr. Wolf's office said in a statement. “Without their work, children would miss out on an introduction to education that helps them throughout childhood, adolescence, and adulthood, and parents and guardians may have to stay home or not pursue education themselves. I cannot understate how valuable this work is to local communities and the commonwealth as a whole, and as Pennsylvania reopens, we need a robust and healthy child care system.”</p>
<p>The funds are part of $106 million allocated to the state through the federal Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. The other money will be released after a study by DHS and Penn State Harrisburg’s Institute of State and Regional Affairs examining the pandemic's impact on child care providers.</p>
<p>“Child care providers allow parents and guardians to go to work knowing their children are being cared for a in a safe, nurturing, and educational environment. Without their service, we cannot have a fully functional economy, and we are committed to helping them weather this tumultuous period,” said DHS Secretary Teresa Miller in a statement. “This CARES Act funding allows us to support child care providers who are undoubtedly feeling the current strain on their businesses so they can continue to be a resource for families around Pennsylvania.”</p>
