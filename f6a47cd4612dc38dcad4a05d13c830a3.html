<h1>5 moments that got Bill Cowher into the Hall of Fame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Bill Cowher learned that he’ll be enshrined at the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, Ohio, this summer in a surprise announcement Saturday. Here’s a look back at some of the moments that helped him earn induction.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>First division title — 1992&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Cowher succeeded the legendary Chuck Noll as Steelers coach in January and promptly led one of the most rapid turnarounds in team history. His 11-5 mark and AFC Central title ended the franchise’s skid of just one playoff appearance in Noll’s final seven seasons. The playoff debut that followed — a 24-3 loss to Buffalo in the divisional round — was far from memorable, but the season preceding it showed that Cowher could get results in the shadow of Noll’s towering legacy. It was no small feat.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>AFC title — 1995</strong></span></p>
<p>Cowher and the Steelers earned redemption for their loss to San Diego in the previous year’s AFC championship by topping Indianapolis for the title by a 20-16 margin at Three Rivers Stadium. At the time, the win made Cowher, then 38, the youngest coach in league history to reach a Super Bowl. Victory in the big game would have to wait, though. Three Neil O’Donnell interceptions cost the Steelers dearly in a 27-17 loss to Dallas two weeks later at Sun Devil Stadium in Tempe, Ariz.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">The turnaround — 2001</span></strong></p>
<p>After winning division titles in each of his first six seasons, Cowher endured the only extended losing streak of his career from 1998-2000, as his teams went just 22-26 and missed the playoffs in all three seasons. He entered 2001 facing questions about his job security, and he answered them in resounding fashion with a 13-3 campaign and the team’s first of three AFC championship appearances in four years.</p>
<p>That season’s division title — his seventh — made him one of just six coaches in league history with at least that many. The Steelers fell short of the Super Bowl with a 24-17 loss to Tom Brady and the upstart New England Patriots in the title game, but there was no mistaking that Cowher and his Steelers were back as a force to be reckoned with in the conference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>15-1 — 2004&nbsp;</strong></span></p>
<p>Everything that went wrong in 2003, when the Steelers sputtered to a 6-10 mark, seemed to go right in 2004. Quarterback Tommy Maddox went down with an injury in the second game, but rookie Ben Roethlisberger stepped in and kept winning. And winning. And winning. By season’s end, that Week 2 loss in Baltimore was the team’s only blemish on the best regular season mark in franchise history and just the fourth such record in the league since it went to a 16-game schedule in 1978. The dream season ended with another loss to the Patriots in the AFC championship, though the sting of that defeat would be short lived.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>Super Bowl victory — 2005</strong></span></p>
<p>Finally. After eight division titles, six AFC championship appearances and 152 victories, Cowher finally got to hoist the Vince Lombardi trophy when his team knocked off Seattle, 21-10, to win the league championship in Detroit. It was far from easy. The Steelers needed to win their last four regular season games just to make the playoffs. Then they needed to beat the AFC’s first, second and third seeds — all on the road — to reach the Super Bowl. In the end, though, the tough path just made the achievement that much more impressive and gave Cowher the signature moment he needed to eventually reach the Hall of Fame. He retired after an 8-8 season the following year and then joined CBS as an analyst.&nbsp;</p>
