<h1>Pirates' Kyle Crick hopes to bury season filled with drama, tipped pitches</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Few Pirates players are happier to get to spring training and put the 2019 season far in the rear-view mirror than Kyle Crick.</p>
<p>The 27-year-old hurler and the team had planned on building on a seemingly promising 2018. Crick had a 2.35 ERA with 65 strikeouts to 23 walks over 60 1/3 innings. The Pirates had a winning record that season and were supposed to get guided to contention by their pitching staff.</p>
<p>Crick was supposed to pitch the seventh inning to get to the ball to Keone Kela in the eighth inning, which then got it to Felipe Vazquez. By the middle of September, Crick's season ended because of a tendon injury suffered in a fistfight with Vazquez.</p>
<p>"It was a tough time," Crick told the Post-Gazette. "Last year was the first time I had real adversity as a professional. I had to respond the right way. I became obsessed with my recovery. I didn't want to lose out on playing the game I love because of something like that."</p>
<p>It didn't take Crick long after the punch to realize the severity of the injury. There was blood gushing out of his finger, and he looked down and saw his right index finger got split open.&nbsp;Crick had surgery less than 12 hours after the altercation with the former Pirates closer.</p>
<p>"I knew very quickly that I needed to get this fixed," Crick said. "I was so nervous. I knew we needed to move fast. I wanted it done quick and over with. I can only work hard getting back. I wanted to get my range back."</p>
<p>Now, Crick is at Pirate City. He is slightly behind his usual schedule but expects to be ready for Opening Day.</p>
<p>"Physically, I'm good. Might be a little bit behind on cardio work and stuff like that. But other than that, my hand is good," Crick said. ... The tendon itself is healed. What I have to do is re-break through some scar tissue in that joint, but nothing that won't be fixed in a couple of weeks."</p>
<p>But the drama-filled injury only tells half of Crick’s disappointing season.</p>
<p>Crick suffered some second-half woes that matched the swoon for the team that fell out of contention. Crick went from a first-half ERA of 3.23 over 60 2/3 innings to a 7.53 ERA in 18 and 1/3 innings.</p>
<p>Crick believes that a session with the Pirates’ video staff revealed some reasons why he gave up so many runs. Long story short: he was tipping pitches.</p>
<p>"I think there were some things that led to some runs. And they were on me. The things were on me. They weren't on my team. They weren't on the pitches called," Crick said. "It was me, giving away my stuff.</p>
<p>"I fell into some patterns and some routines, and it was eye-opening because at the end of the season, some of our video guys woke me up, and Jay showed me. I was like, ‘Wow.’ If I'm doing the same pattern and same routine 90 percent of the time, it's only a matter of time."</p>
<p>This wasn't a cheating scandal like the Houston Astros and Boston Red Sox, but it was the same result. Players knew what was coming from Crick.&nbsp;He throws one of the best sliders in baseball, but it doesn't matter how good a pitch is if the hitter knows it’s coming.</p>
<p>"It was a relief in a way once I figured out what was happening and why it was happening," Crick said. "There were swings I got with certain pitches in certain counts that I'd never gotten before.</p>
<p>"I'm not dumb. I knew something was up. There's no way a guy is sitting on a 2-1 or 2-0 slider. Conventional thought says you sit on a fastball, but I had guys sitting 2-0 slider. I'd never had guys make contact like off my slider."</p>
<p>An example of this could've been with the Braves’ Austin Riley. Riley took Crick deep at PNC Park for a three-run home on June 4th. Crick hadn't given up a run in 15 2/3 innings heading into that at-bat. What did Riley get him on? An 0-1 slider. How did the rookie do it? Here's what now-former manager Clint Hurdle and Crick said about it at the time.</p>
<p>"Maybe the slider's elevated," Hurdle said. "It could be a good pitch. I don't know that right now. I know that's the second game all year that Crick's given up a run. We got beat tonight."</p>
<p>Crick does damage with his slider and felt it was the right pitch for the situation. His quote back in June was more foreboding than he realized.</p>
<p>"I thought I executed it pretty well. Chances are he knew it was coming or something because he put a pretty good swing on it," Crick said. "Still, on that particular 0-1 slider, I think I executed the pitch. It was just a better piece of hitting."</p>
<p>Crick is ready to bury all of that and move forward. He likes new manager Derek Shelton and working with pitching coach Oscar Marin. Crick, like the Pirates, is hoping that fresh energy will lead to an improved 2020.</p>
<p>"I've gotten a chance to talk with this new staff, and they seem very player-friendly, player-oriented," Crick said. "I'm excited about that, man. I've talked to them numerous times on the phone. I just met the skip. He seems pretty cool."</p>
<p>"I feel good about it. We have a young team, a strong young team too, healthy, coming back. We're getting all our dudes back."</p>
