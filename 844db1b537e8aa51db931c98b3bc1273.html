<h1>Patrick Marleau has more Pittsburgh connections than you might expect</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Patrick Marleau grew up in the Canadian province of&nbsp;Saskatchewan and has played all of his 20 NHL seasons with the Toronto Maple Leafs and San Jose Sharks, the team that sent him to the Penguins in a trade Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he’s lacking in connections to the city in which he’s now employed, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After the deal was announced, Patrick’s wife, Christina, posted a couple of photos of&nbsp;Marleau wearing Penguins gear in the 1990s. Turns out, they were his favorite team growing up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The choice makes sense, considering Marleau was pre-teen when Mario Lemieux and Co. were winning back-to-back Stanley Cups in 1991 and ’92. They’d be a natural team for any young hockey fan to gravitate toward, let alone one who didn’t have a team in his native province. His closest possible rooting interests were Calgary and Edmonton in Alberta and Winnipeg in Manitoba.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A few years later, Pittsburgh became the place where Marleau’s NHL dream first came true. As the Penguins noted with a throwback photo on their Twitter page, he was the second overall pick in the 1997 draft, which was held at the Civic Arena.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Marleau also made his Stanley Cup final debut here in 2016, when his Sharks ultimately dropped the championship series against the Penguins. He scored his only goal of the series in Game 1 at PPG Paints Arena, a 3-2 Penguins victory.&nbsp;</p>
