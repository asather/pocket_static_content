<h1>Wali Jamal brings Pittsburgh's black history to life, on stage, page and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wali Jamal’s heroes have always been writers.</p>
<p>Sure, he is passionate about family, acting and black history, but he has “come to terms” with this fact about himself.</p>
<p>From the comic books that triggered his insatiable curiosity to Pittsburgh pioneers such as Dr. Martin R. Delany and August Wilson, he has found inspiration in how his heroes have elevated the language and revealed truths about living black in America.</p>
<p>The actor-musician-stand-up comedian has always done some writing, usually in play form, but now Jamal is in the midst of his most ambitious one-man project yet, which has led him to another conclusion: “Writing is hard.”</p>
<p>For the past five years, Jamal has been working to showcase the accomplishments of Delany, Pittsburgh's first black physician, who also was an abolitionist, journalist, author, politician and the highest commissioned black officer in the United States as a major in the Union Army.&nbsp;Delany worked alongside Frederick Douglass and was just as prominent in his time as a proponent of "Africa for Africans," with the dream of establishing a settlement for black Americans in West Africa.</p>
<p>“The Delany Papers,” — written, read and performed by Jamal — will be available in&nbsp;paperback and audiobook next month (date TBA), and video chapters of the book are currently broadcast on local Comcast cable channel PCTV21 and on Jamal’s YouTube channel, History's Flipside.</p>
<p>Jamal is best known for his work on stage.&nbsp;The St. Clair Village native, 58, was the Post-Gazette Performer of the Year in 2018, having completed an unprecedented cycle of appearing in all of Wilson’s 11 plays, including the one-man show, “How I Learned What I Learned.”&nbsp;He will perform the show again, on March 13 at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, as part of the August Wilson Society’s biennial colloquium.</p>
<p>Language sparks his own creativity, and Delany’s&nbsp;florid prose reflects “the romanticism of the period and writers like Poe and Melville,” Jamal notes. “It was a time when people wrote speeches that would last two, three hours, so when I read it, the actor comes out.”</p>
<p>Jamal laughs when he compares the efficient title of his project with that of Delany’s own book: “The Condition, Elevation, Emigration, and Destiny of the Colored People of the United States.”</p>
<p>His vocabulary was “immense,” says Jamal, so that now words such as “consanguinity” (descended from the same ancestor), flow easily from his lips.</p>
<p>Memorizing lines, dates, facts — he begins many a conversation, “Did you know …” — has never been a problem for the actor.</p>
<p>He inherited his work ethic from his mother, Edith Elaine Scales Abdullah, who died in 1990 at age 51. Her son uses the word “awesome” often to describe the community activist who ran summer job programs out of their home in St. Clair Village.</p>
<p>Jamal’s path to the stage began as a musician. Determined to become an actor, Jamal thought he could find his way to theater through stand-up comedy, perhaps the toughest performing gig of all, and he used his prowess for mimicry in his act. Jamal recalls that dissatisfied audience members at one club on Centre Avenue “wouldn’t boo you, but they would clatter their ashtrays on the table.”</p>
<p>In 1991, he answered an ad and auditioned for Don Brockett, who was looking for extras in a musical.</p>
<p>“I did impressions because that was my shtick as a comic,” Jamal says, rattling off lines as Bill Cosby, Rodney Dangerfield and Myron Cope.&nbsp;And then, channeling Brockett’s gravelly voice, he relates that the late Pittsburgh entertainer told him, “You have a magnificent ear. When people talk, you actually listen and hear them. But I’m sorry, honey, I don’t have a part for you.”</p>
<p>Jamal, a drummer, also had “a little jazz band” and would play for dinner crowds at places such as Minutello’s in Shadyside. During that time, he “stumbled into an audition” for Kuntu Repertory Theater, where director Eileen Morris noticed him and asked him to read for her and theater founder Vernell Lillie. He walked out with the lead in “Lifting” by writer-photographer Frank Hightower, and met fellow actor Mark Clayton Southers, founder and producing artistic director of Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre Company.</p>
<p>“We became brothers instantly,” Jamal recalls. “That was my first play, and it was off to the races.”</p>
<p>He would go on to add “writer” to his many occupations, but it was only recently that he acquired the tools that have somewhat eased his task.&nbsp;Jamal received a $15,000 grant from Advancing Black Arts in Pittsburgh, a program of The Pittsburgh Foundation and the Heinz Endowments.</p>
<p>In his snug Downtown apartment, with wall-to-wall posters and memorabilia of plays he has appeared in, he explains that the grant went mostly to buying a laptop and camera equipment.</p>
<p>“Before this,” he says, pointing to the laptop, “for five years I wrote out everything longhand.”</p>
<p>Although he has been acting steadily for most of the past 15 years, Jamal’s major source of income has been from maintaining the apartment building where he lives. He lately has had his hours cut while at the same time working on “The Delany Papers” project and hoping to bring the rarely done “How I Learned What I Learned” to other cities.</p>
<p>Asked to trace the origins of his project, he doesn’t go back to his discovery and fascination with Delany, but to 1999, when he met August Wilson at a reading of “Jitney” at Southers’ Hill District home.</p>
<p>“When we had a break, I was out on the porch with him, because August and I were the only cigarette smokers. And I asked him, because I hadn’t written anything to that point, did he have any advice for an up-and-coming writer. He said, ‘Write what you know.’ So I was like, ‘OK. What do I know? I know black history.’”</p>
<p>He began by researching a hero he found in a comic book: Robert Smalls, a former slave who became an American businessman, publisher and politician.</p>
<p>He explains that Smalls represents one step in “coming to terms with the fact that all of my heroes have been writers. It started with Maurice Sendak and ‘Where the Wild Things Are.’ Then Charles Schulz and Jack Kirby and Stan Lee ….”</p>
<p>It was Golden Legacy comic books about black history that led him to Smalls and by extension, Delany. His play “Robert Smalls: Legend of the Black Mariner” <strong>—</strong>&nbsp;Smalls stole and then captained a ship in his flight to freedom —&nbsp;won a playwriting competition.</p>
<p>It took him two years to write his first draft of the play, with 53 characters to be acted by 20 actors. He laughs, knowing most theaters would scoff at the idea of such a monumental and expensive undertaking.&nbsp;“But incredibly, they did it,” he says of the 2016 production by Pittsburgh Playwrights.</p>
<p>On his way to a meeting to acquire funding to further his play, Jamal noticed the historical marker on Fourth Avenue at PPG Place that reads: “Martin R. Delany (1812-1885) A promoter of African-American nationalism, Delany published a Black newspaper, The Mystery, at an office near here. He attended Harvard Medical School, practiced medicine in Pittsburgh, and was commissioned as a major in the Civil War.”</p>
<p>Jamal’s reaction: “I said, ‘Doctor? Civil War major? Newspaperman? There’s my next project!’ ”</p>
<p>He threw himself into learning everything he could about the doctor, with the bonus that discovering Delany was like excavating 19th-century black history in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Previous books about Jamal’s subject include “Martin Delany, Frederick Douglass, and the Politics of Representative Identity” by Robert S. Levine.&nbsp;The doctor is often tied to the better-known Douglass in his activism.</p>
<p>“Martin Delany was just as brilliant and as well known as Frederick Douglass at the time,” notes Jamal, “but Frederick Douglass was his own, best press agent. He was photographed even more than Lincoln, and that was his own doing. He was in the Frederick Douglass business.”</p>
<p>Such observations and stories — some of a more notorious nature — are at Wali Jamal’s fingertips and online. And they are coming soon as an audiobook and, notably, to the page, one writer to another.</p>
