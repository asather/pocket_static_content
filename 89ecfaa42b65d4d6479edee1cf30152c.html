<h1>Paul Zeise: Let's hope MLB season is as entertaining as the negotiations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time in at least two weeks, I am starting to believe there will actually be a baseball season. That is a stark contrast to where I was last week when I was convinced we had no shot of baseball. The week before, though, I was convinced there was no way we would have a summer without baseball.</p>
<p>You get the picture. This has been a wild ride watching baseball players and owners trying to figure out how to come to an agreement. On some days, it seems neither side really wants to play, and on others, it seems both sides are hellbent on playing.</p>
<p>I think this latest proposal by the owners, though, proves they want to play and are willing to work to find some common ground with the players. There is now a feeling that the two sides are closing in on something that will work and we will have baseball this summer.</p>
<p>I think Pirates President Travis Williams <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/01/travis-williams-pirates-mlb-mlbpa-proposals-pittsburgh/stories/202006010076" target="_blank">said it best to Jason Mackey</a> on Monday.</p>
<p>“I’m confident just because I think reasonable minds will prevail,” Williams said. “They always do in these situations. These are unfortunate times for a lot of people in the world. This is not something that’s just hitting Pittsburgh or the United States. I think we all acknowledge that.</p>
<p>“We all understand that we’re going to be taking on losses, whether we’re talking about players or organizations. But at the end of the day, reasonable.”</p>
<p>That’s the good news, I just hope we at least get a few more days of the&nbsp;“negotiations” circus. Is that too much to ask? I turn on the news and it is all bad news and doom and gloom. I need a break from reality and watching the players and owners act like 14-year-olds has been extremely entertaining.</p>
<p>We need a few more days of Blake Snell and Bryce Harper whining that they need to get theirs. We need more Scott Boras trying to bully the players into taking a deal that is good for, well, him. We need more of owners like John Fisher, who is worth $2 billion, explaining why he can’t afford to pay minor leaguers $400 a week any more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Forget about “Survivor,”, MLB versus MLBPA is by far the best reality TV show going. And I don’t know right now that there is a close second. The only thing this show is missing is Carmen Electra, which makes me wonder if Dennis Rodman can hit a curve ball.</p>
<p>My fear is that the actual season won’t be nearly as entertaining as this labor dispute. I don’t know how it could possibly be, especially if it lasts only 50 or 60 games.</p>
<p>How in the world can we get excited about a home run chase that will be won by someone who hits 15 of them? How can it possibly be exciting for teams that get off to a slow start and are buried in the first three weeks. The pitcher who has the most wins will be like 9-3, and the closer with the most saves will have 12 or 13 of them.</p>
<p>What’s fun about that? Honestly, if they are going to play 50 games, they should just scrap that plan and make a 30-team double elimination tournament with nine-game series. Now that would be fun, though some teams might be done in 10 games when they get swept twice.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Did I also mention that on top of it all, the season will almost assuredly be played without fans and probably media, too? That means I won’t even be able to enjoy a BBQ sandwich from Manny’s or enjoy the game while taking in the sights, smells and sounds of a baseball stadium when a game is being played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baseball is a great sport. It is a sport that not everyone likes because of the pace but one that has so many nuances to it that it is far more entertaining than people know. It is a sport, though, that has often been ruined by labor unrest and mistrust between the owners and players. They always seem to find their way back to the field, however, and this is another time where I finally expect that it is going to happen.</p>
<p>I’m glad we will have baseball. I just hope that the season isn’t ruined because it lasts only 50 games. It could still be entertaining and my hope is that it will be. The only thing I do know is that players and owners have a lot of work to do in order to make sure the story of 2020 happens on the field and isn’t overshadowed by the circus-like atmosphere surrounding the negotiations.</p>
<p>Of course, check with me tomorrow, as it is entirely possible I could be back on the side that thinks we won’t have baseball at all this year.&nbsp;</p>
