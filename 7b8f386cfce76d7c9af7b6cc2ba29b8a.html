<h1>After 'statement' season opener, Pitt gets another chance to prove this year is different</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pat Narduzzi stood in front of his players last Saturday, minutes before Pitt ran out of the Heinz Field tunnel for the first time in 2020, and delivered an impassioned line of self-belief.</p>
<p>“We know who we are in here, guys,” Narduzzi said, pacing in Pitt’s locker room ahead of its season opener against Austin Peay. “And we’re going to show everyone else in the country who we are.”</p>
<p>That line, highlighted in a behind-the-scenes feature posted to Pitt’s YouTube channel, was appropriate for a hype video. Perfect, really. But in reality, the Panthers didn’t show the college football world who they are in last weekend’s 55-0 stomping of Austin Peay. That revelation will come over their next 10 games.</p>
<p>The No. 25-ranked Panthers — a group that welcomed high expectations this offseason and even broke training camp huddles by shouting, “ACC champs” — kick off what they hope is a march to the conference title game this Saturday. Pitt has its ACC opener against Syracuse, a game at Heinz Field that will help shape the trajectory of the Panthers’ season.</p>
<p>That may seem like a lot of hoopla and hyperbole for a Week 2 noon kick. Pitt is a 20-point favorite, and Syracuse lost by 25 in its opener, after all. But following what Narduzzi called a “statement” against Austin Peay, it’s important that Pitt does it again — only this time against a program that’s given the Panthers headaches over the years.</p>
<p>The average margin of victory in Pitt and Syracuse’s last five meetings is a touchdown. When Pitt was a 9.5-point favorite in 2015, it won by three. When the Panthers were 24.5-point favorites in 2016, they got into a downright silly 76-61 shootout. After that, Vegas wised up. The spread in the last three meetings hasn’t surpassed four points, and all three games were decided by one score.</p>
<p>A win’s a win, especially against a team considered a rival. But in a year where Pitt is supposed to be “different,” the Panthers shouldn’t settle for another razor-close call. Narduzzi said Monday, in reference to Austin Peay: “It’s not who we beat. It’s how we beat them.” That should apply to the Orange, too.</p>
<p>Syracuse is not good this season. At least it’s not supposed to be. The Orange were picked 14th of 15 ACC teams in the preseason predicted order of finish and feature a converted fullback on their leaky offensive line. Dino Babers’ team admirably hung around for three quarters at No. 12 North Carolina last Saturday, but the Orange were sacked seven times and eventually dismantled in a 31-6 loss.</p>
<p>Pitt, with its pass-rush and a poised performance from Kenny Pickett, has the chance to do the same to Syracuse. And in the process, it would give the Panthers a boost before a landmine-laden ACC slate.</p>
<p>Yes, the Associated Press’ top-25 poll is watered down. Even Narduzzi acknowledged that, with Big Ten, Pac-12 and other teams not currently playing and removed from consideration. But of the six other ACC teams ranked, the Panthers are scheduled to play five of them: No. 1 Clemson, No. 7 Notre Dame, No. 17 Miami, No. 18 Louisville and No. 20 Virginia Tech.</p>
<p>Pitt plays Miami and Notre Dame in back-to-back weeks in October, hosts Virginia Tech on Nov. 21 and travels to Clemson the following week to close its regular season. And before all that, the Panthers face an up-and-coming Louisville team at home next Saturday. The Cardinals, a dark horse pick to reach the ACC title game, should be Pitt’s biggest hurdle to a possible 5-0 start going into that Miami game on Oct. 17.</p>
<p>Which brings us to Syracuse.</p>
<p>After Pitt was picked to finish eighth in the ACC preseason poll, senior Damar Hamlin labeled the projections as “disrespect.” Pickett echoed that sentiment, saying: “It’s just another day for us. I feel like we get that disrespect every season.” Eighth was too low, no doubt. And yet, there is merit to the “respect is earned” argument that Twitter trolls and Pitt fans alike made on social media.</p>
<p>This past week, it felt like every compliment paid to Pitt had to be prefaced by saying: “Sure, it was Austin Peay ...” Sure it was Austin Peay, but Pickett’s downfield passing impressed. Sure it was Austin Peay, but Pitt’s red-zone running game was encouraging. Sure it was Austin Peay, but 55 points is 55 points.</p>
<p>The Panthers blew the doors off an inferior opponent, which they haven’t done in recent years. So yes, that was cause for applause. But Pitt was hardly tested against Austin Peay.</p>
<p>Maybe the Panthers will struggle with the test posed by Syracuse. Or maybe Pitt will pass with no issue at all. Either way, Narduzzi’s Panthers will really start to show who they are this Saturday — and give a glimpse of what’s to come in ACC play.</p>
