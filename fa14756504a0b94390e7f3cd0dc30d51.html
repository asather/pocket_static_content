<p>The University of Pittsburgh is telling students in three Asian and European countries that are among the most affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) to return to the U.S. and self-isolate as a precaution.</p>
<p>“Over the past day, we have notified 41 students studying in Italy, South Korea and Japan that they should return to their home communities in the United States and practice social distancing for 14 days after they arrive,” Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick said Friday.</p>
<p>Social distancing means staying roughly six feet from others and avoiding settings such as shopping centers, theaters, stadiums, workplaces, schools and classroom settings, plus public transportation such as subways, taxis and ride share, according to <a href="https://www.emergency.pitt.edu/covid-19/updates" target="_blank">Pitt’s Public Safety and Emergency Management Office</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We are continuing to monitor new developments both locally and around the world and remain in close communication with our students, faculty and staff about their travel plans,” Mr. Zwick added.</p>
<p>Earlier Friday, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/02/28/coronavirus-steel-valley-school-district-staff-stay-home-COVID-19/stories/202002280170" target="_blank">Steel Valley School District</a> officials said they learned that two of their staff members traveled outside the country to areas where active transmission of the virus has been confirmed.</p>
<p>Slippery Rock University also learned that overseas study abroad during campus spring break March 8-15 is off.</p>
<p>“Our international study abroad programs are designed to deliver immersive cultural learning experiences to our students,” Slippery Rock President William Behre said in a campus message. “Given the current situation, it is our belief that the spread of the virus has negatively impacted our ability to meet that deliberate educational intent.”</p>
<p>Just after 10 p.m Friday, Duquesne University announced it canceled a spring break trip to Rome that was scheduled to depart Saturday. The university is also arranging for the 59 students at its Rome campus to return to the U.S. In a previous statement, the university said it would&nbsp;“cancel pending trips and arrange for the return of any students, faculty and staff from that destination” if the location received a level three health travel notice.</p>

<p>The State Department on Friday updated Italy’s travel notice to a level three, meaning reconsider travel. It is the second-highest level warning.</p>
<p>As of Friday morning, almost 84,000 cases had been identified in 52 countries; about 2,300 deaths in 10 countries have been reported, Mr. Behre explained.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is prudent to recognize that as the outbreak is still evolving, the risk of possible infection is great,” Mr. Behre wrote to campus.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Robert Morris University canceled study abroad for the semester.</p>
