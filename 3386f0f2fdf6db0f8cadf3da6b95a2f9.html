<h1>Strip District-based self-driving car company closes on big deal with Volkswagen</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Strip District-based Argo AI has closed a deal with Volkswagen on a $2.6 billion investment, making the self-driving car startup a global company with a valuation of more than $7 billion.</p>
<p>The deal, which was announced last July, adds Volkswagen’s Autonomous Intelligent Driving team to Argo’s platform —&nbsp;giving the company an engineering center in Munich, Germany and bringing its total headcount to more than 1,000 employees.</p>
<p>AID — a subsidiary of Audi, which is part of the Wolfsburg, Germany-based Volkswagen Group — is developing technology that it hopes will create a universal self driving system in urban environments.</p>
<p>Argo, founded in 2016, had previously secured a $1 billion investment from Ford when it was first starting out.</p>
<p>“Our mission is built on the importance of developing trust in self-driving cars,” Argo co-founder and CEO Bryan Salesky and Argo Munich vice president Reinhard Stolle wrote in a blog post Tuesday.</p>
<p>“With Volkswagen and Ford integrating Argo AI’s system into their vehicles to support distinct initiatives for moving people and goods, we have a clear pathway to making a positive impact on the world.”</p>
<p>The partnership between Argo, Volkswagen and Ford can <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2019/07/12/Argo-AI-Volkswagen-self-driving-vehicle-ford-pittsburgh-bryan-salesky/stories/201907120097" target="_blank">increase the scale and reach of driverless technology,</a> and each company, the CEO of Ford Autonomous Vehicles LLC John Lawler wrote in his own blog post.</p>
<p>This isn’t the first collaboration of its kind. Before announcing its investment in Argo, Volkswagen had spent more than a year working with Aurora Innovation, another self-driving car startup with headquarters in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>Aurora later <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2019/06/10/Fiat-Chrysler-Aurora-Innovation-pittsburgh-self-driving-autonomous-vehicles-renault/stories/201906100072" target="_blank">announced a partnership</a> with U.K.-based Fiat Chrysler.</p>
<p>Yet another Pittsburgh-based autonomous vehicle company, Aptiv, recently announced a Boston-based joint venture with Hyundia.</p>
<p>Ford, which has committed to spend $4 billion through 2023 on development of its self-driving service, said it remains independent and fiercely competitive in building autonomous technology.</p>
<p>The partnership does not mean Ford is reducing its investment in the space but is instead reallocating resources to things like customer and experience and transportation as a service software, Mr. Lawler wrote.</p>
<p>Though still committed, Ford announced in April it had hit a speedbump in its development. The company pushed back the rollout of its autonomous vehicle service to 2022 following the impact of COVID-19, which shut down businesses and disrupted supply chains across the globe.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, the four companies competing in the autonomous vehicle race maintain that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/05/24/self-driving-car-testing-COVID19-coronavirus-Uber-Aptiv-Hyundai-Aurora-Argo-AI/stories/202005240037" target="_blank">COVID-19 has not disrupted any progress.</a></p>
<p>After a months-long pause in testing, Argo and Aurora put their self-driving cars back on Pittsburgh streets in mid-May. Uber, which has offices in the Strip District, and Aptiv, which has offices in Hazelwood Green, have yet to resume testing on public roads.</p>
<p>In addition to the Pittsburgh headquarters and latest addition of an office in Munich, Argo has engineering centers in Detroit, Palo Alto and Cranbury, New Jersey. The company is also mapping roads and testing self-driving cars in Miami, Washington, D.C., and Austin.</p>
