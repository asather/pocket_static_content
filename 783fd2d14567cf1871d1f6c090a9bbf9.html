<h1>Lawyer for ex county councilman McCullough tries to block order to report to prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A day after former Allegheny County Councilman Charles McCullough received an order to report to the courthouse to begin serving his 2½- to 5-year prison term his defense attorney has filed an emergency application with the state Superior Court to block the move.</p>
<p>Common Pleas Judge David R. Cashman issued his order on Tuesday asking McCullough, who has remained free on bond pending appeal since he was sentenced in November 2015, to report to his courtroom at 9 a.m. on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Wednesday, McCullough’s attorney, Adam Cogan, filed an application for emergency relief with the state Superior Court asking that it direct Judge Cashman to rescind his order since McCullough’s appeal is still pending.</p>
<p>On March 25, the state Superior Court affirmed McCullough’s conviction on five counts of theft and five counts of misapplication of funds.</p>
<p>However, McCullough filed a motion for reargument with the same court on May 7. That motion is still pending.</p>
<p>McCullough was convicted of writing more than $40,000 in checks for political contributions from the accounts of Shirley Jordan, an elderly widow he represented, without her permission.</p>
<p>Mr. Cogan wrote to Judge Cashman on Tuesday, explaining his position, but the court was not swayed.</p>
<p>Instead, Judge Cashman replied that McCullough’s appeal has been exhausted.</p>
<p>“The fact that he has filed a motion for re-argument with the Superior Court and the request of that re-argument occur before the Court En Banc is of no moment,” Judge Cashman wrote.&nbsp;“These motions are not a continuation of his right of appeal. His right of appeal concluded when he took the matter to the Superior Court, and his claims were rejected by the Superior Court on March 25, 2020.”</p>
<p>Judge Cashman went on to say that McCullough’s pending motions are not a matter of right, and instead are discretionary.</p>
<p>Failure to comply with his order, Judge Cashman said, would “necessitate that the sheriff of Allegheny County enforce that subpoena.”</p>
<p>McCullough’s attorneys argue in their emergency application to the Superior Court that Judge Cashman lacks jurisdiction to direct their client to begin serving his sentence while his appeal remains pending. They ask that bond continue through application for reargument and any petition for allowance of appeal to the state Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In his response, Deputy District Attorney Michael W. Streily called McCullough’s argument that Judge Cashman can’t revoke bond “rather astounding.”</p>
<p>“Appellant isn’t saying he is entitled to a hearing. He is saying that a trial court in Judge Cashman’s position never has the authority to revoke an appeal bond,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Streily said such a ruling would set a dangerous precedent.</p>
