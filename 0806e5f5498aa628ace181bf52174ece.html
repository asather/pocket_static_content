<h1>State reports 73 new COVID-19 deaths, one in Western Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Department of Health reported Saturday 73 new COVID-19 deaths and 680 new positive COVID-19 cases, the 20th straight day the state has reported fewer than 1,000 new cases.</p>
<p>Since the state’s first recorded death from COVID-19 on March 18, the state has now had 5,537 people die because of the infectious disease, the fourth most of any state in the country. Fifty-five of the state’s 67 counties have recorded at least one death.</p>
<p>Since the first recorded positive case on March 6, the state has now recorded 71,415 positive COVID-19 cases, the sixth most of any state in the country. All 67 counties in the state have had at least two positive cases.</p>
<p>Only one new death was reported by the state Saturday in Western Pennsylvania, in Allegheny County, though the state’s overall count of 163 deaths differs from the Allegheny County Health Department’s count of 151, with no new deaths reported by the county Saturday.</p>
<p>The state’s count, however, includes people whose legal residence was in Allegheny County, but may have died outside the county, either at a nursing home or hospital.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department reported 27 new positive cases and four new hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The new cases push the total of positive cases in the county to 1,897 since the county’s first confirmed case on March 14. That total includes 1,777 confirmed cases and 120 probable cases, which include positive antibody test results.</p>
<p>There have been a total of 151 deaths in the county —&nbsp;140 confirmed and 11 probable — but only one since May 21, according to <a href="https://alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx" target="_blank">the county’s coronavirus dashboard.</a></p>
<p>Those who have died in Allegheny County have ranged in age from 42 to 103, according to the county’s data. The median age of those who have died is 85.</p>
<p>The four new hospitalizations push the total number of people who are known to have been hospitalized in Allegheny County for COVID-19 symptoms to 340 since March 14.</p>
<p>Currently, according to the most recent data from the <a href="https://www.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/85054b06472e4208b02285b8557f24cf" target="_blank">state Department of Health’s Hospital Preparedness Dashboard</a>, there are 13 people in Allegheny County on a ventilator because of COVID-19.</p>
