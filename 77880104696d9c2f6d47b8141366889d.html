<h1>How did I end up with my mom's garden?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>My mother would never win a garden contest, or even consider entering one. She never cared about flowers in complementary colors, leaves of different sizes or the concept of scale —&nbsp;putting the shortest plants up front and bigger ones behind.</p>
<p>Raising nine children didn’t leave much time for gardening, so she focused on two beds in front of our house in suburban Buffalo, N.Y. When I was little, I remember her planting impatiens, zinnias, marigolds and other colorful annuals there and in&nbsp;a long narrow strip between the driveway and a tall wooden fence.</p>
<p>My favorite annual was ageratum, a fuzzy little round flower that’s usually blue or purple but also comes in pink and white. I thought it looked like the flower where the tiny Whos live on a dust speck in Dr. Seuss’ classic children’s book “Horton Hears a Who.”</p>
<p>“A person’s a person, no matter how small” resonated with me, maybe because I’m Thing 7 of 9. In my family, the older six kids were the skilled workers and the younger ones were the grunts. That made me and my sister, Patty (Thing 8), the main weeders. We didn’t mind getting dirty, were pretty thorough and unlike Kathleen (Thing 9) could tell the difference between flowers and weeds —&nbsp;usually.</p>
<p>I say usually because it was tough to recognize the tiny seedlings that sprouted in spring near where my mom planted ageratum the year before. While most annuals don’t self-seed, ageratum is often the pluckiest of volunteers in a laissez-faire garden.</p>
<p>My mother quickly recognized how much she could save on flowers if she could just keep us from pulling the ageratum. The year she had this revelation, she worked alongside me and Patty, acting as arbiter of our fistfuls of weeds. She never bought ageratum again.</p>
<p>By the time I was 12, our front garden consisted mostly of fuzzy blue flowers with a few other annuals growing in between. Ageratum didn’t reseed in the driveway bed, partly because it was shadier and partly because one of the fence posts was first base for our kickball games. The only plant to survive our sneakers was a rosebush in foul territory.</p>
<p>I didn’t realize then that I already had more garden experience than my mother. Little Mary Martha Zenger (there were lots of Marys in the Meyer-Zenger-Weimer clan) spent most summer days playing in the sand with her brother and cousins or swimming in Lake Erie by Angola, N.Y.</p>
<p>As I got older, my mom became a little more ambitious in the garden. She tried a few perennials —&nbsp;vining clematis, sedum and Montauk daisies that my sister, JoAnn, brought from Long Island. When my parents downsized to a smaller house, my mom took some perennials and added hydrangea and a few other shrubs. But I missed those fuzzy blues as I weeded or pruned her garden on my summer visits.</p>
<p>Now ageratum grows in my garden. My wife and I plant some each summer between annuals out front. We didn’t buy many this year because so many reseeded from last year, more than I’ve ever seen.</p>
<p>In this corona summer, lowly ageratum reigned, growing so tall and thick that it overwhelmed the salmon- and coral-colored geraniums it was supposed to complement.</p>
<p>My mom, who moved to a nursing home this spring, would have let the ageratum win. But I dug up the fuzzy blue flowers in front and moved them behind the pricey annuals. And when they again stole sun from the geraniums, I cut and plucked some more.</p>
<p>You can barely tell. In mid-September, the ageratum is still going strong and has lots of company in my merry Mary garden of volunteers and upstarts. There’s the ‘David’ phlox I bought years ago for its bright, white, late summer blooms. Thanks to bees who sneaked in pollen from someone else’s garden, we now have clumps that are pastel and dark pink, too.</p>
<p>The same thing happened with cleome, a reseeding annual known as spider flower. I planted white, but my favorites are the multicolored pink ones that pop up here and there like fireworks.</p>
<p>Then there’s the ‘Popcorn Drift’ groundcover roses I chose for their buttery yellow flowers that fade to cream. Over several years, the buds on each bush have turned into tiny floral sunsets with salmon petals and yellow centers. These beautiful little renegades are the reason we bought coral and salmon geraniums this year.</p>
<p>If I was as talented a floral arranger as my sister, Sue, I would make a bouquet of all of them for my mom, whom I haven’t seen since Easter because of COVID-19 restrictions. When I finally get to see her, I hope my pictures and descriptions are good enough. And I hope she wears her ageratum blue shawl. It’s my favorite.</p>
