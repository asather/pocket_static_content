<h1>Local reuse charities scale down during COVID-19, plan reopening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While some non-profits are seeing record levels of need for their services in the time of COVID-19 — food banks, for example, have seen long lines nationwide — smaller local organizations face uncertain times ahead.</p>
<p>The crisis is a unique challenge for groups that rely on taking in and redistributing used materials. The person-to-person contact that characterizes collecting, sorting, and redistributing donations simply isn’t feasible under present conditions.</p>
<p>Construction Junction Reuse, a group that takes in used and surplus building materials and resells them at discounted rates, is no longer accepting donations, their&nbsp; “bread and butter,” COO Melissa Mongelli said.</p>
<p>“We’ve redone our retail model,” she noted. Customers can arrange sales over the phone or via text, and participate in “social distancing pickups”: taking a specific, already-purchased item from the outside the facility without human-to-human interactions.</p>
<p>“We’re concerned about our staff,” Ms. Mongelli said. She added that, “this way, we can control the flow of people” coming to pick up their purchases.</p>
<p>Off the Floor Pittsburgh, which normally accepts donations of furniture and then gives them to disadvantaged families that lack home furnishings, has restricted donations considerably and has suspended all pickups and deliveries. Only if someone is moving, for example, thus making their donations impossible to collect after the crisis, will Off the Floor accept them.</p>
<p>“The last thing we want to do is see valuable furniture or household items thrown in the trash,” executive director Bob Myers said. Off the Floor also uses social distancing when accepting the donations — donors can leave items at their facility, which are then moved to the warehouse at a later date.</p>
<p>Mr. Myers expressed a number of concerns about conducting normal operations. Most donations come from affluent neighborhoods, he said, and affluent families are more likely to have traveled recently. Donations tend to go to low-income neighborhoods, which tend to have higher rates of comorbidities and less access to health care or health insurance.</p>
<p>“We’re in and out of homes daily,” said Mr. Myers. “That’s not a wise thing to do” under the current conditions.</p>
<p>The Free Ride Bicycle Project, which provides a “DIY space” to repair bicycles and also resells or gives away donated used bikes, has had to temporarily cease operations entirely, president Katie Blackburn said.</p>
<p>“It didn’t make sense for us to stay open in a way that would be safe,” Ms. Blackburn said, citing their use of shared workspaces and tools.</p>
<p>All three groups have seen significant declines in donation interest as the flow of gifts that typically comes with spring cleaning have been disrupted. Mr. Myers, for instance, said that Off the Floor has seen a 60-75% drop in donation offers. All three are hoping for a resurgence once business closures are lifted.</p>
<p>“After it’s lifted, we’re gonna need those donations,” Ms. Mongelli said. She encouraged people who used the quarantine period to do home improvement to save their surplus supplies.</p>
<p>Reopening presents its own challenges, however. All three expressed worries about acquiring enough cleaning supplies and personal protective equipment, items that become essential both for normal workplace cleanliness and for sanitizing every donation that comes in the door.</p>
<p>“Once we lift from the stay at home order, the virus doesn’t magically go away,” Ms. Blackburn said.</p>
<p>Ms. Blackburn suggested that the need to thoroughly disinfect every donated bicycle would be an extra step that would take away from staff and volunteers’ time and work. Mr. Myers worried that finding supplies that would likely still be going to high-priority locations, like hospitals, would be a challenge.</p>
<p>“You can’t find a container of disinfectant wipes anywhere,” he pointed out.</p>
<p>Ms. Mongelli said that, for the few employees still working, she had sewn masks with a sewing machine.</p>
<p>And employee retention presents an issue as well. Construction Junction had to furlough several employees, and Ms. Mongelli described the process of hoping for federal support to keep the remainder on payroll as a “waiting game.”</p>
<p>Off the Floor laid off several part-time employees, but Mr. Myers said they are already looking to bring on several new hires after the quarantine is over. That process is difficult due to the uncertainty in when that will be.</p>
<p>“We don’t know when we’re coming back,” he said. “How can you hire someone without giving them a start date?”</p>
<p>Free Ride is an all-volunteer operation, so Ms. Blackburn is more concerned about a dropoff in volunteers. Still, she is optimistic that their regulars will be excited to return.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping,” she said, “that distance makes the heart grow fonder.”</p>
