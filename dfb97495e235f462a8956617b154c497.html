<h1>Fishing Report: Family boat ride capped by a 40-pound muskie</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After a fun Fourth of July swim at Tionesta Lake, Forest County, the Martinelli family of Mount Washington motored once around the reservoir before attending a friend’s picnic. Joe Martinelli was trolling a 12-inch hand-carved wooden Baker Bait when the reel squealed. At the other end of the line was a 53½-inch, 40-pound muskellunge.</p>
<p>“It was a steady fight, like if you caught a tree,” he said.</p>
<p>The fish was released, but it turned belly up.</p>
<p>“We stayed with it for two hours but couldn’t keep it alive,” said Mr. Martinelli. “I release all of my fish, but this one didn’t make it.”</p>
<p>The muskie made a fine family dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie</strong> (Erie County) The walleye bite was improving, but anglers reported lots of throwaways. Boats were clustered over 30-40 feet of water west of Walnut Creek and in 40-50 feet from Trout Run to the Clay banks. Voracious post-spawn catfish took all baits and some in the 40-inch range were reported. Dan Morey of Erie was jigging east of the peninsula when he pulled a freshwater drum in excess of 30 inches into his fishing kayak. Because of dredging at the Walnut Creek Access Area, the beach, shoreline and Gateway Drive on the stream’s west side were closed.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Arthur</strong> (Butler County) Hybrid striped bass chased alewives into the shallows at night. Live alewives and stickbaits were effective. Largemouths went for plastic worms and spinners on these Big Bass Program waters, where the size minimum is 15 inches and daily creel limit is four.</p>
<p><strong>Private lake in Zelienople</strong> (Butler County) Wayne “Pops” McNeil of East Liberty, a 77-year-old member of Pittsburgh’s Let’s Go Fishing club, caught a 22-inch largemouth bass weighing more than 4 pounds at Conway Sportsmen’s Club on Tuesday.</p>
<p><strong>The Point</strong> (Allegheny County) Bass and panfish were caught near the confluence of the three rivers. A 35-inch flathead catfish took cutbait and was released following Fourth of July fireworks.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) As a bald eagle soared overhead on Fish-for-Free Independence Day, visitor Mason Tampuu of Toms River, N.J., landed smallmouths measuring 14½ and 12½ inches, plus a half dozen sublegal bass and a rainbow trout. With the creek very low, he floated crawlers and worked spinners through the deepest pools and undercuts, under logs and through the channel at bends.</p>
<p><strong>Twin Lakes</strong> (Westmoreland County) Despite the heat, angler pressure was high over the holiday weekend. Several good-size largemouths were taken.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalhanna Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) Big rainbow trout, former hatchery breeders, were apparent but not biting Sunday after the shade moved off the waters in the Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only area. Many of the trophy-size trout, stocked as part of the Keystone Select program, remain in the creek. Harvest season is open in DHALO waters.</p>
