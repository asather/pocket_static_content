<h1>The Next Page | A swing (and a splash) through California</h1>

<p>“Get down!” Miller Scott, our guide, commanded.</p>
<p>My son Jeff, three other passengers and I urgently plopped to the bottom of the raft. We were whitewater rafting on the Middle Fork of the American River in California and entering Tunnel Chute, the most famous rapid on the fork and one of the most unique in the United States. To make it easier to find gold, miners blasted a nearby hill to divert the river, creating this rapid and a tunnel.</p>
<p>We sped down the rapid as frothy as boiling water on a stove. Miller warned us that boats have a one-in-four chance of flipping or dumping passengers here. I had rafted the Middle Fork 20 years ago but chickened out on Tunnel Chute when I saw how treacherous it looked. Now older, I figured death is always lurking around the corner. Why not go for it?</p>
<p>Everything seemed perfect, then blub, blub, blub. The river ejected all passengers like human cannonballs.</p>
<p><strong>On to gold country</strong></p>
<p>This is what vacation looks like in the time of coronavirus.</p>
<p>The virus dashed our plans for another adventure in Africa, so we headed for gold country in California, an area rich in rapid rivers. Jeff and I have a nose for whitewater like dogs to a bone.</p>
<p>Traveling to San Francisco, we wore face masks for 10 hours in airports and on planes. It was Jeff’s first visit to the city by the bay. Many sites were closed because of the virus, so we went to one certain to be open.</p>
<p>We rented bicycles at Blazing Saddles and pedaled along the bay to the Golden Gate Bridge. Let me tell you. San Franciscans take this virus seriously. I don’t usually wear a mask outdoors around Pittsburgh, but I would have felt like a Cleveland Browns fan at a Steelers game if I had bicycled there without a mask.</p>
<p>The ride to the bridge was picturesque but businesslike on the bridge. The bike lane, narrowed by equipment, may have been about five feet wide — not much space to accommodate passing bicyclists. I didn’t dare gawk at the bay while I was pedaling on the bridge.</p>
<p><strong>Adapting to the virus</strong></p>
<p>Back on the Middle Fork, Jeff, the other passengers and I were taking a refreshing and unplanned dip. After plunging into the water, we bobbed up in darkness with the frantic sound of echoing voices. We floated through the 100-foot-long tunnel, one of only two in the world for whitewater rafting.</p>
<p>Miller explained that our raft veered right, rode up the right wall of the gorge and hit a seam where the fast water of the rapid met the slow water of an eddy.</p>
<p>“That seam grabbed our left tube and made the boat stand up,” Miller said.</p>
<p>I was impressed by the diligence that OARS, our outfitter for the whitewater trips, used in adapting to the virus.</p>
<p>The company delayed raft trips from spring until the Fourth of July for multiday trips as it trained staff in following new procedures to abate the spread of the coronavirus. The staff takes guests’ temperatures daily and a reading of 100.4 degrees raises red flags.</p>
<p>OARS requires guests to wear a mask on the shuttle bus and in the chow line at all times. Passengers must wash hands before and after eating and using the latrine.</p>
<p>“We put in a lot of time and planning and careful thought so that we could feel comfortable providing an outdoor excursion during a pandemic,” said Chris Moore, California manager of OARS.</p>
<p>That plan was further tested on an overnight trip on the Tuolumne River near Yosemite National Park.</p>
<p>The highlight of the Tuolumne is Clavey Falls, rated the second biggest whitewater rapid in the world by Northwest Rafting Company.</p>
<p>Our guide, Becca McNulty, lined up our raft to enter between the “goalposts,” a rock with water flowing over on one side and an exposed rock on the other. At her command, we dropped to the bottom of the raft and plunged down an eight-foot waterfall. We returned to our positions and missed Ski Jump Rock in the middle and then Table Rock, which could break a guide’s oar. Everyone stayed in the boat.</p>
<p>“There’s always butterflies in your stomach, a healthy anxiety of what could happen, if you don’t do it right,” Becca said. “If people fall out, it’s a very turbulent rapid.”</p>
<p>We spent the night at Indian Creek Camp on a broad, sandy beach littered with rusting, three-foot-wide pipes that floods had carried from an abandoned power station upstream. Jeff found a four-foot-long rattlesnake slithering among the stones on the shore. He came back and led me to the site. Were it not for its movement, I would never have seen it because its pattern blended so well against the rocks.</p>
<p>Doubling the rules of social distancing, we kept a healthy 12 feet away from the snake. It felt no need to coil, hiss or rattle and neither did I. But the snake was just 30 feet from the latrine.</p>
<p>We never opened our tent bag. Instead, we blew up the air mattresses, spread out our sleeping bags and slept under the stars.</p>
<p>In a night sky devoid of artificial light, constellations blinked overhead. An occasional meteor zipped past. A half moon bathed the canyon in soft light, and I could hear the constant murmur of river, a sound as soothing as a mantra.</p>
<p><strong>It’s a bear</strong></p>
<p>Needless to say, rural California is not San Francisco. In the small towns, many shoppers felt no need to wear a mask despite the obvious signs requiring them.</p>
<p>Jeff and I drove to Sequoia and Kings Valley National Parks. Wearing our masks in dense foot traffic, we walked the loop to the General Sherman Tree. It is the largest living tree in the world by volume at 2.7 million pounds. It stands nearly 275 feet tall and is about 2,200 years old.</p>
<p>After witnessing his first sequoias, Jeff said, “They were reminiscent of the giant talking trees from Lord of the Rings. They were massive.”</p>
<p>We hiked 500 feet to the Hanging Rock, a car-sized boulder that rests precipitously on a curving rock. From there we walked 0.3 miles to granite Moro Rock. A steep staircase of nearly 400 steps carved into the rock ascends the summit.</p>
<p>The stairway features a low rail, little safeguard against the sheer 6,725-foot drop. But the top afforded stunning views of the Great Western Divide, Castle Rock and the eastern half of Sequoia National Park.</p>
<p>We drove to the southern part of Sequoia National Forest and hiked five miles on the Needles Trail. The generally flat path ends at Needles Ridge, a formation of granite spires. The trail ended at a wooden staircase with a metal frame and railing.</p>
<p>The lookout at the summit burned down in 2011. I could see between the slats of the steps, and at 8,245 feet the height was dizzying. Both sides offered spectacular views of the Sierra Nevada, including Mt. Whitney, highest mountain in the contiguous United States, but there was no sign to identify it.</p>
<p>We drove through Sequoia National Forest and parked at Roaring River Falls. We hiked 1.6 miles to the start of a loop. We reached the South Fork Kings River. As we approached a pedestrian bridge, I said to Jeff, “Freeze.”</p>
<p>He kept on walking and talking. This time, I used my Dad voice only louder. “Freeze!”</p>
<p>Jeff looked ahead and stopped. A black bear, small but big enough to be on its own, was sauntering near the path. I wondered if it would continue toward us or turn right onto the bridge. It moved closer until it was only about 40 feet away. The bear smelled a post of the bridge then walked across like he owned it.</p>
<p>The bear headed toward the river where a mother, father and their two young children were lounging. Upon spotting the bear, the mother protectively herded the children close to her. The father, holding a cellphone, moved away from his family and closer to the bear.</p>
<p>I guess a vacation photo of a bear held more weight than his wife and children. Come to think of it, though, that bear was pretty cute.</p>
