<h1>Notebook: Trevor Williams goes five strong, Luke Maile goes yard in Pirates' intrasquad scrimmage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since early March, the Pirates trotted out onto a baseball field in full uniforms for game-like action on Friday.</p>
<p>The circumstances were informal, to be sure. It was an intrasquad scrimmage between Team Black and Team Gold. Trevor Williams was the starting pitcher for Team Black, and Robbie Erlin started for Team Gold.</p>
<p>The statistics from such an event are hard to take too seriously, given the incredibly small sample size — the scrimmage lasted just five innings before giving way to a sort of simulated game with coaches playing defense. Still, with the dearth of actual, real-life sporting events going on, Friday’s scrimmage was a welcome reprieve.</p>
<p>The highlights were, however, relatively few and far between. Williams was strong, which is, perhaps, the best scenario the Pirates could have hoped for entering the day. By unofficial stats, he went five innings, giving up just four hits and one earned run, while striking out four batters. That one run came in the top of the fourth inning, when, with runners on the corners and no outs, Jacob Stallings grounded into a 6-4-3 double play, which still managed to score the runner from third.</p>
<p>On the other side of things, Team Gold began with Erlin, who did not give up a run, and proceeded the rest of the way with a train of bullpen arms — Clay Holmes, Nick Burdi and Michael Feliz — pitching afterward.</p>
<p>Burdi was on the mound when Team Black struck back offensively in the bottom of the fourth inning. Right fielder Gregory Polanco drove home the run on a single up the middle. In the bottom of the fifth, catcher Luke Maile launched a solo home run to left center field off Feliz to make it 2-1.</p>
<p>The point, of course, is not the score to any of the Pirates. That was made clear by the goofy things that happened along the way. Baseball operations staffer Jeremy Bleich was the umpire, and in the simulated game portion of the day, he flinched a bit on an inside pitch before eventually ringing up Polanco, sparking some light-hearted arguments around the field.</p>
<p>As previously stated, the game fizzled out after five innings and morphed into a simulated game, during which Shelton, hitting coach Rick Eckstein, baseball operations special assistant David Eckstein and bench coach Don Kelly manned the infield. At one point during the scrimmage, infielders JT Riddle and Phillip Evans just traded teams. Starting pitchers Steven Brault, Mitch Keller and JT Brubaker sat in the right field bleachers and, at one point, started a mini wave between the three of them.</p>
<p>All of that is to say that the scrimmage isn’t meant to be taken seriously. It’s more a necessity to get work in for multiple players at once and accelerate the process of preparing for the season opener in two weeks.</p>
<p>“I think it’s more the live BP, the seeing how hitters are reacting to pitchers, seeing pitchers and what the action of their breaking ball is, what the action of the changeup is, if they’re able to locate the fastball,” manager Derek Shelton said Friday. “I was a little surprised at our intensity today on the bases, in a good way, because I think they were happy to be out there. We don’t want anybody to go full-out right now because we don’t want any of those soft-tissue injuries that we talked about, but the fact that they went about it the way they did today, with the enthusiasm they did, it was nice to see the first day.”</p>
<p><strong>Summer camp schedule moving forward</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates’ first intrasquad scrimmage was supposed to take place on Thursday night, but was pushed back because of rain. Going forward, they hope to do something similar every day, though the length of the scrimmages will vary.</p>
<p>“I think tomorrow we have four innings, maybe three and a half,” Shelton said. “... Today was the first day we played, so it’s not a spring training game where we would throw guys out there for seven innings. They were out there for four and a half or five. We split up the catching. You’ll probably see, I think tomorrow ... you’ll see us play three and a half full innings. If we get to a point where we have two starters lined up on the same day and a bunch of relievers, and we play nine, you’ll probably see three innings of the Eckstein Brothers’ dynamic duo in the middle and Donnie at first, but we won’t stretch our players out until they’re ready, just for leg wise and comfort wise.”</p>
<p>Lining up the pitchers becomes an interesting subject, especially after a day like Friday, when six different bullpen arms threw. Shelton said they aren’t to the point where they want to have those pitchers throw back-to-back days, though he does think they will get to that point near the end of spring training.</p>
<p>That may be part of the reason that tomorrow’s scrimmage will be just three and a half innings. It’s all built into the summer camp schedule that Kelly and the rest of the staff have put together, which has had to be adjusted for inclement weather as well as the Allegheny County restrictions on people congregated in one place at the same time.</p>
<p>“Give kudos to Donnie and [director of field operations] Matt Brown because they made an adjustment at like 9:30 this morning that was really good to get all the players here and to get the workout in,” Shelton said. “... The second thing is I thought, because of that and because we changed, the fact that our players had as much energy as they did and went about it, especially defensively today, it was pretty cool to see. I just wanted to give kudos to those two guys before we started.”</p>
