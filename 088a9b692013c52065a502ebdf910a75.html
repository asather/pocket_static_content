<h1>Pitt basketball beats North Carolina, wins first ACC road game in nearly three years</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHAPEL HILL, N.C. -- For all that has beleaguered North Carolina this season -- and with an 8-6 record at a school so utterly unaccustomed to such a mark, there has been a lot -- it’s still North Carolina, one of college basketball’s preeminent programs that enjoys every benefit that comes with such an exalted standing.</p>
<p>The Tar Heels lost three first-round NBA draft picks from last season and their best player this season -- Cole Anthony, a projected top-five pick in this year’s draft -- is sidelined with a right knee injury, but their roster still features four players who were four-star prospects coming out of high school and a fifth who had five stars, all of whom are piloted by a coach with 879 career wins. Their worst start in nearly two decades had dampened enthusiasm, but nearly 21,000 fans still gathered Wednesday night at a palatial venue that still dangles seven national championship banners over the head of any team that lines up against them.</p>
<p>Playing here and playing this program, even in the worst and leanest years, still means something. Winning, though? That means even more, something Pitt is now able to say it knows all about.</p>
<p>Behind some timely second-half shooting from sophomore guard Trey McGowens and freshman forward Justin Champagnie, who combined for 33 points in the game’s final 20 minutes, and a renewed defensive effort late in the game, Pitt defeated North Carolina, 73-65, Wednesday at the Dean Smith Center. It was the Panthers’ first-ever win against North Carolina in Chapel Hill and just their third win against it since 1941. Additionally, it was Pitt’s first ACC road win since a Feb. 2017 victory at Boston College.</p>
<p>Forgettable as this season continues to be for the Tar Heels, Wednesday was anything but for their jubilant opponent.</p>
<p>“It means a lot,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “This is one of the storied programs in the history of college basketball and one of the storied buildings. There’s a lot of history, a lot of tradition here. For us, I don’t think our program has won an ACC road game since 2017. I don’t think it's a coincidence that it had to have a lot of adversity, a lot of things we didn’t do in the first half and to get down and have to come back.”</p>
<p>McGowens finished the night with a team-high 24 points and career-high eight assists (of the team’s 13 total) while Champagnie added a career-high 22 points and eight rebounds. The duo made 10 of its 15 second-half shots, including a seven-of-nine mark from 3-point range. Sophomore guard Xavier Johnson added 17 points, though he also had six turnovers.</p>
<p>Four days after relinquishing a 16-point first half lead in a ghastly loss to Wake Forest, the Panthers (11-4, 2-2 ACC) played spoiler this time. Trailing by 11 with 17 minutes remaining, they outscored North Carolina, 43-24, the rest of the way. That burst was at its best and most efficient during a seven-minute stretch in which they made eight of their nine shots, including all five of their 3s. Four of those 3s came from Champagnie, who buried those shots in a span of just 3:52. A deep McGowens 3 pushed that advantage to eight with 5:36 remaining and though the Tar Heels (8-7, 1-3) twice got within four in the final four minutes, they were unable to get any closer, undone by the types of miscues that have plagued them for much of the season.</p>
<p>It was the largest halftime lead North Carolina had blown at home since 1997.</p>
<p>“I’d like to come up with something witty and something different...but I don’t have it,” North Carolina coach Roy Williams said.</p>
<p>After the Tar Heels went into halftime up nine, the game turned in every conceivable way in the final 20 minutes. Pitt’s offense was, yet again, anemic in the first half, scoring just 28 points on 36 first-half possessions against an opponent that had, only three days earlier, given up 96 points on 73 possessions to the second-worst statistical offense in the ACC. In the second half, it scored 45 points on 35 possessions. Defensively, after giving up 37 points on 36 first-half possessions, it limited North Carolina to 28 points on the final 35 possessions.</p>
<p>“He [Capel] was saying if we just attack them, attack them, attack them, their fans will basically just die out,” Champagnie said. “Just keep attacking, keep attacking, keep attacking.”</p>
<p>Following the Wake Forest loss, Capel preached togetherness to his players. If they were going to beat North Carolina on the road -- even against a squad that Williams said two days earlier was "the least gifted team I've ever coached in the time that I've been back here,” creating any number of headlines in the process -- it would need it. In practice on Sunday, McGowens said the team had a meeting where everyone “worked out our differences.”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, particularly in the second half, it looked like a group that had done just that.</p>
<p>“We need everyone,” McGowens said. “I just trusted my guys. If I trust them, I know they’re going to take care of me and make everything else happen.”</p>
<p>For many of the Panthers’ 11 eligible scholarship players, eight of whom are only in their first or second year with the program, the weight of its road winless streak was only felt so much.</p>
<p>But as they gathered in the locker room after the victory, those relative newcomers could see joy in others, some of whom were at Pitt when things felt much more dire, like a 31-point loss in the same building two years earlier. Having lost some of those games themselves, they could feel that joy, too.</p>
<p>As they had discussed earlier in the week, they’re all in this together.</p>
<p>“We were glad, but at the same time, that’s something we’ve got to get used to,” Johnson said. “We’ve got to start winning and try to turn this program around.”</p>
