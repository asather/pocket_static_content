<h1>Another decline in state university enrollment, but this time with noticeable bright spots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New enrollment numbers, likely to guide difficult talks about campus consolidation and teaching force reductions, show continued erosion across Pennsylvania’s 14 state universities including those in Western Pennsylvania. But there are some bright spots, too.</p>
<p>It’s now been a full decade since the State System of Higher Education as a whole last gained enrollment. Headcount numbers released Friday afternoon continue that trend, with a decline of about 2.2%, or 2,074 students from last year, that brings the total to 93,708 —&nbsp;numbers not seen in two decades.</p>
<p>Enrollment has fallen by 22%, or 25,809 students, from the system’s peak in fall 2010-11 of 119,513 students. Losses on some campuses are far larger.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there were encouraging signs in the latest data.</p>
<p>For instance, half of the 14 universities mustered gains of varying size —&nbsp;far more than in some previous years —&nbsp;including Mansfield University, which had the largest gain at nearly 7.7% to 1,792 students. Cheyney University, the smallest campus, grew by about 1.5% to 627 students.</p>
<p>The historically Black campus in suburban Philadelphia has been in an epic struggle to reverse its enrollment and financial woes, and the system and governor’s office have intervened with assistance given Cheyney’s distinct mission in helping the system ensure educational equity.</p>
<p>Population loss, in particular in Western Pennsylvania, has fueled enrollment losses in part, but so have competition and rising campus prices on system campuses in a state that traditionally ranks 47th or 48th in taxpayer support for higher education.</p>
<p>The new numbers show that three of Western Pennsylvania’s five system universities saw enrollment declines this fall. The other two, Slippery Rock and California University of Pennsylvania, mustered modest gains.</p>
<p>Slippery Rock’s enrollment edged upward by nearly 1% to 8,876, a gain of 70 students. California University of Pennsylvania saw its fall enrollment grow to 6,885, a gain of 43 students, or just under 1%.</p>
<p>The largest decline percentage-wise was at Edinboro University, whose enrollment of 4,319 represents a loss of 327 students or 7%. Indiana University of Pennsylvania saw another student decline, too, totaling 569 or 5% percent, reducing its campus population to 10,067.</p>
<p>In suburban Philadelphia, West Chester University, largest of the 14 campuses, saw a 28 student increase to 17,719, essentially unchanged from last year.</p>
<p>The State System’s board of governors meets Wednesday and Thursday. The latest data are likely to influence uncomfortable discussions about the system’s deteriorating finances and need to right itself to continue its mission as Pennsylvania’s access system, whose&nbsp;campuses are the least costly option to secure a university degree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re collectively working to recapture our affordability edge so that students regardless of zip code can access a system university,” State System spokesman David Pidgeon said this week in describing State System redesign efforts and campus budget cuts.</p>
<p>Jamie Martin, the head of the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, expressed concern about decisions being made without complete data, concerning both the 350 faculty reductions proposed and campus consolidations include one involving California, Clarion and Edinboro universities.</p>
<p>She questioned whether the State System’s goal of bringing student-faculty levels in line with the campuses’ peak enrollment in 2010 is in the best interest of students, noting smaller class sizes on campuses including the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State.</p>
<p>Policy experts have long warned that a system created in 1983 to ensure that all students have access to a quality education needs a larger commitment from the state. Others, including members of the Legislature say the State System, has not moved quickly enough to adapt to demographic realities.&nbsp;</p>
