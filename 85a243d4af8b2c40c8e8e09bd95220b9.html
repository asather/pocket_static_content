<h1>Ethan Morton's big fourth quarter leads Butler to PIAA playoffs victory over Upper St. Clair</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Butler fell behind early to Upper St. Clair in their PIAA Class 6A second-round clash. The Golden Tornado trailed by 10 after the third quarter.</p>
<p>But if any team knows that all that matters is how you finish, it’s this Butler squad. The Golden Tornado rallied for yet another playoff win, knocking off the Panthers, 77-73, at Robert Morris University’s UPMC Events Center.</p>
<p>As news of sports teams — from professional to college to high school — cancelling games due to coronavirus concerns, the Butler-Upper St. Clair matchup originally scheduled at North Allegheny was played in a packed house. It was moved earlier in the week to accommodate an anticipated crowd.</p>
<p>When the teams met at the same location in the WPIAL semifinals, Butler scored a 83-78 come-from-behind victory in overtime.</p>
<p>Butler (22-4) has won 17 games in a row and will face District 10 winner McDowell in the quarterfinals Saturday at a time and location to be determined.</p>
<p>Ethan Morton, who was hobbled by an injured ankle in the first round, came alive in the fourth quarter when he scored 16 points to spur Butler to the finish.</p>
<p>“We’re pretty seasoned right now, so nobody was panicking,” said Butler coach Matt Clement. “It was just a phenomenal, all-around effort by everyone on that court today.”</p>
<p>Morton netted 21 in the game and was shut out in the second and third quarters. As the Panthers focused on slowing down Morton with relentless pressure, Mattix Clement stepped up by knocking down five 3-pointers as he finished with 26 points. Devin Carney added 12 more.</p>
<p>“How we pulled off the win was all heart,” said Mattix Clement. “Other people were able to step up when Ethan was a little hurt and we were able to handle the pressure.”</p>
<p>Ethan Dahlem paced the Panthers with 18.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair (21-5) led, 63-51, early in the fourth before Morton took over. Butler took the lead with 2:20 remaining when Clement knocked down a pair of free throws. The Panthers’ Joshua Russell sank a 3 with 57.2 seconds remaining to cut Butler’s lead to 74-73 before Morton made 3 of 4 free throws in the final 30 seconds to clinch the win.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair racked up 32 points in the first quarter behind a surge from Dahlem. He netted 12 in the quarter, including a pair of 3s. The Panthers came out firing and knocked down five shots from behind the arc. Clement helped Butler keep pace by knocking down a trio of long-range shots as he racked up 14 points in the first quarter.</p>
<p>Morton threw down a dunk in traffic early in the game then knocked down a 3 before time expired in the first. He was held in check in between, ending the quarter with five points.</p>
<p>The Panthers took a 32-23 lead into the second quarter when the pace slowed a bit. USC held a 44-38 lead at the break. Both Dahlem and Clement ended the half with 14 points a piece.</p>
<p>Butler took the lead, 51-50, when Clement sliced to the hoop and layed it in with 3:55 remaining in the third. USC answered with an 11-0 run, knocking down 3s on three straight possessions and culminating with a layup by Landon Rauch. At that point, it looked like Butler was in trouble.</p>
<p>“I thought we had them,” said Upper St. Clair coach Dan Holzer. “But [Morton’s] a special player.”</p>
<p>In the end, Butler and Morton did it one more time.</p>
<p>“He’s a difference maker,” Upper St. Clair coach Dan Holzer said of Morton. “He’s that good. I have that much respect for him. He’s the best player in the state of Pennsylvania.”</p>
