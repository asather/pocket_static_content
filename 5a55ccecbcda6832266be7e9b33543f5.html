<h1>For Western Pennsylvania's post-9/11 veterans, a vibrant, resourceful community</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During Al Villanueva’s final mission in Afghanistan, he and fellow Army Rangers boarded a Chinook helicopter while rocket-propelled grenades exploded all around them.</p>
<p>Two months later he was in the NFL.</p>
<p>Mr. Villanueva had a degree from the United States Military Academy, a stellar service record and leadership experience in addition to the opportunity to play football. Not all veterans are so lucky. But even Mr. Villanueva, now the Steelers left tackle, struggled with reintegration to civilian society.</p>
<p>“When I joined the NFL I was a practice squad dummy,” he said. “I was treated like a rookie football player and nobody understood what I did in the service. I was not proud of myself at all and I looked at myself different without a uniform. I was not in a good place for many reasons.”</p>
<p>Fortunately for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2019/12/21/al-villanueva-steelers-war-afghanistan-peace-talks-negotiations-pittsburgh-veterans/stories/201912170160" target="_blank">Mr. Villanueva and other veterans in Western Pennsylvania</a>, the Pittsburgh area houses a vibrant post-9/11 veteran community, which includes the resources necessary to provide the help that vets need.</p>
<p>According to RAND’s Center for Military Health Policy Research, nearly 20% of veterans who served in Afghanistan or Iraq have either post-traumatic stress disorder or depression. A study from the National Institute of Drug Abuse found that 25% of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans displayed signs of substance abuse disorder.</p>
<p>“Up until probably 10, 15 years ago, you had to have a visible wound to be considered, the fact that you had been through … you need some help,” said Sean Buzzard, an Air National Guardsman who deployed to the Middle East and the Pittsburgh chapter captain of the <a href="https://www.teamrwb.org/" target="_blank">non-profit TeamRWB [Red, White and Blue]</a>. “Now we realize, not all wounds are visible, and there’s just a lot of other stuff that went on and goes on and affects people and it's OK to talk about it. Before it was kind of, couldn’t talk about those kind of things. There was a stigma.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Inner turmoil...’</strong></p>
<p>Adam Zaffuto, a Hampton High School graduate who served in the Army in Iraq and Afghanistan, left the military after a back injury, a tear in the muscle wall that surrounds the spinal column that allowed a disc to push against his sciatic nerve. He struggled to reconcile the things he did in the name of his country with the idea of being a good and moral person.</p>
<p>“When I came home I was probably self-medicating a lot of the …” he trailed off.</p>
<p>“You have this inner turmoil about the things you saw, the things you did, the experiences you had. You have regret and shame and anger and very intense feelings that you don’t particularly want to share with somebody that doesn’t really understand, because they're not going to be able to understand you. My biggest fear was ending up as a [expletive]-up, damaged veteran that wasn’t capable of doing anything after the military. Because I had seen that.”</p>
<p>After leaving the Army, Mr. Zaffuto enrolled at Duquesne and went to therapy there two days a week for 18 months. He still goes sometimes. He discovered a book called “War and the Soul: Healing our Nation’s Veterans From Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder” by Edward Tick.</p>
<p>“Reading that book really changed my life and how I viewed myself after combat and after these experiences,” said Mr. Zaffuto, who works as a territory manager for Identified Technologies, a drone mapping company. “You read passages out of this book and it jumped out at me as like, oh this is like somebody that’s speaking from my heart, my experience.”</p>
<p>Mr. Villanueva, 31, received help from Mike Munchak, the Steelers’ former offensive line coach.</p>
<p>“He preached toughness every day,” Mr. Villanueva said. “I think that mentality not only helped me play football, it also helped me cope with all the feelings and emotions that would come up about the war. I became addicted to this type of toughness in people and I started surrounding myself with this mentality.”</p>
<p><strong>High marks</strong></p>
<p>In the veteran community, Pittsburgh gets high marks as a place to live because of the cost of living and educational opportunities. According to 2019 census estimates as of July 1, 2019, the 742,000 veterans in Pennsylvania account for 7.3% of the state’s population, and there are, conservatively, 76,000 vets in Allegheny County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2015, Syracuse University’s Institute for Veterans and Military Families selected the heath and wellness center at UPMC Mercy to host <a href="https://pittsburgh.americaserves.org/" target="_blank">PAServes — Greater Pittsburgh</a>, a part of the AmericaServes network of public, private and non-profit organizations dedicated to helping veterans. Four years later, they have helped about 4,600 veterans, 26% of which are post-9/11, with employment, benefits navigation, housing, and individual and family support.</p>
<p>“Now we focus heavily on preventative measures where we are doing more benefits navigation support, more employment support,” said Matt Gryskewicz, PAServes’ program administrator. “So not just finding a job but finding meaningful employment for veterans as well.”</p>
<p>Local post-9/11 veterans founded <a href="http://steelcityvets.org/" target="_blank">Steel City Vets</a> in 2010 to help vets find jobs and connect to the community. TeamRWB focuses on engaging veterans in physical and social activity. <a href="http://www.vlpwpa.org/" target="_blank">The Veterans Leadership Program of Western Pennsylvania</a> was founded in 1982, as Vietnam veterans struggled to find jobs with the mills closing, and continues to help veterans find housing, employment and support.</p>
<p>“VLP tries our very, very best to get out into the communities and do outreach so that we can find veterans as they’re transitioning out,” said Melissa Ernst, the VLP’s director of public relations. “Even if they don’t need services, just getting them connected with the organization. We do a lot of wellness events just to kind of keep the post-9/11 veterans connected.”</p>
<p>Ernst comes from a military family. Her father, David, spent 32 years in the Air Force. She didn’t find out until after joining ROTC in college that a medical issue disqualified her from joining the military, so she began helping veterans. Her mission took on a heightened importance when her fiancé’s roommate, a veteran, committed suicide. She joined the VLP in May.</p>
<p>“My background is in veteran employment,” she said. “I think that’s a very big part of the piece. It’s not just helping veterans find a job when they come out, but securing gainful employment. Not just financially rewarding careers but a purposeful career as well.”</p>
<p><strong>A weekly trip</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Villanueva had the day off on a recent Tuesday in December, but he came to the Steelers facility for a photo shoot for this story. After that, he was on his way to the VA Medical Center Oakland, a trip he makes every week during the season.</p>
<p>“I want to be the best I can be for them, both on and off the field,” he said. “I served in the military to find a way into American society [Mr. Villanueva, whose father was in the Spanish Navy, was born in Mississippi but grew up overseas] and although it’s come with many challenges, the military community has been nothing but positive in my life. I could have not been more thankful to have landed in a town where they accepted me.”</p>
