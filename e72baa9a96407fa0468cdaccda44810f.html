<h1>New Zealand preparing for four-week lockdown beginning Wednesday</h1>

<p>WELLINGTON, New Zealand —&nbsp;&nbsp;Office workers are hauling computers and plants to their cars and shoppers are stripping shelves bare of coffee, flour and toilet paper before New Zealand starts a four-week lockdown.</p>
<p>“I know it will feel daunting,” Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said, but she said the move was meant to save lives.</p>
<p>People must stay home and all non-essential businesses and activities cease when the lockdown begins late Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The decision came as health officials announced another 36 confirmed cases of COVID-19, bringing the total to 102. Most were tied to travel overseas, but crucially, two of the cases could not be traced and officials believe they are evidence of a local outbreak.</p>
<p>New Zealand, which has a population of 5 million, already has closed its borders to all but citizens and residents.</p>
<p>New Zealand also considers itself a gateway to South Pacific island nations that would be devastated if the virus took hold there, given their isolation and poor health systems. Only a handful of virus cases have been identified so far in the South Pacific, including two in Fiji and one in Papua New Guinea.</p>
<p>In Australia, a fourth Australian federal lawmaker has tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>South Australia state Senator Rex Patrick, from the minor Center Alliance party, said on Monday he tested for COVID-19 after being in contact with infected government Senator Andrew Bragg two weeks ago. Bragg, from New South Wales state, is among 35 guests who became infected at a March 6 wedding south of Sydney.</p>
<p>Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton was the first Australian lawmaker to discover he was infected days after returning from Washington, where he met President Donald Trump’s daughter Ivanka and U.S. Attorney General William Barr. Queensland state government Senator Susan McDonald announced days later that she was also infected.</p>
<p>None of the four is in the national capital Canberra, where a scaled-down Parliament is meeting to pass economic stimulus spending measures to soften the virus’s economic blow.</p>
