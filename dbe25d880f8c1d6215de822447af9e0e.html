<h1>Ron Cook: Pirates are getting what they paid for right now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In America, you almost always get what you pay for. If you want a steak, it costs more than a burger. If you want a good bottle of wine, it costs more than Ripple. If you want a Maserati, it costs more than a Ford Fiesta.</p>
<p>And if you want a good baseball team?</p>
<p>Apparently, the Pirates don’t.</p>
<p>In the first two games of the coronavirus-afflicted 2020 season, they looked exactly like a team with a pro-rated payroll of $24.8 million, second-lowest in baseball ahead of only the dreadful Baltimore Orioles, according to spotrac.com. The lineup they put on the field Saturday against the St. Louis Cardinals didn’t even vaguely resemble a major league lineup. The result was a predictable 9-1 loss.</p>
<p>Your cheaply constructed Pirates are 0-2.</p>
<p>“It’s two games. Let’s not get crazy,” skipper Derek Shelton said. “You can’t get reactionary with anything.”</p>
<p>Shelton is right, of course. Even in this shortened season, there still are 58 more games, COVID-19 permitting. But if the Pirates lose Sunday afternoon to the Cardinals at Busch Stadium, the three-game losing streak will be like starting 0-8 in a regular season. Beyond that, the two games were hideous, enough to make you want to hide your eyes:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Pirates went down one-two-three in 12 of the 18 innings and managed more than one hit in just four innings.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Pirates had just one extra-base hit, a double by Colin Moran in the ninth inning of Friday night’s 5-4 loss. The Cardinals, by comparison, had a double, triple and four home runs.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Pirates hit .169 as a team, the Cardinals .288.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Cardinals’ payroll is a pro-rated $70.5 million. That seems relevant here, doesn’t it?</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The Pirates’ offense was so bad Saturday — three singles in 30 at-bats — that Shelton was left to brag about the work of Chris Stratton, Nik Turley and Kyle Crick out of the bullpen. That would have been laughable if it wasn’t so downright pathetic.</p>
<p>It didn’t take a genius to see that Saturday was going to be a long day for the Pirates. The bottom four hitters in Shelton’s lineup were Phillip Evans, Guillermo Heredia, John Ryan Murphy and Cole Tucker. Evans spent last season at Class AAA. Heredia came into the season as a .240 career hitter with 17 home runs in 974 at-bats. Murphy hit .175 last season and is a .219 career hitter as a backup catcher in seven big-league seasons. Tucker, the only one of the four to play for the Pirates last season, hit .211 as a rookie in 2019 with 40 strikeouts in 147 at-bats.</p>
<p>The four combined to go 1-for-11 against Cardinals starter Adam Wainwright and three relievers.</p>
<p>Heredia has been especially awful in the small sample size. He went 0-for-7 in the two games and took a called third strike with the bases loaded in each. Not exactly a good first impression, right?</p>
<p>Maybe the return of Gregory Polanco will help. He is expected to play this week after missing time because of COVID-19. When he’s ready, he’ll immediately jump into right field, where Heredia played Friday night and Tucker did on Saturday.</p>
<p>Certainly, it will help if Kevin Newman, Bryan Reynolds and Adam Frazier do something — anything — at the top of the order. They combined to go 2-for-22 in the two games. Reynolds, who hit .314 as a rookie last season, is off to an 0-for-7 start.</p>
<p>Only Moran and Josh Bell have looked as if they have a clue at the plate. They have combined for five of the Pirates’ 11 hits.</p>
<p>“These guys are going to hit,” Shelton said. “They’re going to have better at-bats. We just have to get our feet on the ground and get going.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Shelton continues to wait for his first win as a big-league manager. He even lost the three exhibition games to Cleveland during spring training 2.0. The stinking mess that his team already appears to be is hardly his fault, or even that of new general manager Ben Cherington. The blame goes higher than that in the organization — much higher, all the way to the very top.</p>
<p>Let me guess what you are thinking:</p>
<p>That doesn’t make the losing easier to accept. It makes it harder.</p>
