<h1>Chase Claypool pick gives Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers 'one more weapon'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers did not let a run on wide receivers deter them from what they ultimately wanted to do with their top selection in the NFL draft.</p>
<p>And they were able to provide some depth behind T.J. Watt and Bud Dupree at outside linebacker to help pressure the three young No. 1 quarterbacks in their division.</p>
<p>Even though 10 receivers were selected before it was their turn, the Steelers used their top pick on Notre Dame’s Chase Claypool, a big, physical wide receiver who they think can help strengthen what was one of the league’s lowest-scoring offenses in the second half of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>Claypool, who was selected with the 49th overall pick, was one of the freakish players in the draft — a 6-foot-4, 238-pound receiver who ran a 4.42 at the NFL combine and scored 13 touchdowns last season for the Irish.</p>
<p>“We were excited that that player was available to us; not that position, that Chase Claypool the player was available to us,” general manager Kevin Colbert said. “He’s big, he’s strong, he’s fast, and when a player like that is available, it’s easy.”</p>
<p>The Steelers used their third-round compensatory pick (102nd) on Friday to take Alex Highsmith of Charlotte, a converted defensive end who has the body type (6-3, 248) the Steelers desire to move to outside linebacker. Highsmith, who began his career at Charlotte as a walk-on, is the first player from Ashley High School in Wilmington, N.C., to be drafted by an NFL team.</p>
<p>“We have three Heisman Trophy-winning quarterbacks in our division,” said coach Mike Tomlin, referring to Cleveland’s Baker Mayfield, Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson and the latest addition, Joe Burrow in Cincinnati. “We need players who can hunt those guys.”</p>
<p>Coupled with new tight end Eric Ebron (6-4, 253), Claypool will give Ben Roethlisberger a couple of big targets when he returns from elbow surgery in attempt to bolster an offense that scored only 10 touchdowns in the final 10 games in 2019. The Steelers were also the only team to not score at least 30 points in any game last season.</p>
<p>“The size is great, from a height standpoint, the wingspan, all that is wonderful if it’s used right and you learn how to use it at this next step,” offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner said. “In my heart I know Ben is working hard to get back, and when he has the ability to throw the ball down the yard and he feels good about the percentage of big plays, I know for a fact he’s going to be excited about having one more weapon.”</p>
<p>Curiously, Claypool said he did not know the Steelers were going to draft him because he hadn’t talked to Tomlin since the Senior Bowl in late January. It might be the first time the Steelers used their top pick on a player they did not interview in person at the combine or at their South Side facility — or, in this instance, on a video call because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“That was about it, that would have been my last chance [to talk to them],” Claypool said on a conference call after his selection. “I had a good talk with Coach Tomlin. But that’s how it goes.”</p>
<p>Claypool, 21, joins what is already a young corps of receivers that includes JuJu Smith-Schuster (23), James Washington (24) and Diontae Johnson (23). He said he watched a lot of tape of Calvin Johnson and Julio Jones, as well as Smith-Schuster, because they were big, physical receivers who were also very productive.</p>
<p>It is the first time since Santonio Holmes in 2006 the Steelers used their top pick in the draft on a wide receiver. And it’s the first time since 2012 (David DeCastro) they used their top pick on an offensive player.</p>
<p>“We really got up close to him at the Senior Bowl and the work he did on special teams really stood out in practices,” Colbert said. “Working the way he did, the special teams part of it, really showed the competitiveness this young man has to go along with his size speed and receiving ability.”</p>
<p>Unlike Claypool, Highsmith said he knew the Steelers were interested in him because they were one of just two teams with whom he interviewed with both the coach and general manager. And he is aware of the Steelers’ history of drafting college defensive ends and converting them into outside linebackers.</p>
<p>“I know coming into this scheme, that position, I feel I can play,” Highsmith said. “I had my hand in the dirt the past two years, but I’ve been working a lot on my drops, and I’m ready to step into that role.”</p>
<p>The Steelers were looking for an outside linebacker to backup Watt and Dupree after releasing Anthony Chickillo. Highsmith caught their eye at the East-West Shrine Game after a season in which he had 15 sacks, 21½ tackles for loss, three passes defenses and two forced fumble.</p>
<p>The Steelers have rotated their two starters more in 2019 because they asked them to rush the passer and play the run more than they had in the past. The Steelers wanted to improve their depth and find a backup who could play ahead of Ola Adeniyi.</p>
<p>“You could tell he was above where we thought he might have been,” Colbert said. “To end up putting up the stats he did this season, we don’t think this kid is anywhere near where he might be somewhere down the road.”</p>
<p>The second round did not get off to a good start for the Steelers because of the run on receivers.</p>
<p>The Bengals cut into the crop of available receivers when they selected Clemson wide receiver Tee Higgins to start the second round, giving No. 1 pick Burrow an additional deep threat to go with A.J. Green.</p>
<p>Then the Indianapolis Colts followed with the 34th selection by taking USC’s Michael Pittman, a 6-foot-4 wide receiver who had 101 receptions last season with the Trojans. Eight picks later, the Jacksonville Jaguars took Colorado’s Laviska Shenault Jr., a multi-dimensional receiver who had the diverse skills the Steelers coveted.</p>
<p>Penn State’s KJ Hamler became the fourth wide receiver to be selected in the second round when he went to the Denver Broncos with the 46th pick, three spots ahead of the Steelers. That meant 10 wide receivers had been selected before the Steelers had a chance to make a pick.</p>
<p>But it was a deep year for wide receivers, and the Steelers proved it by getting Claypool, a native of Abbotsford, British Columbia, who had 66 catches for 1,037 yards and 13 touchdowns last season at Notre Dame. They chose him even though Baylor receiver Denzel Mims and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/04/25/chase-claypool-steelers-nfl-draft-j-k-dobbins-ravens-afc-north/stories/202004250038" target="_blank">Ohio State running back J.K. Dobbins</a>, players who were considered possible first-round picks, were still available.</p>
<p>“His production was off the charts, and it’s been growing every season,” Fichtner said.</p>
<p>“A big part of that was confidence, being put in that situation, knowing you can make those plays,” Claypool said. “Once I acquired that confidence, I think that was pretty big.”</p>
<p>Barring a trade, the Steelers have four more draft picks — two in the fourth round (Nos. 124 and 135) and one each in the sixth and seventh rounds — when the draft concludes Saturday. It would be their fewest total picks since they had five in 2003.</p>
