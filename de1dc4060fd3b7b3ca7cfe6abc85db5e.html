<h1>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred answers key questions about baseball’s return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred appeared on CNN Thursday night and answered several key questions relevant to baseball’s potential return.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, Manfred expressed optimism toward the sport clearing health and money-related hurdles. Here are the most important things he said, as MLB and the MLB Players Association continue to discuss a plan the owners presented to the players on Monday.</p>
<p><strong>Manfred thinks there will be baseball this summer</strong></p>
<p>(The idea, for background, is roughly 82 games starting at the beginning of July, played at home stadiums. Spring training would start on or around June 10, and playoffs would be expanded from 10 to 14 teams. Fans would not be present, at least to start.)</p>
<p>“It’s hopeful that we will have some Major League Baseball this summer,” Manfred said. “We are making plans playing in empty stadiums, but as I said before, all of those plans are dependent on what the public health situation is and us reaching the conclusion that it will be safe for our players and other employees to come back to work.”</p>
<p><strong>He’s not worried about the contractual fight</strong></p>
<p>Owners presented the players with a financial deal that many in the latter group have ripped, including Rays pitcher Blake Snell during a Twitch appearance Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The proposal includes revenue sharing with a 50/50 split, which the players have called a non-starter, believing they’re agreeing to a salary cap. It also will force the players to take an additional pay cut or negotiate another agreement that’s more suitable to them.</p>
<p>The two sides seem extremely far apart, although Manfred believes they’ll find common ground.</p>
<p>“I think whenever there’s a public discussion about economics, people tend to characterize it as a fight,” Manfred said. “Me personally, I have great confidence that we’ll reach an agreement with the Players Association. Both that it’s safe to come back to work and we’ll work out the economic issues that need to be resolved.”</p>
<p><strong>There are extensive medical protocols</strong></p>
<p>Manfred said MLB will use the same Utah-based lab that performs its drug tests to administer PCR tests for COVID-19. Results will be back in 24 hours, and there will be multiple tests per week, Manfred said.</p>
<p>This was outlined in an 80-page presentation given to the players meant to assuage many of their medical concerns.</p>
<p>MLB will also perform regular temperature checks and symptom analysis daily.</p>
<p>“We have developed extensive protocols,” Manfred said. “A key to those is frequent testing. All of our players would be tested multiple times a week to determine whether or not they have the virus. That testing would be supplemented, less frequently, by antibody testing as well.”</p>
<p>The 80-page outline also included such things as how the players would travel, how chartered planes would be cleaned and how social distancing would be observed at ballparks, with acceptably small waves of people coming and going.</p>
<p>Manfred described the entire thing as “extraordinarily detailed.”</p>
<p>“We hope we’ll be able to convince them that it’s safe,” Manfred said. “At the end of the day, however, if there are players with either health conditions or just their own personal doubts, we would never force them or try to force them to come back to work. They can wait until they feel they’re ready to come.”</p>
<p><strong>What if someone tests positive?</strong></p>
<p>A key question, for sure. Maybe the biggest one.</p>
<p>“Our experts said that we don’t need a 14-day quarantine,” Manfred responded when asked that exact question. “The positive individual will be removed from the rest of the group. There will be a quarantine arrangement in each facility and in each city. Then we’ll do contact tracing for the individuals that we believe there was contact with, and we will do point-of-care testing for those individuals to minimize the likelihood that there’s been a spread.”</p>
<p>And if there’s a cluster of positive tests? What happens then?</p>
<p>“Nothing is risk-free in this undertaking,” Manfred said. “We’re trying to mitigate that risk with the repeated point-of-care testing to make sure that people who have had contact have not been exposed. And by removing those individuals that have a positive test, they will be quarantined until they have two negative tests over a 24-hour period.”</p>
<p><strong>The need for baseball is big</strong></p>
<p>Manfred described the economic effects of a missed season as “devastating,” claiming that owners’ losses could approach $4 billion.</p>
<p>He also talked about baseball wanting to be part of the American healing process, as we continue to battle COVID-19.</p>
<p>“Playing in empty stadiums is not a great deal for us economically,” Manfred said. “But our owners are committed to doing that because they feel it’s important that the game be back on the field and that the game be a sign of a beginning to return to normalcy for American life the way we’ve always enjoyed it.”</p>
