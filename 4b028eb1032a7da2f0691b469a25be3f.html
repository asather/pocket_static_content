<h1>Penguins sign 2017 draft pick William Reilly to entry-level deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins bolstered their organization’s defensive depth Wednesday by signing 2017 seventh-round pick William Reilly. The two-year, entry-level contract begins with the 2020-21 season and runs through 2021-22.</p>
<p>The Penguins initially selected Reilly with the 217th overall pick in the 2017 draft. At 6-foot-2 and 197 pounds, he has some size and an offensive dimension to his game.</p>
<p>Reilly, 22, played four seasons at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. During his senior season, the right-handed blue liner captained the Engineers. He was named a finalist for the Eastern College Athletic Conference’s best defensive defenseman award. Among ECAC defensemen, he ranked second in goals (eight) and fifth in points (22). He was also the team leader in plus/minus at plus-14.</p>
<p>Reilly would have become an unrestricted free agent had the Penguins not agreed to terms before Aug. 15.</p>
<p>“Will had an impressive year in 2019-20 after continuing to improve during his four years at RPI. His commitment to working hard and improving his conditioning has paid off,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “We are happy to add another young player, increasing our organizational depth on defense.”</p>
<p>Before RPI, the Toronto native was named Rookie of the Year for the Nanaimo Clippers of the British Columbia Hockey League, notching 32 points in 52 games.</p>
<p>The Penguins recently lost their top blue-line prospect, Calen Addison, in the trade that brought Jason Zucker to Pittsburgh. With Addison gone, some of the defensemen who are getting closer to the NHL are P.O. Joseph and Joseph Almari. The Penguins also addressed their blue-line prospect pool last month by signing college free agent Cam Lee out of Western Michigan.</p>
