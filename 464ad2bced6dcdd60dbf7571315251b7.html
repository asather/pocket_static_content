<h1>Steelers practice report: Observations as cutdown day nears</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said it’s a big week for young players vying for spots on the 53-man roster. And on Wednesday afternoon, two players in the mix for jobs continued to state their cases.</p>
<p><strong>James Pierre</strong>, a rookie undrafted free agent from Florida Atlantic, made a leaping interception of a Paxton Lynch pass. Pierre has been one of the few standouts among the undrafted free agent class.</p>
<p>Also making a case for a job on the 53-man roster is receiver <strong>Ray-Ray McCloud</strong>, who reeled in a deep ball over veteran cornerback <strong>Cam Sutton</strong>. McCloud also returns kickoffs, which could help him as the coaches and front office prepare to trim the roster from 80 to 53 by Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Pierre is competing for a job in a deep secondary, but the Steelers need to develop depth at corner with Sutton and <strong>Mike Hilton</strong> entering the final years of their contracts. If the Steelers don’t keep Pierre on the 53-man roster, he could develop on the practice squad if he clears waivers.</p>
<p>McCloud is competing for a job in a receiving corps that is loaded with veterans and rookie <strong>Chase Claypool</strong>. The Steelers have kept six receivers in the past, but the sixth receiver always played vital roles on the special teams. For years, <strong>Darrius Heyward-Bey</strong> was that player for the Steelers and last season it was Johnny Holton.</p>
<p>McCloud is making a case for the Steelers to continue that tradition.</p>
<p><strong>Okorafor lines up with the starters</strong></p>
<p><strong>Chuks Okorafor</strong> started at right tackle when the Steelers opened their first team period. He and <strong>Zach Banner</strong> continue to battle for the starting job.</p>
<p>Tomlin and offensive line coach Shaun Sarrett keep saying they’re in no hurry to name a starter, but time is ticking on the competition. Regular-season game prep will begin in earnest next week.</p>
<p><strong>Countdown is on...</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers will practice twice more at Heinz Field before moving their practices back to the South Side, but for all intents and purposes, this COVID-19 training camp is all but over.</p>
<p>The Steelers open the regular season against the Giants on Sept. 14, and on Wednesday afternoon Tomlin gave his players a look at what a normal Wednesday will be like during a game week.</p>
<p>The only thing that was different was a longer-than-usual emphasis on special teams. Without any preseason games, Tomlin said he took extra time Wednesday and will continue to take extra time in the next few practices to get his special teams the work they need.</p>
<p>“We felt like we need work getting the offense and defense off the field and getting the special teams onto the field,” Tomlin said. “That is a big component of preseason football. We’re paying respect to these unusual circumstances by getting work in that area. We’ll continue to do. We don’t want to get into stadiums and have issues when as we transition from group to group.”</p>
<p>Even though it was a typical regular-season Wednesday, Tomlin said they have not begun specific preparations for the Giants, who have a new head coach in Joe Judge and a new staff.</p>
<p>“We were still just focused on our things, things we could execute in all circumstances,” he said. “There are a lot of unknowns with the Giants. It’s the first game. There is no preseason. They’re a new staff. So the things we focus on in an environment like this better be things we can execute regardless of circumstance. It was more about us and our ability to perform.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury update</strong></p>
<p>Right guard <strong>David DeCastro</strong> was still missing from practice Wednesday. He left Friday’s scrimmage early with a lower-body injury. Also not participating on Wednesday was offensive lineman <strong>Stefen Wisniewski</strong>.</p>
<p>Other players that had been out of practice returned.</p>
<p>Defensive end <strong>Chris Wormley</strong> (shoulder) was a full participant, as was running back <strong>Anthony McFarland</strong>, who did not participate on Monday. Wormley had been a partial participant on Monday.Long-snapper <strong>Kameron Canaday</strong> was a partial participant as he works his way back from a knee injury.</p>
<p>Sutton did not finish practice and is being evaluated, Tomlin said.</p>
