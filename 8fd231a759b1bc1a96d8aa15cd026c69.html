<h1>North Allegheny becomes first WPIAL high school to add girls wrestling program</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Girls wrestling has come a long way since Waynesburg's Terri Harding became the first girl to wrestle in a WPIAL varsity match in 1986. Since then, girls participation in high school wrestling has steadily increased.</p>
<p>For the past five years, girls wrestling has been the fastest growing high school sport in the country, according to the National Federation of State High School Athletics.</p>
<p>The OPC (optimum performance calculator) weight management system used by the National Wrestling Coaches Association listed more than 23,000 young ladies participating on varsity high school teams across the country during the 2018-19 season and more than 27,000 during the 2019-20 season.</p>
<p>"Interest in girls wrestling has significantly increased over the past few years," North Allegheny assistant coach Dan Heckert said. "But their only option was to wrestle for boys teams. That's why I joined the SanctionPA movement."</p>
<p>Heckert was one of 15 individuals who formed the Pennsylvania Girls High School Wrestling Task Force.</p>
<p>"Our goal is to have 100 schools in Pennsylvania add a girls wrestling program at the high school level over the next three years. We organized a week before the PIAA tournament in March, so we've only been together for a short time, but have made significant progress."</p>
<p>The task force teamed up with the national organization aptly named "Wrestle Like a Girl".</p>
<p>"We put together a 24-page information packet to help schools that are considering adding a girls program," Heckert said.</p>
<p>The document — which <a href="https://wrestlelikeagirl.org/sanction-pa" target="_blank">can be found</a> on Wrestle Like A Girl’s website — includes data on girls wrestling, the benefits of adding a program, how they relate to existing boys teams, recruiting ideas, coaching resources and an outline of the sanctioning process, as well as an FAQ that that covers the most common questions from coaches, athletic directors and school administrators.</p>
<p>"We set our goal at 100 because that's the number of schools we need to be sanctioned by the PIAA," Heckert said. "There are 23 states that sanction girls wrestling and hold a state tournament."</p>
<p>In a three-month period, the task force has convinced four high schools to add a girls program. The first was Lancaster McCaskey, followed by Easton and Executive Academy. North Allegheny became the fourth, and first from the WPIAL, at a school board meeting held Wednesday night.</p>
<p>"It's great to be a part of the first girls program in the WPIAL," said Massimo Curry, who has been a member of North Allegheny's varsity squad the past two years. "We are paving the way for future wrestlers and teams in the WPIAL."</p>
<p>The task force is hoping to have at least 10 schools participating by the start of the 2020-21 season.</p>
<p>"There are quite a few schools that have shown interest in adding a girls program," Heckert said. "We're hoping to get another half dozen or so to commit before the season begins. And it wouldn't surprise me to have another WPIAL school or two."</p>
<p>Heckert's coaching duties will be split between the boys and girls program.</p>
<p>"I will be working with both programs," Heckert said. "We're expecting to have six-eight girls on this year's team. We will hold a separate practice on some days and practice with the boys on other days."</p>
<p>The girls can still participate in a boys match, but will also have competitions with other girls.</p>
<p>"The Powerade Tournament will have a girls division this year. The same is true for the Mid-Winter Mayhem Tournament at Indiana University," Heckert said. "We can also enter our girls in junior varsity boys tournaments."</p>
<p>Seventeen of the 80 high schools that sponsor a varsity wrestling team in the WPIAL had at least one girl on its roster during the 2019-20 season. A total of 25 girls appeared on WPIAL rosters, including 13 who wrestled in 10 or more bouts.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy of those entries was Greensburg Salem senior Riley Stoner, who had an 8-17 record while competing at 120 pounds. After the boys season, Stoner competed in the Pennsylvania Girls State Championships, which were held at Gettysburg High School and won her second state title.</p>
<p>"Pennsylvania USA Wrestling has held a girls state tournament since 2012, but its participation at the high school level was low until three years ago," Heckert said.</p>
<p>This year's tournament attracted 363 girls in five different age brackets, including 114 at the high school level.</p>
<p>Curry placed seventh at the state tournament in 2019, but missed this year's tournament with an elbow injury. She also attended USA Wrestling's Girls Freestyle Nationals in Fargo, N.D., in 2019.</p>
<p>"It was a lot of fun to wrestle at Fargo," said Curry, who posted a 2-2 record. "I had a chance to face some of the best girls in the country. There were as many as 35 girls in each weight class. I would have went back later this summer, but the tournament was cancelled due to the COVID virus."</p>
<p>Curry comes from a family of wrestlers.</p>
<p>"My mom and dad wrestled, along with my three brothers," said Curry, who recently completed her junior year. "And my younger sister Larke will be joining me on the girls team this year."</p>
<p>Curry would like to continue wrestling in college.</p>
<p>"I have talked with Lock Haven, Lincoln College in Illinois and Ferrum College in Virginia," Curry said. "I'm hoping to get a scholarship."</p>
<p>There are more than 70 colleges that have a women's wrestling team, including five in Pennsylvania: Gannon, Lock Haven, East Stroudsburg, Delaware Valley and Lackawanna Junior College.</p>
