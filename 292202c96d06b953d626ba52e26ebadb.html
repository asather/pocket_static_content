<h1>Pitt is anemic offensively, porous defensively in 72-52 loss to Clemson</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeff Capel turned 45 on Wednesday, officially putting a man who began his head-coaching career at 27 closer to his 50th birthday than his 40th and earning him a touching rendition of “Happy Birthday” from Pitt’s student section before the game.</p>
<p>What he got from his team that night wasn’t exactly a present.</p>
<p>Presented with an opportunity to win its fifth-consecutive home game, the first time that would have happened since the 2012-13 season, against a Clemson team it was favored to beat by 3.5 — making it one of the more winnable games left on the schedule of a team with postseason aspirations in mid-February&nbsp; — Pitt turned in what was very likely its worst performance of the season, one in which it was hard to find much of anything positive on either end of the court. The Panthers were anemic offensively, shooting just 31.3% from the field, and porous defensively, allowing 72 points on 65 possessions, in a 72-52 loss to the Tigers at Petersen Events Center.</p>

<p>Clemson entered the evening ranked 199th in offensive efficiency among 353 Division I teams (and 13th among 15 ACC squads). What has been, for much of the season, an impotent unit looked like something else entirely against the Panthers.</p>
<p>The Tigers made 13 of their 22 3-pointers (59.1%), including eight of their final 10. They had previously shot better than 33% from beyond the arc just once against an ACC opponent.</p>
<p>They came into the game ranked 19th in Division I in the percentage of field goal attempts this season that were 3s, making them a squad that, in a very true and real sense, lives by outside shooting and dies by it. In its previous three games, all of them losses, Clemson made only 19 of its 83 3s (22.9%). Against Pitt, it fared significantly better, using effective ball movement and regularly making its opponent look like it was perpetually a step or two behind, even in the rare instances in which it closed out on a shooter effectively.</p>
<p>With the win, the Tigers have defeated Pitt in seven consecutive meetings, with the Panthers’ last victory in the series coming in March 2014. It also dropped Capel to 3-9 all-time against Clemson coach Brad Brownell, whom he faced eight times when the two were at VCU and UNC Wilmington, respectively.</p>
<p>Freshman forward Justin Champagnie had a team-high 11 points and six rebounds, though those were down from the 17.2 points and 9.2 rebounds per game he had averaged in the team’s previous six games. Sophomore forward Au’Diese Toney also finished in double figures, with 10 points. Guard Ryan Murphy, who had missed the previous three games while recovering from a concussion, was scoreless in 16 minutes.</p>
<p>Pitt, as it has been wont to do many times this season, fell behind early, trailing by 10, 24-14, not even 12 minutes into the contest. What has been a languishing Clemson offense made five of its first nine 3s. Though the Panthers were able to get within two following a dunk from Terrell Brown, the Tigers stretched their advantage to eight, as their opponent went without a field goal and scored just one point in the final 4:51 of the period.</p>
<p>In the second half, it only got worse.</p>
<p>Clemson rattled off eight unanswered points, doubling its lead and turning what had been a manageable deficit for Pitt into some much more difficult to overcome. It was aided in that effort by the Panthers, who went the first 3:48 without a point, meaning that in a period of 8:39 from the end of the first half to the beginning of the second, they scored just a single point.</p>
<p>After a pair of Xavier Johnson free throws with seven minutes remaining, Pitt had gotten within six, 51-45, energizing the home crowd while providing a very grim snapshot of how the night had gone, especially given the quality of its opponent. Shortly after that, a Clemson offense that had gone five minutes without a point reawakened, going on an 11-2 run to go back up by double digits and end whatever potential for a comeback remained.</p>
<p>With the Tigers’ lead at 15 in the final two minutes, and following a missed 3 from Trey McGowens, isolated boos emerged from frustrated pockets of an ever-thinning home crowd. A night that had begun with hope and potential had ended with a thud.</p>
<p>The Panthers will look to regroup from their setback with a game Saturday at Virginia Tech, which has lost five consecutive games following a promising and surprising 14-5 start.</p>
