<h1>Blawnox intersection site of yet another violent encounters between train and truck</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After a train tore through the trailer of a tractor-trailer truck trying to make an illegal turn in Blawnox Tuesday morning, the reaction from locals who live and work near the crossing at Center Avenue and Fourth Street was unanimous:</p>
<p>Thank goodness no one was hurt, despite the truck’s trailer getting sliced into pieces, and the 47,000 pounds of steel rebar on the trailer flying through the air.</p>
<p>But they also agreed on a second reaction:</p>
<p>“I’m sick of these trucks getting stuck on these tracks,” said Mike Fanto Jr., who, with his father, runs Tower Auto Sales, a used car shop located right next to the intersection. “This is the third time in three weeks.”</p>
<p>It was not clear if the tractor-trailer that got hit Tuesday got stuck on the tracks as it headed to one of the many industrial sites or warehouses on the river-side of the railroad tracks in or near Blawnox.</p>
<p>But at least two other trucks in recent weeks have gotten stuck, with one freeing itself, and the other requiring a call to 911 to get trains to stop on the tracks while the stuck truck got assistance from a tow truck.</p>
<p>Neither of those two trucks were hit. But Blawnox fire Chief George McBriar said in his 30 years with the department he’s seen two or three similar accidents either at the same intersection, or one a little further west. And several times a year, at least, tractor trailers get stuck on the tracks trying to make turns that are too sharp for them to make, causing them to lodge their trailers on the raised railroad track crossing, requiring a tow and a call to 911 to stop the oncoming trains.</p>
<p>“It’s a problem,” Chief McBriar said while overseeing cleanup at the scene Tuesday. “The trucks are supposed to go down [Center Avenue, which crosses the railroad tracks] and turn right [on Third Street a block away] so they end up coming straight down here” along Fourth Street and not making the harder-angled turn off Center to Fourth.</p>
<p>“There’s a sign right there,” he said, pointing to a no left-turn sign that’s just over the tracks along Fourth Street. “And another down there” at Third Street.</p>
<p>The sign at Center and Third is even bigger and says clearly in red, capital letters: “ALL TRACTOR TRAILER TRUCKS RIGHT TURN ONLY — TRUCK ROUTE.”</p>
<p>Bunny Sproul, who lives in a home and runs a laundry service right next to the tracks across the street from Tower Auto Sales, says she knows from experience why so many tractor-trailers are getting stuck on the tracks.</p>
<p>“They’re busy watching their GPS [map systems] instead of reading the signs,” said Mrs. Sproul, who saw the collision coming and ran inside with her dog, Casey, just before it occurred to avoid injury. “And the GPS says ‘Turn left,’ so that’s what they do.”</p>
<p>Blawnox police Chief Patrick Goodman said the accident occurred around 11 a.m. Tuesday, when the truck driven by an unnamed driver drove down Center Avenue, crossed the tracks, attempting to head to Clark Precision Machine Components, which has a large campus of buildings along Fourth Street.</p>
<p>Chief McBriar said the driver came to stop on the river-side of the tracks, with the trailer and cab off the tracks, as he tried to figure out how to get to the Clark site.</p>
<p><strong><em>Here’s video supplied by eyewitness Justin McKay just seconds after the collision:</em></strong></p>
<p>Justin McKay, a wholesale salesman for Tower Auto Sales, saw the driver in his cab trying to figure out what to do for about five or 10 minutes, so he went over to try to help him.</p>
<p>“I saw he was going to try to make that turn” onto Fourth Street from Center Avenue,” said Mr. McKay, who also lives in the neighborhood and has seen the same scenario with annoying regularity over the years. “I tried to tell the guy multiple times to go around the block. But I don’t think he heard me.”</p>
<p>Mr. McKay then got a call and headed back into the auto sales building, and almost immediately heard an “explosion … like a firework going off in your ear.”</p>
<p>“I knew what it was,” he said.</p>
<p>He ran outside to see if the driver was OK and filmed a short video of the long train of tanker cars still rolling through the intersection.</p>
<p>The impact of the collision of the heavy train going about 35 mph split the tractor-trailer into three pieces, with the rear axle flying across the tracks, some flying 60 feet away into a nearby garage, and the rest staying attached to the front of the trailer and cab.</p>
<p>The 47,000 pounds of rebar also flew into the air, flying with enough force that it knocked Mr. Fanto’s Acura RDX SUV up in the air into the garage amidst a large pile of rubble.</p>
<p>“It was like the Scarecrow” from the Wizard of Oz movie, said Assistant Fire Chief John Simmons. “ ‘My arms are over there! And my legs are over there!’ ”</p>
<p>The impact also took out an electric transformer pole, splitting it in two, causing a power outage in the neighborhood that was mostly restored within hours.</p>
<p>The problem with the intersection is compounded because if a tractor-trailer does get stuck, and a train is coming, the train can’t see the crossing until it is only about 300 yards away because the crossing is on a fairly sharp bend in the tracks there, leaving little time for the train driver to stop in time just based on what he or she sees.</p>
<p>The driver of the Ranco Transportation truck out of Shawnee, Okla., said he did not want to comment and would not give his name.</p>
<p>Chief Goodman said he was hoping to view video of the accident from nearby businesses before deciding whether to cite the driver.</p>
<p>But he said based on this accident, he knows he has to take some action to try to avoid another accident like Tuesday’s.</p>
<p>“We’ll just have to put up even more signs,” he said.</p>

<p>A train struck a tractor-trailer as it was trying to get off the tracks Tuesday in Blawnox, according to KDKA-TV, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s news partner.</p>
<p>KDKA is reporting that the truck was trying to reverse across the tracks at Center Avenue near Fourth Avenue, but then went forward.</p>
<p>The train struck the rear end of the trailer, which then took down power lines.</p>
<p>KDKA said no one was hurt in the crash.</p>
