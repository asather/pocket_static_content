<h1>Former Pressley Ridge Orphan Gives Back to Organization</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Wilbur Emory McKiernan retired from his nearly 32 years as a postal worker in 1989, he decided that it was time to get his assets in order.</p>
<p>He and his wife Juanita had come to the decision that their estate would go to their son, and upon his death, anything left within the trust would go to an organization that had played a pivotal role in Mr. McKiernan’s life — Pressley Ridge.</p>
<p>In 1927, Mr. McKiernan and his younger brother Richard were surrendered to an orphanage on the North Side called The Pittsburgh and Allegheny Home for the Friendless. The brothers were there for two years before they were moved to the Kappa Sigma Pi Home in Clarksburg, W. Va.</p>
<p>These two orphanages, which merged together in 1969 to form part of what is now Pressley Ridge, were founded in 1832 and were the first and second agencies for children “abandoned, neglected and orphaned West of the Alleghenies,” according to Pressley Ridge’s website.</p>
<p>When Mr. McKiernan died in Dec. 2012, the 96-year-old’s estate was transferred to his son, Chuck, just as planned. Seven years later, in Dec. 2019, Chuck died at 66. That resulted in Pressley Ridge receiving an unrestricted gift of $800,000 from the McKiernans. Pressley Ridge announced the gift early this month.</p>
<p>“It was very humbling to call and tell [Pressley Ridge] that he had left this money for the fine work he thought they did,” said Dale Grambush, a longtime family friend and the McKiernans’ estate manager.</p>
<p>Susanne Cole, the president and CEO at Pressley Ridge, has worked there for about 30 years and said the gift is the second-largest donation she’s seen.</p>
<p>“We have come a long way in serving youth since 1927 when Wilbur first walked through the doors of the Home for the Friendless,” Ms. Cole said in a statement. “Through the generosity of donors like him, Pressley Ridge has been able to continue our mission of doing whatever it takes to create success for all children for nearly two centuries.”</p>
<p>Among other notable donations Pressley Ridge has received over the years, their website mentions a $100 gift from “a rising, young industrialist, who listed himself only as A. Carnegie.”</p>
<p>Pressley Ridge now has dozens of locations across Pennsylvania, Ohio, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Although Mr. McKiernan would hardly recognize the Pressley Ridge of today compared to his time at the orphanage, the institution still functions to serve families. No longer called orphanages, the homes serve children and families facing difficulties.</p>
<p>“We are here to provide support to families, to help keep them together and to work through whatever challenges may be in their life,” said Ms. Cole.</p>
<p>Their services include foster care and adoption, therapy counseling, specialized residential programs for children and more. The organization helps about 10,000 families each year work to create healthy, stable family relationships.</p>
<p>“When he was here, it was kind of ‘surrender your kids because you can no longer take care of them,’ ” Ms. Cole said. “What it has transformed into is, ‘how do we keep kids and families together?’ ”</p>
<p>Ms. Cole noted that Mr. McKiernan’s contribution to the organization would go to “help support kids and families,” and that this gift couldn’t have come at a better time.</p>
<p>“The people we work with already have some challenges in their life, and with COVID on top of that. Those dollars will really support us,” Ms. Cole said.</p>
<p>It was unsurprising to Mr. Grambush that his friend would want whatever was left of his assets to go back to the facilities where he spent the majority of his childhood.</p>
<p>“He was very well-disciplined and had a humble spirit,” he said.&nbsp;“Just a really good personality overall. He always seemed to want to support schooling for kids, because he was so limited.”</p>
<p>When Mr. McKiernan was between the ages of 12 and 16, he worked on a farm near the Kappa Sigma Pi Home, Mr. Grambush said. The farm work was so tiring that Mr. McKiernan often fell asleep during his classes.</p>
<p>After his time in the orphanages, Mr. McKiernan went on to fight in World War II as part of the U.S. Army Air Force. After the war, he spent a brief amount of time as a Pinkerton detective, and then began his career at the post office.</p>
<p>So how did the McKiernans amass their wealth?</p>
<p>Much is unclear, but Mr. Grambush said the family received money in a settlement when Mrs. McKiernan was injured in an accident.</p>
<p>“Wilbur and Juanita never lived like they had money; they were very frugal,” Mr. Grambush said.</p>
<p>He said Mr. McKiernan also invested in various utility companies throughout his life.</p>
<p>Mr. McKiernan was born in Wilkinsburg, but later moved to New Brighton, Minn.</p>
<p>Mr. Grambush, who knew the McKiernan family for over 40 years, had no explanation for the move.</p>
<p>“I haven’t been able to find a definitive answer,” Mr. Grambush said. “Though it’s quite possibly through his work with the Salvation Army.”</p>
<p>When Mr. McKiernan died, he had been a volunteer with the Salvation Army for 78 years, specifically at the Salvation Army Lakewood Corps.&nbsp;He frequently helped with summer day camps and vacation Bible school and taught Sunday school at The Salvation Army Lakewood Worship and Service Center in St. Paul, Minn.</p>
<p>Now, nearly a hundred years after Mr. McKiernan first stepped onto Pressley Ridge property, his legacy and gift will be honored with a bench at both of the facilities he had lived in as a child.</p>
