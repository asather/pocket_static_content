<h1>Wolf signs bill reforming work license requirements for rehabilitated criminals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Skilled workers with criminal records in the commonwealth will now have a second chance to move forward in their lives thanks to a newly-approved bipartisan Senate bill signed by Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 637 removes what Mr. Wolf’s administration is calling “outdated licensing barriers” that have proven to restrict skilled workers with criminal records from obtaining necessary professional licenses.</p>
<p>According to the governor’s administration, one in five Pennsylvanians – over a million workers – requires an occupational license from a board or commission to do their job.</p>
<p>Various occupations, including those in the fields of cosmetology, hairdressing, landscape architecture, social work, and vehicle manufacturing, dealing and sales and more all require professional licenses.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvania must be a place where hardworking people can put their skills to work,” Mr. Wolf said. “Arbitrarily denying someone a job license because of outdated rules against criminal records is wrong. This new bipartisan law is a commonsense way to allow people to pursue the American dream and build a better life in Pennsylvania. It’s good for skilled workers, their employers and the economy for all of us.”</p>
<p>The bill lists a number of changes for the 29 occupational licensing boards in the state.</p>
<p>Boards and commissions will no longer be able to use a person’s criminal history to deny that person a license, provided their criminal history is not directly related to the job in which they are seeking a license.</p>
<p>Boards will also be tasked with individually considering applications based on the offense, the amount of time since the conviction, the applicant’s personal progress and training, and other factors before withholding a license.</p>
<p>Those boards will be required to create a public list of criminal offenses that may prevent licensure. In addition, individuals will be allowed to obtain a preliminary decision if their conviction is likely to disqualify them from obtaining a license, saving time and money in the process. However, individuals are still welcome to apply and present evidence to support their case for a license.</p>
<p>Temporary licenses for barbering and cosmetology will also be made available for those that trained in a correctional facility, allowing them to work once they reenter society. Applications for such licenses on the outside are often denied for reformed criminals, but the temporary licenses can work for one to two years.</p>
<p>Secretary of Pardons Brandon J. Flood, an advocate for reform in the justice system, applauded the adoption of the new law, which he said will help those that have been rehabilitated rejoin society. Flood is uniquely familiar with the challenges of reentering the world after incarceration, as he spent the better part of a decade in prison on drug and firearm charges. While serving a sentence in Chester County, Flood enrolled in college classes, and upon release, he eventually secured a job in the state legislature that led to his current position, which he took on just last year.</p>
<p>“Today’s signing of this legislation serves as a hand-up and not a hand-out to many justice-involved Pennsylvanians who have made mistakes, learned from them, and are actively seeking to improve their lives for the better,” Flood said . “I would like to thank the Governor, the Pennsylvania General Assembly and Senators DiSanto and Schwank for their leadership on this critically important issue.”</p>
<p>Though the Senate bill does encourage reentry to society for reformed criminals, certain cases are excluded. Boards cannot issue licenses to someone convicted of a sexual offense to practice health care.</p>
<p>As it stands, boards cannot take juvenile convictions or convictions expunged under the Clean Slate law when determining eligibility for a license.</p>
<p>The Department of State and Pennsylvania’s licensing boards will develop a guide to help those with criminal convictions apply for a license.</p>
<p>“The Pennsylvania Department of State has been a vocal advocate for professional licensing standards that protect the health and safety of Pennsylvanians and are free of unnecessary or unclear requirements,” Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said. “We believe this new law is a step forward toward that goal. We applaud the legislature and Governor Wolf for making this much-needed reform in the commonwealth’s licensing laws.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf’s office has advocated for changes to the licensing process for years. In 2017, an executive order signed by the governor called for a review of job licensing with a comparison to other states. In 2018, a task force appointed by Mr. Wolf released a report that offered proposals “to cut red tape and modernize job licensing,” including removing “outdated criminal record restrictions.”</p>
<p>Two years ago, Mr. Wolf signed off on the Clean Slate law, allowing individuals to petition the courts for their records to be sealed if a person has been free from conviction for 10 years for an offense that resulted in a year or more of prison time, provided that person has paid all court-ordered financial debts.</p>
<p>In 2017, Mr. Wolf’s administration “banned the box,” removing questions about criminal histories from state employment applications. The move was intended to provide applicants with criminal histories a fair chance at consideration for a position based on their skills and qualifications, without immediately excluding them based on their histories. Exceptions were provided in cases where a criminal’s history could interfere with their ability to perform their job.</p>
