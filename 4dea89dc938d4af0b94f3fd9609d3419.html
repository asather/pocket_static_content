<p>HARRISBURG — Saying the effects of Gov. Tom Wolf’s shutdown orders over the past 180 days have been disastrous for Pennsylvania businesses and families, House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff announced on Wednesday he will attempt a legislative maneuver that seeks to end the COVID-19 disaster declaration that the governor renewed on Tuesday for another 90 days.</p>
<p>“We need a change,” said Mr. Benninghoff, R-Centre County. “We are asking all our members to join us on this anniversary of the 180 days of this shutdown to override the governor’s order and open Pennsylvania in an orderly fashion, keeping Pennsylvania safe and Pennsylvanians employed and most of all allowing them to earn a paycheck to take care of their families.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Mr. Benninghoff made this announcement at a news conference in the Rotunda of the Ryan Office Building at the Capitol Complex where he was joined by about three dozen of his House Republican colleagues.</p>
<p>Accomplishing that goal will require the support of 25 Democratic members and the entire House Republican Caucus to override Mr. Wolf’s July 14 veto of House Resolution 836, which would allow the Legislature to force the governor to end a disaster declaration. Only 12 Democrats voted for that resolution when the House voted in June to send it to the governor.</p>
<p>Mr. Benninghoff said the consequences of the governor’s restrictions on restaurants and bars, and those placed on other businesses that the disaster declaration allow him to impose, are not a partisan issue.</p>
<p>“I think there’s a bipartisan concern about the sluggish economy,” he said. Mr. Benninghoff noted Democrats have supported some of the Republicans’ past efforts to pass legislation that would reverse some of the governor’s orders related to his COVID-19 mitigation efforts. Mr. Wolf vetoed many of those bills.</p>
<p>House Democratic spokesman Bill Patton called the Republicans’ plans to attempt an override grandstanding.</p>
<p>“It’s all too predictable and sad,” Mr. Patton said. “Time and again House Republicans have tried to end the emergency prematurely, a mistake that would undo months of sacrifice and hard-won progress by Pennsylvanians and leave us unready for any resurgence. If we become the only state without such a declaration in place, our schools, hospitals, nursing homes, fire companies and local governments risk losing millions of dollars in federal funding.”</p>
<p>Mr. Patton added: “Rather than join House Republicans in looking backward 180 days, Democrats will instead look forward 89 days to Nov. 30 and the end of the current Republican majority.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf issued his first disaster declaration in March and has twice renewed it. The governor has said he has been following the advice of public health experts in ordering the temporary closure of businesses statewide and limiting capacities of restaurants, bars, salons, and entertainment venues to slow the spread of the virus and keep hospitals from becoming overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Other lawmakers in attendance at the news conference said Pennsylvania has seen a flattening of the curve of COVID-19 cases and lower hospitalization rates, leading them to believe it is time to end the disaster declaration.</p>
