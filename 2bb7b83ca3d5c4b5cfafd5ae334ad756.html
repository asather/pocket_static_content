<h1>Israeli man seeks release from jail because of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Israeli man who pleaded guilty in December to sexually assaulting a teenage girl in 2004 — and then fled the country only to be extradited 15 years later — is asking the state Superior Court to release him from the Allegheny County Jail because he is at higher risk to contract COVID-19.</p>
<p>Moshe Journo, 54, pleaded guilty on Dec. 9 to aggravated indecent assault, sexual assault, statutory sexual assault and indecent assault. The charges stem from allegations that he raped a 15-year-old girl at a Dormont tanning salon on Sept. 6, 2004.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>After his initial arrest, Journo was released from custody on a $25,000 bond and fled back to Israel. In December 2017, he was detained by Israeli authorities and finally returned to Pittsburgh in 2019.</p>
<p>On March 12 — four days before his original sentencing date — Journo filed a motion to withdraw his plea. His new attorney, Joesph E. Hudak, wrote in the motion that his client has maintained his innocence since the initial charges.</p>
<p>“The defendant is absolutely, positively, 100% not guilty,” Mr. Hudak wrote three separate times in his motion.</p>
<p>He alleged in the petition to withdraw the plea that Journo’s previous attorney only visited him a limited number of times at the jail and failed to properly develop his defense.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County District Attorney’s office objected to the motion to withdraw the plea, which has not yet been ruled upon since the courts have been closed since March 16 because of the pandemic.</p>
<p>On April 2, Mr. Hudak also filed a petition to modify his client’s bail with Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Bruce Beemer, noting that his client was willing to go on house arrest and that his sister would guarantee a $1 million appearance bond, using her Mt. Lebanon home as security.</p>
<p>Judge Beemer denied the motion.</p>
<p>On April 10, Mr. Hudak filed a petition with the state Superior Court seeking his client’s release.</p>
<p>In his petition, the attorney wrote: “The current conditions at the Allegheny County Jail create an extreme risk for rapid, exponential spread of COVID-19 throughout the facility with grave outcomes for both the incarcerated population and the surrounding communities.”</p>
<p>Journo, Mr. Hudak wrote, has asthma, diabetes and high blood pressure, putting him at high risk for contracting the virus.</p>
<p>In its response to the Superior Court, filed Tuesday afternoon, the prosecution urged the court to deny Journo’s release, arguing that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk.</p>
<p>“Contrary to petitioner’s assertion, he does not stand before this court as an innocent man,” the prosecution wrote. “He pled guilty to all offenses.”</p>
<p>The filing quotes from the plea hearing in which Journo admitted he was guilty — agreeing that he had committed each of the crimes.</p>
<p>“If appellant comes to this court brazenly asserting his 100% innocence, in the same breath, he is acknowledging his perjury to the trial court,” wrote Deputy District Attorney Mike Streily.</p>
<p>In the filing, he argued that Journo was trying to manipulate the system by refusing to honor judicial process.</p>
<p>“He has no respect for an oath and has shown no desire or willingness to be punished for his criminal actions.”</p>
<p>Also responding to Mr. Hudak, Judge Beemer on Tuesday issued a four-page ruling, explaining why he denied Journo’s bail request.</p>
<p>“Appellant stands before the trial court as a convicted defendant awaiting sentencing on felony sexual assault charges, having demonstrated that he is a flight risk, and with a detainer lodged by the Department of Homeland Security,” Judge Beemer wrote. “The suggestion by appellant that he would surrender his passport as a condition of bond is not persuasive and provides the court with no assurances based on his past conduct.</p>
<p>“As appellant was willing to sacrifice the monetary bail put in place in 2004, as well as abandon his children and business, the court does not believe that monetary bail alone is sufficient.”</p>
<p>Judge Beemer concluded that, while he recognizes the health concerns raised by COVID-19 and the need to reduce the jail population, there are no conditions of release that would ensure the defendant’s appearance in court.</p>
