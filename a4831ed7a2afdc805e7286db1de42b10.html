<h1>Anthrocon 2020, Pittsburgh’s Furry convention, canceled due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of Pittsburgh’s quirkiest annual events has been forced to skip its 2020 iteration due to the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>Anthrocon, an annual “Furry” convention the Steel City has been hosting since 2006, was supposed to be held July 2-5 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center. That will no longer be the case, as Anthrocon 2020 has been officially canceled because of the uncertainty surrounding this global pandemic.</p>
<p>“Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, for which there is no timely end in sight, we have been forced to make the sad decision to cancel Anthrocon 2020,” a message on the <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/" target="_blank">convention’s official site</a> reads. “We had hoped to avoid it, but it has become clear that we will not be able to provide a convention experience that is both safe and enjoyable for our attendees.”</p>

<p>It had become a tradition every summer for Downtown Pittsburgh to be flooded with “Furries,” or folks who create animal “fursonas” complete with elaborate costumes and backstories. Here is a more complete <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2017/06/27/Unleash-Furries-Anthrocon-convention-weekend-Pittsburgh/stories/201706270133" target="_blank">Post-Gazette primer</a> on Anthrocon and the Furry community for those unfamiliar with this particular group.</p>
<p>Not only does Anthrocon usually provide a yearly boon for businesses near the convention center, but it also usually donates a portion of its profits to a local charity or organization. For example, Anthrocon 2016 raised $32,579 for The Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium.</p>
<p>Folks who booked hotel rooms via VisitPittsburgh will have their reservations canceled in the next 24-48 hours and anyone who has already been charged a one-night deposit will have that amount refunded as soon as possible, according to Anthrocon’s website.</p>
<p>The site also indicated that anyone who used a deferral from 2019 to purchase 2020 Anthrocon tickets will have that deferral automatically carry over to 2021 and cannot request a refund. It also clarified that tickets to the “Fursuit Friendly Cruise” will be automatically refunded.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://www.anthrocon.org/covid19-cancellation" target="_blank">more information on next steps</a> for Furries and vendors who were planning to attend Anthrocon 2020 available through the event’s website, which currently only contains that “important, sad announcement” and instructions for disappointed conventiongoers.</p>
