<p>The Penguins announced Friday that they had tacked another season onto the contract of Chad Ruhwedel, signing the defenseman through 2021-22.</p>
<p>The final year of that deal will have an annual average value of $750,000.</p>
<p>Ruhwedel played 41 games for the Penguins last season despite being the eighth or ninth defenseman on their depth chart coming out of training camp. The righty had two goals, four assists and a plus-4 rating while arguably outperforming Justin Schultz. However, Ruhwedel did not suit up in the playoffs.</p>
<p>With Schultz expected to leave via free agency and more changes expected after another early playoff exit for the Penguins, Ruhwedel could get a chance to earn a regular role next season. If not, he will still come in handy as a reserve.</p>
<p>The depth defenseman has played 137 games in four seasons in Pittsburgh. He also skated in six playoff games during the 2016-17 Stanley Cup run.</p>
<p>“Chad is a reliable, depth defenseman who is a great teammate,” GM Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “He keeps himself in great shape and is always game-ready, which is important for a player in his role and the success of our team.”</p>
<p>Ruhwedel, a 30-year-old from San Diego, was slated to become a free agent last summer, but the Penguins brought him back with a two-year deal that had an AAV of $700,000. So he will actually receive a slight raise in 2021-22.</p>
