<h1>Paul Zeise: Pirates feel like a team in rebuild mode, and that’s OK</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Some negative and eternally critical Pirates fans out there insist the new management team has done nothing this offseason. They couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>I mean, what other team can claim they signed Guillermo Heredia, Luke Maile and John Ryan Murphy this offseason? How did the Pirates manage to pull that off?</p>
<p>OK, I’m joking; they did sign those guys, but that is still the equivalent of nothing. I think the great Bob Smizik probably said it best on Twitter when he called it “dumpster diving.” And make no mistake: These weren’t moves made with the idea of improving the club in mind. These are three bodies who, combined, are hitting somewhere below .600, but they have shown some level of major league competence, so they fill a role as well as a hole.</p>
<p>Ben Cherrington seems like a very smart executive and baseball man. He arrived and quickly got started trying to assess what the Pirates have in their organization. I’m going to assume he came to the right conclusion quickly that a full rebuild is probably the way to go.</p>
<p>The thing is, I’m OK with this approach, and I think most Pirates fans should be too. I’d much rather the message be “We are tearing down and rebuilding” than anything else. It is a much better approach than signing reclamation projects and cheap veterans to be able convince people that you’re trying to be competitive.</p>
<p>This roster, as it stands, isn’t good enough. The pitching staff is loaded with younger pitchers who all have been terribly overrated by the last management team. The first baseman can’t field the position, the third baseman doesn’t hit homers and isn’t a good fielder and the right fielder who can’t throw, runs bases terribly and is an inconsistent hitter.</p>
<p>Plus, the organization lacks depth. The roster needs to be rebuilt, and there needs to be a specific focus on finding young hitters with power. The Pirates have a few nice pieces to build around but not nearly enough.</p>
<p>There are no shortcuts and no quick fixes for small market teams. The only way a small market team can win is if it is built correctly from the ground up. The Pirates can’t sign a Bryce Harper or a Gerrit Cole off the free agent market, but they can draft and/or develop them as prospects and build around them when they are young and under team control.</p>
<p>The 2020 season should be&nbsp;about shedding older players and turning them into prospects. It should be about getting experience for the youngest and brightest players in the organization. It should be about rebuilding the talent base and re-examining the way the organization scouts for the draft.</p>
<p>This will be an ugly year and it could bring back memories of some of the lowest times in Pirates history. This could be a 60-win season, and I think fans will buy it as long as there is a tangible plan for the future in place.</p>
<p>That’s why I’m not like most people who are ridiculing the Pirates for signing players whose career batting average is below the Mendoza line. It doesn’t matter. If anything, it tells me they aren’t fooling themselves and everyone else into thinking they are trying to be contenders.</p>
