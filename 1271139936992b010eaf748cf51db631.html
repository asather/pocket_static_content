<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mars High School girls soccer team won a PIAA championship this past season, and one of the Planets has been named the top player in the state.</p>
<p>Ellie Coffield, a junior midfielder, has been selected the Gatorade Pennsylvania Player of the Year. Although soccer in Pennsylvania is played in the fall, Gatorade waits until the spring to name a player of the year for each state.</p>
<p>Coffield was one of the main reasons Mars won WPIAL and PIAA Class 3A championships. She scored 31 goals and had 30 assists for an unbeaten team. Mars finished 22-0-1 and gave up only 10 goals all season. Coffield was also named to the Post-Gazette 10-player All-Area team.&nbsp;She was part of a potent one-two punch for the Planets. Taylor Hamlett scored 43 goals and was named the Post-Gazette Player of the Year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Coffield has 71 career goals and 65 assists. She has a grade-point average above 4.0 and already has made a verbal commitment to Pitt.</p>
<p>Coffield’s selection means Western Pa. swept both the boys and girls Gatorade awards this year.
