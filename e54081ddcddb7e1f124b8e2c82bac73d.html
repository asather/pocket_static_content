<h1>Mars' Michael Carmody and Laurel Highlands' Rodney Gallagher earn all-state recognition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mars’ Michael Carmody and Laurel Highlands’ Rodney Gallagher went head-to-head in a thrilling WPIAL Class 5A championship game.</p>
<p>Carmody and Gallagher now find themselves on the same team.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State Team for Class 5A was released Friday, and Carmody and Gallagher were both named to the first team. They were the only players from the WPIAL picked to any of the three teams.</p>
<p>Carmody, a 6-foot-7, 290-pound senior forward, is a rare bird in that he was also a first-team all-state pick in football his senior season. No other athlete in the state was a first-team selection in both sports. Carmody will play football at Notre Dame.</p>
<p>Gallagher, a 6-foot guard, is pretty rare himself. He’s one of only three freshmen in the state named all-state and one of just two picked to the first team. Gallagher is a big two-sport star, as his list of scholarship offers in basketball includes Pitt and Illinois, and his offer list in football includes Pitt and Penn State.</p>
<p>In the WPIAL championship game, Gallagher made two free throws with 4.8 seconds left to lift Laurel Highlands to a 52-51 win against Mars. It was the first WPIAL title for Laurel Highlands since 1968.</p>
<p>It’s the second all-state selection for Carmody, who made the second team as a junior. This season, Carmody averaged 19 points and 19.5 rebounds per game. He shot 64% from the field and 71% from the free throw line. Carmody, who started in three straight WPIAL championship games, finished his career with 1,182 points and 1,156 rebounds. His senior year, he became the first athlete since New Castle’s Malik Hooker in 2013-14 to make Fabulous 22 in football and Fabulous 5 in basketball.</p>
<p>Speaking of the Fab 5, Gallagher was the first freshman selected since the Post-Gazette began picking the team 40 years ago. Gallagher, a heralded freshman coming into the season, lived up to the hype by averaging 22.7 points, 3.8 assists and 3.8 rebounds a game. He shot 44% from the field and 78% from the free throw line.</p>
<p>Malvern Prep senior guard Deuce Turner was named player of the year and&nbsp;Muhlenberg’s Tyrone Nesby coach of the year.</p>
