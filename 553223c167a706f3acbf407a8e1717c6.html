<h1>COVID-19 case reported at Peters Township High School</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An individual at the Peters Township High School has tested positive for COVID-19 a few days after school started on Aug. 24.</p>
<p>The district is offering in-person instruction five-days-a-week at school. Students could also opt for an online cyber program.</p>
<p>“On August 26, the Peters Township School District was notified that an individual at Peters Township High School has tested positive for COVID-19,” stated an Aug. 26 letter.</p>
<p>The individual will not return to school until they have completed isolation procedures for the virus, and the impacted areas of the school building were thoroughly cleaned and sanitized.</p>
<p>According to the district’s letter, initial contract tracing conducted by school district and Department of Health personnel indicated no close contacts with this individual. Close contact is defined as any individual within six feet of an infected person for at least 15 minutes.</p>
<p>If there is a second confirmed case at the high school prior to Sept. 8, the school would have to close for five to seven days per Health Department guidance. If that happens, students would attend class remotely for that time period.</p>
