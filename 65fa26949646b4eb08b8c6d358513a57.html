<h1>Beechview Spray Park ready to reopen pending final inspection</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If all goes well, Beechview residents will get a little relief from the warm weather Thursday.</p>
<p>The Beechview Spray Park, normally open by this time of year, has been closed since last Thursday while crews repaired the main water feed line to the park, according to Sue Lucas, a spokeswoman for Citiparks. Ms. Lucas said the pipe has been repaired and the pad will reopen Thursday, pending a final inspection from workers in the morning.</p>
<p>Work crews had to make an earlier repair on a faulty spray nozzle sensor before the splash pad opened last Wednesday. The main pipe went down Thursday and the splash pad has been out of commission since.</p>
<p>“We should be back in business pretty soon,” said Ms. Lucas. “That said, anything can happen when the water turns on.” She said she expects a call from work crews at 11 a.m. to confirm the repairs.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping for a good, happy call for all the kids,” she said.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service’s office in Pittsburgh is forecasting sunny weather Thursday with a high of 82 degrees.</p>
