<h1>As mitigation efforts expand, county's bar, restaurant owners and workers feeling singled out</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dozens of local bar and restaurant owners and workers assembled in Downtown on Thursday to protest the recent alcohol ban in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>The ban, which went into effect on Tuesday evening, prohibits bars and restaurants that sell alcohol from allowing consumption on their premises. Not long after the protest ended, however, the county on Thursday said it also was expanding its mitigation efforts and was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">forcing a one-week closure of all bars, restaurants, casinos</a> and venues that host more than 25 people at a time.</p>
<p>Prior to the county’s latest move, many local establishments have already been stung by the loss of sales that have resulted from various mitigation efforts to get the COVID-19 pandemic under control.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of our sales come from alcohol, so if things continue the way they are and people aren’t allowed to come in to drink, I see us closing down again in the next week or two,” said Brent Kightlinger, the assistant general manager at Redbeard’s on Sixth Avenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Kightlinger said that when Redbeard’s opened its doors in June — after several months of closure due to COVID-19 —&nbsp;the staff followed state guidelines to create a safe environment for patrons. But because the ban affects all businesses that sell alcohol in Allegheny County, he, and many other service industry workers, feel they’re being unjustly punished.</p>
<p>That sentiment was echoed by others at the protest, including Justin Vernet, a DJ at the Spearmint Rhino Gentlemen's Club in Chateau.</p>
<p>“We put forward a lot of effort to keep people safe, and I definitely feel we’re being punished for it.” Mr. Vernet said. “The state created all of these rules and guidelines for businesses when we first opened up, but rather than enforce them, they’ve decided to take the easy way out.”</p>
<p>Mr. Vernet and Mr. Kightlinger were joined by about 40 to 50 other service industry workers, most in masks, outside the City-County Building on Grant Street to protest the countywide measure.</p>
<p>During the protest, which remained peaceful, many held signs like “Let us serve!,” while others attempted to coax passing traffic into honking their horns in support.</p>
<p>The event’s main organizer, John Pavlik, was unable to attend. On Tuesday, Mr. Pavlik, who owns Xtra Innings Sports Bar and Grille in West Deer, said one of his employees had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>Mr. Pavlik’s absence meant that the people gathered to protest were left without an event leader and thus without speeches or clear instructions of how the protest would be managed.</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Pavlik’s absence, Mr. Kightlinger said the protest continued because people in the service industry felt that their voices needed to be heard.</p>
<p>“I’m sure there were other bars that didn’t follow state guidelines or attempt to keep people safe and they absolutely should’ve been targeted.” Mr. Kightlinger said. “But to make such a blanket ban that also affects those of us that did what we were supposed to do is just plain unfair.”</p>
