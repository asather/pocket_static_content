<h1>Steelers sign four more to offseason roster</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers signed four more free agents to their 90-man offseason roster on Thursday. Defensive backs Breon Borders and Arrion Springs and offensive linemen Anthony Coyle and John Keenoy were added a week before the draft.</p>
<p>Borders has the most experience of the quartet. He has been on active rosters or practice squads with the Raiders, Bill, Texans, Jaguars and Redskins since entering the league as an undrafted free agent in 2017. He has dressed for 13 NFL games and was waived by the Redskins last month.</p>
<p>Coyle played for the New York Guardians in the XFL earlier this spring and also spent time with the Texans, Packers and Falcons after being undrafted in 2018.</p>
<p>Keenoy also played in the XFL with the Dallas Renegades and was in camp with the Vikings last year. Springs also played in the XFL and spent time with the Chiefs, Browns, Saints, Raiders and Chargers after being undrafted out of Oregon in 2018.</p>
