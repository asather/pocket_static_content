<p><strong>“Dancing With the Stars”</strong>: After 28 sequin-studded and spray-tanned seasons, the popular ballroom competition gets a makeover. So extend a warm welcome to new host Tyra Banks and rookie judge Derek Hough. The latter brings an impressive resume that features six mirrorball trophies. Of course, the cast is filled with fresh faces, as well. They include animal activist Carole Baskin, who gained fame in the wild and crazy documentary series “Tiger King,” and Kaitlyn Bristowe, best known for “The Bachelorette.” Other notables are Backstreet Boys singer AJ McLean, rapper Nelly, actress Anne Heche and former Olympic figure skater Johnny Weir. (8 p.m. Monday, ABC).</p>

<p>Monday:&nbsp;Directed by Luca Guadagnino ("Call Me by Your Name"), “We Are Who We Are” is a coming-of-age drama series set on a U.S. military base in the sleepy seaside town of Chioggia, Italy.

<p>Wednesday: Keith Urban hosts the 55th Academy of Country Music Awards.

<p>Friday: Prolific producer Ryan Murphy ("American Horror Story") wants to freak you out again.

(Netflix).</p>
