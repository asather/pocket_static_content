<h1>Pittsburgh singer-songwriter releases love song on what would have been her wedding date</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Brooke Annibale was looking forward to June 26, 2020 as her wedding date.</p>
<p>In lieu of that, she’s dropping a single.</p>
<p>With her nuptials postponed due to the pandemic, the Pittsburgh singer-songwriter is marking the date by releasing the single and video for “Home Again,” mixed by Grammy winner Peter Katis (The National, Death Cab for Cutie, The Lone Bellow, Sharon Van Etten).</p>
<p>A lovely, soaring pop ballad in the vein of Sarah McLachlan, the song itself is like a proposal, Annibale reaching out to her partner, singing “If you want to make a home again / so do I.”</p>

<p>“I wrote this song at the beginning of a relationship: a song about falling in love, figuring out how to communicate our love for one another, and ultimately build a life and home together,” Annibale said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Over a year after I wrote it, I proposed to my girlfriend (she said yes), and we set our wedding date for June 26, 2020. For the past several months, I have looked forward to this day, a special day of celebration, and a day that for much of my life I didn’t think would even be legally possible. Sadly, like everything in 2020, the wedding had to be postponed. But this specific day still weighs heavily in my mind, so to honor it, I decided to release this song today. A love song to my future wife, an expression of love and gratitude for how we did indeed make a beautiful home together and we will indeed be able to get married surrounded by the people that we love…just not today.”</p>
<p>“Home Again” will appear on the followup to 2018’s “Hold on to the Light,” expected to be released next year.</p>
