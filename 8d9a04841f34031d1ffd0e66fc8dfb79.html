<h1>Pittsburgh band Code Orange Is about to get a lot more explosive</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The latest video from Code Orange, for “Swallowing the Rabbit Whole,” takes us into creepy, futuristic realm, opening with scratchy electronic sounds and a burning man who ends up on a gurney encased in plastic.</p>
<p>It takes more than a minute for the beat to kick in, and then 30 seconds later, the singer steps to the mc.</p>
<p>The singer steps to the mic… Wait. Since when does that happen?</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 9pt;"><strong>With:</strong> Every Time I Die, Zao, Jesus Piece, Machine Girl, Facewreck.</span></p>
<p><strong>Where:</strong> Roxian, McKees Rocks.</p>
<p><strong>When:</strong> 6 p.m. Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Tickets:</strong> $28; roxianlive.com.</p>
<p>Meet the 2020 Code Orange, which has a formidable frontman in Jami Morgan, the burned man, who, for the past 11 years, did his monster vocals while clobbering the drums. Now, he’s on the frontline of the Pittsburgh band — where the action and danger is — with bass beast Joe Goldman and headbanging guitarist Reba Meyers.</p>

<p>It’s going to make Code Orange, already one of the most explosive bands on the planet, even more of a wrecking crew.</p>
<p>The roll-out sets the stage for “Underneath,” the follow-up to the Pittsburgh band’s 2017 Grammy-nominated third album, “Forever,” which elevated the band (which also includes guitarist/keyboardist/programmer Eric “Shade Balderose and guitarist Dominic Landolina) to a new level on the world stage.</p>
<p>Code Orange, which formed at Pittsburgh CAPA in 2008 as Code Orange Kids, hits fans hard once again with a 14-song onslaught (recorded in Nashville with Nick Raskulinecz and Will Yip) that flashes the full range from the sheer chaos of the harsh metalcore to the soothing relief Meyers offers as a sidekick.</p>
<p>It’s a whiplash combination that sets Code Orange apart from the bands it contends with at metal festivals across North America and Europe.</p>
<p>Morgan, just back from Nashville where the band was rehearsing the new production — “We needed one of those sound stages to try some things we’ve never done before,” he says — talked about “Underneath,” which arrives Friday, the day before a hometown release show at the Roxian that launches the Underneath the Skin tour.</p>
<p><strong>So, you’re stepping out as a frontman. Had you been moving toward that for a while?</strong></p>
<p>When we started writing the songs, we kind of discussed it and Shade kept encouraging it, because the songs were complicated in a way, and we were saying this is going to limit what we can do on stage. It was a mixture of that and, at the time, we were playing support shows with bigger bands and learning the difficulties in connecting in the way we’re set up. It seemed like things were coming together in this perfect storm. That, and I thought of how we would introduce it in the videos and how we could add another layer to the album with it. We try to make the whole thing an event as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong>You’ve been behind the drums since the beginning. Does this feel natural to you?</strong></p>
<p>It feels great, especially because we’ve been practicing a lot. That’s the best way to get comfortable. I don’t think I could do it for any other band, really. It feels good. For one, it’s so much easier to use my voice, even just standing up. And we just sound a lot better. It also just frees up everyone to still go hard, without having to have the weight of the show on their back and kill themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have favorite frontmen?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, for sure. Obviously, we love Nine Inch Nails — we love Trent [Reznor] — and Phil [Anselmo] from Pantera, back in the day, and even freaking like Axl Rose. There’s so many great ones. And then, of course, all the guys we watched from our world, whether it be Freddy Madball or whoever.</p>
<p><strong>Are you at all concerned that you and Joe are going to kill each other up there?</strong></p>
<p>Honest to god, until we started doing this, I never even realized, the dude is a [expletive] reckless individual. In the past, he’s tried to carry the load, he’s tried to connect. Now, he can do him and still be free, but he doesn’t have to worry, like, ‘Oh god, I gotta get the crowd into it.’ It’s a stressful situation being in an arena and having to run back and forth being the bass player.</p>
<p><strong>Reba feel the same way?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I think originally she just wanted to make sure it was cool and as soon as we did it one time, she was super encouraging about it. They’re all very encouraging.</p>
<p><strong>What were the drum auditions like? It must be bizarre replacing yourself.</strong></p>
<p>Um, it was bizarre for sure, and there were times when we were like, “We’re not going to be able to find anybody.” This s—t is tremendously hard to play on drums. We learned that the hard way by trying out a lot of people, honestly. We ended up finding somebody that we thought just fit, in all ways. Overall, it ended up being a fit just in vibe and personality and hunger. But the way we’re approaching it is, the band has always been us, just the five of us, and you don’t want to just get married to somebody, immediately, so we’ll see how it shakes out.</p>
<p><strong>Is it someone from another band?</strong></p>
<p>Uh, we’re not gonna say. It’s not even about who it is. The mask and the concept fits with the character in the record and with the cover art, and I like that. On top of that, we’ll see. He’s a great guy and I think he’ll continue to earn his spot, but for now he’s an empty vessel. He’s our drumming muse for now. We don’t want to be married to anyone yet. You don’t know how people are going to be ’til they are.</p>
<p><strong>Having that breakout success with “Forever” — how was it different making a follow-up to that, as compared to “I Am King”?</strong></p>
<p>The only difference is that we just keep, for lack of a better phrase, going down that rabbit hole of making things more and more difficult for ourselves. The only pressure was, I could see a vision of what I wanted it to sound like. I could see where I wanted heavy music to be and what it could sound like coming out of us. I really don’t think this record could be bottled up as anything. You can’t say it’s this kind of music or that. I don’t think there’s any heavy band that sounds like that whole record, so we had this whole concept of how to combine modern technology and production style and, instead of just having electronics and a band, how to make it all this immersive world but still not lose that element of hardcore and extreme metal. It was very stressful to put the puzzle pieces together. It was many full notebooks and picture books and a whole g—damn movie that I wrote out to help break things down for me — what it was supposed to look like and feel like in the story of the record.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about that story? Seems like there’s a focus on seeing people for what they really are.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s kind of about living in this super-overcrowded, noisy world we’re in, where everyone has a voice but their voices are smaller. To me, it seems like everyone has more of a platform but less of a voice because everyone’s just screaming, you know. And we have these things in our pockets that not only shape how we are perceived but, basically, how we perceive everything around us. Even if everything we take in is kind of everyone’s public performance of what they are, what we’re taking in isn’t even accurate. So, it’s how that affects people’s mental health and how it leads to where we are in this transitional time in society. It’s kind of about determining that you’re going to have to face a lot of your own shortcomings and anxieties and fears and resentment and a lot of bitterness to understand where we are, and come out of it [on] the other side.</p>
<p><strong>At your age, you were right on the dividing line of this social media era.</strong></p>
<p>Right on the line, yeah. Almost all of my teen years I had to go to the library to use the internet — and I would go there every day. Then I had one of those phones you pay for and they run out, with the minutes. Totally, we watched that happen. We wanted to make a record that not only sounded like the chaos of a lot of that colliding but took on technology in a different way. Not so much from the government is listening to us, robots are taking over -- the way metal has approached technology a lot in the past — but more from the psychological perspective of the horrors of having this thing where you can watch everybody and everybody can watch you. It’s all like a personal journey of what we’ve gone through as a band, as well.</p>
<p><strong>How do you balance the yin-yang of you and Reba?</strong></p>
<p>It’s pretty natural. The way I look at it is we have a pallet of colors in the voices. And we try to use it all to make the record exciting, more listenable, more listenable in a big chunk, have ups and downs. I see “The Iron King” as more like a slasher movie and the last record is a little deeper, more suspenseful horror and this is more psychological, like science fiction, so we try to just use the voices accordingly, to bring the ups and downs. It’s more based on that than anything else.</p>
<p><strong>How do you feel about playing your first Coachella?</strong></p>
<p>I feel great about it. I’m excited to get out there to some different people. Our end goal is to span all these different worlds that I don’t think have been connected, whether it’s doing Coachella and also doing WWE and also doing Slipknot and also doing hardcore and the rap stuff we’ve done and Shade did Alt-J. It’s another cool ground to cover.</p>
<p><strong>Would you say the Grammy nomination helped break things open for Code Orange?</strong></p>
<p>It did in some ways, but it just shows our range in that we’re a band that can poke our head outside of the box, which I’ve been preaching for a long time. But there’s like actions that have to happen for other people to see that. The only way for a band like us to get to where we want to get is to take these little pieces of all these different audiences. We’re never going to be the next band for a certain kind of audience. I think it’s too many things combined. I think when we win a Grammy it will give us an even bigger platform. It’s always about platforms.</p>
