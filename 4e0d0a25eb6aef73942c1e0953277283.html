<h1>Washington, Pa., couple charged with defrauding $1M in contracting scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Washington, Pa., couple surrendered themselves to the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office Wednesday on charges that they defrauded just over $1 million through the husband’s work as a general contractor.</p>
<p>Daniel Bull, 37, faces over two dozen charges after he allegedly took approximately $1.1 million from customers and subcontractors in a check-kiting scheme with his wife, 37-year-old Nicole Bull. Check kiting involves using a series of floating checks to pay nonexistent funds across different bank accounts.</p>
<p>The scheme was connected to a number of incomplete projects in which Mr. Bull was involved through <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/03/21/Zero-Six-Eight-designed-to-help-former-inmates-get-second-chances/stories/201602220110" target="_blank">his work with Zero Six Eight</a>, a business aimed at helping ex-offenders which he founded after serving 21 months in federal prison for mail fraud.</p>
<p>Investigators allege Mr. Bull and his wife would use money obtained from Mr. Bull’s contracting projects to clear the checks and support their businesses. Money from victims would be funneled directly to Mr. Bull, his wife or accounts associated with their business ventures including Zero Six Eight, JobRise, Work Pittsburgh, NDG and Created to Party LLC.</p>
<p>Mr. Bull would&nbsp;“would write a check for a larger amount without having sufficient funds in the account for the check to clear,” Detective Kevin P. Flannigan wrote in the criminal complaint. Mr. Bull or his wife “would then write a secondary group of checks from other bank accounts and deposit these checks in the first account to allow the initial check to clear.”</p>
<p>The scheme allegedly defrauded several different homeowners and business partners.</p>
<p>In 2018, Mr. Bull became business partners with a man named Daniel Stinson for Mr. Bull’s JobRise company. The two began a general contracting job worth up to $45,000 and&nbsp;“it became a disaster,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>On the day the job was supposed to start, Mr. Stinson found out Mr. Bull didn’t have a contracting license.&nbsp;Mr. Bull told Mr. Stinson he would obtain the license — but never did, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Another victim entered into a contract with Mr. Bull to work on a property in Lawrenceville, and Mr. Bull began to take payments without completing work, the complaint reads.&nbsp;Subcontractors began to tell the victim that they were not getting paid for their work.</p>
<p>The victim paid approximately $180,000 to Mr. Bull before Mr. Bull stopped paying the employees and ceased work on the project altogether.</p>
<p>In another contract,&nbsp;Mr. Bull explained his backstory as a former felon to two victims who planned to hire him to build a new home in Oakmont. They said they were excited to support him and described him as “very likable” and “believable,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>Those victims&nbsp;believed the supervisor, bank and architects were ensuring work was completed before money was sent to Mr. Bull, but they began to notice problems as Mr. Bull started making&nbsp;“empty promises” about the project’s completion, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>Again, subcontractors began to complain that they weren’t being paid by Mr. Bull. An unpaid roofer refused to finish the roofing job, leading to water damage and mold in the property’s basement, the complaint says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Oakmont project, Mr. Bull received approximately $604,000 from Washington Financial Bank for work that was unfinished.</p>
<p>Another pair of victims, who were allegedly deceived out of more than $57,000 for a project in Beaver County, told investigators that Mr. Bull “is a thief and a fraud,” the complaint reads.</p>
<p>For that project, Mr. Bull listed a&nbsp;“Matthew Fields” as a guarantor. Investigators spoke to a man named Matthew Fields who worked for a construction company in Charlotte, NC., but he said he neither knew Mr. Bull nor was involved in the Beaver Country project.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Bull also defaulted on loans of&nbsp;$60,000, $105,000 and $150,000, and is alleged to owe at least&nbsp;$531,000 to several subcontractors including 84 Lumber, Allegheny Millwork and DW Plumbing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Detective Flannigan wrote Mr. Bull “is funneling money through all of his business and personal bank accounts with a portion of this money going to the actor's credit cards.”</p>
<p>He also engaged in deception by&nbsp;telling victims that he was talking to reps from an electrical company, before recanting and telling them he didn’t know anyone from said company, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>He is also alleged to have never provided financials to some victims and claimed canceled bank transfers were done due to an error on the bank’s behalf.</p>
<p>In an email to his business partner Mr. Stinson, with the subject line&nbsp;“Character,” he seemed to discuss his prior conviction and current deceptive activity with JobRise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"I have ignored basic matters of integrity because my intentions were good,” a transcription in the complaint reads. “Lieing&nbsp;(sic) to myself and in turn to others around me is a humiliating reality."</p>
<p>He continued,&nbsp;''I've been on a path before when I was willing to succeed at any cost no matter the collateral damage. I am certainly not there now[,] but if this doesn't pivot today[,] I recognized this last night how far I have stepped away from my new path and the danger ahead.”</p>
<p>Despite Mr. Stinson and his predecessor at JobRise,&nbsp;Jorge Newbery, both believing they still owned 50% of JobRise, the parent company Zero Six Eight filed for bankruptcy in 2019. Neither Mr. Stinson nor Mr. Newbery were bought out, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bull faces multiple charges of theft, forgery, deceptive or fraudulent business practices in addition to charges of identity theft, home improvement fraud and conspiracy. All of the 29 total charges are felonies.</p>
<p>Ms. Bull is charged with dealing in proceeds of illegal activity, conspiracy and receiving stolen property. A lawyer for the couple was not listed in court records, and neither could be reached for comment.</p>
<p>They were arraigned Wednesday and released on their own recognizance. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Oct. 2.&nbsp;</p>
