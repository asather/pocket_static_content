<h1>Allegheny County's second COVID-19 death a surprise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The cause of the second death in Allegheny County from COVID-19 infection wasn’t discovered until after the person passed away.</p>
<p>“It is with a great deal of sadness that we advise you that Allegheny County had a second death as a result of COVID-19,” the County Health Department stated. “This person’s positive status was not known until after the death.”</p>
<p>Because the Medical Examiner’s Office determined the cause of death, “there will be additional information released by that office according to protocols,” the Health Department release states. “We are hopeful that the public and the media will be respectful of this family during this difficult time.”</p>
<p>As a Medical Examiner’s case, “we are providing more information on this case than we would normally. This will not be our department’s standard practice.”</p>
<p>The deceased woman was in her late 70s with no recent travel but with other health issues “that may have delayed recognition of COVID-19.”</p>
<p>“Medics who responded to a 9-1-1 call were wearing personal protective equipment (PPE),” it says.</p>
<p>After reporting the symptoms to the Medical Examiner’s office, COVID-19 testing was performed. When the results provided positive for COVID-19, the Health Department began “contact tracing” based on information from the family, whose members are now in self-isolation.”</p>
<p>No further information about the victim is forthcoming.</p>
<p>In cases not involving the Medical Examiner’s Office, the Health Department said it the information it provides will be limited to the general age of the individual and whether that person was hospitalized at the time of death.</p>
<p>The county also said Tuesday that it has 58 positive cases of COVID-19, up from 48 on Monday. Other counties in southwestern Pennsylvania that are reporting COVID-19 cases are Washington (9), Westmoreland (11), Butler (6), Beaver (3), Cambria (1), Fayette (2) and Mercer (2). In addition, Armstrong County reported it’s first case on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Statewide, there are 851 positive cases and seven deaths, with at least one case now in 40 of the state’s 67 counties.</p>
