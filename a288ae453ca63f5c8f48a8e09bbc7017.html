<p><strong>Quarterback:</strong> Ben Roethlisberger was predictably rusty in the early going, but he heated up late in the first half to help the Steelers take a 16-10 halftime lead. He threw two touchdown passes in the final 9:01 of the half to JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Washington. He was 8 for 11 for 99 yards on those two scoring drives, accounting for most of his 145 passing yards on those two drives. He finished 21 for 32 for 229 yards with three touchdowns and no interceptions and a quarterback rating of 117.8. Not bad for his first game in 365 days after an elbow injury ended his 2019 campaign.</p>
<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>
<p><strong>Running backs:</strong> James Conner was ineffective early and then left the game and did not return due to an ankle injury. That gave Benny Snell a chance to be the featured runner, and he came through big-time. Snell rushed for 113 yards on 19 carries, including a run of 30 yards midway through the fourth quarter that set up the Steelers’ final touchdown. Conner finished with 9 yards on six carries, and Jaylen Samuels carried once for 2 yards. After a slow start, Snell’s hard-nosed running became a huge plus for the offense.</p>
<p><em>Grade: B+</em></p>
<p><strong>Receivers:</strong> It wasn’t a prolific night for Smith-Schuster, but he caught all six of his targets for 69 yards and two touchdowns. Diontae Johnson also had six catches for 57 yards, and James Washington had a 13-yard touchdown when he masterfully kept his knees from hitting the ground while reaching the ball out over the goal line. A couple of new players made their presence felt, too. Training camp sensation Chase Claypool, the rookie second-round pick out of Notre Dame, had a spectacular 28-yard catch in the first quarter that helped set up a field goal in the first half. He finished with two catches for 38 yardst. New tight end Eric Ebron caught a big third-down conversion for 20 yards that set up the first touchdown of the game to Smith-Schuster.</p>
<p><em>Grade: B</em></p>
<p><strong>Offensive line:</strong> There was too much pressure on four-man rushes early in the game, which contributed to Roethlisberger’s slow start. He was constantly hurried in the first few series. Roethlisberger was sacked by Dexter Lawrence after new starting right tackle Zach Banner was beaten around the edge. Later, in the third quarter, Alejandro Villanueva was bull-rushed by Leonard Williams, who ended up sacking Roethlisberger for a second time. The miscue stalled the drive, and the Steelers ended up kicking a field goal. This is a unit very much in transition, and it probably didn’t help matters that starting right guard David DeCastro had to miss the game due to a knee injury. Stefen Wisniewski started in his place and had to leave late in the fourth quarter with a pectoral injury. Banner also left late in the game with a knee injury. Rookie Kevin Dotson and Chukwuma Okorafor finished in their places.</p>
<p><em>Grade: C+</em></p>
<p><strong>Defensive line:</strong> The line set the tone early and often by stuffing Giants running back Saquon Barkley, who had minus-3 yards rushing at halftime. He finished with just 6 yards on 15 carries, and the Giants totaled just 29 yards on 20 attempts in the game. It was a dominating performance by Stephon Tuitt, Cam Heyward and Tyson Alualu. “We had a commitment, and we weren’t bashful about that commitment,” coach Mike Tomlin said afterward. Tuitt also added a sack in his first game back after missing the final 10 games last season with a pectoral injury while Heyward was in the right place at the right time to haul in a crucial interception in the third quarter.</p>
<p><em>Grade: A-</em></p>
<p><strong>Linebackers:</strong> Bud Dupree and T.J. Watt made huge plays for the defense. Watt dropped into zone coverage and picked off Daniel Jones early in the second quarter. That turnover set up the first Steelers touchdown a few minutes later. Then, early in the second half, Dupree pressured Jones and forced the interception by Heyward in the end zone. It halted a 19-play drive as the Giants were poised to take the lead. It was a relatively quiet game for the inside linebackers, but Vince Williams did record a sack when he blindsided Jones in the first half.</p>
<p><em>Grade: A</em></p>
<p><strong>Secondary:</strong> It was definitely a rough start for the Steelers cornerbacks. Early in the second quarter, Joe Haden was called for pass interference on third-and-11, giving the Giants a first down in Steelers territory. On the very next play, Jones connected with Darius Slayton for a 41-yard touchdown with Steven Nelson in coverage. But the secondary settled down after that as Jones struggled to generate much more offense until a drive that resulted in a touchdown with less than two minutes left. Strong safety Terrell Edmunds led the Steelers with nine tackles.</p>
<p><em>Grade: B</em></p>
<p><strong>Special teams:</strong> Diontae Johnson got things off to a bad start when he muffed a punt inside the 20 that the Giants recovered at the Steelers’ 3-yard line. Luckily for him, the defense stood tall and held the Giants to a field goal. Chris Boswell missed an point-after attempt in the first half, but he made field goals of 41 and 36 yards. New punter Dustin Colquitt had a solid debut with four punts for 183 yards, including a 59-yarder. New kickoff returner Ray-Ray McCloud’s lone return was for 33 yards, showing why the Steelers kept him over Ryan Switzer.</p>
<p><em>Grade: C</em></p>
<p><strong>Coaching:</strong> It was clear the Steelers wanted to ease Roethlisberger into game action. The play-calling early in the game was a bit conservative, but eventually offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner allowed Roethlisberger to open up the offense. He delivered with some big throws at crucial times to steer the Steelers to two touchdowns in the final stages of the first half. Keith Butler’s defense came out hungry and had a critical goal line stand early in the first quarter. That set the tone for the entire game. The Steelers defense picked up where it left off last season, and that’s a great sign for the team moving forward. The offense must start faster, but the slow start in Roethlisberger’s first game back was not completely unexpected.&nbsp;</p>
