<h1>Rachel Levine is the calm in the eye of the COVID-19 storm</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Daily virtual news conferences have elevated public health officials from near obscurity to semi-celebrity status during the COVID-19 pandemic —&nbsp;think Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx. But such high exposure inevitably draws criticism for speaking inconvenient truths about the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, that praised/pilloried role is held by Health Department Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine, who has become the public face of the state’s pandemic response as much as Gov. Tom Wolf has been. Calm and reassuring, she delivers daily pandemic updates, urges the state’s 12.9 million residents to “stay calm, stay home, stay safe” and encourages best practices of hand washing, social distancing and masking to mitigate the virus’ spread.</p>
<p>In some quarters, Dr. Levine is hailed as a hero for not only addressing medical needs but also providing salve for the psyche, delivering troubling information in a tranquil way that engenders confidence. There’s even a Facebook fan club group,&nbsp;“Dr. Rachel Levine —&nbsp;We Love You,” that has just shy of 5,800 followers.</p>
<p>A survey released May 12 by The Washington Post/Ipsos showed that 72% of Pennsylvania adults approved of how the governor has handled the coronavirus outbreak, a result that likely reflects upon Dr. Levine’s work, too.</p>

<p>But in some quarters, she is lambasted by those who disagree with her handling of the public health crisis. Some Republican legislators have even called for her firing or resignation.&nbsp;And from the darkest recesses of the human condition have emerged hate-filled, transphobic attacks on Dr. Levine, who is a transgender woman and a role model in the national LGBTQ community.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine doesn’t revel in the acclaim, bristle at the criticism or react angrily to the transphobia. Instead, she remains calm.</p>
<p>“I think that my greatest satisfaction is in the midst of this global health crisis to be able to do my part to serve Pennsylvania,” she said in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>“Our vision is a healthy Pennsylvania for all. And, you know, that's an enormous challenge in the midst of a global pandemic, so my greatest satisfaction is being able to contribute towards that goal.”</p>
<p><strong>Responsibilities</strong></p>
<p>Months before most Pennsylvanians began to think about the new coronavirus, Dr. Levine already was immersed in developing a battle plan to combat its spread.</p>
<p>“After the first cases occurred in Washington state and then in California and then in Illinois, we started to have robust discussions, both in our department and then also through the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials,” said Dr.&nbsp; Levine, who as the organization’s president-elect will assume the top leadership role this summer, which will be a crucial period in regards to COVID-19.</p>
<p>She also talked two or three times a week with federal officials at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, she said. “The beginning of February we started a virtual incident command and actually had our staff go into the [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency] and organize it.</p>
<p>“Starting probably the end of February we went into full incident command mode here. …&nbsp; I remember updating and talking to the governor —&nbsp;it may have been the first day of February — [telling him] that this is going to be a significant public health threat.”</p>
<p>Since then, Dr. Levine’s weeks have been filled with extraordinary responsibilities. There is no typical day, she said, but most follow a pattern.</p>
<p>“I get up very early in the morning and after I get dressed I’m on email. I get to PEMA [Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency] early —&nbsp;that’s where all of offices are, everything is run out of PEMA, none of us are in the Capitol —&nbsp;and I'm working with our staff and the governor’s office and a million phone calls. You know everything we’re doing is virtual, so virtual phone calls. Then I leave early in the evening and get home and eat dinner and go to bed and then do it again.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/faces-of-covid-19/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/04/15/faces-of-covid-19-stories-behind-local-lives-lost" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Despite the pace and stress, Dr. Levine said she is “holding up well, and I really appreciate it when people ask me. I have been in very close contact with my family, I’m trying to sleep well and eat well and rest when I can, but I am certainly staying laser-focused on this public health crisis.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of clinical background, so staying calm in the face of medical emergencies is something I’ve been able to do all throughout my career, to be able to focus on the job at hand.”</p>
<p>She holds virtual news conferences five times a week —&nbsp;at one point it was seven days —&nbsp;to provide the latest updates on COVID-19 cases, deaths and other health news and guidance. At the end she takes questions from news outlets across the state.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, she was asked about a weeklong decline in the number of COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“We do consider it a very positive trend,” she responded. “I think that we have been successful in terms of continuing to bend and straighten that curve in terms of the number of new cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“And now after those mitigation efforts have been successful, we are working under the governor’s leadership in a progressive, iterative, phased fashion to reopen Pennsylvania, for counties to go from red to yellow and eventually from yellow to green and to protect those businesses and the economy as well as protect the public health of everyone in Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p><strong>Pushback</strong></p>
<p>A Boston native, Dr. Levine graduated from Harvard College and Tulane University School of Medicine and completed pediatrics training at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. She joined the Wolf Administration in January 2015 as Pennsylvania’s fourth physician general, a cabinet-level position for which she was unanimously approved by the Republican-controlled state Senate. Previously, she had been clinical affairs vice chair for the Department of Pediatrics and division chief of adolescent medicine and eating disorders at Penn State Children’s Hospital-Milton S. Hershey Medical Center.</p>
<p>Gov. Wolf named her acting health secretary in July 2017 and she was confirmed in March 2018.&nbsp;She remains a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Penn State College of Medicine and has lectured nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>In a<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2015/11/01/Meet-Pennsylvania-Physician-General-Dr-Rachel-Levine-highest-ranking-transgender-person-in-state-history/stories/201510200184" target="_blank"> 2015 Post-Gazette profile</a>, a former medical school student said of Dr. Levine: “She will be missed by patients but she’s perfect for policy. She’s someone who is able to navigate very difficult situations.”</p>
<p>As the days of the pandemic have rolled on, she has faced criticism, protests and even calls for her resignation or removal from office.&nbsp;None of that seems to faze Dr. Levine.</p>
<p>“To echo the governor, Pennsylvanians want to do and will be doing the right thing,” she said. “There are some people who don’t want to do that. I have concerns for their health when they’re not practicing social distancing and washing their hands and wearing masks and things like that. But overall, I’m very pleased with Pennsylvania’s response because we trust Pennsylvania.”</p>
<p>She asserted the state had employed “a very careful, measured, evidence-based response” to non-essential business closures, stay-at-home orders, public health guidance and re-openings. “You can always have criticisms and we accept that.”</p>
<p>At her news conference Tuesday, she was asked about a resolution introduced by state Rep. Russ Diamond, R-Lebanon, calling for her removal or resignation because of deadly COVID-19 outbreaks in nursing homes and an alleged lack of Health Department transparency. She didn’t miss a beat.</p>
<p>“I have no specific response to the representative but what I can say is I remain committed to protecting the residents of Pennsylvania, wherever they live, wherever they go, whether it’s in a facility, whether it’s at home, whether it’s in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, Erie or Harrisburg, whether it’s in their communities, whether they agree with me or not, and I will do everything I possibly can to keep them safe.”</p>
<p>Political in-fighting over public health and other social issues during “a very important and critical election year” was not unexpected, Dr. Levine said, even as she attempts to stay above the fray.</p>
<p>She takes a philosophical approach toward&nbsp;transphobic hate,&nbsp;even referencing a “Star Wars” movie character.</p>
<p>“I think people fear what they don’t understand, what is not within their experience. And so I like to quote Yoda that fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger, anger leads to hate and hate leads to suffering.</p>
<p>“I am obviously very out and part of the LGBTQ community and proud to be so. Maybe through my actions people will be educated about the LGBTQ community and the contributions that we make and are trying to make and then they’ll fear less and they’ll be less angry and will hate less.”</p>
<p>As for the future, Dr. Levine is generally optimistic — if Pennsylvanians continue to do what needs to be done.</p>
<p>“People in the United States and Pennsylvania will get through this pandemic. But I think that things will change. I can’t predict what those changes will be, but it’s not going to be exactly the way it was before.</p>
<p>“So we’re going to have to work through this new reality that we have during this global pandemic. I have confidence in Pennsylvanians and in the commonwealth and we will get through this and we will come out even stronger.”</p>
