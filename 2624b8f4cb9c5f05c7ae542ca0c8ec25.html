<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday will order a statewide shutdown as the number of COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania continues to grow, according to three sources familiar with the decision.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf and other state officials will release more details to the public at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>The governor had previously placed four counties — Bucks, Chester, Delaware, and Montgomery — under a shutdown order. That involved asking non-essential businesses like gyms, hair salons, and concert venues to close for 14 days. Wolf said pharmacies, grocery stores, and gas stations should stay open.</p>

<p>Residents there were urged to curtail any non-essential travel.</p>
<p>On Sunday, Mr. Wolf also ordered restaurants in those four counties as well as Allegheny County to close their dine-in facilities for two weeks. He said carry-out and delivery service could continue.</p>
