<h1>Sen. Pat Toomey announces he will step away from politics in 2022</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Pat Toomey, who has represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate since 2011, announced Monday he will decline to run for re-election in 2022 and will not campaign for Pennsylvania governor.</p>
<p>The two-term Republican senator said during a press conference in Bethlehem that he was ready to step away from politics and return to the private sector after 18 years of public service over a 24-year period. Mr. Toomey previously represented Eastern Pennsylvania in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1999 to 2005, keeping his pledge to limit his time in the House to three terms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The reasons I’ve reached this decision are not political, they’re personal,” Mr. Toomey said,&nbsp;joined on stage by his wife, daughter and two sons.&nbsp;“The decision is consistent with the long-held view I’ve had in support of term limits.”</p>
<p>“I always thought I’d probably serve just two terms” in the U.S. Senate, he said, pointing to the stresses of commuting to Washington from his home in Lehigh County.&nbsp;“I’m looking forward to more time back at home.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he came to the decision to walk away from public service in the previous “days, a couple of weeks.” His phone had been ringing off the hook from people offering to help him during the 2022 campaign season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve been getting phone calls almost on a daily basis from people who have said: ‘I want to help you run for governor. I want to help your re-election campaign. I want to host a fundraiser,’” Mr. Toomey said. “Once I reached the decision, I need to be candid with them.”</p>
<p>He said he also hoped an early announcement would help Republicans across the state begin to draw up a winning strategy for who to put forward as gubernatorial and Senate candidates.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey is known in Washington as a cerebral legislator who shies away from hot-button social issues and prefers delving into fine policy details. Over his tenure, he has watched as the Senate — considered a prestigious and deliberative body shielded from the political whims of the country — fell into the gridlock of partisan rancor that consumes most matters in Washington today.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey’s two Senate elections have not been landslides. He was first elected to the Senate in 2010, defeating Democratic candidate Joe Sestak by two percentage points amid widespread Republican wins in Congress in a midterm election year.</p>
<p>He won re-election in 2016 by just over one percentage point, defeating Democrat Katie McGinty, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s former chief of staff.</p>
<p>Asked by a reporter if he thought he would win if he ran for Pennsylvania governor, Mr. Toomey pointed to his five-out-of-five record in winning elections. “I think if I decided to run, I would’ve won again,” he said.</p>
<p>On Capitol Hill, Mr. Toomey serves as a member of a powerful trio of congressional panels: the Senate Finance Committee, the Senate Banking Committee and the Senate Budget Committee. A former Wall Street banker, Mr. Toomey served from 2005 to 2009 as president of the Club for Growth, an advocacy group focused on low taxes, small government, free trade and other conservative principles.</p>
<p>The senator’s views have often put him at odds with President Donald Trump’s administration on trade, spending, gun reform and some foreign policy issues.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey has opposed Mr. Trump’s trade war with China and his tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum and pressed the administration to get tougher on North Korea and China. In 2016, he refused to say if he would vote for Mr. Trump until hours before the polls closed.</p>
<p>On Monday, Mr. Toomey repeatedly said the rising polarization and his disagreements with Mr. Trump’s policies and style played “absolutely no role whatsoever” in his decision to retire from politics.</p>
<p>“I decided very early on I am not responsible for editing the president’s Twitter feed,” Mr. Toomey said on Monday, while adding that “When I disagree with him, which I have, I haven’t been bashful about saying so.”</p>
<p>By and large, Mr. Toomey has been a reliable vote for the president and his agenda. He played a major role in writing the 2017 GOP bill that cut taxes and rewrote key pieces of the tax code. That year, he cast a vote in support of three measures that would have rolled back the Affordable Care Act, a repeal effort that ultimately failed.</p>
<p>He reiterated his support for Mr. Trump’s re-election.</p>
<p>Though Mr. Toomey has not been a surrogate speaker for Mr. Trump’s re-election campaign in Pennsylvania — a crucial swing state that Mr. Trump won by a razor-thin margin in 2016 — he remains&nbsp;“open to however the [Trump] campaign would like to use me,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>He said he supported the Senate’s plans to hold hearings and a confirmation vote on Judge Amy Coney Barrett, Mr. Trump’s nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court, despite Mr. Trump and three Republican senators testing positive for COVID-19. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has postponed Senate activity for two weeks.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey said he believed there could still be a vote on Judge Barrett’s nomination before the Nov. 3 Election Day, while leaving open the possibility that a confirmation vote could come after Election Day.</p>
<p>“I think we should go forward on this, I think we can do this safely,” Mr. Toomey said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the final two years of his term, Mr. Toomey said, he hopes to become chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, should the Republicans hold onto control of the Senate.</p>
<p>He said there are a range of legislative priorities he would seek to accomplish, including ways to encourage middle-income Americans to be investors, embrace of new financial technologies, making permanent the 2017 GOP tax cuts and further government deregulation.</p>
<p>He cited a “great relationship” with his Pennsylvania colleague, Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, with whom he has worked to fill judicial vacancies. Last month, the Senate filled the 10-judge bench in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh, for the first time since 2013.</p>
