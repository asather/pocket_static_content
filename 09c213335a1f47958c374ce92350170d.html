<h1>Steelers captains 'surprised' by Al Villanueva's helmet decision vs. Giants</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several Steelers said they were surprised and caught unaware that offensive tackle Alejandro Villanueva chose to honor someone other than Antwon Rose II on the back of his helmet <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/09/14/steelers-antwon-rose-helmets-social-justice-activism-pittsburgh/stories/202009140072" target="_blank">during Monday night’s season opener</a> against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>Villanueva, a former Army Ranger who was awarded a Silver Star Medal during two tours of duty in Afghanistan, chose to tape the hand-written name of Alwyn Cashe, a Black sergeant 1st Class in the U.S. Army, over Rose’s imprinted name on his helmet.&nbsp;Cashe, who died 15 years ago trying to rescue fellow soldiers from a burning vehicle in Iraq, was posthumously awarded the Silver Star for his repeated rescue attempts.</p>
<p>“I was surprised by what Al did,” defensive end and team captain Cam Heyward said Wednesday. “You’ll have to talk to him, but in this country we’re given the freedom to do and support those who mean a lot to us.”</p>
<p>“I did not know about Al’s choice for the back of his helmet,” quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said.</p>
<p>Rose, 17, was shot and killed in 2018 by an East Pittsburgh police officer who ultimately was found not guilty.</p>
<p>Heyward said the team discussed what to do for the game and elected to honor Rose and bring attention to the shooting, which gained national attention two years ago. Rose’s mother, Michelle Kenney posted a message Tuesday night on Facebook criticizing Villanueva for not going along with his teammates’ decision to honor her son.</p>

<p>“We chose this first game to represent her son … we chose to support her son,” Heyward said. “If she wants to make the community closer, that’s what we’ve got to do. Was it perfect at the end of the day? No. But, as a collective unit, we wanted to support her and her family and draw awareness.”</p>
<p>Villanueva, who has not spoken publicly about his decision, was the only player to not display Rose’s name.</p>
<p>“Obviously, that’s his choice,” Roethlisberger said. “That’s the amazing thing about the country we live in. Unfortunately, it is what it is.”</p>
<p>Said Heyward: “I was unaware of it. We had discussed it before it was brought up to us. That’s for him to comment on in the future. I’m not going to sit up here and speak for him. He’s his own man, and we’ll move forward.”</p>
<p>Honoring Rose was just one part of the team’s decision to deliver a message during their opening game.</p>
<p>Several players held a long banner that said “Steelers Against Racism” during the playing of the national anthem. The hometown of each player was listed on the sides of the banner. During pre-game warm-ups, coach Mike Tomlin wore a sweatshirt that said “End Racism.”</p>
<p>“We had talked about the banner on Wednesday and we were working on something that didn’t have to be politicized,” Heyward said. “We wanted to be straight-forward and let you know we’re against racism and we want to end racism. There are a lot of things going on in our world that support that.”</p>
