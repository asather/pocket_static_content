<h1>Concerns raised about elimination of Bloomfield bus stop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority continues to hear concerns about the process it is using as it consolidates bus stops throughout the system.</p>
<p>But the agency says that is affirmation that the public is reacting to its proposed changes, which is exactly what officials want.</p>
<p>The authority began a program last fall to systematically review more than 7,000 bus stops to eliminate those that are little used, redundant or unsafe. The goal is to improve the on-time performance of buses by making the system more efficient and perhaps freeing resources to add service where it is needed.</p>
<p>Staff picks a couple of routes to review each quarter, visits each stop, and then posts signs at stops recommended for elimination. The agency believes it gets more traction from riders this way rather than engaging with riders before recommending changes.</p>
<p>The program is now in its second round and some riders and groups remain unhappy with that process. The review this quarter involves the 88 Penn and 48 Arlington routes.</p>
<p>Christina Howell, executive director of the Bloomfield Development Corp., told the authority’s board of directors Friday that some residents in her neighborhood are concerned about the process. About 30 attended a neighborhood meeting about it Thursday.</p>
<p>Ms. Howell said she was disappointed the agency turned down her offer to participate in the meeting. Her agency would rather be “a partner” in the process to select stops for elimination “rather than react” to recommendations, she said.</p>
<p>After the meeting, Ms. Howell said residents are particularly concerned about the proposed elimination of a stop at Millvale and Penn avenues in favor of one a block away at Matilda and Penn. Millvale is a very busy stop with a high number of riders who are older or have disabilities and it seems discriminatory to close that one, especially if the authority doesn’t share its criteria for eliminating stops, she said.</p>
<p>“Should that criteria be transparent and everyone see why they made that decision, maybe we’d support it,” she said.</p>
<p>The authority board never responds to comments at a board meeting, but afterwards CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman and Chief Development Officer David Huffaker said they are satisfied with the process. They will review the Millvale stop before a final decision is made.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman said in more than 20 years in transit planning, her experience has been that having the public react to staff recommendations is a better way to get feedback on these types of issues than holding community meetings. Mr. Huffaker called the criteria “more art than science” and stressed that factors such as the condition of a stop, nearby amenities and other stops in the area are factors in addition to the number of people using a stop.</p>
<p>“I think this process shows we’re getting people’s attention,” Ms. Kelleman said.</p>
<p>The authority will take comments about the proposed changes until Feb. 7 on its website, <a href="https://www.portauthority.org/" target="_blank">portauthority.org</a>.</p>
