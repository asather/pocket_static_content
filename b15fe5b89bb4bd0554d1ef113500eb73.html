<h1>Federal court rejects 'weak and unenforceable' Pennsylvania smog regulations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal appeals court in Philadelphia has ruled that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s approval of a weak Pennsylvania air pollution standard was “arbitrary and capricious,” and directed the federal and state environmental agencies to come up with new tougher, enforceable, regulations.</p>
<p>The Sierra Club and Earthjustice brought the appeal, arguing at a May 21 hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, that the EPA’s approval of Pennsylvania coal-fired power plant pollution standards wrongly claimed the state regulations would reduce emissions of nitrogen oxides, a building-block of unhealthy smog.</p>
<p>The court, in its 30-page opinion by judge Theodore McGee, agreed, stating that the EPA was “simply rubber stamping an average of current pollution output as its supposed new gold standard,” and that a state allowance of low temperature coal combustion could actually increase pollution emissions five-fold.</p>
<p>The court also agreed with the Sierra Club claim that the proposed state regulations also lack enforceable emissions reporting standards.</p>
<p>“The Third Circuit’s opinion finds, in no uncertain terms, that the EPA was wrong to approve a weak and unenforceable Pennsylvania rule,” said Charles McPhedran, an Earthjustice attorney who argued the case for the Sierra Club. “High emissions have downwind consequences for air quality and public health, and EPA and Pennsylvania must do better.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania currently has five coal-fired electric power plants, plus a sixth that burns coal part-time, down from 16 that burned coal a decade ago. Many of those that stopped using coal have switched to lower cost natural gas as a fuel.</p>
<p>The court opinion vacated the EPA’s approval on three provisions of the Pennsylvania “SIP,” or State Implementation Plan, and directed the federal agency to either approve a “revised, compliant&nbsp; (state) SIP within two years” or formulate new pollution standards that employ reasonably available control technologies and that “lack the gaping loophole found in the enforcement regime proposed here.”</p>
<p>Mr. McPhedran said the two-year deadline is short by federal standards and sends a “powerful” message.</p>
<p>“I think the court, by setting that deadline, is expressing its frustration with both agencies, with the DEP for proposing such a weak rule and with the EPA for approving it.”</p>
<p>The state is required to submit a pollution reduction plan to the EPA because seven counties around Pittsburgh and Philadelphia could not meet tighter ozone control standards adopted by the EPA in 2008. Pennsylvania’s SIP was submitted in May 2016, and the EPA approved it “provisionally” in March 2018. Several environmental organizations as well as New York and Maryland, states surrounding Pennsylvania, opposed the plan, the court opinion noted, but the EPA gave it final approval in 2019.</p>
<p>An EPA spokesman said the agency is reviewing the decision. The DEP issued a statement saying it is also reviewing the decision, and refused to respond to the court’s criticism of the state rules or say how long it will take to write and implement new regulations and submit them to the EPA.</p>
<p>Nitrogen oxides are emitted by power plants, manufacturing industries and vehicle exhaust pipes, and react with sunlight and volatile organic compounds in the atmosphere to form ground level ozone, the primary component of smog. Breathing elevated levels of nitrogen oxides can cause lung damage, respiratory infections and asthma. Smog can cause or aggravate a host of breathing problems and diseases for humans, lead to heart attacks and strokes, and reduce plant growth and damage crops and forests.</p>
<p>“This decision is a strong rebuke to EPA, and a powerful reminder of the obligation EPA has to protect the public from smog-producing pollution from dirty coal-fired power plants,” said Zachary Fabish, an attorney for the Sierra Club who participated in the case. “We hope that EPA will now take steps to prevent the harm to public health and the environment that this power plant pollution causes.”</p>
