<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf has written to President Donald Trump to back calls from other leading governors for another $500 billion in federal aid for states fighting the spread of the coronavirus, warning that his office is projecting a budget deficit of up to $5 billion.</p>
<p>The letter, dated Wednesday, was issued with two other Democratic governors, Tony Evers of Wisconsin and Gretchen Whitmer of Michigan.</p>
<p>Trump won all three states narrowly in 2016, states that had long backed Democrats in presidential contests.</p>
<p>In the letter, they acknowledge that the federal government is making an initial $71 billion available to meet some immediate cash flow needs of state and local governments.</p>
<p>But, they write, “the magnitude of the crushing economic impact this virus has had on our states and residents cannot be overstated.”</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, Wolf said the projected deficit ranging between $4.5 billion and $5 billion will make it incredibly difficult to focus the state’s efforts on supporting workers and businesses as it attempts to rebuild its economy.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, Republican Gov. Larry Hogan of Maryland and Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York issued a call for the additional $500 billion. Hogan is chairman of the National Governors Association and Cuomo is the vice chairman.</p>
