<h1>Gov. Wolf seeks federal loans for state's small businesses hurt by COVID-19 impact</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Wednesday asked the federal government for disaster relief to help the state’s small businesses cope with the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>The governor requested the U.S. Small Business Administration declare the state a disaster so that businesses and nonprofits could become eligible for loans of up to $2 million apiece with long-term repayment plans.</p>
<p>“The impact of financial losses related to COVID-19 will be felt for years to come,” Gov. Wolf said in a statement.</p>
<p>“But these low-interest loans can help bridge the gap between economic losses now and economic recovery in the future.”</p>
<p>The state’s Commonwealth Financing Authority and Pittsburgh’s Urban Redevelopment Authority also announced steps to assist businesses that are facing lost revenues and layoffs as the economic fallout from the coronavirus continues.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The interest rate on the SBA loans is 3.75% for businesses and 2.75% for nonprofits.</p>
<p>The SBA defines small businesses as firms with fewer than 500 employees.</p>
<p>They employed 59 million people, or close to half of the nation’s private workforce in 2015.</p>
<p>Last week, the SBA began collecting data from small businesses about the impact of the coronavirus on their operations and revenues.</p>
<p>Details on how businesses and nonprofits can apply will be made available once the SBA grants the governor’s request.</p>
<p>The Commonwealth Financing Authority authorized the transfer of $40 million to the Pennsylvania Industrial Development Authority that will be combined with existing funds in PIDA’s Small Business First Program, said Senate President Pro Tempore Joe Scarnati, R-Jefferson.</p>
<p>More than $60 million will be allocated from the PIDA program for 0% interest loans of up to $100,000 to businesses with 100 or fewer full-time employees, said Mr. Scarnati.</p>
<p>Application fees are being waived and there will be no payments and no interest during the first year of the loan.</p>
<p>Guidelines are still being developed but will be available as they are established at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dced.pa.gov/PIDA" target="_blank">www.dced.pa.gov/PIDA</a></p>
<p>The city’s URA is seeking board approval to stop all payments by borrowers for the month of April.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Existing small business borrowers are being offered emergency extended credit through loans of up to $15,000 with 0% interest and no fees.</p>
<p>The URA also said its micro-enterprise loan program will make 30 loans of up to $15,000 with 0% interest available to small firms that aren’t currently URA borrowers.&nbsp;</p>
