<h1> Native tribes sue federal government; Astronauts return to plagued planet; Trump’s former lawyer to serve time at home</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several Native American tribes sued the federal government Friday, seeking to keep any of the $8 billion in federal coronavirus relief for tribes out of the hands of for-profit Alaska Native corporations.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department is tasked with doling out the money by April 26 to help tribes nationwide stay afloat, respond to the virus and recover after having to shut down casinos, tourism operations and other businesses that serve as their main moneymakers.</p>
<p>The Confederated Tribes of the Chehalis Reservation and the Tulalip Tribes in Washington state, the Houlton Band of Maliseet Indians in Maine, and the Akiak Native Community, Asa’carsarmiut Tribe and Aleut Community of St. Paul Island in Alaska filed the lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>The U.S. Treasury Department, named as the defendant, did not immediately return comment.</p>
<p>Already, tribes had raised questions about the distribution of the funding.</p>
<p>“It is what Indian Country will rely on to start up again,” said Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Chuck Hoskin Jr. “And Congress surely didn’t intend to put tribal governments, which are providing health care, education, jobs, job training, and all sorts of programs, to compete against these Alaska corporate interests, which looks like a cash grab.”</p>
<p><strong>Astronauts return&nbsp;to plagued planet</strong></p>
<p>Last time Jessica Meir, Andrew Morgan and Oleg Skripochka were on Earth, there were house parties, happy hours, handshakes, crowded concerts and no one was yet talking about the novel coronavirus that has reshaped daily life across the world.</p>
<p>More than 200 days since they each embarked on their trip to space, things are different. All three astronauts landed Friday morning near Dzhezkazgan, Kazakhstan.</p>
<p>Friday also marks 50 years since astronauts aboard Apollo 13 were forced to abort their lunar landing mission — after explosions crippled the service module and command module — and safely landed in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>“50 years ago a crisis in space ended in the safe return of the #Apollo13 crew,” Mr. Morgan wrote on Twitter on Friday. “Now, during the return of the Soyuz MS-15 crew, the crisis is on Earth. The constant: dedication and ingenuity of the mission control centers around the globe.”</p>
<p><strong>Trump’s former lawyer to serve time at home</strong></p>
<p>President Donald Trump’s former lawyer and other inmates at a minimum-security camp in upstate New York were told they would serve their sentences at home.</p>
<p>Michael Cohen, the disgraced former lawyer for President Trump, was among some of the inmates at a federal prison camp in upstate New York who were told they would be released into home confinement because of concerns about the spread of COVID-19, several defense lawyers said on Friday.</p>
<p>The expected releases come about three weeks after Attorney General William Barr, who oversees the Bureau of Prisons, ordered a review to determine who among the country’s nearly 144,000 federal inmates could safely be furloughed to home confinement as the pandemic worsened.</p>
<p>A week later, Mr. Barr directed prison officials to move more aggressively and expanded the criteria under which inmates could be released.</p>
<p>According to the prison agency’s website, nearly 1,200 prisoners have been released — after a required 14-day quarantine.</p>
