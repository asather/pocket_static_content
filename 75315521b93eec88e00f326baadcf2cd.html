<h1>Pittsburgh Symphony to offer streaming programming during COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joining a number of orchestras around the country, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra today announced a range of digital musical content to entertain and educate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The content will be available on the symphony’s website (<a href="https://pittsburghsymphony.org/pso_home/web/extraordinary-measures" target="_blank">pittsburghsymphony.org</a>) and social media channels beginning next week.</p>
<p>The program, termed “Extraordinary Measures,” will include:</p>
<p>• morning videos with music and insight, self-produced by PSO musicians</p>
<p>• a weekly presentation of excerpts and selections from the season hosted by PSO music director Manfred Honeck</p>
<p>• Educational resources for children ages 3-8 and practice tips and techniques for middle and high school instrumental students</p>
<p>The PSO has had to cancel or reschedule concerts and events through April 29. Due to the financial strain caused by the cancelations the orchestra is asking listeners to consider donating tickets for a tax refund or exchanging tickets where possible. It is also providing full refunds or gift certificates for future events.&nbsp;The box office phone number is 412-392-4900.</p>
