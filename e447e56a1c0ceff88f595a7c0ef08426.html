<h1>Pine-Richland escapes Central Catholic rivalry game with overtime win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Central Catholic versus Pine-Richland is already established as one of the best rivalries in WPIAL football. Tuesday night, the bitter section rivals extended their mutual disdain to the hardwood.</p>
<p>With second place in Class 6A Section 1 at stake, the No. 5 Rams (14-6, 7-3) overcame a poor shooting night to escape from the Vikings’ cramped gymnasium with a hard-fought 54-45 overtime win.</p>
<p>Central Catholic (12-10, 5-5) tied the game on a free throw by Jack Cerkes with 4.2 seconds remaining in regulation, but the Vikings couldn’t get their shots to fall in the extra period, and Pine-Richland guard Jackson Sevco drained several clutch free throws to seal the game.</p>
<p>“Once we saw a couple [free throws] go in, it’s so contagious,” Rams coach Jeff Ackerman said. “You miss some, everyone misses them. You start making them, everyone makes them.</p>
<p>“Finally, in overtime, we started making our foul shots.”</p>
<p>Pine-Richland senior guard Kyle Polce and Central Catholic junior guard Anderson Cynkar led all scorers with 14 points apiece, though it was Polce who came up with a pair of big steals in overtime along with a fast-break layup to give the Rams some much-needed breathing room.</p>
<p>“They were doing the same thing the whole game, but they started rushing it more,” Polce said. “I was just reading the pass. They would always make the extra pass, so I jumped the extra pass and that’s when I got my steals.”</p>
<p>The Vikings have long been known as a football powerhouse, but haven’t made much noise in WPIAL basketball in recent years. First-year coach Brian Urso is doing his best to change that narrative, as Central Catholic already holds big wins versus defending WPIAL Class 6A champion Mt. Lebanon as well as a 78-69 win at Pine-Richland earlier this year.</p>
<p>As much as Urso would have loved to sweep the season series and take home a share of second place in the section, he understands how important moments like these are in the process of building a program.</p>
<p>“We still have a lot of basketball left to be played,” Urso said. “We know what we’re capable of. It’s time to tighten things up. It’s time to keep improving, getting better. I know that we can make a run at this.”</p>
<p>The Vikings started the game by jumping out to an 8-2 lead as the Rams struggled to get anything going on offense early. Pine-Richland started to find its groove late in the first quarter though, while Central Catholic’s offense went cold. The Rams used a 13-2 run to take a 15-10 lead in the second quarter, then took a 23-17 lead into the half.</p>
<p>Coming out of the break, seniors Collin O’Toole and Ben Sarsons ignited the Vikings’ offense as they traded two buckets each to put Central Catholic back on top. A 3-pointer by O’Toole capped a 13-0 run to give the Vikings a 30-23 advantage, but Pine-Richland slowly started clawing away at Central Catholic’s lead.</p>
<p>With the Vikings leading 34-29 going into the final quarter, senior guard Logan Murray made a tough driving layup and followed it up with an assist to Luke Shanahan to make it a one-point game. Then, with Central Catholic leading, 38-37, Pine-Richland senior Levi Wentz used his football instincts to intercept a pass and take it the other way for a go-ahead layup.</p>
<p>“I love it. These are the things I’m going to remember when I grow up,” Wentz said. “High school basketball, there’s nothing like it.”</p>
<p>The Vikings would tie the game on Cerkes’ free throw, but the Rams outscored Central Catholic 15-6 in overtime to come out of the raucous environment with a crucial victory.</p>
<p>“We wanted it, man. We wanted this game tonight,” Ackerman said. “We didn’t play well at our place. We knew that we let one get away at our place ... We were a little tentative at first, then finally we started to loosen up and play more aggressively.</p>
<p>“I’m just really proud that we grinded it tonight.”</p>
