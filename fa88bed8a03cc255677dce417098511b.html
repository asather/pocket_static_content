<h1>Giant Eagle announces $10 million bonus for employees working amid COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Giant Eagle on Saturday announced employees would receive $10 million in bonus pay as they work through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The bonus will go to employees from Giant Eagle stores as well as the company’s Market District, pharmacy&nbsp;and GetGo gas station locations. People working in warehouses and delivering products to stores will also receive bonus pay, according to a release from the company.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;O’Hara-based chain employs around 32,000 people across over 100 grocery stores, plus retail support centers and offices,&nbsp;according to the company’s website.</p>
<p>The bonus pay starts immediately, and will be extended back to March 15. A release from the company notes a&nbsp;May 2 end date is scheduled, but will be “reevaluated in the coming weeks based on the needs of the community.”</p>
<p>Current employees and new hires will both be eligible for the bonus as the company&nbsp;“continues hiring efforts,” the release says.</p>
<p>As layoffs continue due to business shutdowns and economic uncertainty amid the spread of the new, novel coronavirus, Giant Eagle has partnered with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Primanti Bros. to provide <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/03/20/layoffs-temporary-close-hiring-grocery-giant-eagle-walmart-dollar-tree-family-dollar-shop-n-save-covid-19-coronavirus/stories/202003200089" target="_blank">temporary work</a> to PPG Paints Arena workers and Primanti’s employees while event cancellations&nbsp;and restrictions on dine-in services continue.</p>
<p>Other chains such as Shop n’ Save, Walmart and Dollar General also announced they were increasing hiring efforts during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“As a company, we must continue to find ways to support our incredibly dedicated Team Members,”&nbsp;Laura Shapira Karet, Giant Eagle’s president and CEO, wrote in a press release. “Across all our communities every day, they are working tirelessly to keep families safe, healthy and fed.&nbsp;We cannot thank them enough. They are our heroes.”</p>
<p>Giant Eagle last week announced it was cutting hours across store locations due to an extraordinary surge in shopping as the COVID-19 pandemic expands across the region.</p>
