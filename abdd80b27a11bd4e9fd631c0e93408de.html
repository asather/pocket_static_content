<p>According to the park’s Facebook post, guests will still be able to visit the park in the fall, but with limited hours. The park will be open Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays from October 2 through November 1.</p>
<p>Currently, Kennywood still plans on holding the Pierogi Fest on Sunday, Sept. 7 and the Holiday Lights festival that runs from November 27 until December 20.</p>
