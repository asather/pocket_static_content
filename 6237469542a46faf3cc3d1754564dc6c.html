<h1>Butler rallies for another dramatic overtime win, outlasts Central Dauphin, 93-90</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Butler did it.</p>
<p>Again.</p>
<p>In what has become a common theme in the postseason, Butler found itself on the brink of elimination before pulling out an overtime win. The latest installment was a 93-90 win Saturday against Central Dauphin in a PIAA Class 6A first-round game in front of a large crowd at North Allegheny.</p>
<p>It was Butler’s third overtime win in its last four games. The Golden Tornado trailed Peters Township by five with less than 30 seconds left in overtime in the WPIAL quarterfinals. They ended up winning in double-overtime. The Golden Tornado then trailed Upper St. Clair by five with less than 40 seconds left in regulation before winning in overtime in the semifinals.</p>
<p>Now, one game after beating Mt. Lebanon to win its first WPIAL championship in 29 years, Butler (21-4) added another heart-thumping win, this time rallying from five down with 30 seconds left in regulation to advance to Wednesday’s second round, where it will again face Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>“It was the same thing as the first two playoff games,” Butler’s Ethan Morton said. “We bought ourselves another four minutes with overtime. We thought we could get the job done.”</p>
<p>Butler coach Matt Clement added: “This has been the M.O. since the playoffs started for us. I think we built up this mental toughness and this grit, and we just figured things out as we’ve gone along. Add in the Ethan injury today and him having four fouls, I just give the kids credit. They’re not ready to go home yet.”</p>
<p>That’s right, Morton, Butler’s all-everything senior point guard, picked up his fourth foul with 4:02 left in regulation and then came down awkwardly on his right ankle about a minute later. He stayed in the game, and even on a night where he didn’t do much scoring, still finished with a triple-double (and near quadruple-double) — 13 points, 16 rebounds, 10 assists and 7 blocked shots.</p>
<p>But this is a game that featured some gigantic performances on both sides, including three players who scored at least 30 points. Devin Carney, Butler’s sweet-shooting sophomore guard, scored 39 points. Central Dauphin’s Ryan Smith scored 35 points and teammate Rance Russo added 30. This was a terrific effort by the Rams (22-7), the fifth-place finisher out of District 3, who needed to win two consolation games just to qualify for the PIAA playoffs.</p>
<p>“If you told me that [before the game], I would have said we would win by 20,” Central Dauphin coach Wayne Fletcher said of his two players scoring 30-plus.</p>
<p>Central Dauphin led for about all but three minutes of regulation, the exception being Butler’s 5-0 run to start the game. Smith’s basket a minute into the fourth quarter gave the Rams a double-digit lead, 59-48. But Butler didn’t fold, slowly chipping away. Russo made two free throws to put Central Dauphin ahead, 79-74, with 30 seconds left. Mason Montag then nailed a 3-pointer to cut the Butler deficit to three with 22 seconds left.</p>
<p>Butler sophomore Raine Gratzmiller followed with the game’s biggest defensive play, taking a charge against Smith that gave Butler the ball back with 20 seconds remaining.</p>
<p>“That was a gigantic play,” Clement said. “That took a lot for a sophomore to do that in that situation.”</p>
<p>Carney misfired on a 3-pointer, but Mattix Clement, son of the coach, collected the rebounded and was fouled with 8.5 seconds left and Butler trailing, 79-77.</p>
<p>“As a coach, you’re nervous. And as a dad, you’re like 50 times more nervous,” Matt Clement said.</p>
<p>First shot good. Second shot good. Tie game.</p>
<p>Russo threw up a shot with two seconds left, but it was long, forcing overtime.</p>
<p>Central Dauphin scored the first two points of overtime, but Montag responded with another big 3-pointer to put Butler ahead, 82-81. The Golden Tornado led the rest of the way, their lead growing to as large as five. Carney scored eight points in the extra period, when he was 6 of 6 from the free-throw line. Montag missed two free throws with 0.2 seconds left, and Central Dauphin didn’t have enough time to put up a final shot.</p>
<p>Carney, who made six 3-pointers, scored 33 of his points in the second half and overtime.</p>
<p>“It’s just awesome to see,” Morton said. “He’s just such a great player and can score at will, and that’s the kind of games we need out of him.”</p>
<p>Carney’s performance was huge considering Central Dauphin did a fine job limiting Morton’s scoring. Morton had just three points through three quarters and was limited to two field goals in the game.</p>
<p>“We knew that if we could just make him work, get hands in the way, and get some longer guys on him, we could have success against him. And it created a situation where we had an overtime game,” Fletcher said.</p>
<p>Mattix Clement finished with 15 points and Montag had 12.</p>
<p>Afterward, Morton had an ice pack nestled against his ankle, but said he knows the pain could be much worse.</p>
<p>Said Morton: “It feels a lot better than if we had lost.”</p>
