<h1>Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership wants public input on proposed mobility principles for Golden Triangle</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership announced Wednesday it has developed six proposed principles to guide development of its Downtown Pittsburgh Mobility Plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Now it wants the public to weigh in on whether those are the right principles to follow in an <a title="Downtown Pittsburgh Partnerhsip survey" href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/PDPPrinciplesandGoals" target="_blank">online survey</a> through May 15.</p>
<p>The year-long study is designed to recommend immediate changes to improve how everyone uses the streets in the Golden Triangle, including improving pedestrian access, increasing transit and reducing the number of single-occupancy vehicles in the central business district. It is being paid for through a $1 million grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation, and the city, Port Authority and Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission are participating in the project.</p>
<p>The six proposed guiding principles are:</p>
<p>▪ Keeping Downtown welcoming and vibrant by providing clean, well-lit streets, improving access to the waterfront and adding more programming in parks and on trails and increasing pubic art.</p>
<p>▪ Improving walkability and transit, especially at night, through better lighting and more service, respectively.</p>
<p>▪ Making Downtown equitable and affordable for everyone by improving sidewalks and crosswalks, providing free transit transfers and offering better&nbsp;curb access for transit, paratransit, rideshare operations and for those with mobility needs.</p>
<p>▪ Improving wayfinding signs for pedestrians and offering easier directions to parking options for motorists.</p>
<p>▪ Reducing carbon emissions and encouraging more green infrastructure and stormwater solutions.</p>
<p>▪ Maintaining the area’s regional focus and national competitiveness by improving regional transit access and encouraging more people to live Downtown.</p>
<p>“We know that everyone wants a great experience getting to and around Downtown” Chris Watts, the agency’s vice president for mobility, said in a news release. “The survey on Guiding Principles and Goals will help define priorities, and ultimately determine projects, that will move Downtown closer to its potential while balancing the many needs of a city on-the-move.”</p>
<p>The 26-page study is available at the <a title="PDP mbiity study" href="https://downtownpittsburgh.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/DPMP-Issues-Opportunities-Report-April-2020-1.pdf" target="_blank">PDP website</a>.</p>
<p>The partnership expects to have final recommendations available before the end of summer.</p>
