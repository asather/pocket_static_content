<h1>City schools prioritize student engagement as remote learning begins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools will begin remote instruction for high school seniors on Thursday, but many challenges lie ahead for Pennsylvania’s second-largest school district.</p>
<p>Efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 also will force the district to make many changes, including holding a virtual commencement ceremony for graduating students.</p>
<p>“I’ve had the opportunity to engage with some of our seniors this week as we distributed laptops to them, and while many are understandably disappointed with what the pandemic has brought for senior year, I was encouraged by their spirit and commitment to a strong finish,” Superintendent Anthony Hamlet said Wednesday during a video conference with reporters. “We, too, in PPS are committed to finishing the school year strong.”</p>

<p>The district will continue to roll out remote instruction to other grade levels over the course of the next week. In the plan, which will be published Friday on the district’s website, expectations for students and teachers will remain high. The district wants student engagement and teacher feedback to be a priority.</p>
<p>Even as the school district initiates remote learning, it still needs to submit its plan to the state Department of Education for approval. But Minika Jenkins, the district’s chief academic officer, said that the state will focus on “guidance and support” rather than approving or disapproving the plan.</p>
<p>David May-Stein, the district’s chief of school performance, said that administrators discussed moving to various grading systems, such as pass/fail or no credit.&nbsp; They were concerned, however, that a pass/fail-type system would lower a student’s level of participation and engagement if they feel they did not have to put forth the same amount of effort to get an “A,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Jenkins, though, said that teachers should provide meaningful feedback so that struggling students can improve rather than rushing to assess a failing grade.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The ultimate goal right now is to support students with learning and to engage students in not trying to have that punitive grade, but to really look at that meaningful feedback,” Ms. Jenkins said.</p>
<p>With engagement being such a key piece of the plan, the district asked home-room teachers to try to contact all of the students on their rosters. The district’s student services department will look into students who cannot be reached and find out what additional resources their families need to help support remote learning.</p>
<p>“One of the things that we’ve learned over the course of the last four weeks is that families that already have challenges, these challenges have been multiplied tenfold,” Mr. May-Stein said.&nbsp;“Our counselors, our social workers, our student service assistants who are school-based will work directly with teachers, principals and assistant principals to help support students remotely.”</p>
<p>Some students may face difficulties engaging because they still do not have access to a digital device. The district purchased 5,000 laptops that it added to its stockpile of 2,500, and it received hundreds more through donations.</p>
<p>Ted Dwyer — chief of data, research, evaluation and assessment for the Pittsburgh Public Schools — said the district may need as many as 10,000 more devices.&nbsp;The district is distributing work packets to students who do not have access to a device.</p>
<p>Accommodations are also being made for students with special needs and English language learners. The district will provide tele-therapy, will continue mental health and psychological services and may loan equipment for physical and occupational therapy.</p>
<p>Like much of its instruction, the district said its commencements will be held virtually. Mr. May-Stein said the district has a team of employees working to make the ceremonies&nbsp;“as special and unique as possible” for graduating seniors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s very upsetting for kids who were expecting to have commencements at the end of the year,” Mr. May-Stein said. “We’re working with principals, other central office staff and school activity directors so that we’re able to provide an amazing virtual experience that will highlight who our high school seniors are and what their stories are as they get ready for [what’s] next.”</p>
