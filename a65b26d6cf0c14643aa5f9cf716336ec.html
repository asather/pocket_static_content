<h1>Nothing but fresh air separates seniors and their families</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Hi Mom!” “We love you!” “We miss you!” family members cried Friday as they got to see and talk to residents of Norbert Personal Care Home with only fresh air between them.</p>
<p>Though most of Western Pennsylvania has entered the green phase of COVID-19 restrictions, the rules are still strict at long-term care facilities. Since March, families have not been able to get close to loved ones at the facility in Overbrook without a barrier in between. That changed with Friday’s socially-distanced parade and picnic.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">“Her hair is so long I could cry,” said Lynette DiBernardo, of Dormont,&nbsp;when she saw her sister, Andrea Malak, 58.</span></p>
<p>Ms. DiBernardo, a hairdresser, usually cuts her sister’s hair at Norbert, but she hasn’t been able to because all nursing homes were ordered closed to visitors in March.</p>
<p>“It’s difficult because we're not there,” said another sister, Mary DiBernardo.&nbsp;“But what matters is they’re safe.”</p>
<p>Residents were rolled out into the parking lot in wheelchairs as their families waved and cheered. Cars were decorated and lined up for a parade in front of the personal care home. Musician Bill Mancini performed and packaged snacks were served to guests.</p>
<p>Karen Suchy, of Baldwin Borough, cried when she saw her mother, Betty Milinski, 94.</p>
<p>“I just want to make sure she is OK.&nbsp; I’m sad I can’t go over and give her a hug.”</p>
<p>After the parade, people parked their cars in the lot with an empty space between each car and visited with loved ones from 6 feet away. It was clear the residents were as thrilled as their visitors.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Ruschel, of Bethel Park, said she used to visit her uncle at Norbert every two or three days.&nbsp;“He just didn’t understand why we weren’t there,” she said.</p>
<p>Laverne Rudolph, 70, said it makes her sad not to see her family. She asks about her brother every day, according to Sharon Micklege, a nurse with Gallagher Home Care.</p>
<p>Dan Hart, of Kilbuck, came to visit his friend, Lyle, a fellow veteran. They usually visit once a week.</p>
<p>“I usually pick him up some treats and things,” Mr. Hart said. “I would pick him up and take him over to the Jewish Community Center so he could exercise. I think he misses being able to go out. He doesn’t have much family around here.”</p>
<p>Administrator Janet Torregrosso came up with the idea for the parade and picnic.</p>
<p>“We wanted to give people the opportunity to see their relatives without glass and not on a phone in a 6-inch square,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Torregrosso said that Norbert has had no COVID-19 cases at any of its six long-term care facilities in the state. The Overbrook location has almost 80 residents and 43 staff members. She said the staff would like to do this again and possibly try it at other facilities.</p>
<p><span style="background-color: #ffffff;">Gary Briggs, of Baldwin Borough,&nbsp;came with his girlfriend Friday to visit with his parents, who both live at Norbert.</span></p>
<p>“My dad would sing,” he said of his father, George, who will be 95 in August.</p>
