<h1>Mars Area schools to let superintendent go</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mars Area School Board Tuesday voted to notify Superintendent Wesley Shipley that his contract will not be renewed in June.</p>
<p>“It is now time for a new board, with a mix of newly elected and senior members, to reset for the future,” said John Kennedy, board president.</p>
<p>Mr. Shipley has been superintendent since 2015. Last year, the board gave him a one-year extension since a majority of board seats were up for election, and four of the five incumbents chose not to run again.</p>
<p>“The board recognized the fact that there were five positions up for election and we were going to have new members,” said Tom King, district solicitor. “This action indicates that the new board intends to proceed in a different direction.”</p>
<p>The vote to not renew Mr. Shipley’s contract passed 8-1 with Christine Valenta dissenting.</p>
<p>Board members announced that they have begun the process of finding a superintendent search firm, which will conduct a nationwide search for a new superintendent.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to name a successor superintendent before the end of the school year. In terms of the search process, the board intends to keep the community and the staff updated of key milestones, including opportunities for providing input and sharing feedback,” said Rita Dorsch, board vice president. “We are going to try to navigate this transition as positively and as best as we can.”</p>
<p>Prior to joining Mars Area, Mr. Shipley was superintendent of the Shaler Area School District for four years and was assistant superintendent there for two years.</p>
<p>He replaced James Budzilek, who resigned after serving as superintendent for less than one year. Previously, the district was helmed by William Pettigrew for 26 years. He retired in 2013, and then served on the school board from 2014-19.</p>
<p>The board also authorized Elizabeth McMahon to begin a search for an interim principal at Mars Area Primary Center, where she is currently serving as the acting principal, in addition to her duties as assistant superintendent.</p>
<p>A full-time principal for the primary center will be on board for the 2020-21 school year.</p>
