<h1>Jake Guentzel back on the ice as Penguins begin Phase 2</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a word, Dec. 30, 2019, was a “whirlwind” for Penguins forward Jake Guentzel.</p>
<p>The day began on a high note, when the 25-year-old winger learned he had been named to his first All-Star game. It was a well-earned honor. At the time, Guentzel was leading the club in scoring and was right on pace for a second consecutive 40-goal season.</p>
<p>“I still remember calling my parents,” Guentzel said on Wednesday during a conference call with Pittsburgh-area reporters. “They couldn’t believe it, to be honest with you.”</p>
<p>Who would have believed what would happen next?</p>
<p>During the Penguins’ 5-2 win over the Ottawa Senators, just hours after the All-Star announcement, Guentzel was racing at full speed. As he extended his stick to tip a creative pass from Evgeni Malkin into the net for his 20th goal of the season, Guentzel’s skates got tangled with Thomas Chabot. He flew head-first into the boards.</p>
<p>“It could have been a lot worse,” Guentzel said, speaking publicly about the injury for the first time. “It was kind of a scary situation. Obviously accidental. But it’s kind of a broken play and two guys hit skates. I just happened to be that close to the boards.</p>
<p>“I’m glad my neck got out of the way and head got out of the way. Not good. But I was pretty lucky it was just a shoulder.”</p>
<p>Guentzel underwent significant shoulder surgery soon after the collision. Initially, the Penguins estimated he would be sidelined four-to-six months. At that point, it was fair to wonder if Guentzel’s 2019-20 season might have ended that night at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>However, when the COVID-19 pandemic forced the NHL to pause the season, it came with a very slim silver lining. Those nearly three months – and counting – have significantly flipped the odds of Guentzel contributing to a playoff run.</p>
<p>He’s been skating for several weeks now, as the NHL has permitted injured players to return to the ice during their rehab. And on Tuesday, he was part of the group of Penguins who participated in voluntary, player-run skates as the league enters Phase 2 of the return to play plan.</p>
<p>“I’m getting better every day,” Guentzel said. “Just sticking to the protocol and what I’ve got to do. If we start playing, hopefully I’ll be ready by then. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>Media members are not permitted to observe or attend Phase 2. However, in videos and photos supplied by the Penguins, Guentzel appeared to skate in a group with Sidney Crosby, John Marino, Brian Dumoulin and goalie Casey DeSmith. Evgeni Malkin, Bryan Rust, Jack Johnson and Jared McCann were also among the players photographed at UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. Several more players also participated.</p>
<p>The Phase 2 skates are designed to give players a chance to get their hands back into form and their legs into shape. The next step will be Phase 3, a formal training camp period. These camps aren’t scheduled to begin until mid-July, at the earliest, and will last about three weeks.</p>
<p>Guentzel’s participation in these non-contact practices is an encouraging sign for the Penguins. And the timeline for a possible return should continue to bolster Guentzel’s chances of playing in the postseason. Consider that July 1will be six months since the surgery and the NHL likely won’t return until August at the earliest.</p>
<p>“I’m committed to working hard and strengthening the shoulder as much as I can,” Guentzel said. “I’m trying to get back to pre-injury [level] as much as I can. There’s always that doubt. You never know what’s going to happen with an injury, any sort of injury. I’m committed to putting myself in the best possible position that I can.”</p>
<p>While it looks increasingly likely that Guentzel will play this postseason, where he plays remains a question. Chances are, coach Mike Sullivan will reunite Guentzel with Crosby. But there are plenty of options with Jason Zucker now in the fold.</p>
<p>During the call, Guetnzel was asked about the possibility that the Penguins could add Conor Sheary to the Crosby-Guentzel tandem to recreate a line that helped hoist the Cup not too long ago.</p>
<p>“Obviously my first year we had a lot of fun playing together,” Guentzel said. “It was kind of cool that ‘Sid and the Kids’ got a little name going around. ... It would be an awesome experience again. We really feed off each other. We know each other’s games. If we have that opportunity, we’ll hopefully have some time to get some chemistry back.”</p>
