<h1>Restaurant, gig workers join AG Shapiro to discuss unemployment payment disparities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Her savings dwindling, Pittsburgh bartender Lisa Guerrero turned to unemployment as a lifeline this week, but was denied.</p>
<p>It’s a story shared by thousands of service workers in Pennsylvania’s restaurant industry and gig economy who have lost their jobs, temporarily or permanently,&nbsp;as a result of COVID-19’s economic impact — workers who&nbsp;are in need of immediate financial assistance but have been given little, thanks to their $2.83 per hour base wage and an unemployment system that hasn’t adapted to it.</p>
<p>“I’ve reached the end of my savings and I’m now waiting for my tax return and the fabled stimulus check to hopefully give me some kind of a cushion until we find out when we can go back to work,” Ms. Guerrero said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Ms. Guerrero, who was temporarily displaced from her job on March 16, said she’s been&nbsp;“living frugally” off the little in her savings since then, but was not approved for unemployment because she was evaluated as having no income two of the past five quarters — the period of time between when she moved to Pittsburgh and when she found her job in May of last year.</p>

<p>Without any financial help from her restaurant, Ms. Guerrero has turned to assistance from the nonprofit One Fair Wage, who sent her a $214 relief check recently which she’s already spent on food. But she — and others from the advocacy organization, as well as Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro — insisted on Wednesday that if tipped workers were paid a fair wage to begin with, they’d have been in a better position to get through the coronavirus crisis on their savings.</p>
<p>Instead, they’re struggling to pay their bills, and any money they receive from unemployment insurance is calculated on their $2.83 base wage plus tips that are often under-reported, the advocates said in a virtual town hall —&nbsp;focused on urging government stakeholders to act now to ensure that tipped workers are paid and protected fairly by their employers now and after the pandemic is over.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, thousands have lost their jobs in the restaurant industry, on top of many more job losses in other service sectors, said&nbsp;One Fair Wage president Saru Jayaraman.</p>
<p>Nearly 3,600 service workers in Pennsylvania have applied for direct cash relief from the organization’s emergency fund, Ms. Jayaraman said, joining about 121,000 workers nationwide seeking assistance from the $8.5 million pool of money. Of that pool, $200,000 is for Pennsylvania workers, doled out to those who need it most, including workers who don’t have access to unemployment insurance.</p>
<p>Ms. Jayaraman said service workers needed a fair wage long before COVID-19, and although they want to get back to work and see the pandemic come to an end, they don’t want to return to a system that exploited them.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What we needed long before coronavirus is that every worker in the state of Pennsylvania, whether they’re a restaurant worker or a gig worker, be paid a full livable minimum wage from their employer with tips on top,” Ms. Jayaraman said. “If that had happened, if that law, which was moving through the state legislature, had passed prior to coronavirus, then people would be getting unemployment insurance based on a higher wage.”</p>
<p>Given the opportunity to ask questions to the attorney general, the service workers were most concerned about being able to afford their utilities and car payments. Mr. Shapiro encouraged people to reach out to their utilities and let them know about their inability to pay, but said their utilities can not be shut off during the disaster declaration.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro also talked of his efforts to urge banks across Pennsylvania to institute 90-day grace periods for mortgages and other consumer loans, including auto loans, and relief from fees and charges — as well as a moratorium on vehicle repossession and foreclosure. He said more than 10 banks have signed on, including PNC.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro, who briefed service workers about his office’s efforts to stop price gouging and to halt residential evictions, said it’s time for the state legislature to act on securing a $15 per hour minimum wage.</p>
<p>The fight for $15, he said, should continue long after the pandemic is over.</p>
