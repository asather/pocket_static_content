<h1>‘Go see the girls’: Family restaurant making meals for Pittsburgh school kids as industry rallies to help</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three years ago, when Beth Talarico was a waitress at Enrico’s in the Strip District, a customer told her she was having her “last supper” because she was about to begin treatments for breast cancer.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘When you beat this thing, find me and we’ll celebrate together.’ ”</p>
<p>That woman, Mary Brunner-Ferrese, did beat cancer, and she did eventually find Beth and her older sister, Katie, more than a year later at the sisters’ own restaurant, Piazza Talarico on Liberty Avenue in Lawrenceville.</p>
<p>“I said, ‘Does this mean you beat it?’ She said yes. We all had a glass of Pinot Grigio and have been friends since.”</p>
<p>The three women have banded together to make hundreds of meals this week for Pittsburgh Public Schools children and others, with the help of the Talarico’s parents and donations from friends and their many restaurant connections.</p>
<p>“Mary came to us and said there’s a lot of schools that are closing and these kids don't always know where their next meal is coming from. Sometimes their only square meal each day is at school,” Beth Talarico said.</p>
<p>The restaurant still is selling its house wine to go, but it’s otherwise closed, so they turned it into a staging area, and have been working almost non-stop.</p>
<p>“We put it on social media that we’d be a drop-off point for perishable and non-perishable goods, and any restaurants in the area that had products that they weren’t gonna use, we would take that, too, and give it a purpose — whatever we could do,” she said.</p>
<p>Donations of goods and money came in and they started full-swing on Tuesday, creating care packages and making food.</p>
<p>“We started making pasta,” she said. “We made 50 individual pasta dinners, and one of Mary’s teacher friends came and picked it all up and took it to a PPS dropoff. We called 412 Food Rescue and they picked up 20 pounds of prepared pasta — that's about 100 dinners — that they took it to a senior high-rise in the Hill.</p>
<p>“We work with Nino Sunseri in the Strip through Penn Mac, and one of his drivers told him what we were doing.” Nino called Rick Carrozzi, the general manager at Bella Notte Pizzeria, which Sunseri family owns, she continued. “And he said, ‘Go see the girls. The girls need some help. Give them anything that you were going to get rid of or don't know what to do with.’&nbsp;“</p>
<p>The women went to Bella Notte at 9 a.m. Thursday and, “He had produce, he had 80 portions of meats for their Italian Stallion hoagie. We split them in half and made it into 150 donations. They had cooked chicken, sausage, steak meat, 12 cases of cookies that didn’t get used for the St. Patrick's Day Parade,” Beth Talarico continued.</p>
<p>“My car was completely full. I thought I was just going to get bread or some produce that wasn’t going to go on a pizza.”</p>
<p>Katie Talarico chimed in,&nbsp;“She opened the trunk of the car and we just teared up. This has been harder than regular jobs, but it blew up into something we couldn't expect.”</p>
<p>Larry Lagatutta at Enrico’s has been making bread and donating it to their efforts, as has Breadworks. On Friday, Ross Sunseri donated 200 extra large pepperoni rolls, which are meals unto themselves.</p>
<p>Amidst all of this, the Talarico sisters are still trying for their restaurant to survive as a small business. Next week — provided they are still allowed to by the state -- they will sell takeout and take-and-make pizza and kits with their sauces, dough and pastas. But they will not stop making free meals.</p>
<p>“This is a really uncertain time but it's still bringing the community together,” Beth Talarico said.</p>
<p>The Talaricos are among many making in the service industry doing similar things to keep people fed and offer comfort as the COVID-19 crisis continues.</p>

<p>A sampling:</p>
<p>• Starting Friday night at The Warren and Penn Cove Eatery in Downtown Pittsburgh, began distributing 100 meals and grocery bags to service industry workers, most of whom are already out of work because of the crisis.</p>
<p>“We’re doing this every day until we can’t do it anymore,” owner Spencer Warren said.</p>
<p>He said they’ve fielded donations from Juniper Grill, Point Brugge and Atria’s, and chefs from Meat &amp; Potatoes and Bar Marco will help prepare the meals.</p>
<p>• At Mercurio’s, a family-owned pizza and gelato shop in Shadyside, they are soliciting $10 donations via their website, and for each one they receive they’ll provide one pizza and one pint of gelato to be given to healthcare workers at UPMC St. Margaret, UPMC Shadyside and West Penn hospitals, to be delivered on March 23. After just a day, they’d received 120 donations.</p>
<p>A post on the restaurant’s Facebook page read: “We appreciate you all so much. Our purpose is to feed people delicious food. Thank you for helping us do that, keeping us busy during these pretty depressing times, and providing a sense of normalcy to our day.”</p>
<p>• Beginning Monday, Yoli’s Cucina in Jefferson Hills is donating lunches daily to&nbsp;“groups that are still working under these conditions” including medical professionals, grocery store employees, gas station clerks, emergency employees and postal workers. Their first donation today will be to emergency room staff at Jefferson Hospital.</p>
<p>• Peoples Indian Restaurant in Garfield is “humbly extending a helping hand to its neighbors who may be in need. If you aren’t able to get a meal, or you have a child that you aren’t able to get a meal for, please call us at 412-661-3160 and we will have a to-go lunch box of chicken curry, chickpeas and rice available for you to pick up.” Pick up is available from 11:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Monday through Saturday, and patrons are asked to call ahead “so we can minimize contact.”</p>
<p>• Dancing Crab Thai Noodle House on the South Side has been preparing meals of chicken fried rice for the Wellspring Drop-In Center on Watson Street, Uptown. Wellspring serves homeless and food-insecure populations in the city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>• Last Wednesday, Chef Phill Milton prepared 100 to-go barbecue meals for service industry workers at the Smallman Galley in the Strip District, and he will do that again this week.</p>
<p>• On Monday, Oakmont Bakery will endeavor t<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/east/2020/03/20/Oakmont-Bakery-Oakmont-Deli-Harrison-Bird-Dog-s-Bar-and-Grill-COVID-19-Oakmont-Police/stories/202003200108" target="_blank">o give away 10,000 free sandwiches</a>.</p>
<p>• Pizza Parma on Liberty Ave., Downtown is giving free pizza to any and all first responders that want one.</p>
<p>• The ownership of Napa Prime Chophouse and Off the Hook, both in Pittsburgh’s northern suburbs,&nbsp;put together meal kits ready to make pasta, chicken pot pie, and hamburgers to help the employees out of work at both of their restaurants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>• On Thursday, Square Cafe in Regent Square, along with Monteverde’s Produce in Thornburg,&nbsp;gave away 3,000 pounds of produce and was back at it again on Friday. Monteverde’s donated the produce and Square Cafe displayed it on their sidewalk so that anyone, no questions asked, could come and take what they felt they needed.</p>
<p>“These times are hard and we know a lot of you are struggling, but we are in this together,” the Cafe’s Facebook statement read. “We will be monitoring safe distances so you can pick up your FREE produce quickly and safely. Please take advantage of this if you need food or have been put in a financial pinch. … We love you. Stay safe. Stay fed!”</p>
