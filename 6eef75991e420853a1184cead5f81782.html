<h1>New Giants coach Joe Judge ready to measure up with Steelers, Mike Tomlin?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The talk of New York is the tall task awaiting Joe Judge, the first-year head coach of the team with the worst record in the NFL over the past three seasons.</p>
<p>That could go for the course of the entire 2020 campaign, but also for Week 1 specifically, when the New York Giants and Judge face the third-longest tenured coach in the NFL in Mike Tomlin. A franchise with three head coaches in five years will waste no time measuring itself against one of the league’s models of consistency and stability, this in a season when the Steelers are hungry to rebound from two consecutive winters without playoff football.</p>
<p>“To play the Steelers, it’s important for our players and coaches to understand the tradition and the culture that’s in their DNA,” Judge said this week. “They’re a tough team from a tough city. They have a blue-collar mentality.”</p>
<p>The third-youngest coach in the NFL at 38, Judge is wise enough to know the inherent traits of being a Steeler. But as a first-time head coach at any level, one who has spent the past 11 years working for Nick Saban and Bill Belichick, the pride of Lansdale Catholic High School just outside Philadelphia did his damnedest to make an impression in his inaugural training camp.</p>
<p>First, he took last names <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/08/17/joe-judge-follows-bill-belichicks-lead-on-keeping-names-off-practice-jerseys/" target="_blank">off the back of the practice jerseys</a>, a coaching tactic as old as time. Then there were the laps players — and coaches — had to run <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/17/giants-run-laps-as-joe-judge-sets-new-tone/" target="_blank">if they made a mental mistake</a>. After that it was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/no-holds-allowed-giants-d-bs-practicing-with-tennis-balls-taped-to-hands-to-prevent-penalties-014212829.html#:~:text=New%20York%20Giants%20coach%20Joe,Dan%20Duggan%20of%20The%20Athletic." target="_blank">taping tennis balls</a> to the hands of defensive backs, so they wouldn’t commit penalties holding receivers. Just a case of the new guy trying to change the culture early on, right?</p>
<p>By late August, Judge made headlines by suggesting he might remove the red no-contact jersey from second-year quarterback Daniel Jones, last year’s sixth overall pick, to <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/joe-judge-considering-having-daniel-jones-practice-sans-red-jersey-we-ll-pop-his" target="_blank">“pop his pads a little bit.”</a> There was a bellowing tirade directed at his players the <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/08/17/joe-judge-taking-no-prisoners-in-giants-culture-shock/" target="_blank">first day of padded practice</a>, then again this Thursday <a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29854649/new-york-giants-coach-joe-judge-rips-team-effort-restarts-practice" target="_blank">after 30 sluggish minutes</a>, just four days before Giants-Steelers on “Monday Night Football.”</p>
<p>“That was definitely the first time [I’ve seen that],” linebacker Blake Martinez said of Judge starting over practice from the beginning. “But it was really cool how everybody took it in a positive way. It wasn’t like, ‘Ah, here we go, why are we doing this?’ It was, ‘Hey, this is what we need to fix, we need to make sure we get this right.’”</p>
<p><strong>Chaos vs. continuity</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Pittsburgh, Judge’s first coaching opponent can surely relate to his rookie counterpart. In 2007, there was a first-time head coach (at any level) taking the reins as a 34-year-old, the second-youngest coach in the NFL. By the time summer rolled around, he was being called out by players, publicly and privately, for running a grueling camp.</p>
<p>A veteran team that finished 8-8 the year before and had become accustomed to Bill Cowher’s way of doing things for a decade and a half. The new boss implemented less time off and permitted more hitting, because he’d rather say “whoa” than “sic’em.”</p>
<p>“He put us through a hard camp,” veteran defensive end Brett Keisel said in 2007. “I think coming in as a first-year coach you kind of need to do that and see which guys you have on board and which guys are going to fall by the wayside. It was a tough camp, but we made it.”</p>
<p>These current Steelers have made it, too, but in a different sense. They’ve made it to Week 1 almost entirely healthy and in good shape, with just one player expected to miss the game because of injury in right guard David DeCastro. One of just three teams who didn't have anyone opt out due to COVID-19 concerns, the Steelers have been at full strength from the beginning, and to a man the players have said Tomlin was smart about keeping them fresh for the real thing.</p>
<p>Across the way, the Giants have already placed six players on injured reserve, including safety Xavier McKinney, this year’s second-round pick, and linebacker David Mayo, last year’s second-leading tackler. This after Nate Solder, slated to be the left tackle, and Sam Beal, a candidate to start at cornerback, opted out at the start of camp. There’s also the curious case of cornerback Deandre Baker, the 30th overall pick in 2019 who was waived Tuesday after an offseason arrest for armed robbery and aggravated assault.</p>
<p>On the North Shore and the South Side, there have been no such distractions, and no shortage of days off for rest from grizzled veterans like Maurkice Pouncey to young ones like JuJu Smith-Schuster.</p>
<p>“Very simply put, this team defines continuity in professional sports,” Judge said of the Steelers.</p>
<p><strong>Going in blind</strong></p>
<p>While the Giants have had plenty go wrong leading up to this season, and the Steelers have had nearly everything go right, there is one area in which Judge may enjoy an advantage of sorts.</p>
<p>With Tomlin and the Steelers, you know what you’re going to get. That’s nine starters back on defense and an offense that will again be led by Ben Roethlisberger, with whom even a casual football fan is familiar. With zero preseason film and a coaching staff from various backgrounds, the Giants will never be able to rely on the element of surprise quite like they can this week.</p>
<p>“There’s more definitive speculation when you face a group that has continuity, particularly continuity among key decision-makers on the coaching staff,” Tomlin said Tuesday. “To be quite honest with you, it is going to be easier for Joe Judge and company to forecast what our ball is going to be on offense and defense and special teams because of that continuity.”</p>
<p>Judge told the Post-Gazette he has “years and years of tape to watch” on Roethlisberger to account for not seeing him but for six quarters in 2019. He also expects new quarterbacks coach Matt Canada to bring some new wrinkles to the offense, though, and isn't necessarily buying what Tomlin’s selling on their different challenges in preparation.</p>
<p>Unlike most head coaches in the NFL, Judge doesn't exactly have a definitive offensive or defensive background. He’s never been an offensive or defensive coordinator, instead serving as the Patriots’ special teams coordinator the past five years under Belichick (though he did also coach the receivers last season). Judge won't call the offensive or defensive plays for the Giants because he’s “not there to micromanage.”</p>
<p>He hired Jason Garrett, the Cowboys head coach from 2010 through last season, to run his offense and handed the defense to Patrick Graham, who was the Dolphins’ coordinator on that side of the ball last year. The Steelers have had to do their due diligence on both of those guys, in addition to the Giants of 2019 under fired coach Pat Shurmur.</p>
<p>“You can study enough tape of our coordinators and our systems. You can look into my history and get an idea of what it’s going to be like,” Judge said. “I’d say the only advantage is going to be the team that comes out there and plays physically and sound on Monday night.”</p>
<p><strong>It’s a small world</strong></p>
<p>If it sounds to you like Judge and Tomlin would be fast friends, you're probably right. After all, Judge has long admired the Super Bowl-winning coach 10 years his senior.</p>
<p>Judge’s first job in the business was as a graduate assistant at Mississippi State in 2005 to special teams coach Amos Jones, who was on staff with Tomlin at the University of Cincinnati in the late 1990s. So it wasn't unusual for Tomlin to call up Jones, who’d occasionally have Judge answer and tell him “talk to Mike for a minute.” Just a couple years later, Tomlin became head coach of the Steelers and took Jones along with him.</p>
<p>“To be honest with you, I immediately became a Steelers fan,” Judge remembered.</p>
<p>Before he knew it, Judge was visiting Pittsburgh to “tag along” and see Tomlin run an NFL practice. He’d later get the chance to sit and be a “fly on the wall” with Tomlin at the annual scouting combine, “and have dinner on his check.”</p>
<p>“I know Mike has those guys practicing and playing aggressive,” Judge said. “That’s just the way he is in-person. … He was always very open for a conversation, very open to share some advice when it came up. I have a lot of respect for him as a person. I have a lot of respect for him as a coach. He’s done tremendous things in his career.”</p>
<p>This time a year ago, Tomlin was getting ready for a season-opening matchup with Belichick on a Sunday night. Now he’s facing off with an apple who seemingly hasn't fallen far from the Belichick tree, and there’s pressure on both sides to a certain degree.</p>
<p>Perhaps Judge even learned a thing or two and filed it away for the future when he caught a glimpse of those early Camp Tomlin days at Saint Vincent.</p>
<p>“The approach that this team has taken and the response that we have taken to coach Judge's methods has been great,” said star running back Saquon Barkley, voted a team captain. “Obviously we're a young team and there is going to be some adversity we're going to face throughout the season. There is going to be some adversity we're going to face on Monday night. But it's the way that we respond, the way we continue to come to work and improve every single day."</p>
