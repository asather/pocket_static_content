<h1>Self-employed, gig workers can now file for unemployment compensation in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many Pennsylvania residents who were not previously eligible for unemployment compensation can now file for benefits through a new state system.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, part of the federal government’s stimulus package to provide economic relief to those affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, offers benefits to eligible individuals who are self-employed, independent contractors, gig workers and others who may not qualify for regular unemployment but can no longer work.</p>
<p>The program is funded entirely by the federal government but the details of how and when to file were left largely up to each state. Until this weekend, Pennsylvania officials had advised individuals applying for PUA benefits to wait to file until they received special instructions.</p>
<p>The state had to build a <a href="https://pua.benefits.uc.pa.gov/vosnet/Default.aspx" target="_blank">new online platform</a> to process the PUA benefits because the U.S. Dept. of Labor requires states to track PUA separately from regular unemployment compensation, according to Jahmai Sharp, deputy communications director for the state department of Labor and Industry. The state has also released answers to a list of <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/file/Pages/Filing-for-PUA.aspx" target="_blank">frequently asked questions</a>.</p>
<p>With nearly 1.5 million Pennsylvania residents applying for traditional unemployment compensation since Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all nonessential and non-life-sustaining businesses to close or stop physical operations in mid-March, the state’s traditional system has already been overwhelmed.</p>
<p>“It was a relief when Congress passed legislation allowing self-employed people to get unemployment, but many states didn’t have IT infrastructure in place to carry that out,” said Gordon Denlinger, state director of the National Federation of Independent Business, which represents 13,000 small businesses in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“While we are pleased financial relief is on the horizon for gig workers and independent contractors, many of them tell us they would much rather be working,” Mr. Denlinger said in a prepared statement. “Hopefully the forced shutdowns will soon be lifted when it is safe to do so.”</p>

<p>In 2019, there were 322,000 self-employed individuals in the state, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>In addition to those who are self-employed, the new PUA program is also available to those seeking part-time employment, individuals lacking sufficient work history, and those who do not qualify for regular unemployment compensation or extended benefits, Mr. Sharp said.</p>
<p>Small business owners may also be eligible if their primary source of income is from work done for their business or farm and a person who has never worked before might be eligible under certain circumstances, according to Mr. Sharp.</p>
<p>The Wolf administration also waived some traditional requirements for unemployment benefits, including that individuals could not file for their first week off the job and must prove that they are searching for work.</p>
<p>PUA benefits are based on previous income reported. An individual’s payments may not be more than the state’s maximum weekly benefit rate for regular unemployment compensation, which is $572 in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Individuals who are eligible for PUA will also receive an additional $600 weekly through the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program from the week ending April 4 through July 25.</p>
<p>PUA benefits are available for 39 weeks through the end of the year and could be backdated to January 27, 2020.</p>
<p>Eligible individuals can expect to receive their PUA benefits within two to four weeks of filing their initial claim, Mr. Sharp said.</p>
<p>Individuals who applied for regular unemployment compensation and were denied are still able to file for PUA benefits.</p>
