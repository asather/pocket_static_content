<h1>Covestro takes hit on sales, income due to COVID-19 slowdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Covestro said sales in the first quarter fell by 12.3% and net income plummeted by nearly 90% as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The plastics and materials producer, based in Germany with North American headquarters in Robinson, said it took a significant hit in China where the first cases of the coronavirus were detected and where its customers experienced production disruptions beginning in February.</p>
<p>Covestro makes polymers used in automobiles, construction, furniture, electronics and other products.</p>
<p>Global sales totaled 2.8 billion euros ($3 billion) and net income was 20 million euros.</p>
<p>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were 254 million euros, down 42.5% and in line with Covestroâ€™s guidance, the company said.</p>
<p>Covestro has operations in 30 countries worldwide and 17,200 employees including about 750 at its Robinson campus.</p>
<p>A spokesman Wednesday said the company has not furloughed any employees in North America, and has ramped up production at some sites to make plastic materials used in personal protective equipment, such as face shields for front-line health care workers.</p>
<p>Its annual shareholders meeting has been pushed back from April to July 30 and will be a virtual session.</p>
