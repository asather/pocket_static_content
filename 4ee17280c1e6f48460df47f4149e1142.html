<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The McKeesport Area School Board has hired two school police officers for its new district police force.</p>
<p>Mattie Dolfi and Carl Kuzel were hired by a vote of 7-2 at a Jan. 22 meeting. They will each earn $25 per hour and work during the school year. Board members Joseph Lopretto, Mindy Sturgess, James Brown, Tom Filotei, Ivan Hampton, Steven Kondrosky and Jim Poston voted in favor of the hirings. Dave Donato and Diane Elias dissented.</p>
<p>Mr. Donato said he voted against the hirings because he does not support the idea of a school police force and said his vote was “not a reflection on the individuals.”</p>
<p>Mr. Lopretto, board president, said a goal of the department is “an educational tool” and not just the security aspect a police department brings.</p>
<p>“We want these kids to see them as a mentor,” Mr. Lopretto said.</p>
<p>Mr. Dolfi comes to the district from the Duquesne University Police Department, where he served 10 years. Mr. Kuzel previously worked for the McKeesport Police Department for 25 years.</p>
<p>The school district’s police department now consists of the two officers and a chief, Bob Boyle, a retired state trooper who was hired in December.</p>
<p>In other business, the board accepted the resignation of business manager Matthew Gergely, who had worked in the district for about two years, first as assistant business manager in 2017.</p>
