<h1>Penguins draft a pair of goalies to replenish depth between the pipes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On a day the Penguins said goodbye to a goalie who backstopped back-to-back Stanley Cup runs, they restocked the pipeline with two more netminders who will help shape the future in the crease.</p>
<p>General manager Jim Rutherford began Day 2 of the NHL draft with a trade that sent 26-year-old Matt Murray to Ottawa in exchange for a second-round pick and a prospect. Less than two hours later, they used that very same second-round pick on Joel Blomqvist, an 18-year-old goalie from Finland. The Penguins kept their focus between the pipes in the third round, choosing Swedish goalie Calle Clang.</p>
<p>Rutherford had drafted just one goalie (2016 second-round pick Filip Gustavsson) in his first five seasons after inheriting a team with Marc-Andre Fleury and several promising prospects in the pipeline. But in a matter of two picks, he added two more.</p>
<p>Asked if the plan was to go heavy on goaltenders or if the draft board simply broke in that direction, Penguins director of amateur scouting Patrik Allvin said it was “a little bit of both.”</p>
<p>“They were both intriguing players,” Allvin said. “It just ended up turning out that both were available.”</p>
<p>The Penguins depth chart in the crease is now as follows: Tristan Jarry is the clear-cut No. 1 goalie after signing a new three-year extension last week. Casey DeSmith, who spent last year in the AHL, is currently slated to be the backup in the NHL. They’re followed by 24-year-old prospect Emil Larmi, who played 11 of his 20 games in the ECHL last season. Finally, 21-year-old Alex D’Orio spent all of 2019-20 with the ECHL’s Wheeling Nailers.</p>
<p>So the Penguins clearly had a need in net. They still plan to target a third NHL goalie when free agency opens on Friday at noon. However, the one downside to choosing two goalies is that it’s highly unlikely either will help maximize the current Sidney Crosby-Evgeni Malkin window. Traditionally, goalies take longer than skaters to reach the NHL. Both are 18 now and will probably not enter their prime until their early-to-mid 20s.</p>
<p>“I don’t think you can ever have enough good players in your system,” Allvin said when asked if he considered a skater who they could fast-track more quickly to the NHL.</p>
<p>Blomqvist, an athletic goalie with high upside, was ranked by NHL Central Scouting as the third-best European goalie in this year’s draft class. He spent the majority of the 2019-20 season with Karpat’s junior club, where he led the league with .931 save percentage. That came on the heels of a 2018-19 season in which he won a junior league championship and was awarded the Jorma Valtonen award as the league’s best goaltender.</p>
<p>So far this season, he’s made two appearances with the main club, posting a .914 save percentage and 1.50 goals-against average.</p>
<p>“I would compare him a little bit more to Jarry at this point,” Allvin said. “Really calm. Play reader. Really athletic. Obviously, he needs to get stronger, as most of the young kids [do].”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Clang recorded a 2.64 goals-against average and .913 save percentage in 34 appearances for his junior hockey team, Rogle J20 SuperElit. Really though, those stats don’t do him justice, as he was playing behind a poor defensive team. This season, he’s currently on loan to Kristianstads IK of Sweden’s second-best professional league.</p>
<p>Clang’s style is a bit different. He’s a goalie who doesn’t venture far from his goal line, which makes him hard to beat around the posts or down low.</p>
<p>“Clang might be a little further ahead in his body composition,” Allvin said. “Really competitive player. He’s a play-reader as well.”</p>
<p>You don’t have to squint too hard to see a parallel to last year, when 2012 third-round pick Matt Murray and 2013 second-rounder Jarry were jockeying for the job. Get ready now for the 2026 Blomqvist vs. Clang debates to ignite sports talk radio in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The goalies highlight a Day 2 draft haul that included five total players (two goalies and three forwards). The Penguins also added forward prospect Jonathan Gruden in the Murray trade and a seventh-round pick in 2021 from the Washington Capitals.</p>
<p>As the draft unfolded, the Penguins prioritized speed, skill and substance. In the fourth round, they selected Lukas Svejkovsky. A Point Roberts, Washington native, the 5-foot-10, 165-pound center started this season with the Vancouver Giants of the Western Hockey League. After a somewhat slow start on a more defensive-minded team, he requested a trade that would help him showcase his skill and boost his stock. After scoring 10 points in the first 18 games, he went on to finish the year with 28 points in the final 34 for the Medicine Hat Tigers.</p>
<p>The Penguins have prioritized skill and speed to hit big on recent mid-round picks like Jake Guentzel and Bryan Rust. While no one is calling Svejkovsky the next Rust or Guentzel, it’s easy to see some of the same attributes from a small, speedy, skilled player.</p>
<p>“We thought that his game took off [after the trade],” Allvin said. “Intriguing player because of his hockey sense and skill level and also a good skater.”</p>
<p>With their final two picks, the Penguins chose players who will likely project as role players.</p>
<p>The fifth-round pick, Raivis Ansons, played alongside Penguins 2019 third-round pick Nathan Legare on Baie-Comeau. While the Penguins were keeping tabs on Legare in the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League, the Latvian-born Ansons’ 6-1, 185-pound size and speed caught their eye. He projects as a penalty killer who isn’t afraid to do the dirty work in the hard areas of the ice.</p>
<p>“We do think there is more production to come this year for him being a second-year, over-(age) player,” Allvin said.</p>
<p>With their sixth-round pick, the Penguins chose 5-11, 174-pound forward Chase Yoder. A Texas native and product of the U.S. National Development Team, Yoder is considered a fast, aggressive, two-way player. He recently enrolled at Providence College, where he’ll play under coach Nate Leaman for the same program that produced Penguins winger Brandon Tanev and prospect Kasper Bjorkqvist.</p>
<p>“A little bit like Teddy Blueger, the way Teddy is playing now for Pittsburgh,” Allvin said. “A hard-working, two-way energy player. More of a fourth-line potential upside. But really strong leader, strong character.”</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to Gruden, he’s another bottom-six type player. The 20-year-old center still has an over-age season of eligibility with the London Knights of the OHL. However, due to COVID-19 uncertainty, it remains to be determined if he’ll start the 2020-21 season playing junior hockey in Canada or with the Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins.</p>
