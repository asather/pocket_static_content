<h1>Save Our Stages Act would help keep live music venues from shutting down</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Live music venues, among the hardest hit businesses during the pandemic shutdown, have been sending out an S.O.S. through a campaign called Save Our Stages.</p>
<p>The organizing National Independent Venue Association (NIVA) has indicated that if concerts are not able to resume this year, and there is no relief to the industry, 90 percent of venue owners, promoters, and bookers report that they are in danger of closing.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, NIVA moved toward its goal with senators John Cornyn (R-TX) and Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) proposing the Save Our Stages Act.</p>
<p>It would establish a $10 billion Small Business Administration grant program for live venue operators, promoters, producers and talent representatives, making grants to eligible recipients equal to the lesser of either 45% of gross revenue from 2019, or $12 million.</p>
<p>The grants could be used for rent, mortgages, utilities, PPE, payments to contractors, maintenance, administrative costs, taxes, operating leases, and capital expenditures related to meeting state, local, or federal social distancing guidelines. Supplemental grants could be used in the future if funding remains available and applicants can demonstrate need.</p>
<p>The National Independent Venue Association, which formed at the outset of the pandemic, represents more than 2,000 members across the country.</p>
<p>“Our members told us months ago that if the shutdown lasted six months or longer and there wasn’t federal relief to hold them over, 90% of them would fold permanently,” Dayna Frank, president of NIVA and CEO First Avenue Productions, said in a statement. “With no revenue and immense overhead, four months in, it’s already happening. The warning light is flashing red and our only hope is for legislation like Save Our Stages Act or RESTART Act to be passed before Congress goes on August recess. Otherwise, most businesses in this industry will collapse.”</p>
<p>RESTART,&nbsp;an eight-week extension of the government's&nbsp;Paycheck Protection Program&nbsp;loans, was proposed in May to help hardest hit and last-phase industries.</p>
<p>“SOS is an industry-specific bill which was just introduced yesterday and crafted over the weekend,” said Adam Valen, marketing manager for Drusky Entertainment PA Precinct Captain for the National Independent Venue Association along with promoter Brian Drusky. “We are supporting both RESTART and SOS. If either one or the other are able to pass, they will both be able to help save our industry.”</p>
<p>Among the local businesses eligible for the grants would be The Rex Theater, Spirit, Mr. Smalls Theatre, Carnegie of Homestead Music Hall, Thunderbird Cafe &amp; Music Hall, Drusky Entertainment, Grey Area Productions and Opus One Productions.</p>
<p>In proposing the bill, Sen. Klobuchar said, “Minnesota’s concert halls, theatres, and places of entertainment, like First Avenue in Minneapolis, where Prince famously performed, have inspired generations with the best of local music, art, and education. This legislation would help ensure that small entertainment venues can continue to operate, and serve our communities for generations to come.”</p>
<p>“Our mom and pop venues and promoters fight tooth and nail to service their communities and foster local, national, and international talent, as well as provide a huge economic driver for their respective areas and the municipality as a whole,” Valen said. “Mr. Smalls Theatre for example has completely revitalized the Millvale area, and without them, tourism in Millvale goes down. This bill will help give those spaces a chance to open.”</p>
