<h1>A double standard </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department lowered its outdoor gathering capacity to 50 people after a spike in cases earlier in the summer.</p>
<p>More recently, when the county’s positivity rate dropped below 4%, department director Dr. Debra Bogen has raised the cap to allow gatherings of 100.</p>
<p>It was high time.</p>
<p>The state limits outdoor gatherings to 250 people, but in June permitted a car show in Carlisle that hosted up to 20,000 people in a flea-market like atmosphere. Protests against police brutality have continued to draw crowds of dozens or hundreds.</p>
<p>According to contact tracers — who reached 88% of infected people in late June in Allegheny County — protests were not a significant source of infection spread.</p>
<p>It may seem inappropriate to talk about protests as a statistic given their moral weight in today’s political climate. But these demonstrations have provided a strong test case for larger outdoor gatherings.</p>
<p>Public figures and studies claimed that protests were not responsible for a renewed spike in cases earlier this summer. Taking that at face value, why can’t restrictions on other outdoor gatherings ease up so long as social distancing and masking guidelines remain in place?</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen’s caution is understandable, and she is the expert on the ground in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>But the apparent double standard between protests and other types of gatherings has led to a loss of trust in health officials. Why can’t Allegheny County at least mirror the state’s outdoor gathering cap of 250 people?</p>
<p>Let’s have more transparency about why some of these restrictions are still in place, and let’s allow people to gather outdoors safely, distanced and masked as appropriate.</p>
