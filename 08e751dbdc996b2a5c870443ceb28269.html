<h1>Pirates bullpen blows lead — twice — in loss to Brewers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Even with a normal loss Saturday, the Pirates could’ve cruised into the midway point of their season feeling at least somewhat good about a couple things.</p>
<p>Josh Bell may be finding himself at the plate. Jacob Stallings has been a pleasant surprise. Cole Tucker and Erik Gonzalez could be every-day players. And JT Brubaker looks like a potential part of the rotation long-term.</p>
<p>But, man, the bullpen. And how the end of this latest disaster at Miller Park went down, too.</p>
<p>The Pirates lost to the Brewers, 7-6, when Richard Rodriguez walked the leadoff man (Jace Peterson) and served up a walkoff home run to Eric Sogard.</p>
<p>After rallying with a heap of walks against Milwaukee closer Josh Hader, putting an improbable win within their grasp, the Pirates essentially told the Brewers to hold their beer in the bottom half.</p>
<p>“We didn’t execute pitches,” manager Derek Shelton said. “I was pleased with [the rally against Hader], but the outcome of the game wasn’t what we wanted.”</p>
<p>In a way, it was an appropriate — albeit frustrating — way to end the first half, when the Pirates went 9-21 and watched their bullpen endure plenty of trouble.</p>
<p>It also made sense because it happened here, where good intentions and late-inning rallies go to die; the Pirates have now lost seven straight at Miller Park and 10 of 11.</p>
<p>The first time the Pirates blew a late-inning lead came off Nik Turley, who allowed a double to left fielder Christian Yelich and hit designated hitter Keston Hiura to start the eighth.</p>
<p>It looked like Turley might dig himself out when he struck out Jedd Gyorko and got Ryan Braun to pop up to Adam Frazier, but Avisail Garcia drilled a two-run double down the left-field line.</p>
<p>The Pirates walked five times against Hader, who had not allowed a run or hit in nine appearances this season, but it turned out that it somehow wasn’t enough.</p>
<p>Big-picture-wise, Brubaker’s start was encouraging, as the right-hander worked five innings and allowed two earned runs on three hits with three walks and six strikeouts.</p>
<p>He gave up a long home run to Yelich in the first inning and sprayed the ball in the second, but he was able to settle down quickly.</p>
<p>Brubaker retired nine of his final 10, the lone exception being a one-out walk to first baseman Justin Smoak in the third. The last three outs Brubaker got came on successive strikeouts of second baseman Luis Urias, Yelich and Hiura.</p>
<p>“I was pretty excited about that,” Brubaker said of getting Yelich back.</p>
<p>With the score tied at 2, the Pirates rallied in the fifth inning, as Gonzalez led off with a triple and scored on a sacrifice fly from Kevin Newman.</p>
<p>On the next pitch, Bell cranked a hanging curveball from Brewers starter Brett Anderson over the fence in center, extending the Pirates’ lead to 4-2. It was the third homer of the season for Bell and his first since Aug. 5.</p>
<p>There have been signs for a couple games now that Bell is in a different place with his swing. Not only has he hit some balls hard that have been right at people, but he’s been chasing a lot less. Those ugly at-bats have been rare.</p>
<p>After two hits Friday, there’s no doubt this one had to feel good for Bell, who entered the game with a slash line of just .204/.257/.282.</p>
<p>“I feel good right now,” Bell said. “Happy that balls are starting to fall for me, and hopefully there’s a lot more to come.”</p>
<p>Bell’s sacrifice fly in the first gave the Pirates a 1-0 lead before Yelich’s blast, as he absolutely crushed a low-and-inside sinker from Brubaker.</p>
<p>Yelich, who had been 1-for-25 against the Pirates this season, put this one in the third deck in right field, the ball traveling an estimated 460 feet with an exit velocity of 112 mph.</p>
<p>Brubaker encountered some control trouble in the second, as he walked two, including Urias to score a run and push Milwaukee in front, 2-1.</p>
<p>The Pirates tied the game in the top of the third when Tucker led off with a single, moved to third on a pair of ground outs to second and scored on a double from Stallings.</p>
<p>Those connecting for a run was somewhat ironic given the fact that they’ve been two of the Pirates’ better hitters of late.</p>
<p>Tucker is now 12 for his past 35 (.343), while Stallings has upped his average to .323, tops among National League catchers with at least 30 at-bats.</p>
<p>At the start of August, Stallings was hitting just .118, but he’s hitting an MLB-best .396 in August — again with a minimum of 30 at-bats.</p>
<p>“It’s obviously been nice to do well personally,” Stallings said. I made a couple adjustments after the first couple weeks or so. Going the other way is a byproduct of a better approach and just being on time a little better, getting a little looser in the box and not putting so much pressure on myself. I feel like I’m getting into my legs well. That’s nice to do, for sure.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates and Brewers wore their No. 42 Jackie Robinson Day jerseys for a second consecutive day. They also observed a moment of silence for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/obituaries/2020/08/28/Chadwick-Boseman-dead-dies-obituary-colon-cancer-Black-Panther-TChalla-Marvel-MCU-Jackie-Robinson-42-James-Brown/stories/202008280161" target="_blank">actor Chadwick Boseman</a>.</p>
