<h1>Most of the S&amp;T Bank Music Park summer season is now scrapped</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The concert cancellations were coming in little by little for a while, but now they’re coming in waves.</p>
<p>Live Nation has now canceled most of its S&amp;T Bank Music Park summer season, due to concerns over the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Concerts by The Zac Brown Band, Alice Cooper, Lady Antebellum, Sugarland, Breaking Benjamin, Brad Paisley, Rascal Flatts, Incubus, Sammy Hagar have all been marked “Canceled.” Ticketholders are able to get refunds for the canceled shows.</p>
<p>Among those postponing this week were Maroon 5, Hall &amp; Oates, Chicago, Nickelback and the reunion of The Black Crowes.</p>
<p>Still remaining on the schedule for the Burgettstown amphitheater, which underwent a name change for the season, are Jimmy Buffett (July 16), Tim McGraw (July 31), The Doobie Brothers (Aug. 6), Matchbox Twenty (Aug. 26), Kiss (Aug. 28) and Korn/Faith No More (Sept. 5).</p>
<p>Given the trend, it seems likely they will all be postponed or canceled.</p>
<p>According to Variety, in a quarterly earnings call two weeks ago, Live Nation CEO Michael Rapino had his sights set on fall.</p>
<p>“We think in the fall, if there are no second hotspots, you’ll see markets around the world [reopening] — Europe, specifically, has talked about opening up 5,000-plus [gatherings] in September. And on the venue side, we’re dealing with federal, the White House, every government body you can imagine, and we’ve got a great task force around what we have to do with the venue to make you safe.</p>
<p>“So I think in the fall you’ll see more experimenting and more shows happening in a theater setting, into some arenas. And then our goal is really to be on sale in the third and fourth quarters for 2021 at full scale.”</p>
<p>With The Weeknd rescheduling his Jun 26 show at PPG Paints Arena for next year, the only concert still on the summer schedule for the arena is Harry Styles on July 14.</p>
