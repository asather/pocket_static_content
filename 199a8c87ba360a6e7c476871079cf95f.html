<h1>'Worse things going on': Yinzers in the Burgh owner looking to rebuild after fire destroys store</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like so many business owners reeling from temporary government-ordered closures amid the coronavirus pandemic, the owner of Yinzers in the Burgh in the Strip District&nbsp;said he was hoping to reopen by May 8 the earliest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That isn’t an option now. The&nbsp;sports apparel store in the 1700 block of Penn Avenue&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/04/22/Strip-District-fire-four-alarm-Penn-Avenue-Pittsburgh-EMS/stories/202004220168" target="_blank">caught fire Wednesday night</a> and owner Jimmy Coen said Thursday it’s unlikely he’ll reopen for the remainder of the year.</p>
<p>The black-and-yellow store that is usually “so vibrant and so electric,” now looks like “an old thing,” Mr. Coen said through tears.</p>
<p>But “people are dying all the time right now,” he said. “It’s just brick and wood ... there’s a lot worse things going on with people in the city.”</p>
<p>Mr. Coen said his other two stores further down in the 2100 block of Penn Avenue are&nbsp;still expected to reopen when state and local government restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>The shops are known for their Pittsburgh sports-themed T-shirts, mugs, jackets, and collectibles.</p>
<p>“We’ve been beat up with this virus, and we never got our stimulus checks or anything,” Mr. Coen, 60, added. “Right now, I’m just trying to figure it out. We are going to rebuild, but I just have to figure it out. I have insurance, but I'm not exactly sure what I'm going to do yet.”</p>
<p>The four-alarm blaze occurred just after 8 p.m. at the site near 18th Street, Pittsburgh fire officials said. The fire was put out an hour later, and one firefighter was taken to UPMC Mercy with a shoulder injury.&nbsp;No other injuries were reported.</p>
<p>Heavy smoke and flames spilled from the third floor of the store, eventually breaking through the roof. Mr. Coen said he believes the fire may have originated there, but he is not sure. Fire officials are still investigating the cause.</p>
<p>Mr. Coen said Thursday morning he could not bring himself to fully assess the damage to his store Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>“I went in a little tiny bit, but to be honest, I was just so upset I didn’t want to feel any worse,” he said.&nbsp;“I didn’t want to go in and see something that might be ruined that was something I kept for a long time.”</p>
<p>The building was not completely destroyed, he said. All merchandise located on the first to third floors were ruined due to water and smoke damage, although those floors had few items and most of the company’s product is located in the basement, he said. Yinzers in the Burgh has been in the 1700 block of Penn Avenue for nearly five years.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;building formerly <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/pittsburgh-company-news/2017/02/22/Mike-Feinberg-Co-Steelers-a-longtime-party-supply-store-in-Penn-Avenue-Strip-District-will-close-in-April/stories/201702220042" target="_blank">housed the Mike Feinberg Co.</a> — a longtime staple in the community that not only sold party supplies for occasions such as Super Bowls, bridal showers and backyard cookouts but was also first to officially distribute the Terrible Towel. It closed in 2017.</p>
<p>The building immediately adjacent to the store may also have been exposed to the fire, according to Pittsburgh police spokeswoman Cara Cruz. Officials at the Schoring Co. party supply store next door could not be reached, but a voicemail for the company’s listed phone number indicated the business is temporarily closed due to the “fire next door.” The extent of damage to that building was not immediately known.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Employees at another neighboring business, Parma Sausage Products, said they were not affected by the blaze. The storefront has been temporarily closed for several weeks due to COVID-19 concerns, although the company has implemented curbside pick-ups and are taking orders by phone, according to sales manager Erin Schumacher.</p>
<p>“We owe it to the firefighters that we weren’t affected at all,” Ms. Schumacher said.&nbsp;“It’s terrible what happened.”</p>
<p>Mr. Coen said he is hoping to save some items in the basement.</p>
<p>“In our basement, a lot of stuff is in plastic, so I'm hoping that a lot of that will be saved,” he said.</p>
