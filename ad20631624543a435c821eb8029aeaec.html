<h1>WEATHER: Cold temps not expected to let up this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mother Nature is playing a little trick on us. The roller-coaster trend of warm and cold over the past few weeks presses the question “Is spring truly here?”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Overnight freeze and frost advisories may have expired for northern counties, but snow is expected to mix with rain into the evening hours Tuesday as temperatures again dip into the 30s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s a far cry from the balmy 70-degree weather Pittsburghers enjoyed last weekend.</p>
<p>“Even into May there still can be potential” for near-freezing temperatures, said Jason Frazier, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Moon. “I wouldn’t say it’s normal, but it’s not abnormally cold for this period of time.</p>
<p>“We still have had, even in Pittsburgh at times, a few events in our history of having even snow recorded in May and accumulating snow recorded in May so it’s not totally unheard of.”</p>
<p>Today a low pressure will move through Western Pennsylvania and we could see snow, from a trace to no accumulation, tonight. Temperatures will reach into the mid-50s, with a low of 39 degrees. The rest of the week will look equally dismal as cloudy skies and more rain are forecast, with temps in the high-40s and 50s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But when we get to the weekend, Mr. Frazier said, the temps will plummet again:&nbsp;“We’re looking at a good cold snap, potential for some near-record lows for the day [Saturday], but nothing that is too out of the realm for what is still the kind of early May season.”</p>
<p>It’ll all depend on how much cold air comes our way, he added. The forecast calls for a high in the 40s on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately, we are just in a pattern where we’ve had more air masses coming out of the Canada region."</p>
<p>“We haven’t had as much of the southern warm air streams coming out of the Gulf reach up to our region,” Mr. Frazier said.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of more of an ‘early spring-ish’ sort of flow of a weather pattern we’ve been in. That’s why we continue to have these colder snaps later in the season whereas early in the spring, we had a warmer flow, a warmer late season pattern,” he said.</p>
<p>“So we had almost a warm start to the spring and now we’re kind of paying for it a little bit.”</p>
<p>That means we can expect more frost and freeze alerts from the Weather Service as the week progresses.</p>
<p>Recently planted flowerbeds and other outdoor plants will need to be covered for protection.</p>
