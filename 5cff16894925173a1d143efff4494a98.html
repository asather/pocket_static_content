<h1>Maestros' sauce bosses turn up the heat and flavor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When a love for hot sauce turned into a hobby, a business was born.</p>
<p>Now 18 months later, <a href="https://maestrossauceco.com/" target="_blank">Maestros’ Sauce Co.</a> has turned up the heat in the hot sauce community.</p>
<p>It began when Ross Flynn introduced Andrew Gradert to his collection of over 60 craft hot sauces, which included a serrano-based sauce that he had made. Mr. Gradert liked it so much that he was inspired to come up with his own, creating a sauce with cranberries and habanero.</p>
<p>“It was OK. It wasn’t terrible but it wasn’t great. It needed some work,” he recalled.</p>
<p>Then he made a second one —&nbsp;Curry Fury — which&nbsp;is now part of Maestros’ core sauce line. He paired habaneros with a chicken rub recipe and produced an instant hit. When he took a test batch into work at PPG Industries, his colleagues wanted to know if he was selling it.</p>
<p>“I started laughing. And they said, ‘No, cash in hand right now. How much for a bottle?’” Mr. Gradert said.</p>
<p>The thought process for a business started there. He invited Mr. Flynn and two other friends, Justin Krehel and Dennis Mikusi, over for chicken wings and broke out his curry sauce. After a couple of beers and conversation about condiments, they decided to start a hot sauce company.</p>
<p>They settled on the name Maestros because it reflects excellence, mastery and precision, Mr. Krehel explained. About a week later, he filed paperwork with the state and the sauce operation began officially in 2019.</p>
<p>Since the Canonsburg-area residents all have day jobs, they make the sauces in the evening hours at Hungry for Time’s kitchen space in Carnegie. It is not uncommon for them to finish their work around midnight.</p>
<p>The sauces are vinegar-based and, of course, focus on peppers. Maestros’ meisters grow 19 kinds of hot peppers, including serrano, jalapeno, fresno, Devil’s Tongue, Carolina Reaper, Pepper XVille, Moruga Scorpion and Chocolate Morugain, on two plots of land&nbsp;— one in Canonsburg and the other in West Alexander, Washington County. They buy milder peppers like poblanos and red, yellow and green bell peppers.</p>
<p>The company’s five core sauces and two reserve sauces come in 5-ounce bottles and retail for $8 at farmers markets in Carnegie, West Alexander and Canonsburg and at special events in the area.</p>
<p>Mr. Gradert and Mr. Krehel recently spoke about how they taste-test their sauces and decide on flavors.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How hot should a sauce be? When does it get ridiculously hot?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> When I start sniffling from the heat, that is about the threshold for me. I can eat hotter, but prefer not to. I do not like extract sauces, which is when capsaicin extract is added to the sauce. They are aggressively spicy and do not taste good at all.&nbsp;We don’t want to make something that just causes extreme pain in the mouth, throat or chest.</p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I want to feel the heat but I also want to be able to taste the food. It should enhance the flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you decide one flavor works and another doesn’t?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong>&nbsp;We make micro batches and tinker with them until it tastes right. It is a gut feeling.</p>
<p>With the Roasted Garlic sauce, we wanted one with a heavy garlic flavor but we also wanted it to be more than just garlic and heat. We tried different onions and vinegars and finally honed in on roasting the garlic and shallots and mixing in ghost and fresno peppers.</p>
<p>When I tested a pineapple-mango sauce, the first batch was absolutely horrible and it got thrown directly into the garbage. But there was potential for that flavor profile and so we kept tweaking and working with it.</p>
<p>Ross made a mushroom sauce. It was one of the worst things I have ever put in my mouth. I shouldn’t even say that.</p>
<p>It’s definitely a team effort.&nbsp;If I think of one thing and Justin thinks of another, we will try to merge the two ideas. The other part of it is that the four of us rarely ever agree on anything. So when we do, the testing stops.</p>
<p><strong>Q: So do all four of you have to sign off on it or is it majority rules?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> We all try to agree about a flavor. We don’t do it on the very first try. We will make a batch, taste-test it and agree or disagree about what it needs and doesn’t need. Then we will make another batch. Sometimes it takes days or even weeks. Eventually, we will arrive with a product and we all sign off on it.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you cook together or just taste the sauce together?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK</strong>: We all work together whenever we are at Hungry for Time. It is a team effort from measuring the ingredients, chopping the vegetables to cooking and blending the sauce to taste-testing and bottling.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you taste-test the sauce? By itself or with food?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> We taste-test it right off the spoon. That way we will know the true unfiltered flavor of the sauce.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you know the sauce is good enough?</strong></p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> It largely depends on what we are looking for in a sauce. In our curry sauce, for example, we strongly wanted to highlight the curry and mustard flavors. We didn’t want one to overpower the other nor did we want other background ingredients to interfere in the taste. With the Mo’ Honey Mo’ Poblano, we wanted to bring out the freshness in the taste and not necessarily highlight the heat of the jalapenos and serranos.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What are you looking for when you test it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> I’m looking at the texture and mouthfeel. I hate vinegar in anything except hot sauce. So if I get an overpowering vinegar taste, I’m not happy with it. I don’t want to cover it up but I want to emphasize the other flavors around it. I don’t want to taste just the peppers. Ingredients need to work homogeneously with one another.</p>
<p><strong>JK:</strong> I also like to focus on the staying power of the sauce. Some will stay with you for a long time and others will just wash off. I like multilayered sauces and don’t like one that is singularly focused. It is a case of the sum of the parts is the whole or even greater than the whole.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you cool off after all your taste-testing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> Any type of thick and fatty dairy like ice cream or yogurt will help to remove the sting. Water will not help; the heat will just stay. We snack on chips or bread when we taste-test as we are constantly tasting the hot peppers.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Do you come up with the name or the flavor profile first?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> The flavor profile is always No. 1 for us. Then we have a discussion to come up with the name. For the Roasted Garlic sauce, the name is spot-on and says it all.</p>
<p>For Mo’ Honey, we focused on the poblano and honey. So there is a robust yet delicate flavor even though the sauce also has serranos and jalapenos.</p>
<p>When we were making the taco sauce, we kept referring to it as the taco sauce. So we said, “Let us just call it what it is.”</p>
<p>Curry Fury was named by a colleague at PPG and is the only sauce named by someone else.</p>
<p>The Hot Chocolate has a bite to it and so we went with a double entendre.</p>
<p>We try to make a sauce that does not exist in the market, that we like to eat, has a name that draws you to it and is vibrant in color.</p>
<p><strong>Q: The Hot Chocolate is certainly different.</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> When I came up with the idea, it was meant for desserts and breakfast items like pancakes and crepes. It breaks down the barriers of what a traditional hot sauce is and has heat. It is made with Hershey’s dark cocoa, strawberries, fresh vanilla bean, vinegar and sugar. I wanted it to have a strong chocolate flavor.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the shelf life for your sauces?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> Once the bottle is open, it is best to use in one year. But they will last longer than that if they are refrigerated. Refrigeration preserves the color, texture and flavor. Don’t leave them out in the heat.</p>
<p><strong>Q: How do you know when it has gone bad?</strong></p>
<p><strong>AG:</strong> The color is the first indicator. You’ll notice that it is not as bright or vibrant as it once was. There should not be any mold because hot sauces are very acidic. If you see mold, throw it right away. It means it is way bad.</p>
<p>Also, the texture will break down and become globby.</p>
