<h1>Pirates' Derek Shelton not concerned about Bryan Reynolds' slow start</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even in 2020’s 60-game MLB season, four games are not enough to draw any substantial conclusions.</p>
<p>Still, one of the more concerning trends during the Pirates’ 1-3 start to the year has been the lack of production from left fielder Bryan Reynolds.</p>
<p>After finishing last season with a .314 average and coming in fourth in Rookie of the Year voting, Reynolds entered Tuesday 0-for-13 with four walks.</p>
<p>Two of those walks came Monday night in the Pirates’ series opener against the Milwaukee Brewers. To manager Derek Shelton, that is a good sign and he isn’t too concerned about Reynolds yet.</p>
<p>“I think the most important thing about Bryan Reynolds is he was born as a hitter,” Shelton said Tuesday. “He hit in little league. He hit in high school. He hit in college. He hit in the minor leagues. He hit last year. He’s going to hit. He’s had a couple rough games. When you have a couple rough games at the beginning of the season, it gets magnified a little bit, and with the 60-game season, people will magnify it even more. I think the quality of his at-bats yesterday were better. He had two walks, he was a little more patient, so Bryan Reynolds is going to be fine. He’s going to hit.”</p>
<p>Shelton backed up those words by sticking with Reynolds, as the switch-hitter is slated in left field once again for Tuesday night’s matchup with the Brewers. While that may not be an enormous gesture, the Pirates have switched up their lineups quite a bit already this season.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, for instance, their lineup consisted of four changes from the one that was run out for the 11-inning loss on Monday. The length of the game certainly played a part in that, but Reynolds’ continued presence is a sign of confidence that he will turn it around eventually.</p>
<p>That also serves to emphasize the importance of Reynolds to the Pirates. Whatever happens in the lineup around him, the Pirates expect Reynolds to be a mainstay, drive the offensive output and be a rock in the lineup.</p>
<p>Shelton doesn’t feel the tough start has anything to do with pitchers attacking Reynolds differently, though. He just thinks it’s an abnormal four-game stretch and that it will turn in Reynolds’ favor eventually.</p>
<p>“I mean, one of the things that’s going to happen for anybody in their second year in the big leagues is you’re going to have more time to evaluate and do things, but when it’s teams in your division they see enough — he played 19 games against the Brewers last year and he played 19 games against the Cardinals, or whatever,” Shelton said. “So they have a pretty good idea, just like he has a pretty good idea about what guys are going to do to him. I don’t think that plays into it very much.”</p>
<p><strong>Managerial lessons</strong></p>
<p>Shelton can’t really say how managing in 2020 is different than any other season, because, well, he hasn’t managed in any other season.</p>
<p>Surely, then, whenever he does manage his first, full, 162-game season, there will be new lessons learned. What he is aware of now, though, is how 2020 can prepare him to be adaptable to change.</p>
<p>“I think the world is always changing and, obviously, we’re in a world that’s changing drastically daily, and we’re making adjustments,” Shelton said. “I think a big part of it is, and we’ve talked about it from the time I was hired, I try to analyze everything — maybe sometimes overanalyze everything — just to make sure we’re doing things the right way. And by overanalyze, I mean I have a lot of conversations with people and ask them questions about what they think and what their opinion is. And I have very strong opinions of my own, and we’ll make decisions, but I want to make sure that [it’s] by overanalyzing, getting as much information as possible.”</p>
<p>Part of that analysis, he says, is reviewing in-game decisions with his staff. That can cover the usage of pitchers in specific situations, defensive substitutions, pinch hitting — any of the tweaks Shelton can make throughout a game.</p>
<p>The benefit of this process is getting the vantage points and opinions of the coaches, who think about the game differently than Shelton. It’s all in an effort to aid in the acclimation of Shelton to being a manager in Major League Baseball.</p>
<p>“Honestly, 60 games from now, I’m going to be a better manager than I am today. And next year in August, I’m going to be a better manager than I am today because there’s going to be things that come up that I’ve probably not thought about, or we had not addressed,” Shelton said. “It’s why we talked about the exhibition games being important and how that goes. Now we’ve played the 10th inning rule. We have an idea how that goes. So I think the more information you gather, the better you get, the more you adjust.”</p>
