<h1>An 1895 electric shop gets the ultimate jump start </h1>

<p>When Greg Kobulnicky bought an Italianate-style home on the North Side in 2017, a two-story ruin at the back of the property was included in the deal. Though his 1868 house in Allegheny West was a beauty, the small outbuilding was the beast of Buttercup Way.</p>
<p>Nature had slowly reclaimed the plain structure built by a father and son in 1895 for their electrical business. Vines embraced its soot-covered red brick, trees grew inside its walls and the roof and ceilings had collapsed. Raccoons, cats and dogs sheltered among rusty appliances, carpets and lawnmowers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s hard to really rehab a building that has fallen completely apart,” Mr. Kobulnicky said.</p>
<p>Neighborhood preservationists told him they could understand if he decided to demolish it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There was a toilet still hanging from the second floor,” Mr. Kobulnicky said. “You question your own sanity of why you’re even doing this. You gotta laugh.”</p>
<p>To ensure workers’ safety and document the project’s scope, he commissioned drone photographs. Temporary metal bracing kept the building from moving or collapsing.</p>
<p>“We just needed to see what the heck was going on with the building....&nbsp;We had to do demolition work after we stabilized it,” Mr. Kobulnicky said.</p>
<p>His gamble paid off. Finished in&nbsp;September 2018, the 770-square-foot retreat known as the Electric Shop has one bedroom plus a sleeper sofa for two, a kitchen with a breakfast bar, a living room and a long outdoor patio shielded by a privacy fence. Last week, Preservation Pennsylvania named it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2020/04/21/Preservation-PA-awards-state-honors-Pittsburgh-fountain/stories/202004200110" target="_blank">a small residential project winner for historic preservation</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It was a Herculean effort for such a little building,”&nbsp;Mr. Kobulnicky said, complimenting his architect, contractors and parents, who helped to finance the project. “We brought it back. It’s been very successful as an Airbnb. It’s one of the most profitable pieces of real estate, per square foot, that we’ve had.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>To the young developer, the structure stands for the entrepreneurial spirit of William P. Price and his son, George, who start an electrical contracting business there.&nbsp;Mr. Kobulnicky noted that 1895 was “pretty early in America’s electrical history. Your mind wonders about what went on in this little building.”</p>
<p>Buildings like this show the close relationship between homes and businesses in this historic neighborhood, he said.&nbsp;Maps from the late 1800s show carriage houses, stables and plumbing sheds dotting the alleys of Allegheny West. Few remain.</p>
<p>The project tested the ingenuity of Jim Oplinger Sr. and his son, Jim, a father-and-son carpentry and general contracting team.&nbsp; Mr. Kobulnicky and his father, Mike, were the investors, along with his mother, Veronica. The family business is Thread Development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A neighbor, Tim Zinn, told Mr. Kobulnicky the building could be restored with federal historic tax credits. Mr. Zinn is&nbsp;senior architectural historian for Michael Baker International.</p>
<p>“Tim kind of gave me the final prompt,” said Mr. Kobulnicky, who earned a master’s degree in real estate development from the University of Maryland in 2012. One of his classes focused on unconventional ways of financing historic preservation projects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Everything was meticulously planned out,” he said. “It had to be. A foot in any direction is a pretty big deal. You want great design to shine.”</p>
<p>Christine Brill, architect and co-founder of the Studio for Spatial Practice, oversaw the project. For the main stairway, she chose a modern copper wire light fixture from Bocci partly because copper is an integral component of electrical wiring.&nbsp;The exterior mortar is made for antique brick by U.S. Heritage Group in Chicago.</p>
<p>Mr. Kobulnicky fell hard for kitchen cabinets designed&nbsp;by Kobenhavns Mobelsnedkeri, a Danish company. The European white oak cabinets with brass handles are fumed and “have an industrial element to them but look modern,” he said.</p>
<p>“We essentially knocked off their cabinets. We used American white oak. The challenge was to come up with that look.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jonathan Fleck from The Color Palette in East Liberty created the kitchen cabinet stain.</p>
<p>Chuck Stein, owner of Allied Millwork in the Strip District, sourced the oak for the cabinets and made the Spanish cedar front door. Its look was inspired by the side doors of the main house.</p>
<p>To make the bathroom feel larger, a glass, European-style shower was installed. The height of sconces, the scale of kitchen cabinets, the size of the bed in the bedroom and the distance from the sofa to the television were measured repeatedly.</p>
<p>A passionate student of local history, Mr. Kobulnicky added local artwork, including a framed 1871 Sanborn map of the neighborhood that hangs near the front door. By the side door is&nbsp;a framed check that William Thaw, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive, made out to himself for $25,000 on March 31, 1874.</p>
<p>“That’s $525,000 in today’s money,” Mr. Kobulnicky said.</p>
