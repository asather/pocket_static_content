<h1>Reports: Penn State, James Franklin seek to dismiss ex-player's hazing lawsuit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State and coach James Franklin have filed to dismiss the hazing lawsuit from former player Isaiah Humphries, according to multiple reports.</p>
<p>The filing from the university and Franklin, which was first reported by the Allentown Morning Call, claims that Humphries’ case is “an implausible theory.”</p>
<p>The case in reference was a hazing lawsuit that Humphries filed in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania back in January, wherein <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/01/14/penn-state-football-hazing-isaiah-humphries-james-franklin/stories/202001140110" target="_blank">Humphries alleged that he was sexually hazed by upper classmates</a>, former teammates of his, and that Franklin knew about this hazing and ignored Humphries’ complaints.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Humphries’ lawsuit claimed that actions were taken against him to ostracize him from the program and force his transfer.</p>
<p>Current Nittany Lions players Micah Parsons, Jesse Luketa and Damion Barber were also named in that lawsuit, along with former defensive end Yetur Gross-Matos. Humphries alleged that former teammates told him they were&nbsp;“going to Sandusky” him, among other things.</p>
<p>Humphries’ lawsuit sought compensatory and exemplary damages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.mcall.com/sports/penn-state/mc-spt-penn-state-football-hazing-lawsuit-20200317-5s3zdm3ainev7ppun6im2rfpzm-story.html" target="_blank">According to the Morning Call</a>, the players named in Humphries’ lawsuit are part of the reason for Penn State and Franklin’s filing, which was made on Monday. In it, they say Humphries’ story&nbsp;“easily unravels,” in part because the aforementioned players were not upperclassmen. Parsons and Luketa were a part of the same recruiting class as Humphries, while Barber and Gross-Matos were in the second semester of their freshman years at the time of the incidents.</p>
<p>This, Penn State claims according to the Morning Call, disqualifies the players named in Humphries’ suit from being in the position “to force another student to engage in prohibited conduct&nbsp;‘for the purpose of initiating, admitting or affiliating’ or ‘continuing or enhancing’ a student’s status in an organization.”</p>
<p>The filing also states, <a href="https://www.pennlive.com/news/2020/03/penn-state-franklin-seek-dismissal-of-part-of-ex-players-sexual-harassment-suit.html?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=pennlive_sf&amp;utm_source=twitter" target="_blank">according to PennLive.com</a>, that even if the conduct that occurred was defined as hazing, that it was&nbsp;“not perpetrated by the university or Franklin,” and that Humphries failed to outline&nbsp;“a special relationship between him and the university and Franklin that’s required to seek damages for negligent infliction of emotional distress.”</p>
<p>This filing is consistent with Penn State’s stance on the matter dating back to January.</p>
<p>"The University has established processes in place for responding to claims of potential misconduct,” Penn State said in a statement to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette in January. “In accordance with our processes, the Office of Sexual Misconduct Prevention and Response and the Office of Student Conduct carried out investigations of the plaintiff’s claims independent from Intercollegiate Athletics. In addition, Penn State police investigated related allegations and forwarded the results of that investigation to the Office of the Centre County District Attorney (DA). The DA reviewed the case and decided that no charges would be pursued.”</p>
