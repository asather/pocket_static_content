<h1>Stargazing: A summer triangle of stars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>High over our heads in the summertime, three stars will take center stage night after night. Look toward the southeast Tuesday night to find Vega, Deneb and Altair, the three stars that form a shape known as the summer triangle. The summer triangle is what is known as an asterism, a well-known shape of stars in the sky. Where constellations provide the official map of the night sky and are agreed upon by the International Astronomical Union, asterisms are a way of playing “connect-the-dots” with the stars and can vary depending on regions or cultures.</p>
<p>The summer triangle is made of three bright stars from three constellations. Vega belongs to the constellation of Lyra, the ancient Greek harp. Deneb is part of the constellation of Cygnus, the swan. Altair belongs to the constellation of Aquila, the eagle. Throughout the summer, keep track of the summer triangle. It will make an arc that makes its way directly over our heads, shining high every night.</p>
<p>Right now, you can also use the summer triangle to help you locate a few things in the sky. If you are far from city lights and away from light pollution, look to the center of the summer triangle to locate the path of the Milky Way. Also, this summer, the summer triangle conveniently points to two other shining gems in our sky, the planets Jupiter and Saturn.</p>
