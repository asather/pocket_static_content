<h1>Allegheny County says 13 reported COVID-19 deaths bring total to 165</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County’s health department on Thursday said there was a change in how it received certain data over the weekend, which caused information about COVID-19 cases that was previously excluded from the count to be reflected in the latest figures.</p>
<p>The change resulted in a spike in deaths, which brings the county’s numbers more in line with the state’s. The county is now reporting 165 deaths, an increase of 13 deaths over the previous day and nearer the most recent total number (166) that Pennsylvania’s Department of Health presented on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Of the 13 new deaths reported by the county, it said “all but one appear to be linked to long-term care facilities” and that they died between May 8 and May 25. The victims’&nbsp;ages range from 57 to 90. The county said 12 of them are listed as confirmed deaths from COVID-19 and one is listed as probable.</p>
<p>Of the county’s total number of deaths, 153 are confirmed and 12 are probable.</p>
<p>The county said it has had 1,965 cases of the respiratory disease, which is an increase of 13 over Wednesday. Of the cases, 1,841 are confirmed and 124 are probable.</p>
<p>There was only one other death — in Mercer County — reported in Western Pennsylvania. Mercer now has six deaths due to COVID-19 and has reported 110 positive cases.</p>
<p>Allegheny County and much of southwestern Pennsylvania moves into the green phase on Friday, and state and county officials on Wednesday said efforts should continue to mitigate the spread of the viral disease..</p>
<p>Allegheny has the highest figures in Western Pennsylvania and is followed by Beaver and Westmoreland counties. Based on the state’s data through Wednesday, Beaver has had 594 cases and 74 deaths and Westmoreland 453 cases and 38 deaths.</p>
<p>The state on Thursday reported 75 new COVID-19 deaths and 537 new cases.&nbsp;Pennsylvania has had 25 straight days in which it has reported less than 1,000 daily cases. The state has reported a total of&nbsp;73,942 positive cases.&nbsp;The new deaths increase the statewide total to 5,817.</p>
