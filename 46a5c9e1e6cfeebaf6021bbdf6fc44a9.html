<h1>Finding volunteers becoming difficult, but East End ministry pushes on to help community</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Gregg Caliguiri first began providing food to East End Cooperative Ministry through his restaurants at the end of 2018, he recognized a calling to give back to the city he loves. Since then, and even during the COVID-19 outbreak, he still volunteers for its food pantry five days a week.</p>
<p>“It’s really been an opportunity to be involved with one of the best and most preeminent organizations that serves our community,” Mr. Caliguiri said.</p>
<p>Yet EECM’s day-to-day operations, which include nutrition services, housing and employment assistance and youth programs, have been greatly affected by the virus.</p>
<p>Although still providing emergency groceries through its food pantry and free lunches through its community kitchen on weekdays, the amount of daily volunteers has reduced, the amount of food given to each person has decreased and the demand for food has skyrocketed.</p>
<p>“Our food pantry has seen a three-fold increase in demand since mid-March,” said Carole Bailey, EECM’s president and CEO. “We used to provide each person enough groceries to last them about a month. Now we’re only able to provide enough for about a week.”</p>
<p>Ms. Bailey said that the increase in demand is the organization's largest hurdle.</p>
<p>Since the stay-at-home order began in Pennsylvania, and once thousands of workers found themselves furloughed, EECM’s food pantry has seen a daily increase of 30 to 90 people.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the virus, the distribution of food also has been disrupted.</p>
<p>The food pantry, located at EECM’s “Community House” in East Liberty, normally allows people to come in and select the food they want. But because of the strict social-distancing guidelines, food is now handed out curbside through car windows.</p>
<p>Ms. Bailey said EECM allows a person to pick up food only once per week but she noted that this rule is largely enforced through the honor system. If the stay-at-home order stays in effect, she expects the situation to get worse.</p>
<p>“If this virus continues to spread, I think we’ll see an increasing demand as more and more people are furloughed and laid off,” Ms. Bailey said.</p>
<p>Yet the food pantry, which secures its stock through the Greater Pittsburgh Food Bank and smaller-scale donations, is just a small part of the services that EECM provides. Nor is it the only one affected by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The organization’s soup kitchen, which is open five days a week at the Community House, also has seen a steady increase in demand, Ms. Bailey said.</p>
<p>EECM’s after-school youth services have likewise been canceled indefinitely due to social-distancing rules.</p>
<p>The EECM housing program, which provides 51 beds to people in need across various properties, has seen a significant drop of volunteers able to deliver dinner to their residents.</p>
<p>According to Ms. Bailey, it’s that dip in dedicated volunteers, like Mr. Caliguiri, that has made operating these services more strenuous.</p>
<p>Elderly people, which make up a majority of EECM’s volunteers, have largely decided to stay home, as they are among the most at-risk demographic for contracting the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, EECM’s cadre of full-time employees, who Ms. Bailey says are now communicating through video meetings, are having a difficult time working around the proximity restrictions.</p>
<p>“The circumstances are unfortunate, but I understand why a lot of people can’t be involved anymore for the time being,” Mr. Caliguiri said. “But there’s a really strong community here, and many of those old volunteers call in all the time and ask how we’re doing.”</p>
<p>In addition to able-bodied, healthy volunteers, Ms. Bailey said that monetary donations are crucial to continuing EECM’s nutrition services. Food donations are welcome, she said, but greater finances allow the organization to buy more supplies, like non-perishables, in bulk from the Food Bank.</p>
<p>Mr. Caliguiri, who owns Walnut Grill and Walnut Grove restaurants in the Pittsburgh area and is the son of late Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Caliguiri, said it’s difficult times like these that demonstrate the goodness of our city.</p>
<p>“I think tragedy can bring out the worst in some people, but it also brings out the best,” Mr. Caliguiri said. “I think we’re all opening our eyes to what really matters. Relationships and connections to our community are the most important thing.”</p>
