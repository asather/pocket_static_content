<h1>Review: Science Center's True Crime night wasn't as compelling as it could have been</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Carnegie Science Center’s “Science After Hours: True Crime” event last week was promoted as a chance for adults to do some forensic sleuthing, learn about interesting local cases — and drink booze.</p>
<p>My husband Henry and I pleaded guilty to only one count each — unfortunately — because the Feb. 28 event didn’t live up to the hype.</p>
<p>The presentations were stellar. The auditorium was packed, with people sitting on every step and crowded into the back corners for lawyer Doug Sughrue’s talk about scientific evidence from the Netflix documentary “Evil Genius.” Mr. Sughrue, who represented defendant Marjorie Diehl-Armstrong, described his client and the twisty true tale of the 2003 bank robbery known as the Erie pizza bomber case.</p>
<p>A smaller room was jammed for another presentation,“Odd, Mysterious and Fascinating History of Pittsburgh,” with John Schalcosky, the host of KDKA Radio’s “Pittsburgh Oddcast.” He described several little-known but bizarre cases and events in local history, including the Perrysville Christmas Eve Massacre of 1934. It wasn’t quite compelling enough for my husband, who wandered off to visit the nearby Rivers Casino.</p>
<p>Every month, the science center holds a themed adult-only event on a Friday night. A true crime night was a popular request attendees of past events made on surveys. This one, although it drew a sellout crowd of 1,200 people, didn’t work out as advertised.</p>
<p>Instead of trying to solve a crime using forensic evidence, patrons circulated around tables where volunteers presented information on forensic science. The stations were somewhat engaging, but the lines resembled those at Disneyland. The really fun presentations, like drawing a composite police sketch, had the longest lines.</p>
<p>I was able to get my fingerprints taken and to do two memory exercises that showed how unreliable eyewitness testimony can be. I also learned about the black market for human organs, with preserved sheep hearts and brains on display. I never saw the dental impression table, and I didn’t bother to wait for the blood-typing table or in the long cash bar lines.</p>
<p>The promised mini-escape room did not materialize. There was a crime scene, but it was a disappointment with a body outline that resembled a cartoon figure. The evidence near the body included a fake tire tread, two fake sneaker prints, and a highly stylized, peel-and-stick blood spatter.</p>
<p>It was clear many people worked hard to make the event a success, but I was wishing for a real sleuthing experience with suspects, a narrative and scientific experiments to identify culprits.</p>
<p>Two good examples are the traveling Crime Lab Detective exhibit developed by the Museum of Discovery in Little Rock, Ark., and the International Exhibition of Sherlock Holmes, another traveling exhibit that made stops at museums in Denver and Jersey City, N.J.</p>
<p>So, please, science center event planners, throw another true crime adult night. It won’t be easy. The rewards, however, could exceed all expectations.</p>
