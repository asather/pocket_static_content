<h1>Federal courts in Western Pa. postpone cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All federal civil and criminal trials in the federal courthouses in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown set to start before April 27 have been postponed because of the coronavirus but most other court actions will continue at the discretion of the judges, Chief Judge Mark Hornak has ruled.</p>
<p>The judge said all trial-related deadlines and orders will remain in effect unless the presiding judge modifies them. He encouraged the judges to be flexible to ensure fairness for all parties.</p>
<p>Pleas, sentencings, conferences and hearings for criminal defendants will continue at the discretion of the judges, although video and phone conferences are being encouraged to minimize travel.</p>
<p>The judge also ruled that the weeks from March 13 to April 27 will be excluded in the time calculations for criminal defendants under the Speedy Trial Act. The judge said the ends of justice outweigh the interests of parties in a speedy trial.</p>
<p>Judge Hornak also ruled that magistrate judges will continue to conduct arraignments and detention hearings as needed, although some may be done by video.</p>
<p>The various federal grand juries already in session will continue to hear cases.</p>
<p>Special programs run by the federal courts, such as veterans' court and the RISE court, will be postponed until April 27.</p>
<p>Several federal judges in Pittsburgh on Monday began issuing orders postponing proceedings in their various criminal and civil cases or canceling in-person conferences in favor of phone conferences. U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon, for example, posted a standing order for all of her criminal cases saying they will be stayed until further notice except for proceedings that can be handled by phone.</p>
