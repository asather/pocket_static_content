<h1>Pennsylvania launches new program to extend unemployment benefits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania has launched a new program to provide an additional 13 weeks of unemployment compensation for people who exhaust their benefits.</p>
<p>The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program is part of the federal government’s package to provide economic relief to those who have been affected by COVID-19 and the resulting business closures and historic spike in unemployment rates.</p>

<p>The PEUC program, which officially launched in Pennsylvania on Sunday, is for individuals whose regular unemployment benefits have expired or will expire soon.</p>
<p>Traditionally, eligible individuals can receive unemployment benefits until their benefit year expires —&nbsp;one year after their application date, or until they have received their maximum benefit amount. That amount is based on how long the individual worked in a given time period and how much they earned.</p>
<p>In general, individuals collecting benefits are eligible for compensation for up to 26 weeks, according to information on the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry’s website.</p>
<p>The PEUC program provides 13 weeks of additional benefits to eligible individuals, beginning the week ending April 4, 2020, through the end of the year.</p>
<p>It works in much the same way as traditional unemployment compensation: Individuals will receive a financial determination letter in the mail, they will file biweekly claims and they will receive benefits at the same rate as regular unemployment.</p>
<p>They will also receive an additional $600 weekly through July through a separate federal program to provide economic relief during the novel coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>If an individual already has an open unemployment compensation claim, the 13 additional weeks will automatically be added to the existing claim. If an individual’s benefit year has expired, they must submit an <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/file/Pages/Filing-for-PEUC.aspx" target="_blank">online application here</a>, or through a <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/file/Documents/PEUC%20Application_EUC-8%20REV%2005-20.pdf" target="_blank">paper application here.</a></p>
<p>According to a press release announcing the new program, individuals could be eligible for unemployment compensation if they:</p>
<p>Since March 15, Pennsylvania has made 15.7 million payments to claimants totaling nearly $7.9 billion in benefits, according to the release.</p>
