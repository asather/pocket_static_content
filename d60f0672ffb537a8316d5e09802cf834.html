<p>A 20-year-old man was fatally shot in the parking lot of Monroeville Mall Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police said the shooting was reported at 1:24 p.m. and first responders found the man was shot in the chest. He was taken to a hospital and pronounced dead.</p>
<p>Police said evidence appears to show that the shooting occurred during an argument and that the victim was not randomly targeted.</p>
<p>Monroeville Police Chief Doug Cole said the argument broke out between three individuals who seemed to know each other, one of whom was the victim.</p>
<p>The victim was then shot and went into the front entrance of the mall’s west court, but he collapsed in the foyer. The chief did not offer information on how many shots were fired.</p>
<p>The two individuals fled in a maroon sedan. Police arrived within four minutes of the shooting.</p>
<p>Police consulted with management and the mall remained open beyond the areas near the Party City entrance, which were blocked off with police tape.</p>
<p>County homicide investigators are taking the lead on the case. Chief Cole said there are many cooperating witnesses and he is “very confident” the case will he solved.</p>
