<h1>Steelers are among the 2021 Super Bowl favorites</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ready to bet on the next Super Bowl yet?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps not, considering the confetti has only just settled on Kansas City’s big game victory over San Francisco on Sunday night. When you are ready, though, sports books are already prepared to take your action on the winner of the NFL’s next championship, and the Steelers are among the favorites.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/chalk/story/_/id/28623783/chiefs-favored-6-1-las-vegas-repeat-super-bowl-champs" target="_blank">Caesars Sportsbook</a> in Las Vegas seems particularly high on the team’s chances to compete upon quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s expected return from injury. That operation lists them as the sixth favorite at 15-1 odds behind Kansas City (6-1), Baltimore (7-1), San Francisco (8-1), New Orleans (11-1) and New England (14-1.)&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others are not quite as high on the Steelers but offer similar odds. Here’s a sampling:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bovada.lv/sports/football" target="_blank">Bovada</a>: Ninth favorite, 22-1 odds</p>
<p>● Fanduel: Tied for 11th favorite, 22-1 odds</p>
<p>● DraftKings: Tied for 11th favorite, 22-1 odds</p>
<p>● FoxBet: Tied for eighth favorite, 20-1 odds</p>
<p>● Rivers Pittsburgh: Tied for 11th favorite, 22-1 odds</p>
<p>If you already plan to bet on the Steelers in the futures market, now might be a good time to pounce, as uncertainty remains about Roethlisberger’s recovery from elbow surgery.</p>
<p>If he receives encouraging news from his checkup <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/31/ben-roethlisberger-injury-update-mike-tomlin-steelers/stories/201912310108" target="_blank">scheduled for this past weekend</a>, then the Steelers’ odds may improve but offer less value. And if the news isn’t so great, well, the 2019 season shows the Steelers may not warrant a futures bet at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Quarterback Tom Brady’s impending free agency is another big factor looming over the futures market. So big, in fact, that you can bet on his landing spot in some places, too.&nbsp;</p>
<p>OddShark, via BetOnline, lists New England as the overwhelming favorite to retain his services at -300. If he’s going to play somewhere else, though, oddsmakers like the Los Angeles Chargers (2-1), Dallas Cowboys (7-1), Las Vegas Raiders (7-1) and Indianapolis Colts (8-1.)</p>
<p>The Steelers, in case you’re wondering, are next to last on that list at 33-1.&nbsp;</p>
