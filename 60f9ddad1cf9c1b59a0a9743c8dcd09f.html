<h1>Broadway in Pittsburgh juggles lineup again, aims for October opening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The revamped 2020-21 PNC Broadway in Pittsburgh season, put forth with fingers-crossed on March 30, has been revised and rearranged again.</p>
<p>Changes were inevitable from the moment Broadway announced it would not be back in business until Sept. 6, and there remains no consensus plan for how live theater will come back from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>In the new version of the 2020-21 season, “Ain’t Too Proud,” the Temptations musical originally scheduled to open the season on Aug. 25-30, moves to the following season. “Hadestown,” the 2019 Tony-winning musical, is the new opener, starting Oct. 27.</p>
<p>“To Kill a Mockingbird,” originally due here Nov. 24-29, is still up in the air, while “The Cher Show” (Feb. 23-28) has postponed its tour, with new dates to be announced beginning in the fall of 2021.</p>
<p>The good news on the new schedule is that the musical adaptation of “Tootise” is in the lineup, but not until August 2021.</p>

<p>“Summer: The Donna Summer Musical,” originally scheduled for April at Heinz Hall, is rescheduled for Feb.16-21 at the Benedum Center, replacing “The Cher Show.” (Ticket holders will be notified regarding the change in date and venue.)</p>
<p>With the many challenges facing tours, “there may be additional unforeseen scheduling changes,” said Marc Fleming, the Trust’s vice president of marketing, communications and Broadway programming.</p>
<p>He added that season ticket sales have been&nbsp;“strong” despite the uncertainty of when it will be safe to return to theaters.&nbsp;If performances are rescheduled or canceled, ticket buyers will have the option to receive a refund or an exchange for another performance. Or they may donate the value of the ticket to benefit the Trust.</p>
