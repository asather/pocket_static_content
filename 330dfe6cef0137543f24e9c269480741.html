<h1>Trevor Williams eyes return to form in season ahead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Trevor Williams didn’t mince words when discussing his offseason a couple months ago following major changes to the Pirates’ front office.</p>
<p>“I’ve taken this offseason as the most important offseason of my career,” Williams told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “I’m looking forward to coming into spring training and getting with the new coaches and new staff members that can help elevate my game individually.”</p>
<p>While Williams remains an integral part of the Pirates having a better starting rotation in 2020, there are plenty of areas where he can improve.</p>
<p>In his own words, Williams said he needs to more consistently repeat his delivery, something he did not do effectively enough after returning from a right-side strain.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to say I rushed it; however, I overlooked a lot of red flags,” Williams said. “With my delivery, I was just making sure my body felt right rather than whether my body was good enough to pitch consistently with how I am.”</p>
<p>A failure to consistently repeat his delivery forced some of Williams’ numbers to slip. A year after pitching to a 3.11 ERA, that number ballooned to 5.38 in 26 starts — 6.58 after the injury. He also saw both his barrel percentage (5.8 to 8.3) and launch angle (12.9 to 16.4) increase.</p>
<p>Whereas Williams was very good against left-handed hitters in 2018, holding them to a .228 average, .342 slugging percentage and .637 OPS, he struggled against lefties this past season — a .335 batting average against along with a .561 slugging percentage and .952 OPS.</p>
<p>Williams also allowed home runs twice as frequently as he did the season before, his home run rate per nine innings jumping from .79 to 1.67.</p>
<p>“For me it’s being consistent with my delivery and recognizing certain delivery faults, sequencing pitches better and throwing my off-speed in all counts,” Williams said. “I started to do it during my last few starts of the year. I was incorporating my curveball more, and it was effective when I was using it.”</p>
<p>Perhaps continuing to lean more on his curveball will allow Williams’ four-seam fastball and slider to play better. After hitters slugged .338 against his four-seamer in 2018, that mark shot up to .509 in 2019. With his slider, the slugging percentage went from .396 to .528.</p>
<p>Williams’ pitch mix also got out of whack, with the right-hander throwing about 5 percent more sliders and roughly 3 percent fewer four-seam fastballs.</p>
<p>Physically, Williams said his body “feels really good.” New Pirates pitching coach Oscar Marin actually lives in the Phoenix valley, near Williams, and the two of them plan to get together at some point before spring training to talk about areas where Williams can improve.</p>
<p>“I’m looking forward to getting to know him and starting those building blocks on what I need from him and what he sees in me and how we can go and become the best pitcher I can be,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Fixing what ailed Williams in 2018 doesn’t require a total overhaul, but it will also be necessary if the Pirates are going to pitch better than they did in the previous season.</p>
<p>“The fans deserve so much,” Williams said. “They’ve been in a tough spot the past few years. That’s on us as players with performance. We need to do a better job so that they’re wanting to come to the ballpark and cheer on their hometown team.”</p>
