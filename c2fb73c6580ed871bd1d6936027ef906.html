<h1>Owner of Elliott home where drug raid sickened police gets time served, probation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The man whose home was the site of a drug raid that sent 18 city cops to the hospital for fentanyl exposure was sentenced Tuesday to time served, or about 29 months, plus three years of probation.</p>
<p>Anthony Lozito, 40, had let Lynell Guyton use his house on Bond Street to package fentanyl imported from China and helped him prepared it for distribution in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>When the city's SWAT team raided the residence in the summer of 2017, someone knocked over a table and sent fentanyl powder flying into the air. The exposure briefly sickened some of the officers and 18 of them went to the hospital for evaluation as a precaution, although none was injured.</p>
<p>Federal agents then called in a special state police laboratory team to conduct a search of the house that revealed drug-trafficking evidence.</p>
<p>Guyton, the ringleader, had been the main target of the investigation. He was convicted Jan. 10 on numerous counts related to fentanyl distribution, gun possession and money-laundering. Prosecutors said he bought fentanyl from sources in China and Hong Kong and distributed it in Pittsburgh with his associates, Lozito among them.</p>
<p>Lozito pleaded guilty in September to conspiracy charges. Prosecutors said he packaged large quantities of fentanyl for Guyton at the Bond Street house from May 2017 to August of that year.</p>
<p>He, Guyton and two other cohorts were there when police and federal agents executed a search warrant on Aug. 9, 2017.</p>
<p>Lozito admitted that he allowed Guyton to use the property for fentanyl packaging in exchange for drugs.</p>
<p>Guyton, who tried to represent himself at trial two weeks ago and then changed his mind and let a lawyer take over, was quickly convicted. He is awaiting sentencing and faces decades behind bars.</p>
