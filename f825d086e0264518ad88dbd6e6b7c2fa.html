<h1>Lower Youghiogheny makes a top 10 endangered rivers list</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Washington, D.C., conservation organization is directing national attention toward southwestern Pennsylvania’s “endangered” Youghiogheny River.</p>
<p>From its headwaters in Maryland, the historic Yough drops through some of the best whitewater rapids in the eastern United States and parallels the popular Great Allegheny Passage hiking and biking trail. The river pools in a reservoir known for muskellunge, largemouth bass and recreational boating and drains through a bottom-release dam that supports an exceptional coldwater trout fishery. Winding through lowlands west of the Appalachian Mountains, the Yough attracts smallmouth and walleye anglers and provides drinking water for more than 70 municipalities before merging with the Monongahela River at McKeesport.</p>
<p>Once nearly destroyed by logging sedimentation and coal mine leakage, the 134-mile waterway bounced back following the Clean Water Act of the 1970s and decades of work by conservationists. The state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources designated the Youghiogheny River its 2008 River of the Year based on its importance as a recreational economic magnet. More recently, a serious fracking threat was eased by a waning demand for natural gas.</p>
<p>In April, the nonprofit group American Rivers included the Youghiogheny’s lower waters on its annual Top 10 list of America’s Most Endangered Rivers. Among new threats, the group cited sedimentation from pipeline construction and a Westmoreland County fracking-waste disposal plant several miles from the waterway. Meetings and permitting for a proposed gas-fired power plant just off the Youghiogheny near Elizabeth were postponed among statewide COVID-19 precautions.</p>
<p>Sean Jackson of American Rivers called on Gov. Tom Wolf to require a thorough assessment of potential impacts to the Yough, which he described as, “one of our state’s greatest natural treasures.”</p>
<p>“Local communities, families and visitors depend on this river for its clean drinking water and endless recreational opportunities,” said Mr. Jackson in a statement. “Fracking puts all of this at risk. The fate of the river and its communities are in Gov. Wolf’s hands.”</p>
<p>Neither MAX Environmental Technologies, which runs the fracking waste site, nor Invenergy LLC, the Chicago-based company proposing construction of the power plant, have commented on the American Rivers initiative.</p>
<p>The group’s 2020 list of endangered waterways also includes the upper Mississippi River and lower Missouri River.</p>
<p><strong>Fish for free</strong></p>
<p>On July 4, Pennsylvania celebrates the right to free fishing. On the second of the state’s 2020 Fish-for-Free Days, residents and nonresidents of any age can legally fish on state waterways with no fishing license or permits required. All other fishing regulations and private property laws apply.</p>
<p>State law requires the Fish-for-Free Days to be held on Memorial Day and Independence Day. For about a month, state Rep. Bill Kortz, D-Allegheny, has been trying to reel in cosponsors for a bill that would double the number of Fish-for-Free Days.&nbsp;The problem with the current law, he said, is the weather. A couple of rainy days and its purpose is defeated.</p>
<p>“That’s why I want to expand the Fish-for-Free program to require the executive director of the [Fish and Boat] Commission to declare four such days each year, allowing more opportunities for people to take part,” said Mr. Kortz, minority chair of the House Game and Fisheries Committee. “Fishing is a great way to spend time outdoors and is a welcome respite during these challenging times. Expanding these opportunities will result in more Pennsylvanians giving fishing a try.”</p>
