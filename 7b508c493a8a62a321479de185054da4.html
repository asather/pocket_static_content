<h1>Mt. Lebanon School District employee tests positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An employee at Mt. Lebanon School District has been tested positive for COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Parents of Howe Elementary in the school district were notified by email late Wednesday afternoon that an employee at the school tested positive for COVID-19. According to the letter, which was obtained by the Post-Gazette, the district has reported the information to the Allegheny County Health Department and is&nbsp;“taking all recommended steps to ensure the safety of our students and staff.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The district states they are taking steps in response to the news by cleaning and sanitizing the building and cooperating with the health department on contact tracing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The individual will not return to our school until they have complete the procedures for COVID-19,” the school wrote in the letter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Students have been learning remotely since classes resumed in August, and they are not expected to be in the school buildings until October.</p>
<p><strong><em>Correction, made at 9:03 p.m. on Sept. 16, 2020:</em></strong><em> An earlier version of this article stated that a teacher of Howe Elementary tested positive for COVID-19. However, the letter states it was an employee.</em></p>
