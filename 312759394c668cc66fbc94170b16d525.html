<h1>Sen. Cortez Masto removes herself as a candidate for Biden’s vice president</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada took herself out of the running to be presumptive Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s running mate, saying she wanted to focus on helping her state recover from the coronavirus crisis.</p>
<p>Cortez Masto, the first Latina elected to the U.S. Senate, had been named as one of the women whom Biden was considering for his vice president.</p>
<p>“It is an honor to be considered as a potential running mate but I have decided to withdraw my name from consideration,” she said in a statement. “Nevada’s economy is one of the hardest hit by the current crisis and I will continue to focus on getting Nevadans the support they need to get back on their feet.”</p>
<p>Cortez Masto’s statement confirms what she told CBS News back in November 2019 - that if asked she would say no.</p>
<p>Cortez Masto replaced former senator Harry Reid in the Senate in 2016. Reid released a statement about her decision not to vie for the vice president slot, calling her a “truly gifted leader who always puts Nevada first, and I will continue supporting her however I can.”</p>
<p>Cortez Masto was seen as a smart pick for Biden to ingratiate himself with Latino voters, a group he struggled to win over during the Democratic primary. Her decision to withdraw herself from consideration leaves Biden with at least one other Latina pick, New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham.</p>
<p>Biden has committed to picking a woman as his number two. Minority communities have called on him to pick a woman of color.</p>
<p>Others believed to be contenders are Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, Rep. Val Demings of Florida and former Georgia state representative Stacey Abrams.</p>
<p>Biden said Wednesday during a virtual fundraiser that he planned to announce his choice by Aug. 1. He said he was looking for someone who aligned with him ideologically, but would also challenge him.</p>
