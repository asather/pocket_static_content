<h1>Penguins forward Nick Bjugstad begins skating again as his rehab from core muscle surgery continues </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penguins forward Nick Bjugstad’s recovery from core muscle surgery took a notable step forward on Saturday afternoon, when he skated individually prior to the team’s practice.</p>
<p>“It’s real encouraging,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “We’ll see where it goes, but that certainly indicates significant progress.”</p>
<p>Bjustad has not played since a Dec. 15 game against the New Jersey Devils and underwent core muscle surgery a few days later. The Penguins estimated that he’d be sidelined at least eight weeks. He’s now been out more than 12 weeks.</p>
<p>The rehab process has followed a nonlinear trajectory. A few weeks ago, Bjugstad was skating individually and even went on the team's West Coast trip the second week of January to continue his rehab around the team. But just when it looked like perhaps Bjugstad would join the team for practice, he instead went the other direction and went back to off-ice treatments.</p>
<p>Asked at the time if Bjugstad had endured a setback, Sullivan said, “He hasn’t had a setback, per se… There are always improvements and plateaus as part of the rehab process, especially when it involves a longer-term injury like Nick’s.”</p>
<p>For now the biggest question surrounding Bjugstad is: When will he return? But soon, the team could be asking: Where will he play?</p>
<p>With left winger Jason Zucker now in the fold, the Penguins have more forward depth than they have in months. That depth – coupled with Jared McCann’s natural ability to play center – creates some options for the Penguins when Bjugstad eventually returns.</p>
<p>“We can use him at a center-ice capacity and then he could be our third-line center,” Sullivan said. “We could use him on the wing, in which case we can use him anywhere. All options are on the table.”</p>
<p><strong>Kahun skates again in non-contact jersey</strong></p>
<p>Meanwhile, in other injury news, Dominik Kahun’s concussion rehab remains on track.</p>
<p>Kahun, who was injured during a 4-3 win over the Bruins on Jan. 19, rejoined practice in a non-contact jersey on Thursday. He again sported a gray, non-contact sweater during Saturday’s practice.</p>
<p>Sullivan said there’s no change in Kahun’s status but that he’s making progress. Kahun plans to skate individually prior to Sunday’s game against the Red Wings.</p>
<p>“I’m going 100% for sure already,” Kahun said. “We’re going to figure out when I can go with contact and then I’ll be ready to play. I’m very positive about it.”</p>
<p><strong>Penguins ‘sign’ six kids from Make-A-Wish</strong></p>
<p>Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford stepped to the microphone at the team’s practice facility in Cranberry on Saturday, ready to announce six new additions to the team.</p>
<p>“It’s been a little difficult for me trying to figure out the cap,” Rutherford joked. “But late last night with the analytics guy, we were able to do that.”</p>
<p>No, he wasn't talking about the Zucker trade this time. Instead, Saturday was about making the day of six young fans from the Make-A-Wish program. Jessica, Michael, Hughes, Allison, Brayden and Morgan filed into the room and signed their one-day “contract” with the Penguins.</p>
<p>“Every single one of those kids is great," McCann said. "The Penguins do a great job with ‘Make-A-Wish’ to let us be involved with them and get to know them. They’re amazing kids. We’re lucky to meet them."</p>
<p>In addition to the signing-day press conference, the kids were treated to breakfast with the player in the locker room. After practice, they joined selected Penguins on the ice for a skate at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex. All six families will attend Sunday’s game against the Red Wings at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>“It certainly puts things into perspective for us when you see some of the challenges that this group is going through in their personal lives,” Sullivan said. “For us to have the opportunity to bring them a day of happiness and inspiration, it’s the least we can do.</p>
<p>“Really, the real benefactors are us. Because they inspire us. That’s how I look at it.”</p>
<p><strong>Aston-Reese snaps his slump</strong></p>
<p>Zach Aston-Reese is part of a critical line for the Penguins. As the left winger on the line featuring center Teddy Blueger and right wing Brandon Tanev, Aston-Reese is often asked to start shifts in his defensive zone and help shut down the opponent’s top players. All these tasks, he’s living up to expectations.</p>
<p>But the winger admits himself, he’d like to have a little more offense.</p>
<p>He found it Friday night. With time winding down, Aston-Reese buried the puck in the empty net, snapping his 14-game scoreless streak with just his second goal in the past 31 games.</p>
<p>“It’s a lot easier when there’s no goalie there,” Aston-Reese joked.</p>
<p>Okay, true. But a goal is a goal. Perhaps it’s the spark to add a little more offensive fire to his game.</p>
<p>“I know all these guys want to score,” Sullivan said. “When it doesn’t happen for a while, it’s a natural inclination to squeeze your stick a little bit. Maybe that takes a little pressure off.”</p>
<p><strong>Penguins to host ‘Hockey Day in America’</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins will host “Hockey Day in America” when the Penguins take on the Detroit Red Wings on Sunday. The game-day event is a celebration of all levels of Pittsburgh amateur hockey, including sled hockey, special needs hockey, blind hockey and the Pittsburgh Warriors Disabled Veterans Hockey Team.</p>
<p>There will be six “DICK’S Sporting Goods Junior Starters,” representing Southpointe Grizzlies Special Hockey, Mighty Penguins Sled Hockey, Pittsburgh Rhinos Blind Hockey, Pittsburgh I.C.E., DICK’S Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Penguins Elite and the Little Penguins.</p>
<p>In addition, Damien Gabis, a member of the Pittsburgh Warriors Disabled Veterans Hockey Team, will be honored before the game. Damien, who received a Purple Heart after being seriously injured in Afghanistan, returned from his army service to earn a college degree at the University of Pittsburgh and is currently employed as a social worker.</p>
