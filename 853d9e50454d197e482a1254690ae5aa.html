<h1>North Catholic's Isaac and Dave DeGregorio earn all-state honors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>North Catholic’s Isaac DeGregorio found his name on the all-state team when the Pennsylvania Sports Writers All-State Team for Class 3A was released Wednesday.</p>
<p>Like father, like son.</p>
<p>Isaac, a senior at North Catholic, and his dad, coach Dave DeGregorio, were both honored. Isaac was a second-team selection, while Dave was named coach of the year.</p>
<p>The DeGregorios <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/02/27/North-Catholic-boys-Lincoln-Park-WPIAL-Class-3A-basketball-championship-Petersen-Events-Center-DeGregorio/stories/202002280006" target="_blank">formed a WPIAL championship father-son combo</a> this season, leading North Catholic to the WPIAL Class 3A title and PIAA quarterfinals before the season was stopped because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Isaac and Dave are just the second father-son tandem from the WPIAL to earn all-state recognition in the same season in the last 10 years. In 2016, Mars’ Rob Carmody was Class 3A coach of the year and Robby Carmody made the first team.</p>
<p>Isaac DeGregorio, a 5-foot-11 guard, averaged 17.9 points per game this season while helping the Trojans go 26-2. He made 86 3-pointers and shot 87% from the free-throw line. A third-team all-state pick his junior season, DeGregorio finished his career with 1,563 points, 283 3-pointers and 440 assists. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/30/john-calipari-kentucky-isaac-degregorio-north-catholic-recruiting-basketball/stories/202003300050" target="_blank">He will continue his career as a preferred walk-on at Kentucky</a>. DeGregorio’s grandfather, Joe, coached Kentucky coach John Calipari in college.</p>
<p>This year’s WPIAL title was Dave DeGregorio’s first as a head coach. He’s 47-8 in two seasons at North Catholic. He previously led Pine-Richland and North Allegheny to WPIAL runner-up finishes. Another of Dave’s sons, Owen, was a junior guard who saw time off the bench.</p>
<p>Two other WPIAL players were selected to Class 2A all-state teams — Steel Valley senior guard Cam Polak and Lincoln Park senior guard Isaiah Smith were third-team picks. Polak was second in the WPIAL in scoring with 30.6 points a game. Smith averaged 14.2 points a game and led Lincoln Park to the WPIAL final and PIAA quarterfinals. Smith finds himself on the all-state team for the third time. He was a second-team pick in 2019 and made the third team as a sophomore when he played at Sewickley Academy. Both Polak and Smith will play at Division II schools — Polak at West Chester and Smith at Caldwell.</p>
<p>Camp Hill Trinity sophomore point guard Chance Westry was named player of the year. Westry averaged 24.4 points a game and already has offers from the likes of Michigan, Syracuse and Georgetown. Like Westry, Westtown School senior forward Noah Collier was a first-team honoree. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/2019/09/23/pitt-panthers-basketball-recruiting-noah-collier-jeff-capel-westtown-school-clemson-cal/stories/201909230127" target="_blank">Collier is a Pitt recruit</a>.</p>
