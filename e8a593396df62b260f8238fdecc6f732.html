<h1>Pittsburgh Public Schools opens tech support centers for students</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools is offering in-person tech support for students and families experiencing problems with their district-issued devices.</p>
<p>District officials said families can make an appointment over the next two weeks to bring the devices to one of five Technology Resource Centers located at:</p>
<p>▪&nbsp;Pittsburgh CAPA School -- 111 9th St., Downtown.</p>
<p>▪ Pittsburgh Carrick -- 125 Parkfield St., Carrick.</p>
<p>▪ Pittsburgh King -- 50 Montgomery Place, North Side.</p>
<p>▪ Pittsburgh Langley -- 2940 Sheraden Blvd., Sheraden</p>
<p>▪ Pittsburgh Obama -- 515 N. Highland Ave., East Liberty</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Technology Resource Centers will be open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m., weekdays through Oct. 2.</p>
<p>“We want all PPS families to have&nbsp;secure, functional devices for E-Learning,”&nbsp;said Mark Stuckey, the district’s interim chief technology officer.</p>
<p>Families can&nbsp;schedule an appointment <a href="https://pghboe.az1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_6QGiQKZNBIiI2wJ" target="_blank">by visiting this PPS district webpage</a>. Parents are asked to arrive 10 minutes before their appointment, and to bring their district-issued device, charger, and student log in information to the&nbsp;appointment.&nbsp;Some walk-ins will be allowed, district officials said.</p>
<p>The district, which launched its school year fully online, said remote learning has gone more smoothly after some first-day internet bottlenecks. In one instance,&nbsp;PPS blocked student access to a website, SafeYouTube.net, after users in the district and elsewhere around the country found video links that had been hacked, leading to inappropriate sites.</p>
