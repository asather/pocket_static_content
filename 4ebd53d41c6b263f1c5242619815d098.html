<h1>ESPN's Desmond Howard disappointed with how Penn State is handling season postponement </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Big Ten commissioner Kevin Warren isn’t a popular man in many places as the reality of a season without football sets in University Park and all over the conference. Warren has taken the shots from pundits all over America since the league announced that the 2020 season would not happen in the fall.</p>
<p>Parents are protesting against the decision. Coaches, including Penn State coach James Franklin, have openly challenged Warren. The Pac-12 postponed its season on the same day. Warren’s counterpart Larry Scott hasn’t had a school in his league threaten to play unsanctioned like Nebraska did to Warren.</p>
<p>Making a historic decision is often a lonely place. Warren is in that spot with few allies. While Warren doesn’t have a lot of people speaking on his behalf, there is at least one in former Michigan star and Super Bowl MVP Desmond Howard, who’s currently a rising media star at ESPN.</p>
<p>The stark difference in persecution that Warren is receiving compared to the silence from other conferences that have postponed caused Howard to speak up.</p>
<p>“None of this would’ve happened if (former commissioner) Jim Delaney was still sitting in the seat as the man in charge,” Howard told the Post-Gazette. “This is not a Kevin Warren decision. By job title, he has to take the arrows and fall on the sword, so to speak. But you don’t get all of this with Jim Delaney in charge. You don’t have Scott Frost as the head coach of Nebraska coming out against Delaney before the decision is made.</p>
<p>“If Scott would’ve tried that with Delaney, he would’ve gotten a stern phone call within minutes. A lot of people are taking Kevin’s kindness for weakness.”</p>
<p>Howard is bothered by the lack of transparency from the conference presidents and chancellors. An example of what Howard sees as a lack of support Warren happened on Monday at Penn State.</p>
<p>Athletic director Sandy Barbour spoke to reporters for the first time since the season was postponed. The inevitable question came when a reporter asked how president Eric Barron voted. Barbour’s answer was as confounding as it was succinct.</p>
<p>“It’s unclear whether there was ever a vote or not,” Barbour said.&nbsp;“Nobody has ever told me there was. I don’t know whether there was a vote by the chancellors and presidents.”</p>
<p>Howard understands that Warren has to be the voice. But he also believes that presidents and chancellors should have to answer for their decisions.</p>
<p>“How can Sandy come out and say she didn’t know if there was a vote?” Howard said. “The athletic director reports directly to the president. All she had to do was make a phone call. If Delaney is in that seat, Sandy isn’t going to break breath to make such a comment.”</p>
<p>As a 50-year-old, Howard doesn’t run as fast as he did on his 99-yard kick return in Super Bowl XXXI. However, his mind might work quicker. He isn’t here for the games.</p>
<p>“To be quite honest with you, she’s throwing her president under the bus,” Howard said. “She should know if her president was in that room. She should know how Barron voted. That’s a bad look for Penn State. There is a lack of communication. She has to know if there was a vote. The president is supposed to communicate.”</p>
<p>Warren confirmed that a vote was taken in a letter posted to the Big Ten website on Wednesday. He explained the reasoning behind the choice to postpone the season.</p>
<p>“The vote by the Big Ten Council of Presidents and Chancellors (COP/C) was overwhelmingly in support of postponing fall sports and will not be revisited,” Warren said in the letter. “The decision was thorough and deliberative, and based on sound feedback, guidance, and advice from medical experts.”</p>
<p>To no one’s surprise, the letter wasn’t enough explanation for many people. Howard is upset that he won’t get to watch Big Ten football, but he respects Warren and the choice.</p>
<p>“It is tough for everybody. I talk about college football for a living,” Howard said. “It hurts to see the conference that means so to me and that I played in not have a season. It is not something they took lightly. You hear pundits talk about how much money these conferences make and how money hungry they are. They always say that it is about money.</p>
<p>“But, to me, it’s refreshing to see a conference say that the risks are too high.”</p>
