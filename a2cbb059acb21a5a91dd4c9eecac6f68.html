<h1>Police, DEA bust pot, psychedelic mushroom grow operation in Stanton Heights house</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police and the Drug Enforcement Administration dismantled what they described as a marijuana and psychedelic mushroom grow operation inside a Stanton Heights house and arrested the three occupants.</p>
<p>Narcotics detectives made the bust Friday around 6 a.m. after executing a search warrant in the 1600 block of Trinity Street.</p>
<p>Police said they found four guns, 72 marijuana plants, psychedelic mushrooms, butane hash oil extract, THC oil and wax and drug paraphernalia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Arrested were Robert Douglass, 73; Bruce Douglass, 27; and Quinnton Kouchak, 26.&nbsp;Police were not sure of the relationship between the Douglasses.</p>
<p>Detectives also found two dogs and a pet snake.</p>
<p>Robert Douglass told police that he was the renter and cultivated marijuana and psilocybin, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>There were marijuana grow tents in the basement with lights, air filtration and irrigation systems, police said.</p>
<p>A THC manufacturing station was found on the kitchen counter, the complaint said.</p>
<p>“The large amount of marijuana throughout the house, marijuana plants, loose marijuana, THC liquid, THC wax, psilocybin&nbsp;(hallucinogenic mushrooms), marijuana growing lab stations, multiple weapons including pistols and rifles were all easily&nbsp;accessible by all occupants of the residence,” Detective Anthony Nesser wrote in in the complaint.</p>
<p>“I believe that this indicates that Robert Douglass, Bruce Douglass, and Quinnton&nbsp;Kouchak had knowledge of the ongoing illegal enterprise and conspired amongst each other to grow, cultivate and distribute the&nbsp;illegal narcotics found In the home. The majority of the marijuana and marijuana plants were in the dining room, a common area easily accessible and easily observed by all occupants of the residence.”</p>
<p>Police found the Douglasses when they executed the search warrant. They arrested Mr. Kouchak that night, around 8 p.m., as he loaded things into a car outside the house.</p>
<p>Officers said they found drugs, drug paraphernalia, ammunition and a concealed carry permit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All three defendants were arraigned. Bail was denied for Robert Douglass, who has a criminal record in Pennsylvania dating to 1986, and he was taken to the Allegheny County Jail. Bruce Douglass was unable to post $10,000 bail; and Mr. Kouchak was given $5,000 unsecured bond.</p>
