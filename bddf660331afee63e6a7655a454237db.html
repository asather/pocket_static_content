<h1>Downed train causes T delays</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A rail car that lost power near the Washington transit tunnel on Monday morning caused some delays for Port Authorityâ€™s T customers using both lines.</p>
<p>The issue, which has since been resolved, may cause some residual delays, the authority said around 9:30 a.m. on its Twitter account.</p>
<p>As a result of the problem, trains could not use the tunnel and were forced to use the line in Allentown and bypass the Station Square stop.</p>
