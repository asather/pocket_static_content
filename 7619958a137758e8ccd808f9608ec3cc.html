<h1>Tristan Jarry inks three-year deal with Penguins. Now attention turns to Matt Murray</h1>

<p>The Penguins began their transition in net Saturday, signing Tristan Jarry to a three-year deal.</p>
<p>The contract runs through 2022-23 and carries an average annual value of $3.5 million, fair bridge deal for a promising young goalie.</p>
<p>“Tristan is coming off of an All-Star season and has demonstrated the ability to be a regular starter for us,” general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “He is a fundamentally sound young goaltender who we believe is a great asset for the Penguins.”</p>
<p>The Penguins were open to trading Jarry last offseason. But when the right offer didn’t materialize, the 25-year-old netminder began the season as Matt Murray’s backup. At that time, it appeared Murray would be the goalie who would ink a major, multi-year contract to stay with the Penguins following the 2019-20 season. However, when Murray slumped in November, Jarry made the most of the opportunity.</p>
<p>Through 18 starts from October through December, Jarry posted a 13-5-0 record, .938 save percentage and three shutouts. The stretch included a run during which Jarry didn’t allow a goal for a franchise-record 177 minutes, 15 seconds. He was arguably the most-significant reason the Penguins were able to weather a long list of injuries to their biggest names and best players, including when they posted the NHL’s best record during Sidney Crosby’s absence.</p>
<p>In total, Jarry made 33 appearances and recorded a 20-12-1 record. His .921 save percentage ranked eighth-best in the league and his 2.43 goals-against average was ninth-best.</p>
<p>Soft-spoken off the ice, Jarry’s athletic style and confident puck handling were on full display as the season unfolded. Behind the scenes, his improved maturity also became clear. The Penguins chose to keep Jarry in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton last season to work on his practice habits. On several instances he showed those improvements. Most notably, for five months he had nothing but practice during the pandemic pause and then the first three games of the postseason. Yet, when he was asked to jump directly into an elimination playoff game, he was sharp, stopping 20 of 21 shots during a loss to the Montreal Canadiens in the qualifying round.</p>
<p>The move comes just days before Wednesday’s deadline to extend qualifying offers to restricted free agents. This avoids that process and possible arbitration that could have followed.</p>
<p>The focus now <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/30/matt-murray-trade-rumors-possible-suitors-penguins-nhl-draft-free-agency/stories/202009300136" target="_blank">shifts squarely to Murray</a>, who is also a restricted free agent. The Penguins could, in theory, extend a qualifying offer that Murray plays under this year. But Rutherford was candid in the days following the team’s postseason exit, saying that he would likely have to move one of the goalies to stay under the flat $81.5 million salary cap.</p>
<p>Locking down Jarry makes it even more clear which goalie will be on the move. Should the Penguins in fact trade Murray, Casey DeSmith is next on the depth chart.</p>
