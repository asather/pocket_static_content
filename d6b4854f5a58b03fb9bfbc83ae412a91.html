<p>In addition to the art museum, The Frick campus includes gardens and a greenhouse, a car and carriage museum and Clayton, the home of industrialist Henry Clay Frick. The gardens are scheduled to reopen at 10 a.m. July 14.&nbsp;The art museum and Car and Carriage Museum are to reopen Aug. 15. Timed tickets will be required for entry and will be available beginning Aug. 1. Hours will be 10 a.m. until dusk&nbsp;Tuesdays through Sundays.&nbsp;Tours of Clayton have been suspended.</p>
