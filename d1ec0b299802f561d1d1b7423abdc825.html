<h1>Timothy Lydon: Twitter is the driver of disunion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last fall, the general manager of the NBA’s Houston Rockets, Daryl Morey, tweeted in support of the protesters in Hong Kong. His tweet, “Fight for Freedom. Stand with Hong Kong,” was met with fury in China, whose ruling class effectively terminated its relationship with the NBA by ceasing to broadcast its games, and by suspending indefinitely all sponsorship deals between Chinese firms and the league.</p>
<p>There was little to admire about the NBA’s response. Neither the league’s front office, nor any of its team owners or stars, defended Mr. Morey’s tweet. Its biggest star, LeBron James, said, regrettably, that he believed Mr. Morey “wasn’t educated on the situation.” If Mr. Morey’s tweet betrayed his ignorance of Sino American public relations, Mr. James’ response reminds us how easily American enterprises can accept censorship for profit from China.</p>
<p>We can give Mr. James the benefit of the doubt though. He was asked to comment on a political controversy taking place in a country not of his own. His response was either going to provoke more anger from the Chinese, or from China hawks in America. Nebraska’s junior senator, Ben Sasse, did not give Mr. James the benefit of the doubt. After the fallout from Mr. Morey’s tweet, Mr. Sasse circulated a meme on Twitter which featured a young man looking approvingly at a young woman walking by, while his girlfriend looks at him aghast. The man is “LeBron,” the young woman is a “Commie $$$,” and the girlfriend is “Woke Politics.” Mr. Sasse is a Yale and Harvard graduate, a history Ph.D., a highly educated elite and member of the American ruling class who is resorting to one-liners and Twitter owns.</p>
<p>Mr. Sasse’s argument is perplexing. Why would “Woke Politics” (presumably referring to the extreme left wing of the Democratic Party who denounce people on Twitter) care about LeBron James wanting to protect his, and his league’s, investment in China? It was Mr. Sasse and like-minded alarmists who were shrieking in orchestrated hysteria, therefore the role of the girlfriend could have been “Ted Cruz” or “Ben Sasse.”</p>
<p>In another tweet, Mr. Sasse accused Mr.&nbsp;James of “parroting communist propaganda,” writing that “China is running torture camps and you know it.” This type of trolling is incredible from anyone, let alone a U.S. senator. How could Mr. Sasse possibly know if LeBron James knows that China is running torture camps?</p>
<p>Tweets like Mr. Sasse’s are substantively meaningless, yet they are politically beneficial. Patronizing and demeaning tweets move faster online than do statements of praise or conciliation. For public figures, the incentives of using social media to gain prominence and visibility — to create a brand as an “outsider” or an “independent” — are enormous. Meanwhile, the standards of discourse on these platforms have been completely abolished.</p>
<p>Thus Twitter is riddled with pointless talk, exaggerations, false claims, fantasies, self-aggrandizement, self-righteousness, reams of vitriol and a barrage of images, in the form of GIFs and memes, that do little to provide real understanding of any issue. Memes travel through a self-replicating, self-validating, unthinking process. They are the “instruments of anti-discourse,” author Kevin D. Williamson wrote, “designed and deployed to prevent the exchange of information and perspectives rather than to enable it, a weapon of mass intellectual destruction.” Whatever broadens and deepens thought and understanding should be encouraged. Therefore Twitter should not be encouraged.</p>
<p>In a better world, our leaders would be a moderating influence, and would themselves assume personal responsibility for the health of the national conversation. They would teach us how to argue better and disagree more productively. Instead, in this case, we get the least charitable interpretation possible from Mr. Sasse. He may have impugned Mr. James’ character, but he left a great deal unsaid. Like how Mr. James has been a consummate professional from the age of 18, and is now a devoted father and husband, philanthropist, builder of schools and the face of a billion-dollar league. It’s this league that Mr. Sasse has apparently taken issue with.</p>
<p>The banner photograph on his Twitter page is of the 2017 Western&nbsp;Conference NBA All-Star team with Chinese President Xi Jinping inserted into the lineup. Why is he demonizing the NBA and not other U.S. companies that do business in China? He could have posted a photograph of the CEOs or boards of Starbucks, Apple, Nike, Boeing, Coke, KFC, McDonalds, GM, Hilton or Marriott. All these companies must have compromised themselves damningly in the eyes of Mr. Sasse to make the necessary “adjustments” to principle required to do business in China.</p>
<p>Nike, the company that pays Mr. James to wear its shoes, has billions of dollars invested in China. The investment is predicated on people buying Mr. James’ shoes. Mr. Sasse has no such investment, and if he did I’d imagine his remarks would be slightly more guarded.</p>
<p>It’s uniquely puzzling why U.S. senators in particular would want to stay relevant on Twitter. Why add your voice to this brutal cacophony? For senators, discretion is the better part of valor, always.</p>
<p>The Senate is a wiser, older body that maintains a critical distance from “the confusion and intemperance of a multitude,” as James Madison wrote. It was designed as a “necessary fence” against the “fickleness and passion of the public.” Madison knew that in the thick of the fight is not the best vantage point for seeing America. Is this not a trade-off worth taking? To forego slinging mud in exchange for contemplation?</p>
<p>Mr. Sasse is a professor, therefore it should come naturally for him to teach instead of mock. This is an opportunity for persuasion. Arguments are not won by denigrating other people, but by changing their minds. Instead of dismissing someone with ridicule, show how they are mistaken or misguided in their arguments.</p>
<p>“The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,” Oscar Wilde said. This is the logic our public figures use when they reach for their phones every time they have a zinger. But what happens to a tweet unsent? Does it shrivel up like a raisin in the sun? Our elected officials would do well to find out.</p>
