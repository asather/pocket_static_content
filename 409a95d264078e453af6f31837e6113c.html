<h1>'Watch out': DE Rashad Weaver eyes return to Pitt defense following ACL injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rashad Weaver scrolled through his Twitter timeline last week and noticed a college football fan page's post with a few hundred likes.</p>
<p><em>Top 10 defensive lines for 2020.</em></p>
<p>Blue bloods Clemson, Alabama, Georgia and Ohio State led off the list. Understandable. Miami (Fla.) came in at No. 5. OK. Then Florida, Oregon, Penn State, Utah and Wisconsin rounded out the unofficial list. As of Thursday afternoon, 88 people retweeted it. Not a lot, considering what fetches 1,000 RTs these days. But interestingly enough, Weaver was one of the 88.</p>
<p>“I just saw the tweet and retweeted it,” the Pitt defensive end said with a smile. “I guess those top defensive lines have something we don't, or they have some players we don't. I guess we'll see in the fall when the pads come on.”</p>
<p>Fortunately for Weaver (and Pitt), he'll be out there when the Panthers put the pads on and open their season on Sept. 5.</p>
<p>Weaver — the Panthers' 2018 leader in sacks (6.5) and tackles for loss (14) — said it's “not a question” if he'll be fully healed from a torn ACL in time for the 2020 campaign. He's confident he'll be full-go in the fall after going down last August and missing the 2019 season. And he's looking forward to eventually linking up with a front four that guided Pitt's nationally ranked sack brigade.</p>
<p>“I think I can step in and come back to where I left off,” Weaver said. “Everybody at camp and on the team knows where I was at before I got hurt, and they know where I'm at now. And at the end of it, I didn't really lose a step. It's just going to keep getting better until August when I need to be ready.”</p>
<p>Keyword there being “need.” Weaver doesn't <em>need</em> to be ready for contact in March. So he's mostly taking it easy this spring.</p>
<p>The redshirt senior practiced with the team for the first time Monday, when Pat Narduzzi's squad opened spring camp. “Helmet was tight,” Weaver said with a laugh. “Hasn't been worn in a while.” For what it's worth, though, he looked crisp. He knocked out individual drills, showcasing the first-step quickness and hand power that gave offensive tackles fits in previous seasons.</p>
<p>But non-padded work is all Weaver is expected to do this spring. Narduzzi said he and the coaching staff are going to be “smart” with Weaver, along with six or seven other Panthers. All-American defensive tackle Jaylen Twyman was limited Monday and Wednesday. Wide receiver Tre Tipton, coming back from a torn ACL, rode a stationary bike. Defensive tackle Keyshon Camp, also returning from an ACL injury, is in the same boat as Weaver.</p>
<p>“We kinda know what he's got,” Narduzzi said of Weaver. “We're not going to mess it up. We ain't beating anybody.”</p>
<p>“I don't need to be ready this spring. I need to be ready in the fall,” the defensive end added. “We'll take it day by day with how I feel.”</p>
<p>And at this point, Weaver is feeling pretty good. The 6-foot-5 pass rusher said he started running, cutting and planting in the buildup to Pitt's Quick Lane Bowl appearance in December. “Football stuff,” such as swatting a bag to the side, is fluid and fine. But Weaver knows he isn't 100% yet, adding that he's been “humbled” by having to think about things he'd otherwise do naturally, both on the field and in the weight room.</p>
<p>That's all a part of the process Weaver is pushing through, a process that started seven months ago.</p>
<p>On Aug. 9, 2019, Narduzzi announced Weaver would be sidelined for the season. Three weeks later, Camp went down, and it seemed the sky was falling on Pitt's defensive line. But Twyman, Patrick Jones II, Deslin Alexandre and company held it down in the injured duo's absence. Pitt finished last season tied for first nationally in sacks per game (3.92) while Weaver and Camp looked on.</p>
<p>Admittedly, it was hard for Weaver to miss Pitt's season-opening Panther Walk and the team's first game against Virginia. He said it was also difficult not to play in the Penn State game, the last meeting between the rivals for the foreseeable future. But it wasn't hard for him to see unproven guys like Alexandre, Haba Baldonado and John Morgan succeed in filling his cleats. Especially from his vantage point as a team leader, providing in-game advice whenever appropriate.</p>
<p>“When you get out on the sidelines and the game's going, you still get the blood flowing. I'm in the zone like I'm playing, almost. I'm helping those guys and watching the game and wanting to see us win,” Weaver said. “... You give credit where it's due. [The defense] did a good job at certain times in stepping up. ... We've got guys’ back, and we'll just all flow together. We'll be a better version of last year, in my opinion.”</p>
<p>His teammates believe that, too, pointing to Weaver's return as a primary reason why.</p>
<p>When asked what Weaver's presence will mean for Pitt's 2020 defense, safety Paris Ford leaned into a microphone and whispered, “Watch out.” Damar Hamlin, standing next to Ford, agreed: “It's like having another cheat code out there.”</p>
<p>Admiration for what Weaver brings to the table bleeds onto the offensive side of the ball, too.</p>
<p>Tipton — who's dealt with a laundry list of injuries, including two torn ACLs, in his half a decade at Pitt — said he didn't need to lend an ear or offer advice to help Weaver get through the trying times. Instead, it was Weaver's “self-motivated” attitude that lifted him and others up around the South Side facility. An attitude that will serve Weaver well as his full return to the field in September nears.</p>
<p>“He wants to be out here. He knows what he can do,” Tipton said. “He knows his opportunity is coming.”</p>
