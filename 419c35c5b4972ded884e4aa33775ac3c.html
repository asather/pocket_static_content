<h1>Allegheny County could reopen sooner than some other counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Thanks to a relatively minor hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, Allegheny County could be one of the state’s first counties allowed to relax the state’s restrictions, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said Wednesday.</p>
<p>But Mr. Fitzgerald and county health department Director Dr. Debra Bogen said during their weekly online press conference that getting back to true normal won’t happen any time soon.</p>
<p>“We want to open things up as much as the governor does. I know everybody wants to get somewhat back to the normal operations we had,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “But I think we all realize at this point that when we do and we do that, there will be a new normal, and that normal will have a lot of the mitigation things we talked about.”</p>

<p>The reopening of businesses and life in the county, and in the rest of the state, will be done with restrictions for the foreseeable future, they both said, and that won’t be easy to adjust to.</p>
<p>“To keep the virus from spreading as we reopen, we all must continue to stay at least six feet apart, wash our hands, and wear masks when in public,” Dr. Bogen said. “But that’s not how our society works. We want to be close to families and friends. We want to go to Penguins, Pirates and Steelers games, and concerts and festivals with thousands of people. And businesses need customers to thrive. And that’s where the risk is.”</p>
<p>“Until there is a vaccine or an effective treatment, COVID-19 will be in our community,” she said, “and if we are going to start thinking about bringing that community back together, we need to make sure that we are prepared and we do it safely.”</p>
<p>The county reported Wednesday that it has had 1,088 total positive COVID-19 cases so far, with 74 deaths - figures that now include “probable” cases of people who never were tested for the disease, but who had or have symptoms and possible contact with a known infected person.</p>
<p>But Dr. Bogen pointed out that the county has had far too few people tested to consider that an accurate assessment of the spread of the disease in the county, with just about 13,000 people tested so far, or roughly 1% of the entire county.</p>
<p>“And it’s difficult to make decisions for 1.2 million people when you only have data on about 1% of them,” she said. “We need more testing.”</p>
<p>“Any assessment you’re going to hear from me about reopening parts of the county is going to be rooted in the science, the data and the best advice from the medical and public health experts,” she said, two days after a group of people protested Downtown against Gov. Tom Wolf’s quarantine order. “Luckily we have many of those right here in Allegheny County.”</p>
<p>To return to normal, the “roadmap” will need to reach three critical goals, she said: better understanding of the spread of the disease in the community, more testing, and better surveillance to track down every possible case.</p>
<p>The numbers of cases in the county so far have been “very encouraging,” Dr. Bogen said, with daily numbers of new positive cases below 40 every day since April 6, and a steadily decreasing daily number for the last week.</p>
<p>She said she’d like to see many more test sites open up, and to be able to test anyone with any symptoms, including sites at federally qualified health centers, doctors’ offices, pharmacies, drive-thrus and walk-up sites alike. She’d also like to see more self-testing sites like Rite-Aid is doing where people take a sample themselves and then hand it over to someone to test.</p>
<p>Three weeks ago across the county about 500 to 600 people per day were being tested, and that has dropped to about 300 to 400 people a day recently, she said, but it is not clear to the county why that figure is falling.</p>
<p>Beyond testing, if the county is going to open up, it will need to have more people working with the health department to do contact tracing, which is tracking down every person possible who may have had contact with someone who had a positive COVID-19 test result.</p>
<p>“That is something we’re working on,” she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Fitzgerald said he tries to remind people that “this is a marathon and not a sprint.”</p>
<p>“Just because those numbers are good, we don’t want to take our foot off the gas and get complacent. We want to continue to protect our families and our loved ones,” he said.</p>
<p>He said he hopes that the county can open earlier than others if the numbers stay in the right direction.</p>
<p>“We’ve had certain discussions with our friends at the state,” he said. “Because of what we have seen here in Allegheny County over the last month-and-a-half, we do think that there may be some additional relaxation of some of the things that have gone on in other parts of the state.”</p>
<p>But he added, the county doesn’t want to open up too soon.</p>
<p>“So a lot of our experts have been talking about as we get into the fall, there could be a second wave, or there could even be a wave if we open up too soon,” he said. “So this is one of those areas that’s going to take a long time for us to continue to do the mitigation and the physical distance that we’ve talked about until there is a vaccine, or a treatment, or a cure. And until that day comes, all these other things are going to have to be in place.”</p>
<p>He envisions a phased in reopening of businesses with restrictions, including offices that can space people out, or retail that can limit customers, and even manufacturing that operates in shifts to keep the number of people in a facility lower at any one time.</p>
<p>But it will be a long time before some types of businesses can open again.</p>
<p>“I think anywhere where you’d have large crowds, where we used to have large crowds, or we’d have a number of people coming together, I don’t think those things are going to be opening up any time soon,” he said.</p>
