<h1>Pitt part of international consortium to get COVID-19 vaccine grant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research is part of an international consortium of three organizations receiving a $4.9 million grant to develop a COVID-19 vaccine candidate based on measles-vector technology.</p>
<p>The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, known as CEPI, said in a press release Thursday that it is making the grant to Pitt, as well as Themis Bioscience in Austria, and Institut Paseur in France, as part of the coalition’s ongoing investment to attempt to rapidly develop a vaccine.</p>

<p>“All of our efforts will be directed to address this rapidly changing public health emergency,” Dr. Paul Duprex, the director of Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research said in a press release. “We are delighted to be part of this multinational, world-class consortium.”</p>
<p>He added that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/02/27/Pitt-lab-working-to-create-vaccine-for-COVID-19-coronavirus-pittsburgh/stories/202002270194" target="_blank">Pitt’s state-of-the-art facility’s</a> has a “mandated role to respond rapidly to global outbreaks such as COVID-19; to develop animal models of disease; to use these to test the efficacy of candidate vaccines such as recombinant measles viruses expressing a range of SARS-CoV-2 [the virus that causes COVID-19] genes.”</p>
<p>Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research was one of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/02/12/coronavirus-University-of-Pittsburgh-vaccine-Duprex-health-medicine-Salk-polio-China-epidemic/stories/202002120141" target="_blank">first research labs in the country to receive samples of the coronavirus</a> when it received them on Feb. 14 from a patient in Washington state. In addition, Dr. Duprex is one of the world’s leading experts on measles viruses.</p>
<p>Richard Hatchett, CEO of The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, said in the press release that CEPI chose Pitt and its partners’ approach using measles-vector technology because of the science behind the strategy they propose.</p>
<p>“The measles vaccine is used here as a vehicle” against COVID-19, Mr. Hatchett said. “Using the measles vaccine (also called MV) as a vector, recombinant vaccines can be designed to express antigens from other pathogens” including MERS, HIV and yellow fever among others.</p>
<p>“The use of the modified MV as a vehicle for vaccination against these pathogens makes it possible to deliver the antigens directly in the compartments of the immune system capable of inducing a protective memory response” against the virus.</p>
<p>But CEPI also chose the organizations because it had worked before with Themis —&nbsp;to develop a candidate vaccine for SARS —&nbsp;and Institut Pasteur in partnership with Themis to develop candidate vaccines for MERS, Lassa fever and Chikungunya, a mosquito-borne infection.</p>
<p>Themis is an 11-year-old, private vaccine and immunology company. Since 2010, it has had a joint research and development agreement with Institut Pasteur to use the institute’s measles virus vaccine vector technology. Institut Pasteur is a nonprofit that was formed in 1887 by the famed French chemist and microbiologist Louis Pasteur.</p>
<p>CEPI is an international partnership between public, private, philanthropic and civic organizations at the 2017 Davos conference specifically to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. Davos is the informal name of the annual conference held in Davos-Klosters, Switzerland, by the World Economic Forum.</p>
<p>Any vaccine developed by the coalition will be given “to populations when and where they are needed to end an outbreak or curtail an epidemic, regardless of ability to pay,” the press release said.</p>
<p>“The COVID-19 vaccines that we are developing will exist for the benefit of all humanity, in rich, middle income, and poor countries alike.”</p>
<p>The grant awarded Thursday is just the latest made for work on a possible COVID-19 vaccine since the organization put out a call in early February for applications.</p>
<p>It has now awarded a combined $29.9 million toward COVID-19 vaccine proposals, including to seven other institutions around the world, and it hopes to greatly expand the investment.</p>
<p>On March 6, CEPI called for $2 billion in new funding, with a goal of having at least three vaccine candidates for use in the global pandemic.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>So far it has raised $185 million from the governments of Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway and the United Kingdom, and hopes both governments and private-sector partners and philanthropies around the world will invest.</p>
<p>“CEPI was set up to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious threats like COVID-19,” Mr. Hatchett said in the press release. “One of the ways we’re doing this is by bridging the gap between public and private sectors to pool resources and expertise to jump start the vaccine development process.”</p>
<p>“It is clear than an effective vaccine against COVID-19 is crucial if we are to beat this virus,” he said.</p>
<p>“By investing in a range of partners and vaccine technologies, we are giving ourselves the best chance of developing a vaccine that can stop COVID-19.”</p>
