<h1>Ron Cook: Steelers address areas of need to keep pace within division</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Things change quickly in NFL free agency, don’t they?</p>
<p>Wednesday, I was convinced the Cleveland Browns had moved past the Steelers — hard as that was to believe — and that the Baltimore Ravens had surged even further ahead. Both the Browns and Ravens had made impressive moves during a time when the Steelers lost much more of their roster than they added. Starters Javon Hargrave, Mark Barron and Ramon Foster left, as did potential starter B.J. Finney. The team’s only addition was special teams ace Derek Watt.</p>
<p>By Friday, though, my opinion changed. I talked to Ben Roethlisberger the day before and left that conversation thinking he has a real chance to be healthy and productive in 2020. Then came the news the Steelers addressed two areas of need by signing a couple of free agents, guard Stefen Wisniewski and tight end Eric Ebron. They also added to their defensive line depth by trading a fifth-round draft choice for Ravens defensive end Chris Wormley and a seventh-round pick, a rare deal between two bitter rivals.</p>
<p>I still think the Ravens are well ahead of the Steelers, but the gap has closed.</p>
<p>And the season doesn’t start until September, right?</p>
<p>The Roethlisberger news was the best news. He said he has no doubts — “None” — that he will be able to play well in 2020 despite major elbow surgery in September. “I’m throwing without pain for the first time in years,” Roethlisberger told me. “I know I’m not getting any younger, but I feel younger because I don’t have any pain.”</p>
<p>The signing of Wisniewski to a two-year, $2.85 million contract helps to replace the losses of Foster and Finney. He was good enough to start at guard for the winning team in two of the past three Super Bowls. At the very least, he will provide valuable depth.</p>
<p>The agreement with Ebron on a two-year, $12 million deal is a bit more troubling even though his pedigree is strong. He was the 10th player picked in the 2014 draft by the Detroit Lions and had a big season in 2018 with the Indianapolis Colts when Andrew Luck was the team’s quarterback and he had 66 catches for 750 yards and 13 touchdowns. But Ebron fell out of favor with Colts coach Frank Reich last season. First, he went public with complaints about his targets. Then, he had ankle surgery in December, seemingly blindsiding Reich by doing it. The Colts allowed Ebron to leave after giving a big, new deal to their other tight end, Jack Doyle.</p>
<p>I don’t care if Ebron wants the ball. All good pass-catchers do. It’s not as if he’s going to turn into the diva that Antonio Brown is. But that ankle business? That’s frightening. Is it just me, or did you also think about Ladarius Green when the Ebron-to-the-Steelers news broke?</p>
<p>But if Ebron is healthy and stays healthy, he will give Roethlisberger another strong target. He also will provide a little insurance for Vance McDonald, a really good tight end who also has had trouble staying healthy.</p>
<p>I didn’t like the Watt signing at first — not for $3.25 million a year for three years — but that move has grown on me. He replaces not one, but maybe three Steelers special teamers — Rosie Nix, Tyler Matakevich and Anthony Chickillo. Hopefully, he’ll get some time at fullback or perhaps an H-back position. You also have to love those Watt bloodlines.</p>
<p>There are no guarantees with free agents, of course. In 2018, the Steelers signed Morgan Burnett and Jon Bostic. Each lasted just one season. In 2019, the team signed Steven Nelson, Donte Moncrief and Mark Barron. The Steelers hit it big with Nelson, but Moncrief flopped and Barron was released after just one season to free up salary cap room to sign Wisniewski, Ebron and Watt.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be great if Kevin Colbert and Mike Tomlin get a little more out of this latest threesome of free agents?</p>
<p>At least on paper, by adding Wisniewski and Ebron, the Steelers are in position to have a little more flexibility when their first turn comes up at No. 49 in the April draft. The holes on the offensive line and tight end no longer look like craters. The team could go for a running back for depth behind James Conner, who always seems to be hurt and could leave as a free agent after next season. Or it could go for a wide receiver knowing there’s a chance JuJu Smith-Schuster could leave, as well.</p>
<p>Draft flexibility is a wonderful thing.</p>
<p>It should help the Steelers chase down the Ravens and stay ahead of the Browns.</p>
