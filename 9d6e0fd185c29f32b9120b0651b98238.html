<p>WASHINGTON — In the late afternoon on Wednesday, the voice of the man at the center of the third impeachment trial in U.S. history boomed through the U.S. Senate, discussing how he would react if a foreign government offered information on a political rival.</p>
<p>“If somebody called from a country, Norway, [and said], ‘We have information on your opponent’ — oh, I think I'd want to hear it,” President Donald Trump said during an Oval Office interview with ABC News in June 2019, which was broadcast in the chamber as all 100 senators looked on.</p>
<p>The video was among a trove of clips, text messages and other visual aids deployed by House Democrats during eight hours of opening arguments in Mr. Trump’s impeachment trial.</p>
<p>The team of six House impeachment managers, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., chair of the House Intelligence Committee, sought to convince senators that&nbsp;Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine and withholding a coveted White House meeting to pressure that country into announcing an investigation into a political rival.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff, addressing senators at the start of the session, said the House impeachment inquiry last fall clearly proved Mr. Trump pressured Ukraine in an attempt to “cheat” in this year’s presidential election. The House impeached Mr. Trump in December on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff told senators a response to Mr. Trump’s actions “cannot be decided at the ballot box” because the president had weakened the integrity of U.S. elections.</p>
<p>Wednesday’s arguments zeroed in on private discussions among current and former Trump administration officials — including text messages showing his own diplomats’ hand-wringing over how to carry out the president’s directives.</p>
<p>Democrats portrayed Mr. Trump’s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, as the key figure that diplomats understood to be leading the pressure campaign for the president.</p>
<p>Mr. Giuliani spread a “debunked” belief, Mr. Schiff said, that former Vice President Joe Biden forced an anti corruption official in Ukraine to resign because his son, Hunter Biden, sat on the board of an energy company that had come under scrutiny. Mr. Biden is running for president against Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Mr. Giuliani also believed a widely discredited theory that Ukraine interfered in the 2016 presidential election to benefit Mr. Trump’s opponent, Hillary Clinton.</p>
<p>That Mr. Giuliani wielded tremendous power in U.S. foreign policy based on these theories clearly bothered administration officials, Democrats said. The impeachment managers drew from an extensive video library of public testimony from House Intelligence Committee hearings in November, pulling out particularly poignant moments.</p>
<p>Kurt Volker, former U.S. ambassador to NATO, described to the committee Mr. Trump’s views on Ukraine.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘Ukraine is a corrupt country full of terrible people.’ He said, ‘they tried to take me down,’’ Mr. Volker testified. “President Trump had a deeply rooted negative view on Ukraine,” shaped by Mr. Guiliani.</p>
<p>Then there was the former White House adviser Fiona Hill, who spoke with John Bolton, Mr. Trump’s former national security adviser, about how Mr. Guiliani’s directed the “smear campaign” on Marie Yovanovitch, who was fired as U.S. ambassador to Ukraine last year.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Bolton basically indicated with body language there’s nothing we could do” to push back against Mr. Guiliani, Ms. Hill told the committee.</p>
<p>Mr. Bolton, she testified, said Mr. Guiliani “was a hand grenade that was going to blow everyone up” with his incendiary remarks and by “pushing issues and ideas that would probably come back to haunt us.”</p>
<p>Democrats pulled the ABC News interview of Mr. Trump saying he would welcome dirt on his political opponents from foreign governments — instead of immediately reporting it to the FBI.</p>
<p>“I think you might want to listen; there isn't anything wrong with listening," Mr. Trump said in the interview. “I think I'd want to hear it.”</p>
<p>“Shocking video,” Rep. Sylvia Garcia, D-Texas, commented at the end of the clip.</p>
<p>One by one, the impeachment managers — including Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y.; Ms. Garcia, Rep. Jason Crow, D-Colo., Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla., and Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. — took the front of the room.</p>
<p>As senators silently watched the videos, most appeared contemplative, took notes and listened carefully. But signs of boredom and deficient attention spans were evident as the afternoon turned to evening.</p>
<p>At one moment, as Mr. Schiff was speaking, nearly two dozen Republican senators were seen out of their seats, many of them off the Senate floor. Senators are required to sit in silence and listen for the duration of the trial.</p>
<p>Sen. Lindsay Graham, R-S.C., frequently reacted to the presentations, shaking his head, making exasperated faces and elbowing his neighbor, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo. Some senators on the Democratic side also got up to stretch their legs.</p>
<p>Closing out the session, Mr. Schiff displayed dozens of texts between Gordon Sondland, ambassador to the European Union, and Mr. Volker, the former U.S. Ambassador to NATO, in August and September.</p>
<p>The two diplomats discussed a “deliverable” demanded by Mr. Trump, which Mr. Schiff said was the public statement from Ukraine.</p>
<p>Mr. Sondland recommended to Mr. Volker that Ukrainian officials share a draft statement ahead of time “to avoid misunderstandings” and see “exactly what they propose to cover.” Mr. Sondland later told the House Intelligence Committee he was concerned that Ukraine’s announcement “still wouldn’t be good enough for Rudy.”</p>
<p>At one point, Mr. Volker objected in a text: “I think it’s crazy to withhold security assistance for help,” he texted Mr. Sondland.</p>
<p>“There he is — putting in writing, for crying out loud!” Mr. Schiff said.</p>
<p>The session adjourned shortly after 9:30 p.m., Mr. Schiff praised the career diplomats who he said risked everything to come forward and testify.</p>
<p>“If they could show that courage, so could we,” he told the senators before walking away from the podium.</p>
<p>Democrats have another 16 hours or so, spread over the next two days, to make their case. On Thursday, Mr. Schiff said, Democrats “will go through the law and the Constitution and the facts as they apply” to Mr. Trump’s abuse of power.</p>
<p>After that, White House lawyers will have an equal amount of time, also spread over three days, for arguments.</p>
<p>Senators will then have 16 hours to ask questions of both sides.</p>
<p>Only after the arguments and questioning will senators consider whether to call witnesses or issue subpoenas for documents the Trump administration has refused to turn over.</p>
