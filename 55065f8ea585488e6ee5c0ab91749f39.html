<h1>April 15 passes by calmly, as July 15 grabs the Tax Day designation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tax day was supposed to be Wednesday, but that’s just another thing that the COVID-19 pandemic has postponed. Mark those calendars for July 15.</p>
<p>The extension will give taxpayers an extra three months to file federal and state income tax returns. For those who owe money to the government, the new deadline allows them to use the extra cash for food and other living expenses at a time when many people are unable to work because of shutdown orders.</p>
<p>“You can look at it as a three-month loan from the IRS,” said Howard Davis, president of the Davis, Davis &amp; Associates public accounting firm in the Strip District.</p>
<p>He said taxpayers who are still unable to pay what they owe by July 15 could request another extension that would give them until Oct. 15 to file. But interest and penalties would start to accrue after July 15.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania state tax returns also won’t be due until July 15.</p>
<p>The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, also known as the CARES Act, also has a few personal finance planning gifts that Congress stuck into the law to help taxpayers keep more cash on hand and to secure their retirement savings.</p>
<p>The deadline has been extended for making contributions to traditional individual retirement accounts, Roth IRAs and business owner retirement account for the current tax year. Usually April 15, that has been moved to July 15 as well — benefiting&nbsp;people who had planned to fund retirement accounts but were sidetracked by the coronavirus scare and the stock market crash.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another gift tucked inside the legislation allows senior citizens who don’t need the cash to pass on making any required minimum distributions from retirement accounts this year.</p>
<p>Owners of 401(k) accounts and traditional retirement accounts are usually required to withdraw a percentage of their account balances each year once they reach age 72 (previously 70½). This requirement was put in place to make sure the money in these tax-advantaged accounts is used to provide income during retirement rather than to pass on wealth to heirs.</p>
<p>The penalty for failure to take a required distribution would usually be 50% of the amount that should have been withdrawn.</p>
<p>From the standpoint of some business owners —&nbsp;despite the tax extension — the stress is higher than ever, but for different reasons.</p>
<p>‘For business owners, the stress of filing a tax return has been replaced with the stress of finding out what he needs to do to qualify for business loan programs,” said Alex Kindler,&nbsp;&nbsp;a partner at H2R CPA in Green Tree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A known stress has been replaced with a brand new stress that is unknown.”</p>
