<h1>Obituary: Michael Gold, computer expert who had many interests</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael “Mike” Gold will be missed for his knowledge on everything from technology to homemade French bread. A professor, business owner, board member and beloved family member, Mr. Gold spent his life learning new skills and sharing his know-how.</p>
<p>“I refer to him as a walking Google,” said friend and neighbor Stanley Horwich.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold, of Oakland and Longboat Key, Fla., died Feb. 14, two days after coronary artery bypass surgery. He was 79.</p>
<p>He stayed active until the day he died, sitting on the boards of his condominiums in both Longboat Key and Pittsburgh, cooking, taking photographs and flying his drone with his grandchildren.</p>
<p>“Michael loved life,” said his wife Valerie Swigart. “No one thinks he was 79.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gold was born in Fall River, Mass., and grew up in Newport, R.I. He was a photographer for the Newport Daily News as a high schooler, where he took photos at John F. Kennedy's wedding.</p>
<p>At 17, he attended the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for two years, later finishing his undergraduate education at Boston University’s engineering school, and then attending MIT’s Sloan School for his master’s and doctoral degrees.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold excelled in the budding computer science field, and received multiple NASA and Ford Foundation research grants throughout his career.</p>
<p>He was a “real computer whiz,” Ms. Swigart said. Having worked with computers since they were room-sized, Mr. Gold could take computers apart and put them back together again.</p>
<p>He moved to Pittsburgh to work at Carnegie Tech, now Carnegie Mellon University, in 1966, teaching and serving as the assistant director of the University Computer Center. Later, he taught research and development management at the University of Pittsburgh’s Graduate School of Public and International Affairs. He also served as director of doctoral studies and chair of the university’s Computer Usage Committee.</p>
<p>He worked for the University of Pittsburgh for 30 years, retiring in 1999.</p>
<p>One career wasn’t enough for Mr. Gold — he also co-founded a technology company in 1969. Computer Inventory Control, which later did business as Schoolworld Software, helped start the concept of low-cost software for schools.</p>
<p>Throughout his life, he loved to play host. Mr. Gold’s son Steve Gold, said his father’s friends and colleagues often filled his childhood home.</p>
<p>He was known at his Florida condo as a board member dedicated to helping residents, said Mr. Horwich. When Mr. Gold consolidated the hundreds of separate Comcast contracts to save residents’ money, he helped his neighbors adjust.</p>
<p>Residents who had questions about the technology could call Mr. Gold and he’d show up to help, even if they’d never met, said Jack Keelin, prior president of the board at Beach Place Condominiums in Longboat Key.</p>
<p>Mr. Keelin said Mr. Gold was a quick learner. When he moved to Florida, he studied the Florida condo laws so he could be of help as the Beach Place board worked to rewrite their bylaws.</p>
<p>“He never showed off his knowledge,” said Mr. Keelin. “He just really knew what he was talking about.”</p>
<p>He also served on the board of Bristol Cooperative in North Oakland until his passing, dedicating “over and above” what his role required, said Ira Weiss, president of the board.</p>
<p>At Bristol, he championed projects from renovating the hallways to upgrading the computer systems to marketing the units.</p>
<p>As much as he loved work, he also loved to play. His son said Mr. Gold was often taking up new hobbies and projects.</p>
<p>He enrolled in cooking classes midway through his life, and Ms. Swigart said he became a great chef who made exceptional Paella.</p>
<p>He also took up flying, and owned a Cessna airplane. He and his wife traveled throughout the United States, Europe, South Africa, China, Vietnam, and Australia.</p>
<p>Mr. Gold is survived by his wife of 25 years; siblings Gil, of Los Angeles, Larry, of New Bern, N.C., and Nancy, of Boston; his children Steven of Oakmont, David of Boston and Nicole of Beaver Falls; and three grandchildren.</p>
<p>At his request, there will be a celebration of life in place of a funeral, held in Pittsburgh on March 8 at the University Club in Oakland and in Longboat Key on March 12. Those who knew Mr. Gold can email valerie@pitt.edu for more information and to RSVP.</p>
<p>Donations in memory of Mr. Gold can be made to RAND Corporation, 4570 Fifth Avenue, Suite 600, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 or to the Graduate School of Public and International Affairs Annual Fund for Scholarships, University of Pittsburgh. 3407 Posvar Hall, Pittsburgh, PA 15260.</p>
