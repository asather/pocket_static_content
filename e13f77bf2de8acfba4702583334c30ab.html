<h1>'I don't know if I was breathing': Pirates reliever Blake Cederlind relishes first taste of the big leagues</h1>

<p>CINCINNATI — Blake Cederlind couldn’t sit still in the bullpen Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ right-hander was activated to the major league roster earlier in the afternoon, and with the Pirates playing a doubleheader the day before, he was the freshest reliever they had.</p>
<p>With that, it was all but a foregone conclusion that Cederlind would be making his MLB debut against the Cincinnati Reds at some point, even if he didn’t know exactly when. He&nbsp;waited and watched as starter Joe Musgrove battled his way through five innings. Shortly after Musgrove hit the dugout, the bullpen phone rang, Cederlind walked back to the bullpen mound and began warming up.</p>
<p>Less than 15 minutes later, he was on the mound, throwing 99 mph fastballs. He induced two ground outs and a fly out from Brian Goodwin, Freddy Galvis and Jose Garcia for his first 1-2-3 inning.</p>
<p>“Little nervous,” Cederlind said after the game. “And then the phone rang, got the call and then I just got excited. I was ready, just [trusting] my preparation. I got out there, was confident and it went well.”</p>
<p>Cederlind’s rise to this point was a bit slow at first, then meteoric.</p>
<p>The Pirates drafted him in the fifth round of the 2016 MLB draft out of Merced College (Calif.). He had a 7.76 ERA in Class A West Virginia in 2017 and a 4.89 between West Virginia and Class A+ in 2018. He was striking out more than 8.5 batters per nine innings those years, but the walks and hits he allowed were coming back to bite him.</p>
<p>Then something clicked, and 2019 saw that ERA drop to 2.28 as he rose up the organizational ladder. The strikeouts were a tick lower than prior seasons, but the walks and hits plummeted further.</p>
<p>That set up Cederlind for a chance at the big leagues in spring training 2020, and he burst onto the scene there, a hard-throwing, quirky right-hander with long, flowing blond hair who struck out nine batters in 4⅔ innings in Bradenton.</p>
<p>The delay of the season and then his own positive COVID-19 test during summer camp put Cederlind’s major-league prospects on hold for a while, as he was sent to the alternate training site in Altoona for most of this season.</p>
<p>“Just being patient and working on my craft until they thought I was ready and they needed me,” Cederlind said of his time in Altoona.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the Pirates needed him. Cederlind spent the previous days of their road trip on the taxi squad, working with pitching coach Oscar Marin and bullpen coach Justin Meccage to make sure he was ready.</p>
<p>While that sounds like a formality, it wasn’t, necessarily. Cederlind says he normally pitches from the far right side of the rubber, but Marin and Meccage encouraged him to move to the center, allowing more room for mechanical error than starting from one extreme side or another.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it comes down to putting Cederlind in the best position to let his stuff fly, because the stuff is late-innings-like.</p>
<p>After the five-inning wait to begin his debut, he bounded out of the visiting bullpen beyond the right field wall at Great American Ballpark and strode up to the mound to meet catcher Jacob Stallings.</p>
<p>“He told me to breathe a little bit,” Cederlind said. “I don’t know if I was breathing, so that helped.”</p>
<p>Cederlind’s second pitch was clocked at 99.5 mph, the fastest pitch a Pirate has thrown this season. He said he wasn’t pleased with his slider during the outing. If he gets that in line, it will only make him more lethal.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t his best, the results and the nature of the outing itself were cause for celebration.</p>
<p>“The guys were so supportive coming off,” Cederlind said. “I think they know I’ve been waiting for this one. They’ve been joking all week if I’m ever going to get activated. It was cool to see how happy they were for me.”</p>
<p>Cederlind was asked if he, himself, had wondered if he’d ever be activated.</p>
<p>“Yeah,” Cederlind laughed. “Yeah, I was wondering. But I had a good feeling last night, then I got here today and got the good news.”</p>
<p>None of that matters now. His foot is officially in the door.</p>
<p>Perhaps the lone difference between Cederlind and his introduction to Pirates fans in the minors and spring training is his hairdo. He cut it in August, though he says he’s thinking about growing it out again.</p>
<p>Well, that and the other difference: Cederlind was pitching in a major-league game for the first time Tuesday, showcasing the tantalizing potential he possesses on his biggest stage yet.</p>
