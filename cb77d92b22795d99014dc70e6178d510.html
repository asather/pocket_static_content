<h1>At long last, Derek Shelton gets set for managerial debut</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Since the beginning of the delay to the 2020 Major League Baseball season, Pirates manager Derek Shelton has been asked some variation of the same question countless times: How are you dealing with the postponement of your managerial debut?</p>
<p>Shelton’s answers have touched on but have not been limited to discussing: the aspects of the job he’s able to do right now, the tough realization that games would not carry on how they were supposed to and the acknowledgement that health comes first and the games will come whenever they can.</p>
<p>After Friday, those questions won’t have to be asked anymore.&nbsp;When the Pirates open their three-game series in St. Louis,&nbsp;Shelton will take his spot at the front of the dugout and call the shots in a major league game that matters for the first time in his career. It’s something he has dreamed of since he began his professional baseball career years ago.</p>
<p>“Yeah, this was the goal,” Shelton said Thursday. “I knew I was not going to play in the big leagues. I was very honest with my skill set. I knew I wanted to coach. … Once I started to get into this, I think [Friday] night was what I wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Much has been made of the impact Shelton could have on the Pirates, and rightfully so. A team’s attitude has a way of mimicking their manager’s. Shelton, however, feels he can let the team shape its own identity and be comfortable that he won’t intrude on it.</p>
<p>“I realize my role as the manager. They’re going to take and feed off a little bit of how I am and especially in terms of the culture we’re trying to create, but the big thing for our group is I want those guys to have their own personalities,” Shelton said. “And one of the key things that I have taken out of this 2.0 is they have because they’ve been together. They’re starting to show their voice. They’re starting to be actionable, and that’s exciting for me.”</p>
<p>Shelton has learned plenty about how he wants to manage from his mentors.</p>
<p>He frequently mentioned Twins manager Rocco Baldelli, for whom Shelton was bench coach last season, saying he wants to listen to his players the way Baldelli does. Former Pirates manager Jim Leyland has given Shelton some pointers, too, and Shelton says he hopes to communicate the way Leyland did.</p>
<p>While important, a proper assessment of those things more than likely can’t be done until the season comes and goes.</p>
<p>Instead, Shelton says he will think of those closest to him Friday, his family members who have helped and supported him throughout the last 49 or so years.</p>
<p>“I think what’s going to go through my head [Friday] is probably my family and the fact that I’m grateful for the support I’ve gotten from my wife and my kids and my parents,” Shelton said. “Honestly, it’s a little sad that there’s no fans there and you don’t get to experience that with them, but I think the big thing is that I’m grateful that we were able to get the season off, and I’m grateful for the position and very humbled by the position I’m in.”</p>
<p>Those thoughts are surely helped by the fact that Shelton and the Pirates will be in St. Louis. The Pirates were supposed to begin the 2020 season with a road trip to Tampa, where Shelton coached for seasons, and Chicago, Shelton’s hometown.</p>
<p>Those moments would have been special in their own right, but St. Louis is a close contender.</p>
<p>“I have a lot of relatives in Southern Illinois. I went to school in Southern Illinois. My parents’ first date was at a Cardinals game when [Bob] Gibson threw,” Shelton said. “So there’s a lot of factors about St. Louis. I have college roommates who still live there. St. Louis is going to be a cool place. There are some people in Southern Illinois who were Cardinals fans until, I think, Nov. 29 and now they have some black and gold.”</p>
<p>Next Thursday, Shelton will turn 50. For a time, it seemed obvious he would manage his first game before that milestone. Then, for another time, it seemed like he might not.</p>
<p>All that is in the past, though. Ideally, Shelton will fill out many lineup cards in the future.</p>
<p>“To write your first lineup for a major league game, I mean, I’m glad it happened before my 50th birthday,” Shelton said.</p>
