<h1>Jayden Bristol's big night carries Serra Catholic to win over No. 4 Brentwood</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Serra Catholic’s boys basketball team lost all its starters from its 21-win team that reached the WPIAL Class 2A championship last season — except one.</p>
<p>Luckily for the Eagles and their fans, that one returning starter is senior guard Jayden Bristol, and Bristol saved the best performance of his career for Serra Catholic’s biggest game of the season so far.</p>
<p>With previously undefeated Brentwood (10-1, 5-1) visiting for a battle for sole possession of first place in Class 2A Section 2, Bristol put the Eagles on his back to the tune of a career-high 34 points as Serra Catholic (7-5, 5-0) led from start to finish in a 62-52 win. He scored 25 of his 34 points in the second half, including 13 in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>“We just had a good team win. I don’t really care about the points,” Bristol said.</p>
<p>“I’m just happy we got the W.”</p>
<p>Senior guard Zach Keib led the way for the Spartans with 19 points, while fellow senior C.J. Ziegler chipped in 18. Meanwhile, Bristol was the only player for the Eagles to reach double figures, as he accounted for more than half of Serra Catholic’s points in the key section victory.</p>
<p>“At the beginning of the year, I thought that we weren’t getting any press. We have guys who can play,” Eagles coach Justin Walther said. “Right now, we’re sitting in first place by ourselves.</p>
<p>“We thought we had the horses tonight to outdo their horses, and I think for three quarters, it showed.</p>
<p>“In the fourth quarter, they punched us in the mouth, but we took the punch and then counter-punched. That’s why I think we won.”</p>
<p>Brentwood started off looking sluggish, and both sides committed several turnovers in a sloppy first half that featured plenty of loose balls, deflections and questionable calls.</p>
<p>Serra Catholic led, 25-14, at the end of the first half, but both offenses began to come alive in the second half, starting with the Eagles.</p>
<p>Bristol made a barrage of 3-pointers in the third quarter, including back-to-back 3s that stretched Serra Catholic’s lead to 16 late in the third. The Eagles took a commanding, 45-28 lead into the fourth, and Walther told his players to be “defensively insane” in the final eight minutes.</p>
<p>Instead, Serra Catholic appeared to let up a bit on defense as Ziegler and Keib attempted to will Brentwood back into the game.</p>
<p>“We let them back into the game, because I think we relaxed. I think we thought the game was over,” Walther said.</p>
<p>“But like I said, we took that punch and we punched them back.”</p>
<p>A 3-pointer by Bristol followed by a put-back gave the Eagles a 52-36 lead with a little more than two minutes to play, and the game seemed to be all but over. Brentwood, however, refused to let its perfect record slip away without a fight, and the Spartans climbed back to within five points in the final minute.</p>
<p>That’s when Bristol was summoned to the free-throw line to put the finishing touches on his breakout performance, and his clutch free throws helped Serra Catholic survive a furious rally to win by 10 and take control of the section.</p>
<p>“My shots just started falling, and I just kept letting them fly,” Bristol said.</p>
<p>“My teammates were getting me the ball in open situations. They just kept feeding me.”</p>
<p>Walther said this performance was easily the best he has seen out of Bristol because he simply let the shots come to him, rather than forcing them.</p>
<p>“Tonight, he let his teammates facilitate to him. He was in rhythm on jump shots. He was catching the ball and stepping into 3s like he should be,” Walther said.</p>
<p>“He let the guys get in their gaps, and he played a great team game.”</p>
