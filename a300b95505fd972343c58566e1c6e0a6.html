<h1>As Earth Day turns 50, Pitt helps mine milestones of environmental action </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Earth Day was a bold idea in 1970 by Wisconsin Sen. Gaylord Nelson and activist organizer Denis Hayes. Environmental Action, the magazine they published, was just as audacious.</p>
<p>Over its 26 years in print, the magazine championed iconic environmental legislation, including the Clean Air Act, Clean Water Act and the National Environmental Policy Act, and lobbied against lead in gasoline, the Alaska oil pipeline and supersonic transport.</p>
<p>It started the “Dirty Dozen” campaign, which named U.S. representatives and senators who opposed environmental regulations and tried to defeat them at the polls. And it pushed hard for a national bottle bill to set deposits on glass containers.</p>
<p>The magazine is a time capsule of articles, essays, book reviews, policy analyses and opinion pieces on the great and small environmental policy topics of the day.</p>
<p>Now, a half century after the first Earth Day, and thanks to the work of the University of Pittsburgh's Library System, 389 issues of the magazine are available digitally. It’s a treasure trove of information for environmental historians, scholars and journalists.</p>
<p>“We always felt we were on the front edge of taking on the issues people discovered later,” said Peter Harnik, who was hired as a 21-year-old graduate of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was a writer and then editor of the magazine. “We ran our first articles on climate change and global warming in 1984. No other organizations were pushing on that issue then. We were ahead of the curve.”</p>
<p>Unlike some established hunting, fishing or birding groups of the time that pushed environmental issues, the Environmental Action organization was populated by a younger crowd influenced by Ralph Nader’s work against corporations and anti-war activists.</p>
<p>Mr. Hayes, who was also the national coordinator of Environmental Action, hired Mr. Harnik to write two books, “Earth Day: The Beginning,” a compendium of speeches delivered around the nation on April 22, 1970, and “Earth Tool Kit,” a how-to book about environmental problems and the politics behind cleaning them up.</p>
<p>“We were more anti-corporate in the sense that there were companies that knew they were polluting and also knew they were not doing something about it,” said Mr. Harnik, 71, in a phone interview from his home in Alexandria, Va.</p>
<p>Although Environmental Action’s big focus was on lobbying Congress on environmental legislation, Mr. Harnik said it was aware of other progressive organizations across the nation, including the Groups Against Smog and Pollution in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“GASP was and is a famous group that had to be more extreme because of the extreme environmental issues in Pittsburgh,” he said. “It was like us in that we had to have more of an edge to our campaigns than previously existed.”</p>
<p>Although Environmental Action was based in Washington, D.C., where it did its considerable and wide ranging lobbying work on what would become the iconic environmental legislation of the last half of the 20th century, its archives, including editions of the magazine, ended up in Pittsburgh because of Sam Hays.</p>
<p>Mr. Hays, a Pitt history professor from 1960 through 1990, was a pioneering social, environmental and industrial historian and activist who established the nation’s first environmental archives in Pitt’s Hillman Library. He was well known to Mr. Harnik and the Environmental Action crowd.&nbsp;In 1996, when Environmental Action ran out of money and closed its doors, Mr. Harnik remembers getting a message asking staffers if they wanted any of the office furniture.</p>
<p>“I went over to the office and said, ‘What about the files?’ Later, with friends and lots of boxes I loaded up those files and took them home.”</p>
<p>That’s where they stayed until 2000, when, during a phone call with Mr. Hays, Mr. Harnik asked if he would be interested in the files for the Pitt archives.</p>
<p>“He said he’d love that and sent me acid-free boxes. We transferred the files to the new containers, rented a truck and in a snowstorm traveled the Pennsylvania Turnpike to deliver 99 boxes,” Mr. Harnik said. “We hadn’t done much with them and were just hoping for the best.”</p>
<p>Not much was done with them at Pitt for another 10 years, until, the 40th Earth Day in 2010, when another former Environmental Action editor, Francesca Lyman, called David Grinnell, coordinator of archives and manuscripts for the Pitt library system, and suggested it would be good to digitize the 26 years of magazines.</p>
<p>“He said he could make that happen, so I put out the word to all the EA allums to look in their attics and basements for editions of the magazine,” Mr. Harnik said. “We were able to collect almost all of the editions, the entire magazine. They got the work going and two weeks ago notified us it was done.”</p>
<p>Ed Galloway, associate university librarian for archives and special collections, said decisions about which files to digitize are based on research value and historic milestones.</p>
<p>“Anniversaries do play a role and that’s what this falls into,” said Mr. Galloway. “We almost missed it when we found ourselves missing two key people in the process. I had to go to our team and say, ‘This is a huge anniversary and we need to roll up our sleeves and make sure it gets done in time.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Grinnell said the university began digitizing its archived collections 20 years ago, and started work on the EA collection in October 2019. Three full-time scanning technicians worked on the project, along with a coordinator and a librarian to oversee descriptions about the scanned documents.</p>
<p>“It’s not complete,” he said. “There are some edition gaps, but not nearly as many as there were.”</p>
<p>And new finds are narrowing those gaps even further. After Mr Harnik was informed Monday that the first and third editions of the magazine were missing from the digital archives, he called Steve Cotton, the magazine's first editor, who was able to locate them.</p>
<p>Mr Harnik, 71, who went on to co-found the Rails to Trails Conservancy and work at Trust for Public Lands, said environmental issues, foremost among them climate change, remain critically important.</p>
<p>“Scientists know the problems but they often don’t know how to do something about them,” he said. “Getting good environmental laws is always difficult. Some corporations and states are stepping up, but it’s ultimately about getting the American public to do the right thing.”</p>
