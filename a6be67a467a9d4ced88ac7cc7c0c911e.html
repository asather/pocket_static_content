<h1>Russia's coronavirus cases are spiking and the health system is struggling to keep pace</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MOSCOW —&nbsp;When Russian authorities ordered half-trained medical students into hospitals dealing with the COVID-19 crisis, the students said they felt like raw military conscripts being sent into battle, barely trained to shoot.</p>
<p>In a sign of the crisis roiling Russian hospitals facing the COVID-19 pandemic, university heads last month ordered students to do compulsory practical work in hospitals, where staff complain that they lack protective gear.</p>
<p>At least 169 medical staff have died in Russia, according to a memorial list created by Russian doctors, in the absence of any national official count on the numbers who died or fell ill from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The growing fissures on Russia’s health system is just one part of a growing crisis that is adding more than 10,000 COVID-19 patients a day —&nbsp;catapulting Russia into second place behind the United States in terms of cases.</p>
<p>“We know very well how hard it is now for our doctors, nurses, our colleagues and students who are already working. We hear stories about the lack of protective masks, respirators and so on,” said a fourth-year medical student from the Medical University No. 1, who gave her name only as Alexandra, fearing repercussions for her degree.</p>
<p>“We know that there are doctors and nurses who are quitting because they can’t work in these unbearable conditions,” she added.</p>
<p>It is also a critical test for Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose state-crafted image of total stewardship has taken direct blows by the pandemic as he delegates much of the response to provincial bosses and others.</p>
<p>The virus, too, has pushed its way into his inner circle. His spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, is hospitalized with COVID-19. Last month, Russia’s prime minister, Mikhail Mishustin, tested positive.</p>
<p>But Russian officials assert that Mr. Putin is not at risk. He has spent the past weeks at his retreat outside Moscow.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Russia has struggled to respond to spike in cases, leaving health care workers fighting the system they work in. Some have taken to social media with anguished cries for help or simply to vent. At least three health care workers have mysteriously fallen out of hospital windows in Russia in recent weeks, highlighting the escalations in the health system.</p>
<p>Alexandra, the medical student, said students who refused to work would not be given the credit required to pass and faced effective expulsion.</p>
<p>As of last Wednesday, Russia reported a total of 242,271 novel coronavirus cases, a daily increase of 10,028.</p>
<p>Although the caseload continues to rise, the rate of daily increase has slowed. Russia has reported 2,212 deaths, but it counts COVID-19 cases much more conservatively than other countries. Many deaths among COVID-19 infected patients have been attributed to other causes.</p>
<p>Health officials say that Russia’s high case numbers are due to its testing: around 6 million tests performed so far. Yet doctors complain that the tests are inaccurate in around 20% of cases, showing false positives, exposing medical staff and patients to further risk.</p>
<p>In a St. Petersburg intensive care unit last week, a doctor watched in shock as a ventilator exploded in flames, killing five COVID-19 patients, the second such incident in days. On May 9, a patient with the virus in Moscow died when a hospital ventilator caught fire.</p>
<p>Russian authorities last week ordered a halt to the use of ventilators produced by Urals Instrument Engineering Plant, part of a state conglomerate Rostec, which also manufactures military hardware and is under Western sanctions over Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine.</p>
<p>But the decision raised questions as to how the country will cope as COVID-19 cases continue to climb.</p>
<p><strong>Walking off the job</strong></p>
<p>The lack of protective equipment and resulting sickness among health workers has seen doctors walk off the job, fearing infection and death.</p>
<p>Hospitals have emerged as super-spreader sites, with the infection sweeping through COVID-19 wards, known in Russia as “red zone” wards and “green zones” or “clean zones” for other patients.</p>
<p>At least 400 hospitals had been identified as COVID-19 hot spots, Russian Health Minister Mikhail Murashko said last week, calling it the kind of thing that “tends to happen.” He said the situation was “tense but controllable.”</p>
<p>St. Petersburg Governor Alexander Beglov said 1,465 medical workers in that city alone had been infected with COVID-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic, RIA Novosti reported.</p>
<p>“The risk of getting COVID-19 in the clean zone of a COVID-19 hospital is very high,” Alexandra said.</p>
<p>She said some students who had been contacted by hospitals to start work had been given no choice on whether they would work in red zones or green zones.</p>
<p>“We are talking about very serious infection and forcing students to work with such an infection and calling it practical work is inadmissible,” she said. “It’s a violation of our right to life.”</p>
<p>Students including pregnant women, young mothers, those with underlying health conditions that put them at risk and those with elderly parents whom they could infect were ordered to work in hospitals treating COVID-19 patients, she added.</p>
