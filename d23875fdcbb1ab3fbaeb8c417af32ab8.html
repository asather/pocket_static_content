<h1>Friday was special. Now Chad Kuhl just wants to focus on pitching</h1>

<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Chad Kuhl was reminded of a <a href="https://twitter.com/espnnfl/status/421628089169633280?lang=en" target="_blank">famous Peyton Manning quote</a> after pitching in a game for the first time in 20 months on Friday at LECOM Park.</p>
<p><em><span data-mce-mark="1">Pressure is something you feel when you don’t know what the hell you’re doing.</span></em></p>
<p>Kuhl, who had Tommy John surgery in September 2018, didn’t feel any pressure before his outing against the Baltimore Orioles. He felt a little nervous, as expected. But more than anything, Kuhl was excited to reach this particular milestone.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">And then move past it to become another guy, another Pirates pitcher competing for a spot and trying to get better at his job.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It was awesome,” Kuhl said. “Just kind of wanted to get it out of the way. It’s really cool after 20 months coming back and being able to pitch and be healthy. But I’m just looking forward to when all the questions go away and I can just pitch, play and be normal again.”</span></p>
<p>That should be soon, as the next set of questions Kuhl will face should be about effectiveness, or introducing his changeup or being more exact with his fastball or whatever sort of pitching-related topic that might come up.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But for now, it was the culmination of a long journey back, one he didn’t make alone.</span></p>
<p>Kuhl and Edgar Santana went through their Tommy John rehabs together. After the work was done, they’d go fishing or have dinner together. From vastly different countries, they formed something of a unique friendship.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“That was awesome to have,” Santana said. “It’s not good because we’re hurt, but it was great to have that kind of guy. He’s a great guy. We did a lot of stuff together.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Santana pitched in a game for the second time this spring and worked a quick ninth inning with one strikeout.</span></p>
<p>Kuhl lasted 2/3 of an inning, allowing two runs on one hit with a walk and a strikeout — which came on a beautiful, 85 mph slider.</p>
<p>Nothing against Santana, who’s likely to break camp in the big club’s bullpen, but the bigger long-term focal point might be Kuhl because of the potential boost he could provide to the Pirates’ starting rotation.</p>
<p>Kuhl’s fastball touched 94 mph, and his curveball and slider looked really good, with plenty of life.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Kuhl wasn’t happy that his fastball was “dancing around the zone,” but chances are he’d take that over worrying about when he can throw from 90 feet versus 60. The delivery was also fluid and exactly what he had been practicing, which bodes well for Kuhl’s progression.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Next up should be multiple innings and getting on a five-day plan. Beyond that will be competing for a spot in the starting rotation, challenging incumbent Steven Brault and newcomer Derek Holland.</span></p>
<p>“He’s worked his [butt] off,” Trevor Williams said of Kuhl. “He’s itching to be back out there again. It’s exciting to see Edgar get out there as well and get some pitches under his belt. Those guys worked so hard away from the field at PNC Park.</p>
<p>“To see them and get to watch Chad today and get back out there, I think it’s something special.”</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Local boy shines</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">John Ryan Murphy may have thrilled his parents and ticked off one of his neighbors at the same time. The Pirates catcher, competing for a spot on the roster, stroked a grand slam on Friday that dented a fan’s car.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Murphy is from Bradenton, Fla., and grew up only a couple miles from LECOM Park. His parents, who now live in Sarasota, are attending all of the Pirates’ spring-training games here.</span></p>
<p>Murphy was also a late addition to the lineup Friday because Luke Maile was scratched with left hamstring tightness.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s always the guy who’s not supposed to be in the lineup that does something big,” manager Derek Shelton said.</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing with Murphy will be whether he forces general manager Ben Cherington and Shelton to keep three catchers on the roster. Now with one extra spot available — 26 instead of 25 — more teams probably will do that in 2020.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">With the Pirates’ only two home runs of the spring and with several other quality at-bats, Murphy is making a bit of a case.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I’ve seen [teams carry three catchers] in the past, in Arizona,” Murphy said, citing where he played from 2017-19. “It’ll be interesting to see how many teams end up doing that. I knew I was coming in to camp in a competitive situation. It’s been the same, really, for quite a while for me.”</span></p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Around the horn</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• The Pirates face the Twins on the road Saturday, which means it should be the perfect opportunity for Shelton’s good friend, Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli, to mess with him a little.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Oh, God,” Shelton said when asked what he expected prank-wise. “I would say there’s probably going to be multiple things on the scoreboard that involve me. None of them will be flattering. Lord only knows what he’ll do in our clubhouse. I would expect it’s going to be a lot of fun for me.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• Steve Blass delivered the lineup card Friday. Shelton hinted that somebody from the Pirates’ 1979 World Series-winning club will do the same on Sunday against the Blue Jays.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It was very cool for me that Blass was very thankful,” Shelton said. “He thought it was cool that he went out and handed the lineup card out in a spring training game. He’s done a lot of really cool things in his career. Any time those guys are engaged and want to be around, I think we all feel very fortunate.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• Shelton said he anticipates playing Bryan Reynolds, Jarrod Dyson and Gregory Polanco together quite a bit over the final two weeks of spring training to allow them to get used to one another as an outfield.</span></p>
<p>“They’ll be out there a lot together to get themselves acclimated to each other,” Shelton said. “The two guys on the corners have to get acclimated to [Dyson]. He’s going to cover a ton of ground. He’s going to catch a lot of balls. They have to get used to where he’s going and what his barometer is on balls, especially going into the gaps.”</p>
