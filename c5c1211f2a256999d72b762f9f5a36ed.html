<h1>Indicted rehab center founder accused of dealing drugs, killing addicts asks to be released from jail because of COVID-19</h1>

<p>A drug rehab center founder under indictment on charges of running a McKees Rocks heroin den for addicts and supplying fentanyl that killed two people says he should be released from custody because of COVID-19 at the Allegheny County Jail.</p>
<p>David Francis' lawyer, Casey White, filed a motion Monday asking for pretrial release, saying Francis is not a danger to anyone and he's at risk from the virus because of his age and health problems.</p>
<p>"COVID-19 presents a particular risk to prison inmates and to Francis in particular," Mr. White said. "Mr. Francis is 69 years old and suffers documented severe arthritis and Hepatitis C and is in need of a second hip replacement."</p>
<p>He said jails are hotbeds of infection and that the county lockup has had three detainees test positive for the virus. He said the jail has stopped lawyers from visiting inmates but guards still pose a risk, as do new inmates brought to the jail every day.</p>
<p>Mr. White said even if his client ends up pleading guilty to the federal charges, as he had previously indicated he would before backing out, he'll still have to be in jail for months and remain at risk.</p>
<p>The U.S. attorney's office is opposed to releasing Francis on the grounds that he is a threat to the community as one of the region's largest heroin and fentanyl dealers.</p>
<p>Francis, founder of Next Step Foundation, has been in jail for more than two years following an investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2017.</p>
<p>Francis was indicted along with two New York suppliers, both of whom pleaded guilty, on multiple counts of distributing heroin. Francis is also charged with delivering fentanyl that killed users in Ingram and in Beaver County.</p>
<p>His operation became apparent after police responding to drug overdoses across the region learned addicts named Francis as their source.</p>
<p>Agents said he was a drug dealer masquerading as a counselor.</p>
<p>He founded Next Step Foundation as a nonprofit rehab center but in 2012 changed it to a for-profit company called Next Step Recovery Housing. Federal prosecutors said he did that to avoid scrutiny, since nonprofits receive state and federal money and thus are subject to audits.</p>
<p>DEA agents said Francis dealt drugs directly to clients of Next Step.</p>
<p>He also ran a purported tax preparation business called All Personal Matters, but prosecutors said that was a front for his drug operation and staffed by addicts Francis paid with heroin and crack.</p>
