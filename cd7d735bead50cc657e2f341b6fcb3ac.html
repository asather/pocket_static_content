<h1>QB guru Bruce Arians acquires perhaps his most prized pupil</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In his book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quarterback-Whisperer-How-Build-Elite/dp/1478914262" target="_blank">“The Quarterback Whisperer,”</a> Bruce Arians talked about the let-’er-rip style he wanted all his quarterbacks to employ. He has worked with many of the NFL’s best — Peyton Manning, Ben Roethlisberger, Andrew Luck and Carson Palmer — in his four-decade career as a quarterback coach, offensive coordinator and head coach.</p>
<p>Now he might get the greatest of them all: Tom Brady.</p>
<p>If Brady wants to go to an offense where he can finish his decorated career as a gunslinger, he will have found the right spot with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Arians, a former college quarterback who never met a deep pass he didn’t like.</p>
<p>“When I began working with Carson Palmer in Arizona (in 2013) I told him, ‘Have fun. Throw it deep. This is what I do,’ ” Arians said in his book. “He looked at me like I had three eyes. ‘Really,’ he asked me. ‘I can look at the deep ball like that on virtually every play?’ Hell yes, I replied.”</p>
<p>In 2012, when he worked with Luck as the offensive coordinator/interim head coach with the Indianapolis Colts — a year the league’s No. 1 overall draft pick threw for 4,374 yards and made the Pro Bowl as a rookie — Arians delivered the same type of message to his young quarterback.</p>
<p>“Andrew, this is easy. I don’t care if it’s third-and-1,” Arians said. “If you got T.Y. Hilton matched up one-on-one, throw it to him. It’s that simple.”</p>
<p>Now it looks as though Arians will get the chance to deliver the same message to Brady, who appears to be headed to Tampa Bay after winning six Super Bowls and three league MVP awards with the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>If it happens, it will mean Arians will get to work with the greatest two quarterbacks of this generation — Manning and Brady — in addition to the five years he spent with Roethlisberger as the Steelers offensive coordinator. In his first season with Arians in charge of the offense, Roethlisberger threw for 32 touchdowns, posted a career-best 104.1 passer rating and made his first Pro Bowl in 2007.</p>
<p>“I can’t stand it when coaches play not to lose, like when a head coach with a five-point lead will run the ball three straight times with two minutes to play and kick it and ask the defense to win the game,” Arians said in his book. “That’s not my way, brother.”</p>
<p>Why Brady to Tampa Bay?</p>
<p>Well, Arians appears to have run out of patience with Buccaneers quarterback Jameis Winston, the first overall pick in the 2015 draft.</p>
<p>In his only season under Arians, Winston was the only quarterback to throw for more than 5,000 yards (5,109) and led the league with 33 touchdown passes in 2019. But he also threw a league-high 30 interceptions — nine more than any other quarterback — and was guilty of questionable decision-making.</p>
<p>A telling sign of Arians’ discontent with Winston came last month at the NFL scouting combine when he was asked if his quarterback needed Lasik surgery because he tends to squint on the field. Arians’ response was subtle but digging.</p>
<p>“I don’t think so,” he said. “His deep ball increased dramatically. So I don’t think he has problems seeing the guys. He has problems seeing the scoreboard sometimes.”</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>It was also at the combine when Arians indicated he had one player in mind that, if he could get him, would replace Winston as the Buccaneers’ starter.</p>
<p>Turns out, that was probably Brady.</p>
<p>But, at age 43, Brady might need some better protection from Tampa Bay’s offensive line. If there is one problem with Arians’ go-for-broke style, it’s that his quarterbacks are exposed to lots of pressure.</p>
<p>In his five years under Arians, Roethlisberger was sacked 215 times, an average of 43 per season, most in his 16-year career. Luck was sacked 41 times in his only season with Arians. Winston was sacked 47 times in 2019. And in the three seasons in which he appeared for at least 15 games, Palmer averaged 35 sacks per year under Arians.</p>
<p>Palmer, though, is a classic example of what Arians can do to rejuvenate a veteran quarterback. His career appeared to be on the decline since his knee injury against the Steelers in a 2005 wild-card playoff game. In his next seven seasons, Palmer threw 139 touchdowns and 100 interceptions with the Cincinnati Bengals and Oakland Raiders.</p>
<p>But in 2015, Palmer had his best season ever in Arizona, throwing for 4,671 yards and 35 touchdowns and even sparking talk of being league MVP.</p>
<p>Now it appears Arians will add the greatest of all to his stable of quarterbacks.</p>
