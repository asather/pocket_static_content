<h1>Aldi to open more than 70 stores by the end of the year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Aldi said it plans to open more than&nbsp;70 new stores by the end of the year.</p>
<p>The German deep discount grocery chain currently has 2,000 stores in 36 states, including more than 30 markets in southwestern Pennsylvania. Aldi did not say in which locations it would open new stores.</p>
<p>The grocer’s expansion&nbsp;includes plans to enter the greater Phoenix market and “support further Gulf Coast store expansion” with a new regional headquarters and distribution center in Alabama next year, the company said.</p>
<p>“In recent years, ALDI has invested more than $5 billion in a multi-year, nationwide growth initiative to update existing stores and to open hundreds of new locations,” the company said in a statement.</p>
<p>The company said it has increased its fresh food selection by 40% “with a focus on new produce, meat and organic options, as well as easy to prepare foods, without compromising its commitment to low prices” as well as expanded its e-commerce offerings.</p>
<p>In May, amid the coronavirus pandemic, it announced a rollout of its curbside grocery pickup service to nearly 600 stores by the end of July.</p>
<p>Aldi, part of the German company Aldi Sud, opened its first store in the U.S. in 1976.</p>
