<h1>Talking politics: Discussion is key to a way forward</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Americans are losing the ability to talk to each other about political news.</p>
<p>Without engaging each other on the topics of the day, we cannot move forward as a nation. A lively exchange of ideas can create areas of compromise and sometimes unexpected agreement.</p>
<p>That can’t happen if we don’t discuss politics with each other.</p>
<p>Listen. Talk. Agree to disagree. But talk — learn about other points of view.</p>
<p>Forty-five percent of adults have stopped talking to someone about political or election news.</p>
<p>Why? Because of something said to them or posted online, according to a survey released by the Pew Research Center.</p>
<p>People who follow politics and election news closely are the most likely to cut off dialogue. That’s a shame because they have the most to contribute to the discussion.</p>
<p>It’s among the woke where Pew found tolerance of opposing viewpoints most intolerable.</p>
<p>The survey found that 60% of liberal Democrats cut off discussions with someone. The next likeliest to cut dialogue off — conservative Republicans, at 45%.</p>
<p>Moderates in both parties and independents are more likely to keep talking.</p>
<p>Talking could help move our current mode of attack politics to a more sensible way of doing business. God forbid, there might be areas suited to compromise.</p>
<p>Our recent leaders have provided a very bad example — shouting, not talking. Not listening.</p>
<p>Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and the late Justice Antonin Scalia provided a good example of keeping disagreement civil while remaining friends. The two disagreed on almost every aspect of law and politics. Respect was the key to that friendship.</p>
<p>Like the two justices, we should respect people we disagree with.</p>
<p>We must start talking with each other about politics again. Have a political discussion with a friend, family member, colleague or fellow parishioner now kept at arm’s length.</p>
<p>Have coffee or a beer and talk about the politics of the day. Ask someone why they feel the way they do about important issues.</p>
<p>To unify this country we must talk to each other about politics.</p>
<p>To debate the issues of the day is key to finding a way forward from the deep divisions in this country.</p>
