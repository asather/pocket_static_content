<p>Courtney Hazlett created her television show with families in mind.</p>
<p>“I want it to be a show kids watch with their parents, that parents watch with their parents,” said Hazlett, the executive producer who grew up in Murrysville.</p>
<p>“Restaurants on the Edge” debuts its first season of six, one-hour installments Feb. 28 on Netflix, with a second season streaming later this year. The series takes its audience around the world to see how others live.</p>
<p>Along the way, her team of “heroes” help renovate restaurants with stunning locations but perhaps a serious challenge&nbsp;— or two or three.</p>
<p>“It really is ‘Queer Eye’ meets ‘Parts Unknown,’ ” she said. “We have a team of heroes who are going to pick you up and take you on an awesome vacation in the process.”</p>
<p>In each of the first six episodes, designer Karin Bohn, restaurant entrepreneur Nick Liberato and chef Dennis Prescott visit an existing establishment that hasn’t reached its potential.</p>
<p>They explore the local culture and try to incorporate native dishes and decor into an upgrade. In this case, “On the Edge” refers to places with spectacular settings. In Season 1, the team visits Malta, Hong Kong, Tobermory (Ontario), Costa Rica, Austria and St. Lucia.</p>
<p>“The very first thing [the owners] do is make them a meal. So right off the bat, they get a taste for what’s working and what’s not working… it was important for us that we don’t go in there and jam our experts’ personal tastes down their throats.”</p>
<p>Part of the process involves the three hosts setting off to explore the neighborhoods, and their own adventures and interactions with local experts will influence their suggestions.</p>
<p>“It’s really a deep dive, whether it’s food or just the scene, what are people doing in their free time, what is local, also, what is sustainable?” said Hazlett, who graduated from Franklin Regional High School and has a degree in philosophy from Tulane University.</p>
<p>Hazlett has had her adventures in life. She set out to become a doctor and wound up with a master’s degree in journalism from the Columbia University School of Journalism. From there, she did on-air television work for, among others, NBC and MSNBC.</p>
<p>“The type of stories I covered — Michael Jackson’s death and also a new pope being named and the election of Barack Obama — was that intersection of pop culture and politics or fill-in-the-blank and pop culture. Trying to answer the question, ‘Why do we care?’ ”</p>
<p>She said having children&nbsp;— her daughter and son are now 8 and 5&nbsp;— made the stability of working behind the scenes more attractive. Now, as the executive vice president for development at Los Angeles-based production company OutEast&nbsp;Entertainment, Hazlett has more control.</p>
<p>“Restaurants on the Edge” is a co-production with Canadian company marblemedia. Hazlett said Netflix was a good fit for distributing it in the United States and beyond: “Netflix was so global, so it really did have to be a truly global show.”</p>
<p>It falls into the category of “lifestyle docuseries.” There’s food, there’s stunning scenery and explorations into other cultures, there’s a bit of DIY.</p>
<p>“We don’t go in and knock down walls,” she said. “It’s all soft touches.”</p>

<p>Some of the challenges were daunting, thanks to wild weather.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget the day in Hong Kong, we were in this really cool little village called Tai-o. It’s considered the Venice of Hong Kong, no streets, all canals and little bridge sidewalks.&nbsp;This restaurant is mostly outside, and I’m seeing rain come down like I’ve never seen rain come down before&nbsp;— and I lived in New Orleans through hurricanes.</p>
<p>“Most of these little restaurants have little metal, sort of, tin roofs. So the sound is deafening. And I’m sitting there thinking, ‘Wow, this really could go south. How are we going to do this?’&nbsp;You just figure out ways around it.”</p>
<p>The takeaway from seven months of globe-hopping, she said, was this: “I’ve never encountered so many great people from so many walks of life.</p>
<p>“Globally, people just want to see everybody succeed, and you really see that come to life with this show.”</p>
