<h1>Analyzing the market for the Penguins' Matt Murray</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the second time since 2017, Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford could soon be saying goodbye to a Stanley Cup-winning goaltender.</p>
<p>The $81.5 million flat salary cap has made it a near impossibility to keep both restricted free agent goalies Matt Murray and Tristan Jarry on the roster into 2020-21. With the draft approaching and free agency on the horizon next week, Murray’s time in Pittsburgh is most likely nearing its end after parts of five seasons and two championships.</p>
<p>Murray’s age, 26, and postseason track record makes him an interesting chip at the bargaining table. But he’s not the only goalie out there. Here’s a look at how a crowded market could drive down the price, what Murray offers that the others can’t and some possible destinations.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>A crowded market</strong></span></p>
<p>Two factors have come together to create a buyer’s market for goaltender-needy teams: A tight salary cap has limited the number of teams willing to bid for an upgrade in net, and more significantly, a glut of goalies has become available in free agency or through possible trades.</p>
<p><strong>Unrestricted free agents</strong> — Vancouver’s <strong>Jacob Markstrom</strong> and Vegas’ <strong>Robin Lehner</strong> are starting-caliber goalies available to the highest bidder, although there are reports Lehner already has a handshake deal with Vegas. A few years ago, Washington’s <strong>Braden Holtby</strong> was considered one of the best goalies in the game, though he lost the net to a younger, cheaper option this past season. The main benefit of choosing this avenue is that the buyer won’t have to cough up an additional asset in a trade.</p>
<p><strong>Aging veterans</strong>&nbsp;— Chicago’s <strong>Corey Crawford </strong>(35), Detroit’s <strong>Jimmy Howard&nbsp;</strong>(36), Edmonton’s <strong>Mike Smith</strong>&nbsp;(38) and Anaheim’s Ryan Miller (40) are some of the game’s most-recognizable names. But how much do they have left? The New York Rangers also reportedly plan to buyout <strong>Henrik Lundqvist</strong> (38), adding yet another name to that list.</p>
<p><strong>Backups looking for more</strong>&nbsp;— Dallas Stars goalie <strong>Anton Khudobin</strong> is at the top of that list after leading the Stars to the Stanley Cup final in Ben Bishop’s absence. He played like a No. 1 this postseason, and maybe someone gives him a chance to prove it throughout an entire year. Calgary Flames goalie <strong>Cam Talbot</strong> and the New York Islanders’ <strong>Thomas Greiss</strong> are solid tandem options as well.</p>
<p><strong>Others on the trading block</strong>&nbsp;— Finally, the Penguins aren’t the only ones who could have a goalie on the trading block. <strong>Marc-Andre Fleury</strong> could be on the move, either in a trade or as a buyout candidate. The Arizona Coyotes are also reportedly open to moving <strong>Darcy Kuemper</strong>. Toronto’s <strong>Frederik Andersen</strong> is entering the last year of his deal and might be available for the right price.</p>
<p><strong><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">What’s the sales pitch?</span></strong></p>
<p>If you skimmed that last section, here’s the point: A lot of goalies are out there. Fifteen of them have been referenced so far in this story alone.</p>
<p>So what makes Murray stand out? Aside from the fact that you can find his name twice on the Stanley Cup, Murray has one thing the other can’t offer: youth.</p>
<p>Of the goalies previously mentioned, only Lehner, 29, is still in his 20s. Murray is 26.</p>
<p>Traditionally, a goaltender’s prime starts in his mid-20s and ends soon after his 30th birthday. Consider that active goalies have 10 combined Vezina trophies. Nine occurred when the player was in his 20s. Even though Murray posted the worst save parentage of his career (.899) during an inconsistent regular season, he should theoretically be in his prime for at least a few more seasons.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>What’s the return?</strong></span></p>
<p>The Montreal Canadiens gave up a third-round pick to acquire Jake Allen, a former starter in St. Louis before the emergence of Jordan Binnington. If a goalie who will back up Carey Price can fetch a third-round pick, Murray surely should bring in more as a younger option with more upside. A second-round pick seems very realistic. A first-round pick might be possible if Rutherford can find the right team or the right package of assets.</p>
<p>If the Penguins don’t get a pick back in return, prospects are more likely than a player. The Penguins already have more than $75 million committed against the $81.5 million upper limit, <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/" target="_blank">according to CapFriendly</a>. That’s before they sign Jarry, which will likely cost in the $3 million to $4 million range. Dominik Simon, Sam Lafferty and Anthony Angello are also restricted free agents. Unless Rutherford orchestrates another big move to get a salary off the books, the Penguins don’t have much room to add another NHL salary.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;" data-mce-mark="1"><strong>Where could Murray go?</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Edmonton&nbsp;</strong>— The Penguins and Oilers have reportedly engaged in trade discussions surrounding Murray. However, TSN’s Pierre LeBrun reported the Penguins are looking for a first-round pick and Edmonton isn’t ready to part with its 14th overall selection — at least not yet.</p>
<p>The Oilers would be a good fit for Murray. They have a lot of the right pieces to be a contender with 2016-17 Hart Trophy winner Connor McDavid at the top of that list. If Murray plays like he did during the recent Cup runs, he could help push a talented roster over the top.</p>
<p><strong>Colorado</strong>&nbsp;— The Avalanche leaned on a tandem of Philipp Grubauer and Pavel Francouz. While both helped contribute to the fifth-fewest goals in the league, Grubauer will become an unrestricted free agent in 2021 and Francouz will join him in 2022. While both are solid, is either worth the investment to keep them in Colorado long term? The Avalanche could benefit from a more-proven veteran to backstop a talented roster, and they have one of the deepest prospect pools to make a trade happen.</p>
<p><strong>Toronto</strong>&nbsp;— The Leafs are no stranger to goaltender trades. They acquired Andersen from Anaheim in 2016 in exchange for the 30th overall pick in the 2016 NHL draft and a second-round pick in 2017. With just one year left on a deal that carries a $5 million cap hit, Andersen might once again be on the trading block. If the Leafs are ready to move on, Murray is an option.</p>
<p><strong>Calgary</strong>&nbsp;— After earning an appearance in the All-Star Game, David Rittich eventually finished the postseason backing up Talbot. With Talbot set to become a free agent in a few days and Rittich still unproven, Murray could provide a veteran with a high floor.</p>
<p><strong>Ottawa</strong>&nbsp;— After nearly a decade, the Senators moved on from 39-year-old Craig Anderson. The Senators have several prospects who could compete for a No. 1, so it remains to be seen if they’d want to invest in a short-term answer. But one intriguing factor to this destination is the Senators also have an insane $43-plus million in cap space, which could be used to take on Jack Johnson’s contract if the Penguins want to use Murray to shake up their roster even more.</p>
<p><strong>Buffalo</strong>&nbsp;— The Sabres have an average tandem in Linus Ullmark and Carter Hutton. With Ullmark headed for restricted free agency, maybe Buffalo chooses to negotiate an extension with Murray, a more-proven and accomplished RFA.</p>
<p><strong>Carolina</strong>&nbsp;— Starter Petr Mrázek posted a league-average .905 save percentage and forms a competent but not compelling tandem with James Reimer. The Hurricanes have been a playoff team back-to-back seasons. If they want to get to the next level, an upgrade in goal can help them get there.</p>
