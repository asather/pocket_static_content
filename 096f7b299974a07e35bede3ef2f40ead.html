<h1>Sonny Vaccaro sees reason for joy — and skepticism&nbsp;— in NCAA's breakthrough measures</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sonny Vaccaro was mid-sentence when his hurried cadence took a pause. He couldn’t help but let out a chuckle.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the NCAA’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-colleges/2020/04/29/NCAA-board-of-governors-supports-name-image-and-likeness-compensation/stories/202004290078" target="_blank">highest governing body expressed support</a> for rule changes that would allow college athletes to receive compensation for third-party endorsements, a major breakthrough given the history of the organization. As is often the case with the Trafford native and the NCAA, his feelings were complex.</p>
<p>“I think it’s very positive,” Vaccaro, a former sports marketing executive who&nbsp;pioneered deals between apparel companies and college programs,&nbsp;said before stopping briefly. “But what are they going to put in it? Everything is still restricted. That was my interpretation, a layman’s interpretation. It was the right thing, but we’re going to do it under subterfuge here. We’re going to do it, but we’re not admitting we’re doing it.”</p>
<p>A decade ago, Wednesday’s decision would have been unimaginable from an organization prone to being slow to change.</p>
<p>Its board of governors, relying on a report from an NCAA working group, cleared the way for athletes to capitalize off their name, image and likeness (NLI), something that had previously been forbidden and stood for years as one of the most consistent critiques of the collegiate athletic model.</p>
<p>If the recommendation is ultimately approved, athletes will be able to monetize whatever level of fame they’ve created for themselves, something that has long been a source of punishment for those who pursued it and, in the process, violated NCAA rules.&nbsp;In addition to endorsements, athletes can be paid from social media activity or personal appearances such as autograph signings.&nbsp;It’s a measure that, in the NCAA’s own words, is “unprecedented.”</p>
<p>“NCAA membership schools have embraced very real change,” NCAA president Mark Emmert said Wednesday.</p>
<p>It’s a layered subject, though. Should the NCAA’s three divisions adopt the rule — as they are expected to — and it takes effect for the 2021-22 academic year, it will come with what the organization described as “guardrails.”</p>
<p>Payments to athletes would be regulated by a yet-to-be-determined body that ensures a “genuine” transaction that could not be considered “pay for play.” Agents and other representation players hire will also be regulated. Schools and boosters can’t use potential NLI opportunities as a recruiting inducement. Whatever payments an athlete receives have to be consistent with what is considered fair market value.</p>
<p>“What we don’t want is boosters being part of the recruitment pitches,” Big East commissioner Val Ackerman, who helped lead the working group, said on a conference call Wednesday. “This is probably one of the most pressing problems we have and will require intense focus in the coming months.”</p>
<p>In many ways, the NCAA’s ongoing effort to modernize its amateur model is a victory in what has been a long-standing fight for Vaccaro.</p>
<p>In his work in marketing and grassroots basketball with Nike, he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2013/06/16/One-man-rebellion-Sonny-Vaccaro-takes-on-the-NCAA/stories/201306160231" target="_blank">helped foster the first relationships</a> between basketball programs and shoe companies four decades ago, an enormous source of revenue that has helped make major college athletics the multi-billion-dollar venture it is.</p>
<p>While that system has enriched coaches and administrators, Vaccaro has stood as a consistent, passionate advocate for athletes’ rights, even serving a prominent role in the <em>O’Bannon v. NCAA</em> antitrust lawsuit that challenged the organization’s right to use a player’s name and image for commercial purposes without the athlete being compensated.</p>
<p>“All the lawsuits, all the money being sent to fight this comes down to the reality — why the public finally understands this thing can work for both sides,” said Vaccaro, who later worked for apparel companies Adidas and Reebok. “They can have their games, and the kids when they’re put on a video game, that’s them. That’s not some fictitious person. They’re selling them the rest of their lives.</p>
<p>“The most galling statement they ever made was when the athlete signs a scholarship, they say, ‘We own your identity into perpetuity.’ It’s the most ludicrous thing that anyone in a free country could ever say. How do they own these athletes? It’s that word ‘amateurism’. Amateurism gives them a right.”</p>
<p>That amateur model received some of its most imposing threats last year. In more than 20 states, bills had either been signed or were pending that would allow college athletes to profit off their name, image and likeness, beginning with the signing of the Fair Pay to Play Act in California in September 2019.&nbsp;Pennsylvania House members Dan Miller and Ed Gainey, both of whom represent districts in Allegheny County, circulated their own bill last fall too.</p>
<p>While the NCAA’s actions Wednesday could reasonably be read as a response to that legislation, the organization said it will engage with Congress on a number of steps. Those include ensuring federal preemption over state NLI laws, establishing a “safe harbor” for the NCAA to provide protection against lawsuits filed for NLI rules, safeguarding the non-employment status of college athletes and maintaining the distinction between college and professional athletes.</p>
<p>Initiatives like that give Vaccaro a degree of pause.</p>
<p>“They’re going to go to the grave with their amateurism,” he said. “It’s the reason there’s a problem, but it’s also the reason they can control everybody. That word controls people in that situation to go to college athletics. They have to protect that word.”</p>
<p>With the board’s recommendation, opportunities for athletes that were once illegal could suddenly become available. Those in the primary revenue sports of football and men’s basketball would appear to be the biggest potential beneficiaries, but Vaccaro is also hopeful for what it could do for high-profile female athletes such as former Oregon women’s basketball star Sabrina Ionescu, the No. 1 pick in the WNBA draft earlier this month whose college jersey sold out within three hours of Nike making it available to purchase last November.</p>
<p>The adoration and social media followings their success has garnered — which for some athletes far exceeds the cost of a scholarship — could soon prove to be valuable.</p>
<p>Thinking back to the work of himself and others as Wednesday’s news spread, there’s not so much pride as elation for Vaccaro. As he sees it, a door has been opened and a glass ceiling has been cracked.</p>
<p>Still, he longs for more.</p>
<p>“I just want them to do the right thing,” Vaccaro said. “This is a step in the right direction. However [the NCAA] put it in their own words with their brilliant lawyers and somebody writing it for them, it comes down to these kids being able to earn money off of what they’re doing and what they’re doing is their own. It’s their name. It’s their likeness. It’s preposterous.</p>
<p>“They didn’t steal money out of a bank. They didn’t rob or beat up somebody or take some lady’s purse. They just said, ‘That’s me on screen.’”</p>
