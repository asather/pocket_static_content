<h1>PWSA delays startup of filtration plant in Highland Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A&nbsp;“technical equipment issue” has delayed the planned startup this week of a revamped microfiltration system in Highland Park, the&nbsp;Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority announced Saturday.</p>
<p>“Out of an abundance of caution, the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority will delay the start of the Microfiltration Plant in Highland Park. This is due to a technical equipment issue identified during pre-startup testing,” the PWSA said in a release.</p>
<p>“Our staff and consultants are identifying the replacement equipment to address the issue while also working with the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) on modifications to our permit. These modifications will allow us to install the new equipment. Based on current progress, we anticipate a revised restart date to be within 30 days.”</p>
<p>On Monday, PWSA said it was ready to put the microfiltration plant back into service this week after a three-year, $14 million project that brought the plant up to stricter state quality standards.&nbsp;The project improved the plant’s treatment methods, rehabilitated the microfiltration system and improved security around the Highland Reservoir No. 1, according to a release from the PWSA. Construction began in 2017.</p>
<p>Once on line, the plant’s microfiltration system will include ultraviolet light disinfection technology in the treatment process in addition to membrane filtration, an additional barrier against microorganisms in the water.</p>
<p>Because the reservoir is open to the air, the water is not considered potable and must be treated before distribution.</p>
