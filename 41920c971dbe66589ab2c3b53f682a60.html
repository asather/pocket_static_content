<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 08.03.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey everybody, welcome to my first chat of pseudo-Steelers training camp. Just hung up(?) on a Zoom call with Ike Hilliard, the new receivers coach. He has one of the youngest WR groups in the NFL, so we‚Äôll take your questions on that topic and whatever else is on your mind this Monday.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hey Brian, I enjoy the chats. The Pirates‚Äô broadcasters have been doing games located in the network studio. Have you heard if the Steelers‚Äô broadcasters will be at Heinz or will they also be in a studio? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, James. I have not heard anything about that yet. But I can ask. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And as someone who has paid vague attention to the Pirates broadcasts here and there, I don‚Äôt notice much of a difference.</p>
<p><strong>Georgia Steeler</strong>: Hello Brian, Just got back from HHI and the courses were as Warren Zevon would say ‚Äúwas (were) perfect üèåüèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.‚Äù Still positive vibes on #7 ? Recieving core looks very dangerous to opposing defenses, just hope the running game can meet expectations. Your guess on is there a season üèà. thanks again. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They must be taking care of the greens better than I‚Äôm taking care of the lawn in my backyard. Anyway, yeah, positive vibes on Ben Roethlisberger for sure. But he‚Äôll have a chance to speak for himself for the first time in a while when he meets with local reporters on Zoom tomorrow morning. Look out for Gerry Dulac‚Äôs story off of that call. <br> <br> I still would bet on there being a season, if I had to bet. This past week in MLB isn‚Äôt exactly encouraging, but perhaps the NFL - and its players - are learning from this just how vigilant they have to be.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: I am excited to see D.J. catching passes from Ben. What kind of production should we expect from him? Is he a Pro Bowl caliber WR? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I‚Äôm not ready to go that far just yet. Need to see more from Diontae Johnson before I forecast Pro Bowl status for him. But in Year 2 I think it‚Äôs fair to expect more consistency in terms of his hands and ball security. Trying to take a stab at his stats will be tough given that JuJu should be healthier, James Washington has another year under his belt and Chase Claypool is such an X-factor.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong>: I have been skeptical about the whole fake crowd noise thing for NFL games, but I think it has worked fairly well with hockey thus far. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Agreed. Same with basketball and baseball, from what I‚Äôve seen/heard. To me, it doesn‚Äôt take away from the enjoyment of watching the games one iota. Also don‚Äôt miss seeing cutaways to the crowd either.</p>
<p><strong>Kayla</strong>: With some nfl defensive players signing huge new extensions, I‚Äôm worried the Steelers may not be able to sign Heyward. In addition to his play, he‚Äôs great for the locker room and the community. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah I‚Äôm still not too worried about them getting a deal done with Cam Heyward. If the defensive line depth behind him were more promising, it might be a different story. But he‚Äôs an integral part of the defense and the team for all the reasons you mentioned. I know it‚Äôs not as easy/simple to say this as it has been in previous years, but I think they‚Äôll make it work.</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Who do you think the zero preseason games will hurt the most for either regular season preps and/or roster chances? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It‚Äôll hurt anyone new to the team the most, and then after that, anyone new to the NFL. So your draft picks, and especially your undrafted rookies. Let‚Äôs just look at the first eight guys who got cut in order to meet the reduced roster size. Three skill position players who ended last year on the practice squad, three signed from the XFL and two UDFAs. Didn‚Äôt even get a chance to show what they could do.</p>
<p><strong>Sergio From Mexico</strong>: Hello BB! Thks for the chats! Hope you and yours are safe and healthy!!! Questions... what happens with a player Contract if he opts out for the season... does that year count? And what about his salary? Does it count vs the cap? Thanks a Vamos Steelers!!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Me and mine are all good. If a player opts out, he still gets an accrued season but his contract is delayed a year. His salary is removed from the cap equation, other than any signing bonuses the player might be due. If I‚Äôm wrong about any of that, feel free to fact-chat-check me.</p>
<p><strong>Jacob</strong>: Hi Brian...just wondered if you saw the shrewd move made by the Steelers...releasing former Pitt standout receiver Henderson to free up salary cap money to sign Antonio Brown. üòÄ <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hello, Jacob. Yes, I saw that. Gotta make space in that crowded receiver room somehow. And shame on me for completely forgetting to ask Ike Hilliard about whether the Steelers intend to bring back Mr. Big Chest when we spoke with him at 11:30. I‚Äôm sure that question would‚Äôve gone over well.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Brian - saw the Steelers adding some safeties. Will they address the depth issue at safety or just taking a closer look at those players? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well they‚Äôve added one safety, but not an insignificant one in Curtis Riley. He‚Äôs got four years of experience and has 19 starts over the past two seasons (including all 16 games in 2018 with the Giants). That seems like the kind of resume that will get him a long look when it comes time to make roster decisions, and the fact that he‚Äôs played a lot of deep safety in his career might even vault him into the backup role vacated by Kam Kelly/Sean Davis behind Minkah Fitzpatrick.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Hi, Brian. Do you think Curtis Riley has chance to eventually unseat Terrell Edmunds? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Greetings, Buster. My first inclination is to say no, because of Riley‚Äôs experience mostly as a free safety and Edmunds being this team‚Äôs strong safety. But with Minkah‚Äôs versatility, if his duties can/do expand in his second year here, it‚Äôs not out of the question to think he could play either spot. One thing we should keep in mind here though is that Riley was on the free-agent market all offseason. The Steelers didn‚Äôt just sign Ed Reed or Troy Polamalu here.</p>
<p><strong>Buzzard Bill</strong>: Hey Brian, I assume that any Steelers that test positive will be isolated and can then return to the team as soon as they clear the virus and test negative. Is that correct? What are the rules now concerning outside contact between players and their families? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: First point of clarification: although four players have been put on the reserve/COVID list, we don‚Äôt know for sure that any of those four have tested positive. They could‚Äôve just been exposed to someone who did. But let‚Äôs say one did test positive... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: If he‚Äôs not showing symptoms of COVID, he must isolate for 10 days after testing positive, or after testing negative twice in a row within five days of testing positive. If he IS symptomatic, he must wait at least 10 days from first having symptoms and then at least 72 hours after last having symptoms.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: cap question. can they extend Ben and pay him in retirement? I think the Mets are still cutting Bonilla a check! thanks for the chats <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You can‚Äôt necessarily PAY him in retirement, but the Steelers could do something like what the Saints did this year with Drew Brees. He technically signed a four-year deal in March, but the last two years - you know, when he‚Äôd be 43 and 44 - are void years. They‚Äôre only put in the deal so the team can spread out his signing bonus and lessen their cap hit in the short-term. It makes sense to get creativity with aging quarterbacks who are basically going year to year but can still help you win a Super Bowl before they hang it up.</p>
<p><strong>Doug from Raleigh</strong>: I confess to not paying much attention to chats in the last few months, so if this is plowed ground, just ignore it. How do you see the season playing out? They manage to play all the games, a high percentage, half, or some hodgepodge with 2 weeks breaks for teams to test negative? Thanks Brian, you‚Äôre the best. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: The ground has been plowed, Doug, and no judgment passed upon you for not paying attention to NFL talk in July. That being said, the answer is just that I don‚Äôt know. Nobody knows. Even the NFL will have to, as Mike Tomlin would say, have a hardcore plan but be light on their feet.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hello Brian. Did Mark Barron play that bad or is there some other reason that the Steelers (or any other team to date) have shown no interest him? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi Donna. The way I see it is he wasn‚Äôt particularly good last year, and he missed a lot of practice time for veteran maintenance days. Barron will only be 31 in October, but he‚Äôs always been a hard-hitter who plays a position where age can catch up to you quickly. He‚Äôs also played at least 12 games every year of his career, so a decent amount of wear-and-tear on him. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As for the Steelers specifically, they let him go partially because of salary cap reasons but also because of something Keith Butler alluded to Friday. The communication just wasn‚Äôt quite right sometimes in the middle of their defense, and though he might have gotten more comfortable as the season went on, they figured they‚Äôll just cut their losses with him and see if returning Vince Williams to more of a full-time role will help with that.</p>
<p><strong>SteelByDesign</strong>: How (if at all) will the competitive aspects of the game change if there‚Äôs no fans in the stadium? Does it potentially help a team (like this one) that‚Äôs weaker on offense when they don‚Äôt have to deal with so much crowd noise? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: To me it‚Äôs kind of a moot point if there‚Äôs less crowd noise in 2020. Any edge an offense might get for being able to hear checks and whatnot would be just as advantageous to a defense trying to communicate pre-snap. So if anything, maybe homefield just doesn‚Äôt matter quite as much. Unless of course teams pipe in noise that‚Äôs somehow louder than organic crowds would be. Bet big on all the dome teams!</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: Is there any thought to modify mouth pieces to act like a mask <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure about mouth pieces, but a few players - JJ Watt most notably - already spoke out against the idea of modifying equipment for COVID precautions. For better or worse, many of these guys are creatures of habit who crave comfort and normalcy above all else to do their jobs. Which is why you‚Äôre not seeing quite as much news about these helmet prototypes some companies have designed. The NFLPA would probably push back pretty hard if the league tried to mandate something along those lines</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas</strong>: Being a big fan of Louis Riddick, I was glad to hear he will be on MNF. I think he will brin some credibility to the broadcast booth which has been lacking. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Totally agree, Nicholas. Louis Riddick is excellent at this whole media thing. It‚Äôs not like the guy was a perennial Pro Bowler or even a starter when he played. He was a ninth-round draft pick. Wasn‚Äôt a loudmouth or anything who drew attention to himself. He‚Äôs just really good at what he does, and it‚Äôs nice to see that being rewarded, especially in this business.</p>
<p><strong>Natalie</strong>: Hi, who are your favorite Steelers to interview? Also, since I‚Äôm having pizza, what are your top 5 pizza places? Thanks Brian! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey Natalie. What a delightful question. I wish I could have pizza for lunch every day. My favorite Steelers to interview, off the top of my head, are probably Cam Heyward, Joe Haden, Zach Banner, Mike Hilton and Trey Edmunds. All are very engaging and it‚Äôs not like pulling teeth to get insight. As for pizza, I‚Äôm a big fan of Iron Born, Caliente and Bado‚Äôs. I‚Äôll give the last two spots to my college spot, Sorrento‚Äôs and Antoon‚Äôs.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Can you explain the COVID reserved list versus opting out? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure. The reserve/COVID list is basically just an IR for players who either tested positive or came in close contact with someone who did. You can fill their roster spot, but also they can be activated at any time. Opting out means you‚Äôre just not on the roster or the salary cap for 2020. There‚Äôs no max to either one.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry</strong>: I say let Heyward test free agency.Because we gotta pay TJ, Minkah,JuJu and Bush. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: From a financial perspective, it would make some sense. However, I‚Äôd prioritize Heyward as a piece of the puzzle over JuJu. And Bush is still a ways away to start thinking about his next deal.</p>
<p><strong>Paul from Sacramento</strong>: Hi Brian, I really enjoy your chats and insights.. Why do you think Jaylen Samuels saw such a drop off?? Even with Conners getting hurt.. I kinda thought he was exciting (receiving out of the backfield..) but, just never got the ball.. what happened? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He was banged up last year, too. But he did get the ball here and there, and didn‚Äôt seem to make much progress in terms of his explosiveness or power as a runner from Year 1 to Year 2.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby B.</strong>: To piggyback off Nicholas and your response to him concerning Louis Riddick, I‚Äôm in total agreement with both of you. I would love to see him in the Steelers‚Äô front office if he decides to leave tv. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He‚Äôs reportedly been up for jobs before. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me at all if someone ends up hiring him. I‚Äôd trust him, I know that much.</p>
<p><strong>Bart Scott</strong>: How dare you include Troy Polamalu in a sentence with Ed Reed! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Get outta here, Bart.</p>
<p><strong>Sergio From Mexico</strong>: Hey Brian. so when do all the conspiracy theories start with the cheating Pats... will all of the team opt out and they will forfeit the season to get Trevor Lawrence??? <br> On a less sarcastic note... I feel optimistic about this season and our chances. What say you??? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They‚Äôve already started, Sergio! And on another note, I‚Äôm all out of non-sarcastic responses. Thanks to everyone for stopping by. If you have any other questions, tweet me at @BrianBatko or email me at bbatko@post-gazette.com. Might even find yourself in a mailbag on Post-Gazette . com.</p>
