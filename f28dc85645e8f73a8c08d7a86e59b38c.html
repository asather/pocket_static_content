<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 08.19.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello, everyone, and welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. We'll get started around noon, but feel free to ask your questions now. Will be back here shortly to answer them. Thanks! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: And away we go ...</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>: Who would be the Pirates obligatory All Star representative so far? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Oh, boy, Neil. This is a tough one. Probably Colin Moran, honestly. And it wouldn't be pretty. I've kicked around in my head Phillip Evans and Erik Gonzalez, but there's just no way. Kevin Newman has been good lately, but really struggled at the beginning. Jacob Stallings' defense has been good, but there hasn't been much there offensively. So, yeah, I guess I'd go Moran.</p>
<p><strong>Bill Chapman</strong>: With the Pirates obviously going no where this season, it leads me to several questions. 1. When is the trade deadline this year. Not that the Pirates have much to offer but Frazier, Dyson, Kela wrapped together might bring you a minor league pitcher or outfielder. 2. What is the status of Hayes? Is he healthy and have a future in the big leagues and 3. Where is Jose Osuna? I have seen or heard his name mentioned in weeks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Bill. Thanks for the questions. 1. Aug. 31. I agree on Kela, but I don't know about the other two. Dyson is hitting .143, Frazier .184. Hard to see either attracting too many offers, although Frazier had some interest at the Winter Meetings; so, it's conceivable that would still exist despite the poor start. ... 2. He's healthy, working out in Altoona and absolutely should. I'd be stunned if he's not up by the end of August. He should be up now, frankly. ... 3. Jose Osuna is on the team. I don't know why he's not playing more. Dude had 10 home runs last year. Led the NL in pinch-hit home runs. And he's basically an afterthought. His last at-bat came 16 days ago.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>: Are the Pirates the only team in the league that has to deal with injuries? A common retort to their poor performance points to their injuries, but I'm not seeing an All-Star roster on their IL. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Fair point, Neil. They've talked a lot about injuries, managing the bullpen, the shortened spring training, the quick ramp-up, etc. While I won't deny those are factors, they're hardly the only team dealing with them. And they haven't played well enough to overcome that. They also don't have enough talent -- because ownership should spend more -- to overcome those struggles.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>: Has Neil Huntington been hired by any other team? I thought I remember him being talked about as recently as last year as being desired by other teams such as the Giants. Was that all nonsense? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He has not. That was before he was fired. But he's still getting paid by the Pirates. And, hey, if it was either one of us, we'd be OK being paid to do nothing, too.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hello Jason. While watching last night’s game, I heard that Cole Tucker has been working out at second. It seems to me that Tucker should play short if he plays infield and Newman should move to second which could be the double play combo of the future. I’m concerned Tucker’s play may be affected by being moved around so much. Also, with social distancing, why are boats like the Gateway Clipper allowed to operate? I’ve seen these large boats on the river while watching our Bucs. Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I can't give you a reasonable answer on that second one, Donna. I mean, I think we all know the real answer: $$$. Same reason the casinos are allowed to operate. ... As for Tucker, I don't have any issue with it, honestly. He's been playing second dating back to spring training. So has Newman. I think Tucker has the versatility to handle it. What will hold Tucker back is his hitting. If he can figure out the offensive part -- strike out less, make more consistent contact -- then I think they'll easily find a place for him to play. I've actually kinda liked him in center. But he needs reps.</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: In light of Dyson’s dismal batting average, is he close to being replaced by Cole Tucker or maybe even Jason Martin? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He should be, I know that. Honestly, if this team was gonna hover around .500 or even be remotely competitive, I can see the value in someone like Dyson. Now, not so much. I'm OK keeping him around as a fourth outfielder, but that's it. He's a good vet and well-liked in the clubhouse. He can teach Tucker and Jason Martin some things. But those guys -- or maybe even Jared Oliva -- should be playing every day. Heck, even Erik Gonzalez. ... You might have to stick with Polanco (.075), hoping he figures it out, but I would rotate the other spot.</p>
<p><strong>TONYSUFAK</strong>: Why dont the reporters ask Shelton any tough questions? Tired of hearing all the platitudes. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: What should be asked that isn't being asked, Tony? Also, have you listened to every single one of his pre- and postgame sessions to catalog what has been asked?</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: Hi Jason. Any idea if/when Hayes will be brought up? Can he play any other positions besides third base? Appreciate the chats! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Yuri. He's a third baseman, plain and simple. And a very good one. They haven't moved him around because he is so good defensively there. I would expect by the end of August if not before.</p>
<p><strong>Jim M</strong>: Hi Jason, I enjoyed your “Pirates Takeaways” article from this morning. Do you think the trade deadline at the end of the month might be the catalyst for playing the young guys? Not that we should expect any big trades. I say bring up Hayes, Will Craig, O’Neil Cruz, Cederlind etc. why not try Cruz in RF? Maybe he could hit better than 0.75. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Jim. It could be, although I'm not sure I would wait that long, honestly. I would send a message. You're 4-15. To whom must we be loyal here? I'd try Hayes, Craig, Cederlind and others. What's the worst that can happen? They lose? To my knowledge, Cruz has not worked in the outfield, so I would stick with him at shortstop for now. I would worry about putting him out there in a major league game right now and what that might look like. But I would give him a shot to hit.</p>
<p><strong>bob from mt. lebanon</strong>: It looks like Newman, deservedly, is back as the starting SS. His strong 2019 season and his current hot bat are responsible for his status. But from a pure defensive standpoint, who is the best: Gonzalez, Newman or Tucker? Please rate them 1-2-3. Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Bob. I think Gonzalez is probably the best defender in there, although Tucker is close. I also like Tucker's versatility. I think of the three, he has fared the best in the outfield. Also, by no means do I think Newman is a poor defender. I just think the other two are honestly pretty solid.</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: Your column today was spot on! How can Dyson get picked off in that situation, especially after the catcher "double-clutched" his throw, I'm not impressed with Shelton's managerial decision making, ot that of his coaching staff. And how can he keep Polanco in the lineup? There is no development happening at all. Very dispointing. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Tom. I actually wasn't convinced Dyson was safe, either. It was a close call, but I think the bigger point should be that you can't risk that happening. The Pirates have not looked terribly smart on the bases. And I don't know how I feel about Shelton, honestly. Like him as a person. Like how he is with us. But, yeah, some of the tactical decisions are questionable at best. I also would acknowledge how little talent he has to work with. Zero margin for error.</p>
<p><strong>Lindy</strong>: Hey Jason. Enjoy these chats. I know teams aren’t exactly knocking at the Pirates’ door with the season they are having, but have you heard any trade rumors? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Lindy. If I heard anything substantive on trades, I would report it, believe me. I think there's obvious interest in Kela, although teams will want to see his pitch well before doing anything. I also think this will be kind of a feeling-out process with the deadline being a little more than a month into the season.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: A question about the frequent number of cross-ups in signs between the catcher and pitcher when there is a runner at second. Obviously, the Pirates have had loads of problems with this, but in fairness I've watched a number of non-Pirate games, too, and have seen other teams have the same problem. I'm wondering if this might be reaction to the Astros' sign stealing and teams are trying to make their signs more complex or if it could be something else...fast ramp-up to the regular season, unfamiliarity between pitchers and catchers working together because more pitchers are being used, or just plain inexperience? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's closer to the first point, Drew. Baseball teams have become incredibly ... I don't know narcissistic or skeptical of opposing teams stealing signs. I guess with the Astros mess, for good reasons. But they have several sets of signs that they cycle through, and I think we could probably say too many. I'm still a believer in you have a reasonable amount of signs, and if you notice someone trying to steal 'em, you hit someone. I think there's a line when it comes being secretive and stupid, and they're flirting with it.</p>
<p><strong>Spazeroski</strong>: How can you possibly say in your article that last night’s starting pitching performance was “so-so”? Three runs in three innings is simply not acceptable for a team <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It was his second MLB start. It was also a 3-3 game going into extra innings -- Brubaker gave his team a chance to win the game. But also, he's thrown a total of 11 innings over four appearances. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Oh, and I'm a total moron. So there's that. :-)</p>
<p><strong>Dude</strong>: Isn’t it time to accept Polanco is just not a major league player ? His at-bat in the 10th last night was an embarrassment. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Maybe. I'm torn with Polanco. On one hand, I agree with you. I don't care who you are, .075 is really, really bad, and that player simply should not pay every day. On the other hand, they're paying Polanco a lot of money. They need him to figure it out. I almost wonder if it wouldn't do the Pirates some good to bench Polanco for a series or something and let him clear his head.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats Jason. I am tired of the small market team excuse. Are you? Yes small markets can have tough years but 20+? This team and organization is a joke and when we can get back to normal I hope people continue to stay away from the ballpark. The town makes fun of how the Bengals are run, we are the Bengals of MLB <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes, I don't like the small market excuse either. My argument would be the Rays and A's. They've found ways to win. Why can't the Pirates? Now, I think the previous regime had its run, and it was time to move on. It'll take time -- obviously -- for this new group to get things turned around. But I don't like saying we can't do this because of our market size. The Rooneys do it with the Steelers in the same market. Ron and Mario do it with the Penguins in the same market. And hey, if Nutting can only spend so much, fine. I'm not criticizing. I obviously do not have enough money to buy an MLB. But if you can't afford to pay what it costs to run a competitive team, please just sell the Pirates to someone who can.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: Looks like Crick will be back soon. Any updates on Musgrove and Keller? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You're right. Won't be much longer. And we should learn more today from Todd Tomczyk -- who talks at 4:30 p.m. -- on the other two.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: No expansion of rosters September 1st? Do you anticipate the Pirates to bring up any other young players from Altoona in September? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would sure hope so. I don't see why they're not up here now, honestly.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hi Jason, no questions for you. Just want to recognize that yesterday was the birthday of the great Roberto Clemente. His accomplishments on and off the field should never be forgotten. Arriba Roberto! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Agree, 1,000% Thank you for pointing that out. If any of yinz ever get the chance to check out the Robert Clemente Museum, do it.</p>
<p><strong>Chase</strong>: If the Pirates need to rebuild with scouting and development of young players then why are Larry Broadway, Junior Vizcaino, and Joe Dellicarri still here? That regime is what got us in this mess and now Cherington is relying on them? Makes no sense to me <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Fair point, Chase. There seems to be a culture in baseball -- and I don't totally understand it -- of going at a glacial pace with this stuff. If you stink, OK, you stink, and you try to fix it. That's how a hockey team would operate. But their reasoning goes something like this: They want to learn what was done here before, see what worked, what didn't, where the faults are, then react off of that. Again, I don't totally agree with it, but 1. It doesn't matter what I think and 2. That's why those guys are still around. I have a tough time seeing all three stick around for the 2021 season.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Pirates get first pick. Who you taking? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Oh, c'mon. Kumar Rocker. No question.</p>
<p><strong>Ashlee M.</strong>: I admit, I’m a casual Pirates fan with two young sons and a budget that is tight. I will pay to watch winning teams but not hundreds to watch a rebuild.I’m going to spend the money when it’s worth it.What year do you see the Pirates as legitimate threats to win a championship? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Ashlee, I completely understand. I have two little ones, too. If I wasn't paid to go, I likely would not make that sort of financial investment given how little financial investment ownership has made and how little I hear from folks at the top. To me, you can have one or the other, but not both. ... I can't give you a year, but it's definitely going to take some time, if ever. ... I think the Pirates can get competitive again in a couple years, maybe 2-3, but to win a championship? That's crazy hard for tight-budget teams. Maybe impossible. They'd probably have to spend a lot more than they are now, unless baseball institutes a salary cap.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Because I can only watch one game at a time and because it's always the Pirates when they're playing, I can't really compare this with other teams. So is it my imagination or are Pirate pitchers really worse that most other teams' in not getting out of innings once they get two out and have no one on? And similarly, do their pitchers get to an 0-2 count and then get either to 3-2 or the whole way to a walk more often than most other teams' pitchers do? It seems like it to me but maybe that's just my own frustration coloring what I see. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Rich, thank you for making me look this up. Dead serious. So I did some quick research and found this nugget: Pirates pitchers have the worst ERA (4.57) in baseball when they're ahead in the count. I think we can probably debate cause vs. effect here, but it speaks to what you're saying. They also have 48 walks when entering two-strike counts, a total eclipsed by only six teams.</p>
<p><strong>Bored in the ‘burgh</strong>: Right now, I find that watching the Democratic Convention is more exciting than watching the Pirates. C’mon Buccos, let’s get going!! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Haha. That's probably debatable -- not a political comment, just saying I prefer live sports to anything -- but I can see why the Pirates have been frustrating for fans, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>MoTownWV</strong>: Is it too late to get Clint Hurdle back? There appears to be no logic behind the late inning decisions on pinch hitters and pitching changes by Shelton. It's almost like Shelton is asking himself, "How can I screw this up" on the rare occasions where the Pirates have a chance late in games. Are you sure they aren't intentionally tanking? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They might be. I can't say they're not; however, the tank part comes with your roster and lack of moves. I don't think they -- or anyone -- would ever "throw" a game. They're just trying to compete with significantly less talent than their opponents. ... Also, re: Shelton's decision-making. Agree to a point. It has been underwhelming. I also cut him something of a pass given how little with which he's working.</p>
<p><strong>Neil</strong>: Good article today, Jason. You hit on most of my frustrations. Curious, what is management's reasons/logic for trotting out the same veterans game after game while the supposed top prospects and future continues to wallow on the bench or in Altoona? Does it have anything to do with Super 2 status or other financial/control concerns? How do you know if Ke'Bryan can even live up to the hype if he's never given the chance? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think Ke'Bryan is Super 2 and COVID stuff. But we're there. I think they're being a little too cautious right now, but I do see why they waited too long with him. The others? I have no blessed clue. Jason Martin and Jared Oliva should be up here. It's almost like they feel this loyalty to Jarrod Dyson because they signed him. And with Polanco's struggles, while I might still try to play him and help him work out of this, I couldn't argue with someone who said they should play Martin or Oliva over him. I just think you need to be cognizant of the end goal with Polanco, because you have to pay him.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates trade deadline</strong>: What could the pirates land for the following and what’s your percentage they get traded: Keone Kela, Rich Rod, Adam Frazier, Moran and holland <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Very little. Kela would be your best bet. Maybe a top-15 prospect. Maybe. Holland would be a small piece. Think Lyles last year; he netted Cody Ponce. Can't imagine Holland gets much more than that. Frazier, honestly, probably the same given his start. I might even hang on to him, hope he has a strong final month, then try to flip him in the offseason. I'd keep Rodriguez and Moran.</p>
<p><strong>Blake cederlind</strong>: When we chat next week will I be on the pirates roster <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I sure hope so, Blake. But I'm not terribly optimistic.</p>
<p><strong>Pirates 2021</strong>: Do you think the pirates could play .500 ball next year? They should have a decent rotation I think <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I thought they would flirt with .500 this year, so I may be the wrong person to ask.</p>
<p><strong>Josh bell</strong>: What all could the pirates land for Me and do you see him traded <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's TBD, JB. I don't see it happening now. I think they would like to see your value higher, and I think you would like to see your value higher. Also, while I don't think it ultimately will happen, I don't think they've completely punted on signing you to a long-term deal. So, just hang tight and work out of this slow start.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: I’m shocked the pirates are 4-15 without signing Puig. They would be 15-4 with him. Can’t believe they didn’t sign him <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Only years later will they realize the magnitude of their mistake, Ricky. Could seriously set the franchise back.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Hi Jason - can you share your perspective on how the players feel about playing for Derek Shelton? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Matt. I don't think they have an issue with him. Or, if they do, they're not saying it publicly. I would also offer the caveat that this stuff is tougher to get a feel for given we're not in the clubhouse every day. But from everything I've heard, they like him, like playing for him and feel like it's a combination of injuries and bad breaks that have sabotaged their season. They do have a point, to a degree.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: With fans not being allowed to attend thus making ticket sales irrelevant, wouldn’t this be the best time to trade a fan favorite like Josh Bell. Even tho he looks lost right now, he’s our biggest trade chip. Wouldn’t have to worry about much blowback from fans since right now they’re non existent. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If I'm the Pirates, Gabe, I care less about upsetting fans and more about getting the most back for him. I don't think you're doing that if you try to trade him now. Fans will get over it if the guys the Pirates get back are good. And if you don't think you can sign Bell long-term, then you do need to trade him. But it's about maximizing the return, and they need to have him put up some better numbers for that to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: What’s Erik Gonzalez’ contract situation? Will he be around for awhile? He’s not necessarily young at 29, but looks like a nice piece to keep around <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Believe he signed early in the arb process last year. This year would be his second crack at it ... and he could really be helping himself. The Pirates have him under control for two more years, so yeah, unless they can maybe flip him for something, I agree with you. Would not get rid of him unless I got an offer I liked.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: Let’s say for some odd reason the Padres were looking to trade Tatis Jr. Is there any combination of 4 players in the Pirates entire organization that the Padres would accept in a trade? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No. Plain and simple. No.</p>
<p><strong>Kenny</strong>: It feels like Ben Cherington is almost too nice to be successful here. This front office should have been gutted but all we hear is that isn’t his way. This whole front office needs to be overhauled and it sounds like Cherington isn’t that type. I don’t want any of NH’s guys here and running departments. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think "nice" is the right word, Kenny. I think Cherington is no different than a lot of people in his position. He's going to take some time to look around before he completely overhauls anything. I agree with you that I think he and baseball in general tends to be a little over-cautious. But I don't think it's because Ben feels bad or doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: If Polanco continues to be dreadful, do they simply have to keep playing him because of his contract? I assume he’s untradable because of his performance and contract. Is DFA a possibility? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You could DFA him, sure. But you still have to pay him, thus why I think it makes more sense to let him work out of this. I'd also like to believe there is something in there somewhere. It's a challenge for them right now to bring it out. I do think he's healthy. I also think he's looked like crap. Something needs to change. He didn't just suddenly forget how to play baseball.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Why would you think intentionally hitting someone is okay? That's childish and dangerous. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: In a baseball game? It happens all the time, John. I'm not advocating punching someone. You drill someone in the backside -- never high -- with a fastball to send a message. I'm hardly the first person to suggest this. Like pretty much every team, we had a specific sign for it in college. It's a part of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Rustin</strong>: What is your evaluation on Kevan Graves? I’m sure he’s very talented but anything that smells of Huntington I don’t want around this team <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think Kevan is extremely bright. I've enjoyed my conversations with him. He's also highly thought of around the game. "Smells of Huntington?" Ha. Made me laugh, but I think you're forgetting that Neal did some really good stuff here, too. I'm not saying it wasn't time, but he wasn't a total failure.</p>
<p><strong>Jps717</strong>: The old mamgaement group took tons of well deserved criticism for not developing talent. The new group is even worse so far. Regression everywhere. Shelton in particular seems clueless. I would give the group a D-. What grade wuhld you give? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I wouldn't disagree with that. It's been bad. Below expectations, across the board. But I think you're grading development before it takes time. I will evaluate this front office on how guys like Liover Peguero, Nick Gonzales, Quinn Priester and Brennan Malone develop. I'm not gonna crush 'em for development because they've played like crap for 19 games. They've simply played like crap for 19 games, and they don't have enough major league talent right now.</p>
<p><strong>Billy Beane</strong>: If my owners spent like Bob Nutting that would be a dream! In the meantime make sure you watch us and the Rays in the playoffs. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Billy. Appreciate you swinging by my chat.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck</strong>: Starling Marte is among the league leaders in batting average. This caused me to wonder why ex-Pirates players do better after they are traded than they did in Pittsburgh. Marte, Cole, Meadows and Glasnow are examples. Can you explain why? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Well, Marte did have a career year here last year, but your point is a good one, Chuck. And I'm not sure it's one set thing. Pitchers have been coached differently. Maybe the Pirates screwed up development. Maybe guys are just happy to get out of here. Maybe there's more protection. It's a whole bunch of stuff, but it's definitely concerning. I also think there are worse examples than Marte.</p>
<p><strong>Bucs</strong>: do you except Cruz up next year <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I expect and hope for him to get a taste this year. Probably only at short and maybe just to DH. But with no minor leagues and the major league team stinking, I don't see why you wouldn't give him a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Neal Huntington</strong>: Hows all my lieutenants doing with the new front office? Love that my legacy will live on <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They're good, Neal. Hope you're enjoying the time off.</p>
<p><strong>Samuel</strong>: It has nothing to with Nutting's personal worth; it's the market. He's not running the team out of his pocket. If revenue isn't there, expenses can't match. Also, revenue sharing systems are extremely different in NHL and NFL, which is why it's easier for Penguins and Steelers. Didn't the Penguins just come out and say something about their revenue at the moment? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know. I didn't see if the Penguins did or did not. Thanks for the contribution.</p>
<p><strong>Neil H</strong>: Did I leave this organization with the least talent in all of MLB? I mean they have basically nothing to build around at this point. Seems like stealing when I see that direct deposit hit my bank account each month. I truly am blessed. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Why is there so much Neal Huntington focus this week? Weird.</p>
<p><strong>Neil H</strong>: And I cannot even spell my name correctly at this point. I have been listening to a lot of Neil Young lately.... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You could do worse, Neil/Neal/Kneel.</p>
<p><strong>Stephen</strong>: I agree with James and you about Roberto Clemente. The museum is great, but I think it needs to be moved to a location with more space and much more parking. I hope that those that run the museum are looking into re-locating. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't know. I love that part of the city. I think that's part of its charm. But if they did wanna move it and make it bigger, I definitely wouldn't complain. Love hearing about Clemente's legacy.</p>
<p><strong>Seven</strong>: Watching Oliver Perez last night and being able to trace him through trades all the way back to Ricardo Rincon in ‘97 blows my mind. No question here, just find it remarkable he’s still around <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Seriously. I looked it up last night. I thought I was gonna see that he's like 49 years old. He's "only" 39.</p>
<p><strong>Neal H</strong>: I probably should have taken that Giants job a few years back, yes? Funny how quickly a man’ s reputation can go south. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You'll get another job in baseball and be just fine, Neal. As bad as the Pirates gig ended, I think there's enough there turning the whole thing around that someone else will pay you to make decisions. As they should.</p>
<p><strong>The Eman</strong>: Who was your favorite Grateful Dead keyboard player (I gotta go with Pig)? Any current Pirate who could have been a true deadhead? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Musgrove and Brault have good musical taste. Holland is goofy and might work. Other than that, probably not much. ... I'll go Pig, too, although not by much. The good Brent stuff is really good.</p>
<p><strong>Frazier A</strong>: What the heck happened to my bat? Need I remind you that I was at one time a decent hitter? So much for being a tradable asset.... <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's been there in spurts. Needs to be more consistent, though. Especially if the Pirates are going to move you.</p>
<p><strong>wvpirate</strong>: I noticed in the box score from last night Andrew McCutchen was pitch hit for. And he had 2 hits in the game. Yet Polonco was not pitch hit for. Bad managing. So Philly has spent alot on their team. Exciting players that includes Cutch and Neil Walker. Feels like Pittsburgh is in the poor side of the state. Does Nutting see what kind of reputation this is doing to the Pirates? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Nutting "seeing" what his handling of the franchise isn't the relevant point here. He's well-aware of how he and the Pirates are perceived. There are also limitations, as I mentioned and Samuel added to in a comment. ... But the point here, to both of you and everyone reading is this: If, say, Burkle and Mario would buy the Pirates. Just go there for a second with me. Burkle is stupid rich. We wouldn't hear about small-market challenges anymore, I can guarantee, too. Do you ever hear about them with the Penguins? No. Because he says win, bankrolls it, then goes about his business. That's not how Nutting operates. We can sit here and debate whether that's a bad thing, whether it's impossible to win or whether baseball's financial landscape screws Nutting. I can make some fair points on both sides. But believe me, it's not as though Nutting is unaware that his stewardship of the Pirates of late hasn't been loaded with popularity.</p>
<p><strong>MoTownWV</strong>: What signs can you point to that indicate anything has changed within the Pirates organization? The names have changed but on the surface it looks like more of the same from roster management to player acquisition to development and potentially there has actually been regression amount the limited young core of the MLB roster. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Fair point. I would like to know from Nutting or Travis Williams what tangible progress they feel had been made here. Unfortunately those interview requests were no for Nutting and TBD for Williams, who won't talk baseball anyway. But we heard so much about the "four pillars," "cracking the code" and being more transparent about things with our fans ... well? ... And no, I don't see much that things are different. I trust that Ben Cherington has revamped some stuff behind the scenes -- he never says much when it comes to describing it -- but on-field-wise, I haven't seen much that would lead me to believe they've made progress.</p>
<p><strong>Seven</strong>: Saw Keibert Ruiz homered in his debut. I know the dodgers made May and Lux untouchable Last season, but was Ruiz available had Huntington pulled the trigger on Felipe? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It's my understanding that the Dodgers were not willing to part with any of the three, hence why I didn't -- and still don't -- have an issue with Huntington keeping Felipe Vazquez.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: Jason I read your article about if the Pirates have taken any steps in their developing. Of course the answer is NOOOOOO. We were supposed to see marked improvement in basic fundamentals at the very least and imo they've been worse than in the Hurdle era. And the base running and hitting has been abysmal too. Shelton looks to be in way over his head and same with the coaching staff. They've all been awful. Thoughts? As a fan it's hard to see anything positive in this season so far. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You basically said it. And I've typed it a bunch of times here. No progress has been made. I don't see what we're building toward here. It's almost like we're more concerned about placating the present. But again, if you're looking for meaningful steps forward, is there anything you can really hang your hat on right now?</p>
<p><strong>Curt</strong>: Jason please tell me that the Gregory Polanco era will be mercifully over after this season. He has been horrid and I can't watch him anymore. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I can't make that promise, Curt. They're in a tough spot with him. I think the best thing they can do, honestly, is try to figure him out.</p>
<p><strong>Seven</strong>: To Chuck’s point about players leaving and having success. To be fair the opposite has happened. Pedro, JHay, Walker, Cutch have all regressed since leaving. As well as AJ’s one year stint in Philly. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: True, true. Still, I don't blame fans for being made about Glasnow and Meadows becoming something else, how Gerrit Cole went from being good to absurd, the soon-to-come Shane Baz experience, that sort of thing.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: Intentional physical harm, part of the game? Intent to injure? Jeopardize someone's career? I don't know why we let baseball get away with this because it's "part of the game". Doesn't anyone realize how dangerous this is? Don't players care? I can't imagine condoning it; we don't in day-to-day life, but hey, it's baseball. Maybe I'll kill you with a 95 mph fastball, but don't you dare steal my signs. It's ridiculous, plain and simple. Nothing else explains it away. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You're free to feel however you want, John. But that way of playing baseball has been around nearly as long as the game itself.</p>
<p><strong>BillC</strong>: Any chance Shelton is fired after this year? Or is the sample size of this season too small to make an evaluation? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: None. The sample size is too small. He's ill-equipped with talent. And I also really can't see the Pirates paying two men not to manage.</p>
<p><strong>Baby</strong>: Saw something on Kumar Rocker up above. Really hoping the pirates are able to draft him. If the pirates do get Rocker, what would be a fair estimate for him to get to MLB based on his substantial talent yet young age? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Nobody puts Baby in a corner, but I don't know, couple years? Tough to say having never seen him pitch and him having never pitched in pro ball, but he's also absurdly good. I'd think probably inside of three years would be a starting point. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. Looks like that will do it for this week. Thanks so much for participating. Until next Wednesday ...</p>
