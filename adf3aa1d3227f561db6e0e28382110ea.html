<p>Dr. Anantha Shekhar now works for IU's medical school in Indianapolis, the nation's largest, where holds various leadership roles. He is due to begin his duties in June, subject to a vote by Pitt’s board of trustees.</p>
<p>The trustees’&nbsp;vote, expected at their winter meeting in February, is the last step in the hiring process and it would make Dr. Shekhar an officer of the university, officials announced.</p>

<p>“This is a critical hire for the University of Pittsburgh,” said Chancellor Patrick Gallagher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Anantha’s capacity to envision solutions, galvanize partnerships and produce results is second to none, and his record of propelling both people and institutions to success is unparalleled. I could not be more excited to welcome Anantha into our community, and I am already looking forward to his arrival in June,” he added.</p>
<p>Born in India, Dr. Shekhar holds a medical degree from St. John’s Medical College and PhD in neuroscience at IU, Pitt officials said. He and his wife, Dr. Gina Laite, have two children.</p>
<p>Once he arrives, he will oversee all six health sciences schools at Pitt, more than 6,000 faculty and staff within them, and be dean of the John and Gertrude Petersen Dean of the School of Medicine at Pitt. He also will work with the university's medical partner, UPMC.</p>
<p>Pitt Provost Ann Cudd said: “Anantha’s exceptional and deep experience in basic research leading to novel, patentable therapeutics and in directing large, multi-institutional research initiatives, as well as being an award-winning teacher, will provide transformative contributions to our efforts going forward.”</p>
<p>"I am honored and inspired to be joining one of the most respected medical and research communities in the world, Dr. Shekhar said in a statement that accompanied the announcement.</p>
<p>“Building on the University of Pittsburgh’s exceptional record of health sciences education, innovation, clinical excellence and research preeminence is my top priority, and I look forward to advancing this goal in partnership with UPMC — for the greater good of society — in the months to come.” he added.</p>
<p>Pitt officials said Dr. Shekhar has been recipient of continuous funding from the National Institutes of Health since 1989 for basic, clinical and translational research. He has written 200-plus articles in peer-reviewed publications.</p>
