<h1>Brashear freshman Ta'Mere Robinson has major-college football scholarship offers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ta’Mere Robinson is a mere freshman at Brashear High School in the Pittsburgh City League, a 15-year-old who wasn’t even on the football team at the start of last season. Now he is a hot prospect who was offered scholarships to five major-college programs in less than 24 hours last week.</p>
<p>Meet the new poster child for Strange But True Recruiting Stories.</p>
<p>“For a freshman, this is crazy,” Robinson acknowledged.</p>
<p>Robinson’s football story started in the classroom. It was early September of last year, school was in session and Brashear already had played two football games.&nbsp;Aaron Guillard, a security guard who also happened to be a Brashear assistant football coach, came into&nbsp;a classroom looking for a certain ninth-grader.&nbsp;Guillard heard that Robinson used to play football and Brashear’s team was looking for help.</p>
<p>Guillard couldn’t help but notice the 6-foot-3, 193-pound Robinson around the school halls, but Robinson had already made up his mind that basketball would be his future sport, even though he played football in midget leagues through eighth grade. Guillard had a brief conversation with Robinson on that September day.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘I heard you used to be a good football player, so why don’t you want to play football any more?’ ” Robinson said. “He gave me a form for me to get a physical.”</p>
<p>Robinson bit on the offer. He got the required physical and started practicing Sept. 9.</p>
<p>“It was probably 10 minutes of practice that we saw him when the coaching staff looked at each other and said, ‘Holy heck,’ ” Brashear coach Don Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Four days later after that first practice, after two possessions in a game against Grove City, Robinson was inserted at safety. He got an interception just before halftime. A star was born.</p>
<p>About seven months later, Robinson was on the phone with Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi and Pitt offered a scholarship. That was about 2 p.m. last Thursday. A few hours later, Robinson had an offer from Syracuse. West Virginia offered a scholarship at night and Penn State followed with an offer from coach James Franklin. On Friday morning, Michigan offered a scholarship.</p>
<p>Now will someone please pinch Ta’Mere Robinson, just so he knows this is all for real.</p>
<p>“I remember people telling me, ‘Don’t play football in the City League because the City is not going to get you anywhere,’” said Robinson, a Mount Oliver resident who played years of midget-league football for the Homewood Bulldawgs. “It just feels good to have these offers, especially at the end of ninth grade and being in the City. But I never could’ve thought this would happen.”</p>
<p>No City League football player has ever gotten this many offers from major colleges as a freshman. But Robinson’s story shows three things: how early colleges start recruiting some players nowadays; there is still talent in the City League — just not anywhere near as much as decades ago; and if you’re big, athletic and talented, colleges will find you no matter where you play.</p>
<p>Robinson is one of two freshmen in Western Pennsylvania with offers from Pitt, Penn State, West Virginia and Michigan. The other is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/04/16/Rodney-Gallagher-Pitt-Penn-State-football-scholarships-recruiting/stories/202004160158" target="_blank">Laurel Highlands receiver-defensive back Rodney Gallagher</a>.</p>
<p>“Some of the offers (for Robinson), I think might have been just because Pitt and Penn State offered, and others followed,” Schmidt said. “But Pitt and Penn State have been interested in him for a while.”</p>
<p>Robinson showed plenty of promise at Brashear last season, and it didn’t matter to some colleges that he played for a 1-7 team that was outscored, 126-37, in the five games that Robinson played. Robinson’s highlight tape was impressive, and he sent it to some colleges. He also had DeWayne Brown talking to college coaches for him. Brown runs the 2/10ths speed and agility training at UPMC Rooney Sports Complex on the South Side and trains Robinson. Brown also trains numerous high school players, as well as some top college players and NFL star Aaron Donald.</p>
<p>“DeWayne Brown told me Pitt and Penn State were really interested,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>How could major colleges not like a 6-3, 190-pound freshman with supreme athleticism (he averaged 10 points for Brashear’s basketball team)? Robinson also is a good student (3.38 grade-point average so far), something he talks proudly about.</p>
<p>“You see his (football) highlight tape and schools noticed how he breaks on the ball so well, how he plays angles,” Schmidt said.</p>
<p>Robinson had three interceptions in five football games. He did not play offense. Both Narduzzi and Franklin came to Brashear in January, and although college coaches weren’t permitted to talk to Robinson (NCAA rules), they asked Schmidt if they could see Robinson in person. Schmidt remembers taking Narduzzi to the cafeteria one day while Robinson was eating.</p>
<p>“Narduzzi saw him and said, ‘Dear God, he’s as big as a man and he’s only in ninth grade,’ ” Schmidt said. “I think with his size now, he’ll probably be a linebacker by the time he’s a senior.”</p>
<p>And he’ll probably have many more scholarship offers by then.</p>
<p>“If I had to make a choice on a college, I wouldn’t be able to right now,” Robinson said.</p>
<p>No worries. Freshmen have plenty of time to think.</p>
