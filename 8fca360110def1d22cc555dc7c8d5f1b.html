<h1>Man acquitted in Wilkinsburg massacre appears in federal court by video on new charge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The man acquitted <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">earlier this year in the killings of five people at a Wilkinsburg cookout</a> appeared by video before a federal judge on Thursday on a weapons charge and is set for a U.S. detention hearing next week.</p>
<p>Cheron Shelton is under indictment on a count of illegally possessing a gun and ammunition as a felon and is in U.S. custody.</p>
<p>A federal grand jury handed up the charge on Feb. 25, about a week after an Allegheny County Common Pleas jury acquitted him in the 2016 mass shooting that left five dead and three injured.</p>
<p>Shelton, 33, had an initial appearance by video conference before U.S. Magistrate Judge Cynthia Reed Eddy, who appointed a lawyer and set a detention hearing for Monday.</p>
<p>That hearing will also be held by video conference because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Shelton is accused of possession of a .22-caliber rifle and ammunition for it. As a felon, he can't have either. During the investigation of the March 9, 2016 mass killing, police searched Shelton's mother's house in Homewood and said they found the gun and bullets.</p>
<p>The weapon is not the gun used in the killings, which was an assault rifle.</p>
<p>If Shelton is convicted on the new charge, he is likely to get at least five years in federal prison.</p>
