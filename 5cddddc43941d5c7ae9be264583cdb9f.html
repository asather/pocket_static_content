<h1>Analysis: Steelers corners playing a big role in defensive improvement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It wasn’t all that long ago that opposing quarterbacks licked their chops in anticipation of facing the Steelers. They were among the worst teams in the NFL when it came to defending the pass in 2015, 29th among the league’s 32 teams and yielding a whopping 272 yards per game.</p>
<p>It took four years of steady improvement, but quarterbacks are now licking their wounds after playing the Steelers, who now rank among the best teams in the league against the pass.</p>
<p>The Steelers allowed just 194 passing yards per game in 2019, third in the league behind only New England and San Francisco.</p>
<p>The Steelers can thank their cornerbacks for much of that marked improvement. Joe Haden returned to Pro Bowl form; Steven Nelson emerged as a shutdown corner after being acquired through free agency; and Mike Hilton excelled in the slot.</p>
<p>The quarterback passer rating against the Steelers was just 79.7 and ranked third in the league. In 2018, they were 21st in the league with a 95.2 passer rating against.</p>
<p>General manager Kevin Colbert knew he had to do something to upgrade his secondary, so he signed Nelson to the richest outside free agent contract in team history. And Nelson delivered with a lockdown season opposite Haden.</p>
<p>Nelson was one of the most targeted corners in the league in 2018, his final season in Kansas City. In his first season with the Steelers, Nelson did not allow a touchdown catch. And by season’s end, it was obvious quarterbacks simply weren’t throwing his way very often.</p>
<p>Haden, meanwhile, rewarded the Steelers for investing in him for another three years. Fresh off an August contract extension, Haden had five interceptions, his most since his rookie season in 2010. Those ball-hawk qualities earned him a trip to the Pro Bowl, his third such honor and his first since the 2014 season.</p>
<p>The Steelers have Nelson and Haden locked up through the 2021 season. Hilton, whose solid work in the slot helped to elevate the secondary, was given a second-round tender by the Steelers, a strong sign they value what the restricted free agent brings to the defense.</p>
<p>Hilton, who came to the Steelers as a free agent in 2016, has been effective in a number of roles over the years. He’s a sure tackler in the run game, effective as a blitzer and has improved in coverage.</p>
<p>Cameron Sutton, a third-round pick in 2017, has not been able to supplant Hilton as the team’s top reserve corner, but he could see his role in the defense grow this season. He will compete to be the top backup at outside corner, and with the Steelers releasing linebacker Mark Barron, Sutton’s versatility will be key.</p>
<p>Sutton can play outside corner, slot corner and safety. He even played some dime linebacker in 2018 when the Steelers were dealing with some injuries.</p>
<p>Another player whose role should grow is Justin Layne, a third-round pick out of Michigan State last year. Layne played in 10 games as a rookie, but only saw snaps special teams.</p>
<p>With Sutton entering the final year of his contract the Steelers need to see some improvement if they’re going to get comfortable with him being in the mix at outside corner.</p>
<p>Like a lot of other positions on the team the Steelers are strong with their starters but a little short on depth. But that’s to be expected with the number of big contracts the Steelers have on the books. This group will be strong if Haden and Nelson can stay healthy. If not, those depth issues will surface and could put some stress on the defense.</p>
