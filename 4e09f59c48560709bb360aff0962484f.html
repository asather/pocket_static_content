<h1>Pirates' Geoff Hartlieb, Nick Burdi earn career firsts in win vs. Brewers</h1>

<p>For the second consecutive win, the Pirates got to celebrate some firsts.</p>
<p>On Sunday, when they toppled the St. Louis Cardinals, the celebration surrounded manager Derek Shelton’s first win as a manager. Shelton said afterward that he received a beer shower from the team.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, in beating the Milwaukee Brewers, 8-6, it was right-handed reliever Geoff Hartlieb’s first win in the majors and right-hander Nick Burdi’s first save. So it was their turn to receive the beer shower.</p>
<p>“It’s just some ‘silver bullets’ and [some] baby powder and some Irish Spring all sprinkled on you,” Burdi said. “It’s not that fun, but you get through it.”</p>
<p>The celebration itself may be messy and strange, but Hartlieb and Burdi likely aren’t trading it away any time soon.</p>
<p>Both have taken the long way to get to this point.</p>
<p>Hartlieb, a former 29th-round draft pick of the Pirates, had foot surgery last offseason and battled his way back to full health. Even Tuesday was likely a lot more eventful than he or anybody else had planned. He arrived Tuesday in Pittsburgh, traveling in from the Pirates’ alternate training site in Altoona, along with left-hander Miguel Del Pozo, to replace relievers Clay Holmes and Kyle Crick, who were placed on the 10-day injured list.</p>
<p>Then, when reliever Chris Stratton ran into trouble in the seventh inning, Del Pozo was the one called upon to save the day, but he had a bad night, walking in a run and allowing a two-run double, before intentionally walking another batter to load the bases. Then Hartlieb came in.</p>
<p>That is an unenviable way to make a season debut. Hartlieb induced a fly ball from Brewers second baseman Keston Hiura, which scored a run, but also resulted in a double play when center fielder Guillermo Heredia threw out Orlando Arcia at third base. Hartlieb struck out outfielder Christian Yelich to end the inning, then pitched a scoreless eighth.</p>
<p>A two-run bomb from Adam Frazier in the bottom of the eighth set Hartlieb up for the win.</p>
<p>“He’s looked good all spring, in these intrasquads,” Frazier said of Hartlieb. “I know he just got sent out, so him coming in ready to play as soon as he got back, it says a lot for his mental toughness. He came out and attacked the strike zone tonight and gave us a chance. Pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>Added Shelton:&nbsp;“Not the easiest situation when you drive over in a car today and you get put in the heart of that game and you go back out in the eighth and do what he did. First big league win. I mean, I experienced that a couple days ago. It’s a cool experience. It’s fun to be able to congratulate a guy on his first big league win.”</p>
<p>Burdi’s journey to this point is just as rocky. After undergoing three different surgeries, the latest of which set him out for almost all of last season, he has finally returned with a clean bill of health.</p>
<p>On Sunday, he pitched the ninth inning to beat the Cardinals, but it wasn’t a save situation. Tuesday’s was, after Frazier’s homer.</p>
<p>Burdi allowed a walk to catcher Omar Narvaez to start the ninth but bounced back quickly, striking out outfielder Ben Gamel swinging on a fastball and getting a double a play off the bat of outfielder Lorenzo Cain to end the game and earn the save.</p>
<p>“I honestly didn’t know it was his first time getting the save until tonight after the game, so we’re all fired up about that for him,” Frazier said. “The guy’s been through a ton. He just keeps fighting, keeps fighting, takes care of himself, prepares day-in day-out like no other. We’re happy for him. We’re happy he’s on our side. He’s somebody you feel pretty confident in, when he comes into the game at the end, that we’re getting this thing done.”</p>
<p>In what will be a grind of a season, even if it is shorter, it’s these moments for players like Hartlieb and Burdi that may end up being the most memorable. After all, they each took circuitous paths to make these things possible at all.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For Burdi, it’s hard to discuss how he felt about the moment without reflecting on just how hard it was to make it there.</p>
<p>“Being able to win tonight and then get the save, it was exciting,” Burdi said. “The whole beer shower thing. But this is one of those moments where, you know, it’s been six years in the making. Three surgeries later, finally got the first one.”</p>
