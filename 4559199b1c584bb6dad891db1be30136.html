<h1>Paul Zeise: Notre Dame in the ACC is mutually beneficial </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The moans among some ACC fans came almost immediately after the ACC announced Notre Dame would have a chance to win the conference championship game. They were predictable and they were shrouded in a lot of the same Notre Dame envy that has existed since the Irish started playing football.</p>
<p>“Make them join the conference all the way or get out!”</p>
<p>“Why should the ACC rescue that?”</p>
<p>“This isn’t fair to the other teams in the conference!”</p>
<p>And my personal favorite: “The ACC doesn’t need Notre Dame!”</p>
<p>Please stop embarrassing yourselves. The ACC benefits from being affiliated with Notre Dame as much as Notre Dame benefits from being affiliated with the ACC. And the same can be said about the Big East before them.</p>
<p>There is absolutely no downside for the ACC to be affiliated with Notre Dame. The benefits far outweigh the inconvenience of surrendering a bowl spot here and there. Notre Dame is a national brand that brings instant credibility.</p>
<p>I’ve heard for years that Notre Dame needs to join a conference. The line goes that the Irish have an unfair advantage and that they shouldn’t be able to be and independent and have their own network. They should have to play in a conference like everyone else and share their money from NBC like everyone else.</p>
<p>Why don’t they do that? Because they don’t have to. They are a national brand with fans all over the world, so it is far more lucrative for them to go at it alone.</p>
<p>They are the only brand that could pull that off. I know Texas has attempted with its own network, but that’s contained in one state. People who live all over the world get NBC and can watch Notre Dame games. It is unique as a college football brand, and as long as it can make money and remain competitive for the national playoffs, there is no reason for Notre Dame to join a conference.</p>
<p>And that brings me to the ACC which — give John Swofford credit — scooped Notre Dame after the Big East football conference blew up. Swofford did the right thing in negotiating a deal so that Notre Dame has to play five games against ACC teams every year and rotate so every team has a chance to play them every three or four years.</p>
<p>Those five games alone are worth whatever anyone thinks the affiliation is doing to hurt the ACC. Clemson sells its games out, so it doesn’t really matter to them, but ask the rest of the league what a home game against Notre Dame is worth. And ask them all what a road game at Notre Dame and playing on national TV is worth.</p>
<p>It is worth it even if it means a team might get bumped down in the bowl pecking order a little bit. A lot of ACC schools would struggle to get Notre Dame on their schedule without the help of the conference.</p>
<p>As for Notre Dame, the cost of playing five games a year is well worth it because the ACC is a great landing spot for the rest of the Irish teams. It is a conference that is easy to recruit in and, academically, the ACC aligns well with Notre Dame’s started mission in athletics.</p>
<p>I know Irish fans can be arrogant and act as if they are still an elite football powerhouse. It has to hurt them when we all happily remind them that the last time they won a national title, Lou Holtz was the head coach and was still a relatively young man.</p>
<p>They don’t win as much as they used to,&nbsp; but the football program is still an elite brand. People still want to watch and root against Notre Dame, and athletic directors still like to get Notre Dame on their schedule.</p>
<p>The bellyaching about the ACC adding Notre Dame to their conference standings and making them eligible for the championship game is fun, but it is also misguided.</p>
<p>The ACC doesn’t need Notre Dame to succeed, but it sure benefits from being affiliated with the Irish. Swofford understood this and so does every athletic director and school president in the conference, and that’s why the marriage between the two isn’t likely to end any time soon.</p>
