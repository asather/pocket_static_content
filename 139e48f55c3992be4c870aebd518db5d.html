<h1>Lawsuit challenges constitutionality of life without parole sentences for second-degree murder</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Six people serving life without parole sentences in Pennsylvania prisons for felony — or second-degree — murder filed a lawsuit Wednesday morning against the state Board of Probation and Parole asking that their punishment be declared unconstitutional.</p>
<p>The complaint, filed in the Commonwealth Court, alleges that such a penalty violates the prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment as provided by both the Pennsylvania and U.S. constitutions.</p>
<p>While there are approximately 5,200 people serving life without parole in Pennsylvania, the lawsuit could potentially impact about 1,100 of those who did not actually kill the victim in their case or who did not intend for the victim to die, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The life without parole sentencing scheme, the lawsuit said, “operates to deny these individuals the chance to seek redemption, by being allowed to return home and give back to their communities and families for the past harms they committed, and forces them all to live under the nightmarish specter of dying in prison no matter what they do, no matter decades of exemplary conduct, and without any individualized determination as to whether this harshest of sentences is warranted, or whether the remainder of their sentence can be served under conditions of parole.”</p>
<p>Further, the complaint said, the penalty of life without parole disproportionately impacts minority communities.</p>
<p>Of the 1,100 people in prison for felony murder, the lawsuit said, nearly 70% are Black.</p>
<p>“In the midst of a global pandemic and the eruption of a renewed and massive national movement for racial justice, now is the time for serious and urgent consideration of plaintiffs’ claim,” the lawsuit said. “Rooted in sacrosanct, cross-cultural values of redemption and liberation, plaintiffs request the right to parole eligibility so that they may be assessed as the individuals they are, possessed of dignity and humanity, and may have an opportunity to live outside of prison walls again.”</p>
<p>The plaintiffs seek to have the court declare Pennsylvania’s law prohibiting parole for life sentences for second-degree murder unconstitutional; to order the state parole board to develop a plan to review the cases, including the minimum number of years that must be served before parole consideration; and that the board review each individual plaintiff’s case for possible parole.</p>
<p>Of the six named plaintiffs, they have served anywhere from 23 to 47 years in prison, have been largely misconduct free during their incarceration and have successfully completed many programs and educational courses. They hold jobs in their prisons and serve as mentors to other inmates.</p>
<p>The lead plaintiff, Marie Scott, is 67 years old and has been imprisoned for 47 years. According to the complaint, Scott survived repeated childhood sexual and physical abuse, began using alcohol at age 9 and marijuana at 14. She started using heroin at 16.</p>
<p>Scott was arrested at age 19 after participating as a lookout in a gas station robbery in Philadelphia County. Her co-defendant, a 16-year-old boy, killed the attendant, Michael Kerrigan.</p>
<p>“She did not commit or intend Mr. Kerrigan’s killing, and had no warning or knowledge of her co-defendant’s plan to kill Mr. Kerrigan,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>Scott’s co-defendant, Leroy Saxton, was convicted of first-degree murder and ordered to serve life in prison. However, because he was a juvenile at the time of his crime, under the U.S. Supreme Court decision Miller v. Alabama, which found that life without parole for juveniles was unconstitutional, Saxton was entitled to a new sentencing hearing.</p>
<p>In 2017, Saxton was resentenced to a prison term of 43 years to life. He has since been paroled.</p>
<p>Under Miller, a requirement of the resentencing process is completing an individualized assessment of the defendant. The lawsuit alleges that Pennsylvania law requires individualized sentences for everything except sentences of life without parole — including where the death penalty is in play.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The lawsuit, which refers to life without parole as “death by incarceration,” alleges that the punishment for second-degree murder does not serve any legitimate penological or public safety interest.</p>
<p>The complaint cites research that found that as prisoners age, they are less likely to commit new crimes, and therefore pose minimal risk to the community.</p>
<p>The average age of a person serving life without parole in Pennsylvania is 48, the complaint said, and the average age of that person at the time their crimes were committed was 25.</p>
<p>“Their relative youth at the time of their crime of conviction, the years they have already served, and their aging or elderly condition today — which there is ample evidence to show correlates to low recidivism — mean that hundreds upon hundreds could be released without risk to public safety, and could go on to provide social, economic and emotional benefits to their communities and families,” the lawsuit said.</p>
<p>The other plaintiffs in the case include:</p>
<p>• Reid Evans, 58, and his brother, Wyatt Evans, 57. The two have been incarcerated for 37 years after their conviction in Philadelphia County for an armed robbery in which the victim died hours later of a heart attack.</p>
<p>• Marsha Scaggs, 56, who has been in prison for 32 years after her conviction in Lawrence County. Her co-defendant shot and killed a man they suspected of being a police informant on a drug deal.</p>
<p>• Normita Jackson, 43, who has been in prison for 23 years after her conviction in Allegheny County. She invited a man into her home for her co-defendant to rob him, and instead he shot and killed the victim.</p>
<p>• Tyreem Rivers, 42, who has been in prison for 23 years after his conviction in Philadelphia County. He robbed an elderly woman by grabbing her purse, and she fell as a result. She was hospitalized and died two weeks later from pneumonia.</p>
