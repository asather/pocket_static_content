<h1>Fighting cancer: Screenings for the disease can save lives</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cancer deaths are falling. That’s the good news.</p>
<p>The bad news is that people continue to die from preventable or treatable cancers. Early detection vastly improves the chances that cancer can be effectively treated. Healthy living helps, too.</p>
<p>Get the colonoscopy. Get the mammogram. Get regularly tested for prostate cancer if you are a man or cervical cancer if you are a woman. Don’t put the tests off another year.</p>
<p>Learn how to check for signs of testicular or breast cancer at home.</p>
<p>Those simple steps save lives.</p>
<p>Some of the tests may not be comfortable. The tests are well worth any temporary discomfort.</p>
<p>Finding cancer early on can mean treatments — whether surgery, radiation, chemotherapy or immunotherapy — may not have to be as lengthy or intrusive.</p>
<p>Losing weight along with quitting the use of tobacco products can also reduce a person’s risk of developing cancer.</p>
<p>The cancer death rate recorded its largest single-year drop in 2017, falling 2.2%, according to the American Cancer Society. Lung cancer deaths declined sharply, largely because so many people have quit smoking. Of course, advances in medicine also helped cut the cancer death rate.</p>
<p>That’s no reason for complacency.</p>
<p>Progress on cutting cancer deaths hasn’t been as strong against colorectal, breast and prostate cancer — all cancers that can be discovered early by screening.</p>
<p>Cancer remains a killer, with the cancer society predicting 1.8 million new cancer cases this year and more than 600,000 deaths.</p>
<p>Obesity is a risk factor for esophageal, breast, colorectal cancers and others. And Americans are getting more obese.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, more than 30 percent of adults are obese. In Ohio, it’s 34% of adults.</p>
<p>Like self-exams and regular testing at the doctor’s office, individuals can protect themselves by regular exercise and making an effort to eat healthier.</p>
<p>Exams, testing and working towards a healthy lifestyle can bring more good news in the battle against cancer.</p>
