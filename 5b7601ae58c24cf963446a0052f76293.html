<h1>New Penn State D-line coach excited to work with promising prospects</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Imagine taking a job that requires you to move from Columbia, S.C., to State College. It’s hard enough to coordinate a significant move during regular times.</p>
<p>But new defensive line coach John Scott Jr., just so happened to join the Penn State staff about a month before the campus shut down because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It’s been different than taking over at any other job that I’ve ever had in my life,” Scott said Thursday. “Normally, you get that time to bond with the guys and you’re there, you’ve been through spring ball. But, with what’s going on in the world right now, I had to adapt a little bit.”</p>
<p>Scott joins James Franklin’s Nittany Lions staff after one year coaching the South Carolina defensive line, but he comes with a wealth of experience after spending time at Arkansas, Texas Tech, Georgia Southern, and Louisiana-Lafayette and the NFL’s New York Jets. He replaces Sean Spencer, who left Penn State for the New York Giants in January.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the spring sessions were canceled, Scott did get to coach his new players in winter practice, which helped. The negative: There were not any padded sessions like there would be in spring.</p>
<p>“You’re just adapting to what we have and it is different compared to how it normally is,” Scott said. “ Now you have to trust all the things you see on tape. But the transition is going well in State College and I couldn’t be more pleased, considering the circumstances, where we are right now.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Scott is getting to know his players as best he can.</p>
<p>A lot of the athletes have returned to their home towns since the campus is closed, but it’s a lot harder to go home when you’re from Germany, like Joseph Darkwa. The 6-foot-5, 287-pound defensive tackle is in State College as opposed to making the long journey back home.</p>
<p>“Joseph Darkwa is a great young man and getting to know him has been fun,” Scott said. “He’s here, so we’re able to make sure he’s OK not being able to go back home. But I’ve really enjoyed getting to know him. He’s a personable young man. He cares about his family. He cares about getting a great education and he cares about football a lot. He’s a very conscientious kid with a good heart.”</p>
<p>Darkwa redshirted last season and is fourth on the depth chart at tackle, but Scott believes that Darkwa is steadily rising up the rankings.</p>
<p>“Watching him in the workouts and having an opportunity for the little individual (drills) that we get during the workouts, it’s been good,” Scott said of Darkwa’s performance before practices ended. “I think Joseph is a strong, powerful young man.</p>
<p>“He runs well. He does a really good job of being physical and striking. I see him as having a high ceiling and I think he’s going to be a physical guy that could be a dominant run stopper inside. He’s got good feet. He’s got good quickness for a guy his size, and he’s gonna be a strong kid and he’s not going to let anybody outwork him.”</p>
<p>PJ Mustipher and Antonio Shelton, the starting defensive tackles on&nbsp;the depth chart released after the virtual spring game,&nbsp;are also returning with increased expectations. The impending competition is music to Scott’s ears.</p>
<p>“Watching our tackles, one of the first things that I did when I took this job. I always like to look at game tape to see what kind of players you got inside,” Scott said. “Those are two guys that have been down through it. I still think their best football’s ahead. They do a lot of things well. I think we got a chance with those two to be good inside, stout guys versus the run and they know how to adjust and rush the passer.”</p>
<p>Scott also had praise for defensive end Shaka Toney, a Philadelphia native who was named All-Big Ten second team by the coaches in the conference after racking up 6.5 sacks this past season. Scott mentioned Toney’s leadership as being essential to the program.</p>
<p>“I was impressed at how good of a teammate Shaka Toney is, how connected he is with the guys,” Scott said. “Whenever you walk in that room, it’s like, all the guys look up to Shaka because of the way he plays, he cares deeply about his teammates.</p>
<p>“His teammates look up to him. He can have an unbelievable presence in the meeting room because his teammates believe in him.”</p>
