<h1>Flush and boil water advisory in effect in Polish Hill</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A precautionary flush and boil water advisory is in effect Thursday evening in Pittsburghâ€™s Polish Hill neighborhood due to a water main break.</p>
<p>The advisory affects around 400 households in the area between West Penn Park and the Bloomfield Bridge and will continue until further notice, according to the <a href="https://www.pgh2o.com/boilwater" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority</a>.</p>
<p>A water buffalo for those affected will be placed at the West Penn Recreation Center on 30th Street.</p>
<p>An 8-inch water main broke this afternoon and resulted in low and no pressure in the neighborhood. A loss in pressure can cause contaminants to enter the water, leading to the need for the advisory.</p>
<p>The break was isolated around 3:30 p.m., and repairs were set to wrap up at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>The advisory applies to water used for drinking, making ice, washing dishes, brushing teeth and food preparation.
