<h1>Strip District-based startup acquired for $59 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Voci Technologies, a software startup based in the Strip District, has been acquired by Medallia, a software company in San Francisco that works with brands to gather insights on customer and employee experience to improve business models.</p>
<p>Medallia, a software-as-a-service platform, helps companies capture “experience signals,” or feedback about how a customer or employee would rate their experience, whether that was a flight, an online purchase or a vacation.</p>
<p>The company is the force behind texts that ask “Got a minute to share your experience?” and pop-up boxes that request users to “let us know what you think.”</p>
<p>Already, Medallia collects insights through text messages, digital interactions on company websites and in-person feedback. The $59 million acquisition of Voci Technologies set to close in May will add yet another dimension: phone calls.</p>
<p>Voci’s software uses artificial intelligence and machine learning in call centers to translate speech to text in real time and record phone interactions for future analysis.</p>
<p>The software can act as a “computer buddy” to employees answering phones in call centers, co-founder Anthony Gadient told the Post-Gazette in an earlier interview.</p>
<p>For example, the software will listen to a call to pick up key words and help the employee sift through a computer’s resources to find the right answer to a customer’s question. The computer can “supplement the skills of a human agent,” Mr. Gadient said.</p>
<p>Voci’s software has already processed over 2 billion minutes of speech, according to a press release announcing the acquisition.</p>
<p>“The consolidation of all contact center signals with video, survey and other critical feedback is a game changer for the industry,” Mike Coney, CEO of Voci, said in a prepared statement.</p>
<p>Voci, which spun out of technology developed at Carnegie Mellon University, had raised about $18 million in funding, according to Crunchbase, a portal where startups can self report rounds of funding.</p>
<p>Medallia, which has been a public company for about a year, reported $402.5 million in revenue for fiscal year 2020, an increase of 28% from the prior year, according to its quarterly earnings report in March.</p>
<p>Medallia’s customers span across industries, from travel and hospitality to insurance providers to cosmetics companies. The company has worked with startups like Airbnb, as well as big brand names like Comcast, Delta, Hilton and IBM.</p>
