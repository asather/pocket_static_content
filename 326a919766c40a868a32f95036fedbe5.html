<h1>'Get the hell out of the country': Mike Ditka has strong words for those who protest during anthem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mike Ditka doesn’t want to see national anthem protests in his new football league —- or anywhere else.</p>
<p>The former Pitt and Aliquippa standout told <a href="https://www.tmz.com/2020/07/26/mike-ditka-x-league-national-anthem-protests-womens-football/" target="_blank">TMZ Sports</a> as much Sunday in discussing the Extreme Football League, the women’s football division of which he serves as chairman.</p>
<p>“If you can’t respect our national anthem, get the hell out of the country,” Ditka said. “That’s the way I feel. Of course, I’m old fashioned, so I’m only going to say what I feel.</p>
<p>“You don’t protest against the flag and you don’t protest against this country who’s given you the opportunities to make a living playing a sport that you never thought would happen,” Ditka added. “So, I don’t want to hear all the crap.”</p>
<p>Ditka said he does not have the power to determine his league’s national anthem policy unilaterally ahead of its scheduled April 2021 debut. He was simply voicing his personal opinion.</p>
<p>The league will begin play in eight cities as large as Los Angeles and as small as Omaha, Neb.</p>
