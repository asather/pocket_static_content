<h1>Feds look to avoid 'preventable' deaths by improving conditions for pedestrians</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Department of Transportation is declaring war on pedestrian deaths across the country, incidents that Secretary Elaine L. Chao called&nbsp;“preventable tragedies” at a national webinar for transportation officials Wednesday.</p>
<p>The transportation community is concerned that while overall road deaths dropped from 2009 through 2018, pedestrian deaths rose by 53% to&nbsp;6,283 in 2018. Earlier this year, the Governors Highway Safety Association estimated that pedestrian deaths would rise 5% for 2019 based on figures for the first six months of the year, but the final statistics will show a 2% decrease, Ms. Chao said.</p>
<p>But that&nbsp;“sliver” of good news comes during the COVID-19 pandemic, when Ms. Chao said more people are walking for exercise during stay-at-home orders in many states. That means more people potentially putting themselves in harm’s way trying to remain socially distanced on narrow sidewalks, she said, or walking alongside roads without sidewalks.</p>
<p>“Now, fortunately there [weren’t] as many cars as usual on the road, but there was heightened concern over pedestrian safety, and many communities took steps to address it,” she told the opening session of the National Pedestrian Safety Summit. Those steps included reducing speed limits, installing barriers or designating streets just for pedestrians.</p>
<p>The trend for more people to walk rather than ride began years before the current pandemic, James Owens, deputy administrator for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, told the summit. Communities are slowly catching up with the trend by making changes to accommodate pedestrians, he said.</p>
<p>“Not every community is designed with pedestrians in mind,” he said.&nbsp;“We are encouraged that the number [of deaths] is moving in the right direction, but clearly there is a lot of work still to be done.”</p>
<p>Mala Parker, deputy administrator at the Federal Highway Administration, said studies have shown simple steps can improve pedestrian safety. For example, installing sidewalks where there aren’t any reduces deaths by 90%, flashing beacons at crosswalks reduce deaths by 70%, and allowing a longer time for pedestrians to cross the street cuts deaths by 60%.</p>
<p>In addition to the summit, which will have additional sessions July 15 and 28, federal officials are pushing the ongoing Safe Transportation for Every Pedestrian&nbsp;program through a campaign called Step Up. The campaign will emphasize reducing pedestrian deaths in dark or poorly lit areas, at non-intersection locations and among older pedestrians.</p>
<p>The agency also will focus on the problem in October, which has been designated Pedestrian Safety Month. Nicole Nason, who oversees safety programs at the Federal Highway Administration, said reducing pedestrian deaths has to involve federal, state and local officials as well as vehicle manufacturers who install safety equipment.</p>
<p>“The DOT cannot address this in one mode and can’t address it alone,” she said.&nbsp;“Collaboration is key. The only way we will achieve success is by teaming up.”</p>
