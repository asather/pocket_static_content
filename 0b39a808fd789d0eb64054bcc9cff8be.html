<p>The Penguins have re-signed forward Jared McCann to a two-year deal, the club announced Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Jared is a good offensive player who can play center or wing,” general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “We saw improvement in his play this year and feel that there is more upside to his game.”</p>
<p>The new contract carries an average annual value of $2.94 million.&nbsp;</p>
<p>McCann, who was a restricted free agent, tallied 35 points (14 goals, 21 assists) and was a plus-6 in 66 games this season for the Penguins. The versatile 24-year-old&nbsp;is a better fit at wing but can play center in a pinch.</p>
<p>Acquired in a trade with the Florida Panthers in February 2019, McCann had one assist during the Penguins’ qualifying-round series against the Montreal Canadiens. He was a surprise scratch in Game 3 of the four-game series.&nbsp;</p>
