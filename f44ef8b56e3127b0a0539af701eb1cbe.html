<h1>Duquesne man found guilty after police found $22k worth of crack</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal jury found a former Duquesne resident guilty Friday after he was caught with&nbsp;$22,000 worth of crack while on parole.</p>
<p>Donte Taylor, 37, was found guilty of breaking one count of federal narcotics law, according to a release from the Department of Justice.</p>
<p>Taylor was at his girlfriend’s house when he was visited by parole agents on May 10, 2018. The agents smelled marijuana at the home and administered a drug test.</p>
<p>Taylor tested positive for marijuana and cocaine, and agents notified local police.</p>
<p>After the police arrived, Taylor’s girlfriend admitted there was a small amount of marijuana inside, and gave the officers written and verbal consent to search the house, the released reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When police entered, they found much more: 279 grams of crack cocaine worth between $22,000 to $28,000. They also found cocaine, heroin and fentanyl, plus scales and drug packaging materials.</p>
<p>Under federal law, Taylor could face&nbsp;10 years to life in prison and a fine of up to $8,000,000.</p>
<p>Taylor’s sentencing hearing is scheduled for June 5, 2020.</p>
