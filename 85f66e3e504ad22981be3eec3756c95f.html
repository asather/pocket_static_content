<p>Flags will fly at half staff across Pennsylvania to honor Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who died Friday.</p>
<p>Governor Tom Wolf ordered all American flags on state facilities to fly at half staff starting at sunrise Saturday.</p>
<p>“Justice Ginsburg was a truly remarkable figure in American history, as both a tireless defender of the Constitution, and as a pioneer for gender equality,” said Mr. Wolf. “Justice Ginsburg’s historic opinions from the bench broke down barriers for woman and protected the vulnerable. Her contributions to our country cannot be overstated.”</p>
<p>The United States flag will remain at half staff until interment by order from the White House, said Mr. Wolf. The state flag has been at half staff since March 11 to honor victims of the COVID-19 pandemic and will remain so for the forseeable future.</p>
