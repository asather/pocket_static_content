<h1>Hip-hop video from Grxwn Fxlks captures Pittsburgh in the time of COVID</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Grxwn Fxlks had a different video shot for its debut single, “Celebrate,” which comes with the chorus: “Check cleared, bills paid, celebrate/fridge full, kids good, celebrate/woke up, sunshine and celebrate.”</p>
<p>“But,” says rapper Masai Turner, “we started to see people fall on hard times due to the pandemic and I knew that we weren't going to have a video come out with a party vibe or sending a message that wouldn't be helpful.”</p>
<p>So, the former frontman for the popular Pittsburgh hip-hop crew Formula412 and his partner/producer Akil Esoon put a whole different spin on the song with a new black-and-white video they shot with director Emmai Alaquiva.</p>

<p>Turner, who moved to Phoenix 10 years ago for a job with a tech company, flew into Pittsburgh on March 27 and spent a few days shooting this video in the Hill District, Lawrenceville and other locations.</p>
<p>It captures Turner and Esoon buying people’s groceries, paying for their gas and shopping for groceries to donate to the Light of Life Rescue Mission on the North Side.</p>
<p>The song, with a heavy, old-school hip-hop vibe, was written about a year ago and recorded at Paramount Studios in LA. It was mixed by Chris Galland, who mixed Mac Miller's “Swimming” and mastered by Mike Bozzi, who’s worked with Tyler the Creator, Kendrick Lamar and Childish Gambino.</p>
<p>The video was released on Sunday — 4/12, appropriately — and swiftly had more than 100 shares on the Grxwn Fxlks Facebook page.</p>
<p>“We will put out a new single every four to six weeks until we feel there is a real desire for an album,” Turner notes.</p>
<p>For the debut single, he says, “I came home to spread a little love and a few smiles.”</p>
