<h1>Mon-Fayette Expressway include expensive utility relocations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In many road projects, the highest cost other than construction itself is the acquisition of property and relocation of residents or business operators, with utility relocation a small part of the package.</p>
<p>But for the southern section of the long-awaited Mon-Fayette Expressway, utility relocation will be the biggest secondary cost to build eight miles of highway from Jefferson Hills to Duquesne at more than $40 million. That’s because the design not only follows a path largely occupied by major electric supply lines but also passes over the Union Railroad yard in Duquesne, which handles freight service among U.S. Steel plants and customers in the Monongahela Valley.</p>
<p>In December, the commission approved $15.9 million for Duquersne Light Co. to relocate facilities at three different sites for the new highway.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of costs related to relocation of utilities,” said Brad Heigel, chief engineer for the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission, which is building the expressway.&nbsp;“That will cost more than acquiring property, which usually isn’t the case.”</p>
<p>The most expensive element will be the reconfiguration of the rail yard, which provides rail service linking the Clairton Coke Works, Edgar Thomson plant in Braddock and the Irvin plant in West Mifflin. The turnpike commission approved an agreement last week to reimburse the railroad, operated by U.S. Steel subsidiary Transtar, $21.9 million for changes at the yard.</p>
<p>As part of the expressway project, the turnpike will relocate a bridge on Route 837 in Duquesne that passes over the rail yard. As a result, U.S. Steel spokeswoman Meghan M. Cox said in a statement there will be major changes at the rail yard, which plays a key role in the company’s Monongahela Valley operation.</p>
<p>Ms. Cox said the company supports the highway, which has been discussed for more than 50 years, because it is&nbsp;“critical to the region.” Work will involve redesigning and reconstructing the facility.</p>
<p>“As this project intersects with the middle of our operations, we are forced to relocate rail car switching, weighing and car repair operations during and after construction,” Ms. Cox said. “Duquesne is the epicenter of the Union Railroad, which permits URR to operate as the central nervous system of integrated steel making in the Mon Valley, connecting the raw materials between railroad interchanges, Clairton, Edgar Thomson and Irvin.”</p>
<p>The steel company said about 72,000 carloads of coke and steel slabs pass through the rail yard, which also processes more than 26,000 more carloads a year for the company and its customers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This rail traffic is critical to the Pittsburgh region and assists in balancing the infrastructure of the Mon Valley,” Ms. Cox said.</p>
<p>The facility also is the company’s primary maintenance site to ensure its thousands of rail cars meet federal safety requirements.</p>
<p>Mr. Heigel said the agreement is the railroad’s best estimate of its reconfiguration costs and the turnpike will pay for actual costs, which could be lower. The railroad will be responsible for the work.</p>
<p>“We pay them to move their facilities,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s very complicated down there.”</p>
<p>The turnpike plans to relocate the Route 837 bridge as part of the construction of the interchange with the new expressway. Construction on the southern section of the expressway is scheduled to begin in 2024, but some auxiliary work such as the new bridge and the relocation of Commonwealth Avenue in West Mifflin could begin as early as 2021.</p>
<p>The agency has chosen the path for the highway and is in the process of acquiring 256 pieces of property it needs. Engineers are continuing to fine-tune the specific design specifications.</p>
<p>This part of the highway will be divided into six construction contracts moving consecutively from Jefferson Hills to the north. Each section will open when it is completed.</p>
<p>The future of the northern section of the highway, which will cross the Monongahela River and join the Parkway East at Monroeville, is uncertain because of revenue shortfalls created by the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is paid for with proceeds from the oil franchise tax, whose coffers aren’t being replenished as quickly as usual because motorists are driving less.</p>
<p>The highway initially was to include a wing into Pittsburgh along the bank of the Monongahela River, but a price tag of more than $4 billion and opposition from former Pittsburgh Mayor Tom Murphy killed that idea.&nbsp;</p>
