<h1>Paul Zeise: Steelers didn’t think through their social justice statement very well</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers wanted to send a message of unity and racial justice by putting the name of the late Antwon Rose II on the back of their helmets. Rose was shot in the back by a police officer in June 2018 as he was running away after the car he was in was pulled over.</p>
<p>The message they ended up sending, though, is honoring flawed victims can end up causing more problems than it solves. The car Rose was driving in was involved in a drive-by shooting about 10 minutes before they were pulled over — and that’s why they were pulled over.</p>
<p>Team captain Cam Heyward said prior to Monday’s game with the Giants that the team was unified and wanted to make sure Rose was not forgotten. There was some public backlash against the Steelers because there was a sentiment that Rose wasn’t some innocent bystander targeted by police because of the color of his skin; that he was a conspirator in a felony and many fans believed there were far more worthy victims of police violence to honor.</p>
<p>The team was making a statement in unity and often that is going to he uncomfortable for some fans, as some of these issues are polarizing and divisive. But Alejandro Villanueva was apparently not on board with the plan and instead put the name&nbsp;Alwyn Cashe, a veteran who died during the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2005, on the back of his helmet for the game.</p>
<p>The move caught Villanueva’s teammates by surprise and both Heyward and Ben Roethlisberger said they didn’t know he was planning to do that. Mike Tomlin said Villanueva cleared it with him, but the decision to honor Rose was allegedly made by the players. Even the mother of Rose, Michelle Kenney, weighed in on the situation and voiced her displeasure with Villanueva’s decision to go off script.</p>
<p>“Let me very very very clear. The Pittsburgh Steelers took a team vote. Obviously one person didn’t like the results so…” Kenney wrote in a Facebook post.</p>
<p>Since Monday, Maurkice Pouncey came out and said he didn’t understand the full situation surrounding Rose’s shooting and he would not be wearing his name in the future. Minkah Fitzpatrick seemed to dispute Kenney’s assessment of a team vote and said the decision came&nbsp;‘“from above’ and also wasn’t sure of the details of Rose’s death.</p>
<p>It is now Friday and the Steelers, who pounded the Giants, are still dealing with the fallout from all of this. Villanueva is most to blame because had he just talked to his teammates before the game, the whole thing would have blown over quickly. Nobody would have had a problem with him honoring a fallen war hero, but it became a problem when he did it without talking to his teammates about it.</p>
<p>The way it was all handled leaves lots of questions about who made the decision to honor Rose and when. And the fact that nobody seems to have an answer makes it clear this wasn’t very well thought out — especially given the facts of Rose’s case. Nobody deserves to get shot in the back, and what happened to him was a tragedy. But he was involved in a felony and on the run from it.</p>
<p>The larger point is the dangers of these group-think ideas for social justice displays. There are 53-plus men in a locker room. And while I’m sure all of them are unified when it comes to matters of social justice, there are going to be different ideas of how their platforms should be used.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean they should shut up and dribble (or in this case play football), but it does mean these things need to be thought through. And quite often the best decision is for players individually to decide what they are going to do and how they are going to do it.</p>
<p>Nobody seems to be talking about social justice this week or how well the Steelers played. Instead they are talking about how badly the Steelers screwed this up and whether we should be honoring flawed victims.</p>
<p>Tomlin has been uncomfortable at times with these ventures into things beyond football, and this is an example of why. These issues are not always black and white and there isn’t always a right or wrong side. One can reasonably be for racial justice and against police brutality and also be against putting the name of a man involved in a drive-by shooting on the back of a helmet.</p>
<p>The Steelers have a good team this year. They don’t need distractions and they don’t need anything to jeopardize their team unity. A sloppily thrown together measure like this is the type of thing that can cause headaches, and there is no reason for that to happen.</p>
