<h1>Paul Zeise: Centennial class cheapens the Pro Football Hall of Fame</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I love Bill Cowher and all that he stands for. He is a Pittsburgh icon and embodies the traits that so many of us who grew up here admire and can relate to.</p>
<p>He won a lot of games — and a Super Bowl — and it’s tremendous that he is now a Hall of Famer. But he shouldn’t have gotten the call to the Hall of Fame this weekend.</p>
<p>Cowher is one of the 15 who will be put in the Hall of Fame this season as part of this centennial class, celebrating 100 years of the NFL. The entire class will be announced later this week, and they will have a special ceremony in addition to the normal one associated with the Hall of Fame induction in August.</p>
<p>Now, Cowher may have a Hall of Fame resume — that’s for others to determine&nbsp;— but the way he got in with this centennial class is problematic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not trying to be a party-pooper, but I can’t understand why people think this is a good idea. And what is the point of it, other than to have a made-for-TV event and having a lot of bodies to celebrate?</p>

<p>Jimmy Johnson also got the Hall call over the weekend, learning of the honor during Fox’s coverage of the NFC playoffs Sunday. He’ll get in the Hall of Fame despite not even having 100 wins as an NFL coach.</p>
<p>There are some who say this is necessary, that these players/coaches were overlooked when they were eligible and this is a correction of sorts. They point to players such as Donnie Shell, who had 51 career interceptions, and say he should have got in when he was eligible.</p>
<p>I couldn’t disagree more. The Hall of Fame process is supposed to be selective. It’s supposed to be for the elite of the elite. It was never supposed to be a Hall of Very Good or a reward for players and coaches who were great. That isn’t a high enough standard, which is why typically there are only five or six men who get inducted each year.</p>
<p>I think even that number is too many in some years, but the Hall must have a ceremony every year so people need to keep getting inducted, I suppose.</p>
<p>Cowher, to me, is on that level just below a Hall of Famer, at least as a coach. He rebuilt the Steelers franchise after Chuck Noll retired and fielded teams that had the blue-collar mentality the people of Pittsburgh and fans of the Steelers love so much.</p>
<p>If you want to argue that Cowher’s work with CBS puts him over the top, I wouldn’t completely disagree.&nbsp;But this contrived centennial team goes against everything that a Hall of Fame should be about.</p>
<p>The customary Hall of Fame class will be announced the Saturday before the Super Bowl. Ex-Steeler&nbsp;Troy Polamulu will almost assuredly be one of the five or so who will get named, and he should be because he was an elite-level player.</p>
<p>He’ll be voted in the old-fashioned way.&nbsp;Cowher, Johnson and the other 13 centennial class members should be too.</p>
