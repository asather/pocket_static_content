<h1>Riverhounds' USL Championship aims for July 11 return to play</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Riverhounds are poised to return to action in a little more than a month.</p>
<p>The club’s USL Championship announced Thursday that its board of governors has voted to set July 11 as the date for a league-wide return to play.</p>
<p>No other details of the league’s plans were included in the announcement, which also noted that the league will work with state and local authorities to ensure health and safety guidelines are followed.</p>
<p>It’s for that same reason that the Riverhounds do not yet have any updates on ticket sales and policy. Those will be announced once the club knows what it must to do play host to home games.</p>
<p>USL Championship suspended its season March 12, shortly before most of their teams were scheduled to start their regular seasons.</p>
