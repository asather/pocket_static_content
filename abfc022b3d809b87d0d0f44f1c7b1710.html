<p>The district said it was sharing the information&nbsp;“out of an abundance of caution.”</p>
<p>“As a reminder, the symptoms of COVID-19 include a fever, cough and shortness of breath,” the district said. “If you or a member of your family experience any of the symptoms above, we encourage you to please follow-up with your primary care physician.”</p>
