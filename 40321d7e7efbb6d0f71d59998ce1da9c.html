<h1>How to look at art online</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When looking at art online, it’s important to remember that the scale is different. Screens distort color and texture is hard to see.</p>
<p>Most artists have the dimensions listed with the title, which can help when looking to buy a work. As for color and texture, make sure the monitor’s brightness is all the way up and blue light filters are turned off. It can also help to make the painting fill the entire screen. Standing farther back, as you would in a gallery, and thinking about how the eye is guided through the work can make the experience feel more real.</p>
<p>It’s a good idea to research the artist’s work and background before purchasing. Most artists are happy to answer any questions and encourage people to reach out.</p>
