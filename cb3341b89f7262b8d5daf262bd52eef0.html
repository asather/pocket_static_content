<p>BEIJING â€” The central Chinese city of Wuhan, where the global coronavirus pandemic is believed to have originated, has issued a total ban on the hunting, breeding and human consumption of wild animals.</p>
<p>The move is in an apparent response to research showing the virus most likely originated among bats and was transmitted to people via an intermediary wild species sold for food at a market in the city.</p>
<p>The regulation issued Wednesday seeks to carry out measures passed at the national level covering protected land animals, as well as sea life, promising financial relief to help dealers move into other lines of business.</p>
<p>However, it contains numerous exceptions, including for animals used for traditional Chinese medicine, as long as they are not consumed as food for humans. That left it unclear whether the ban would cover pangolins, small mammals whose scales are used for traditional Chinese medicine but which are thought to have been the intermediary carrier of the virus.</p>
<p>The regulation will be enforced immediately and will be in effect for five years.</p>
