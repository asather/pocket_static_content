<h1>Pittsburgh saw largest jump in construction jobs in Pa. from April to May, data shows</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh metro area added 22,000 construction jobs from April to May, the largest increase in Pennsylvania, according to an analysis of federal employment data from the Associated General Contractors of America (AGCA) released Tuesday.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh reported 58,900 construction jobs in May, up from 36,900 jobs in April. There was an increase of 85,600 construction jobs statewide over the same time for a total of 241,100.</p>
<p>It’s the third-highest increase in the country behind Seattle-Bellevue-Everett, Wash., which added 28,600 construction jobs, and New York City, which added 25,000 jobs. Pittsburgh’s 60% increase is the ninth-highest percentage change in the country as well.</p>
<p>The study found that 392 metro areas across the country added construction jobs. The Midland, Texas, metro area lost the most jobs in the country from April to May at 1,400.</p>
<p>The data was released with a survey conducted by AGCA on workzone safety awareness. Of 178 responses, 33% of highway construction firms reported “five or more” crashes involving a motor vehicle occurred in a highway work zone in the past 12 months.</p>
<p>Another 58% reported that the COVID-19 pandemic has actually made workzones safer due to a decrease in highway traffic levels. Still, 68% reported that highway workzones are more dangerous now overall than 10 years ago due to an increase in phones and other distractions.</p>
