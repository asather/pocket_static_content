<h1>Cal U student sues school for refund over campus shutdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A California University of Pennsylvania undergrad has become the latest Western Pennsylvania college student to sue her school in federal court on behalf of herself and others in seeking a refund because of the virus-related campus shutdown.</p>
<p>Ashleigh Coffman said in her complaint that California University's online instruction is sub-par and she wants her money back for the tuition she paid.</p>
<p>The suit, which is seeking class-action status, is similar others filed in recent weeks against the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/09/tuition-lawsuit-university-of-pittsburgh-covid-refund-students-sue/stories/202005090047" target="_blank">University of Pittsburgh</a> and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/18/CMU-student-lawsuit-campus-shutdown-inperson-instruction-demands-tuition-refund-COVID-19/stories/202005180112" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon University</a>.</p>
<p>All of the suits make essentially the same claim: That students are being denied the education and experience they paid for because online instruction isn't an adequate substitute.</p>
<p>Ms. Coffman and her lawyer, Gary Lynch, said she paid her tuition for the spring semesters for an "in-person, on-campus educational experience" that the school can't deliver.</p>
<p>"She has not been provided a pro-rated refund of the tuition she paid for her in-person classes that were discontinued and moved online," the complaint says.</p>
<p>California University announced March 16 that all of its courses would move online by March 30 and said it would be "business as usual" for full-time students switching to online learning. No in-person classes have been held since March 6.</p>
<p>Ms. Coffman said the online instruction for some courses involves previously-recorded lectures posted on the internet for students to review on their own. For other courses, professors post notes for students to review.</p>
<p>The complaint says the online teaching isn't as good as the real thing and that students have been "deprived of the opportunity for collaborative learning and in-person dialogue, feedback and critique."</p>
<p>The suit accuses California University of breach of contract and unjust enrichment and is seeking a pro-rated refund of tuition for the spring semester.</p>
<p>Suits against Pitt and CMU, and other suits around the country, are asking for similar refunds.</p>
