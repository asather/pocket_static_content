<h1>Pittsburgh diocese sets rules for Mass capacity</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh is authorizing its churches to fill up to 25 percent of seating capacity once weekend Masses resume June 6 and 7, the diocese announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>The diocese recently announced it was resuming daily Masses on Monday, June 1, with weekend Masses to follow. For the first week of daily Masses, attendance will be limited to 25 or fewer, it said.</p>
<p>Beginning June 6 and 7 and for all Masses afterward, churches will be allowed to raise attendance limits to 25% of capacity while maintaining social distancing, mask-wearing and a regular regimen of cleaning and disinfecting worship spaces.</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik canceled public Masses in mid-March amid the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. Even with the reopening, the bishop has maintained the waiver of the usual obligation for Catholics to attend weekend Mass, and services have been livestreamed.</p>
<p>Each parish’s leadership will determine when it’s ready to reopen and how to implement the attendance and other guidelines. Worshippers will be required to wear masks, use hand sanitizer and maintain social distancing.</p>
<p>The complexities of reopening are reflected in the approach taken by the soon-to-merge parishes of St. Bernard in Mt. Lebanon and Our Lady of Grace in Scott.</p>
<p>St. Bernard will open for funerals and daily Masses beginning June 1. Because it has hard surfaces and good ventilation, it is easier to clean and sanitize, said the Rev. David Bonnar, administrator of the parishes. But while a small shrine in the vestibule of Our Lady of Grace will be open for private prayer, the sanctuary itself won’t be used for Masses because the carpet would be harder to disinfect regularly and the ventilation system isn’t as strong, he said.</p>
<p>Both churches, however, will begin to host weekend Masses outdoors on their properties beginning June 6 and 7, he said. People will either be in their cars or, if they don’t have one, in a limited amount of seating, though all those receiving communion will come forward on foot to receive it after Mass.</p>
<p>At Holy Spirit Parish in Lawrence County, which normally has 13 Masses across seven church buildings, the Rev. Joseph McCaffrey said he hopes to begin with outdoor Masses at one location on the weekend of June 6-7. That would help gauge the level of attendance to be expected in the coming weeks so that the parish could plan for future Masses.</p>
<p>“Twenty-five percent [capacity] is still small if you have seven different churches,” he said.&nbsp;“I don’t want to be turning people away, and we have no idea what kind of response it’s going to be.”</p>
<p>He’s looking forward to the reopening. “I never in my life imagined as a priest we’d be in a situation where we weren't allowed to have public sacraments,” he said. “It’s been very challenging, and we’re very eager to be back and with the people.”</p>
<p>State regulations for counties in the cautionary&nbsp;“yellow” zone, which include Allegheny and most of the surrounding counties in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, prohibit gatherings of more than 25 people. (Lawrence County is in the more permissive green zone, but the diocese is maintaining a uniform policy across all its counties.)</p>
<p>Diocesan spokeswoman Ellen Mady said, however, that the state doesn’t have specific guidelines for religious organizations and that&nbsp;the diocese also is basing its decisions on other criteria for the yellow zone, such as those for nonprofits and those used by large stores, which can accommodate more than 25 customers at a time while still ensuring participants are wearing masks and keeping 6 feet apart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While the diocese has authorized the reopening, “the decision to reopen a church rests with pastors, who need to base their decisions on a number of factors,” the diocese said in a statement. That includes the ability to comply with federal protocols on cleaning and sanitizing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Holding outdoor Masses has its own challenges depending on the weather.</p>
<p>But&nbsp;“the Holy Father has had Masses all over the world in all kinds of weather,” Father McCaffrey said. “We’ll follow his example.”</p>
