<h1>Murrysville-based Philips Respironics doubling ventilator production to help replenish strategic national stockpile</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Royal Philips has signed a $646.7 million with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to produce 2,500 ventilators for the strategic national stockpile by May 31 and a total of 43,000 ventilators by Dec. 31.</p>
<p>To do this, company officials said Thursday they intend to double production of ventilators at the Philips Respironics facility in Murrysville and also at a second facility in Carlsbad, California.</p>
<p>“There is an unprecedented global demand for medical equipment to help diagnose and treat patients with COVID-19,” said CEO Frans van Houten in a release. “We welcome the support of the U.S. government in our efforts to aggressively increase the production of hospital ventilators.”</p>
<p>HHS officials said five additional ventilator companies will receive contracts “in the coming week.”</p>
<p>Philips Respironics earlier posted job openings for production line workers at the Murrysville plant to allow for around-the-clock shifts assembling and testing ventilators to shore up a dwindling inventory of the life-saving breathing machines.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman said the company “is closely working with its suppliers in the U.S., Europe and Asia for an uninterrupted flow” of the more than 650 components parts in each ventilator.</p>
<p>Under the Defense Production Act, U.S. suppliers are required to give priority to Royal Philips and the five other ventilator makers —&nbsp;General Electric, Hill-Rom, Medtronic, ResMed and Vyaire Medical —&nbsp;for deliveries. In addition, a Royal Philips spokesman said if a supplier is in a lockdown region “then the DPA will allow it to stay open, and continue the deliveries.”</p>
