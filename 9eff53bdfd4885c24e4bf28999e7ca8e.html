<h1>'He's a Watt': Despite injury, Derek Watt showing Steelers what that means</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There aren’t many fullback numbers better than 44, so it should fit Derek Watt perfectly in his first season in Pittsburgh. And early indications out of training camp at Heinz Field are that Watt could be a great fit himself for what the Steelers need out of their fullback. Just take it from someone who watches him a little more closely than most, and always has.</p>
<p>“I think he’s just a very well-rounded athlete, first and foremost,” T.J. Watt, his younger brother and new teammate, said Tuesday. “He catches the ball out of the backfield, can line up wide and run crisp routes. Obviously, we know he can block, being a fullback, whether it’s routing a guy out in a backs-on-backers [drill] or if it’s cutting on the edge. He can do a multitude of things, and that’s just on the offensive side of the ball.”</p>
<p>No, Derek Watt won’t be lining up next to T.J. on defense any time soon — unless he’s the secret weapon we don’t know about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/08/27/marcus-allen-steelers-linebackers-mike-tomlin-liam-mccullough/stories/202008270193" target="_blank">in a thin group of inside linebackers</a> — but he’ll be doing plenty more for the Steelers on special teams. But more on that later.</p>
<p>Let’s start with what he’ll add to the offense, because in light of his brother’s scouting report, it might not be so much about what he can do as what he’ll be invited to do. The role of a fullback can be and has been volatile in the Steelers system, which is perhaps why third-year offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner called it “a really good question” Thursday when he was asked how much Watt can help.</p>
<p>“Derek is a very sharp player. … He was asked to do a handful of things in the run and the pass,” Fichtner said of Watt’s first four years with the Chargers. “I think he does have flexibility to do both. I do think he definitely has the toughness, and he has the intelligence to do — and be asked to do — a lot of things. So, there’s a lot of excitement for that.”</p>
<p>But Fichtner also mentioned that the Steelers aren’t exactly seeing that in action so far. Watt is still recovering from an “offseason procedure” he declined to disclose and is targeting a full return by the season opener Sept. 14. Fichtner noted that this might be the first practice time Watt has missed in his NFL career, though he did also have shoulder surgery last offseason in late May.</p>
<p>“The surgery’s in the past and I’m ready to go,” Watt said Saturday. “The plan is Week 1. I have every intention for Week 1 and getting involved in the back half of camp here.”</p>
<p>Watt has played in every game for five consecutive seasons, dating to his senior year at Wisconsin, and his durability was attractive to the Steelers in free agency. Despite being limited, he’s shown the potential to be a better pass-catcher than Roosevelt Nix, who converted from defensive line to fullback in the NFL.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Standing on the sideline while the offense tries to move the ball has been the most frequent activity for the Steelers fullback the past couple years. Last season, Nix played in just three games because of injury. But two years ago, with Nix coming off a Pro Bowl season blocking for Le’Veon Bell, his offensive snap share dropped from 16% to 10% as the Steelers led the league in pass attempts. Now, Watt has never played more than 21 snaps in a game on offense, so it’s not as if the Steelers signed Mike Alstott, but they did make him the second-highest paid fullback in the NFL.</p>
<p>“He’s getting in-helmet perspective on work every day, in uniform; we’re just limiting some of the things he does in an effort to make sure we get that daily exposure to the process,” coach Mike Tomlin said. “We’re thoughtfully revving up his participation and it’s going to increase as the days go by.”</p>
<p>Probably not as excited as special teams coordinator Danny Smith, though. Watt tied for the league lead in special teams tackles last year with 16, playing 78% of the snaps in that phase of the game for the Chargers.</p>
<p>If playing hard is a skill, Watt has it. Of course, that should surprise nobody given his lineage.</p>
<p>“He’s a Watt,” Smith said, stressing the emphasis on that famous last name. “His mom and dad ought to be writing books, and we all ought to be reading it. That’s the first thing. He’s special. He just is. His makeup, his understanding of the game, his work habits and everything, he’s special.”</p>
<p>Watt may need to bring a little bit more than just intangibles to the Steelers, given that their rush attack ranked third-to-last in the league last year in yards per carry and their conversion rate on third and fourth down with less than 3 yards to go was worst in the AFC.</p>
<p>But he’s at least making this training camp much more enjoyable for one teammate, who resides in the same neighborhood, same family tree and eats at the same breakfast table each morning.</p>
<p>“It’s great for us,” Derek said of he and T.J. “I used to be on the other side of the country, so now we get to see each other all the time and he gets to hang out with my wife and my son. He’s loving being an uncle who’s able to be there constantly and have time with Logan. I know [oldest brother] J.J.’s very jealous of that and T.J.’s sending as many videos as he can to try to make him jealous so he can win that&nbsp;‘favorite uncle’ title.”</p>
