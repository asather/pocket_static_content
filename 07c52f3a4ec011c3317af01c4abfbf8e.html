<h1>Bellevue police issue arrest warrant for man charged in apartment fire</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bellevue police have issued a warrant Friday for the arrest of 45-year-old Michael Holleran in connection to setting an apartment building on fire.</p>
<p>Mr. Holleran faces multiple charges that include arson, criminal mischief, endangering property and endangering persons.</p>
<p>On July 24, Bellevue Fire Department was dispatched to 198 Grant Ave. for a reported apartment fire in a two-and-a-half story, five-apartment building. Two apartments were occupied during the time of the fire.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Deputy Fire Marshal George Hollenberger and Chief Deputy Fire Marshal Don Brucker conducted a fire investigation, and found the fire’s origin started in the living room on the first floor. City police also brought in an accelerant detection canine in a sniff search and picked up several alerts. Samples from the alerts were collected and submitted to the county’s crime laboratory for analysis. All accidental and natural causes of fire were then eliminated, the affidavit stated, and the fire was then classified as arson. County police then opened up a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>On the scene, fire marshals met with Mr. Holleran, who occupied the first apartment. He told investigators he was treating a parasite infection by soaking his feet in Epsom salt water and wiping his feet with alcohol wipes, where he then placed the wipes in an ashtray to pour gasoline on them and set them on fire in hopes of effectively exterminating the worms.</p>
<p>Mr. Holleran told police he must have put the gas can too close to the flame because the gas fumes emitting from the open gas container caught on fire. He then kicked the gas can away from him where more gas spilled out. When he went to the kitchen to get water, the fire spread, so he then evacuated his apartment. While evacuating, Mr. Holleran notified the other occupant that was home at the time and they safely escaped.</p>
<p>Police say the estimated damages total to $250,000. One firefighter was transported to an area hospital for a rapid heart rate and was released.</p>
<p>In a second interview with police at a room in the Comfort Inn in Ross, Mr. Holleran recounted the same story. He was provided a two-night stay by the American Red Cross. He also added that he poured a puddle of gasoline on his living room floor and set it on fire at least 10 times in the past. Mr. Holleran also informed police he has a long history of substance-use and is currently using heroin.</p>
