<h1>State Supreme Court hears argument on Western Psych shooting case</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Following oral argument on Tuesday afternoon, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court must decide whether the physicians who treated the man accused of committing a mass shooting at Western Psych eight years ago can be held civilly liable for failing to have him involuntarily committed.</p>
<p>Kathryn Leight, a receptionist at the Oakland facility, was shot in the chest and abdomen and severely wounded when John Shick entered the building and opened fire on March 8, 2012. Mr. Shick, who had previously been diagnosed with schizophrenia, killed one person and wounded six others before a responding officer shot and killed him.</p>
<p>Ms. Leight filed a lawsuit against the hospital system and University of Pittsburgh Physicians who treated Mr. Shick at UPMC Shadyside Family Health Center, arguing that they initiated the steps to have him receive involuntary mental health treatment, but failed to complete them, making them liable under the state’s Mental Health Procedures Act.</p>
<p>Now retired Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge R. Stanton Wettick Jr. threw the claims out, and in a December 2018 decision, the state Superior Court concurred with that decision.</p>
<p>Ms. Leight’s attorney, Mark Homyak, appealed that decision to the state Supreme Court, which heard oral argument over videoconferencing Tuesday —&nbsp;made available to the public live via YouTube.</p>
<p>In the appeal, Mr. Homyak argued that the physicians who treated Mr. Shick were grossly negligent for failing to follow through on having him involuntarily treated — and that but for their failure to do so, the shooting at Western Psych would not have occurred.</p>
<p>“There’s evidence they reached a decision, attempted to take action and then failed to complete it,” Mr. Homyak said. “Mrs. Leight suffered her gunshot wounds because these doctors didn’t execute the Mental Health Procedures Act.”</p>
<p>But the attorney for the physicians argued that there is no liability under the Mental Health Procedures Act because the doctors never executed a decision to seek involuntary treatment for Mr. Shick.</p>
<p>“There needs to be a bright line demarcation for when the involuntary commitment process begins,” argued John Conti, on behalf of the physicians. Without it, he said, “it opens the door to unfathomable ambiguity and confusion.”</p>
<p>Before the attack at Western Psych, Mr. Shick had previously been committed five separate times, but none in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>In his argument, Mr. Homyak told the Supreme Court that liability under the Mental Health Procedures Act was triggered on Feb. 10, 2012, when Mr. Shick walked into his doctor’s office carrying a baseball bat, banged it on the counter and threatened the staff.</p>
<p>That day, the attorney said, a physician called re:solve, UPMC’s mobile mental health response unit, and requested assistance to complete the commitment process. Re:solve went to Mr. Shick’s apartment, Mr. Homyak told the court, but he refused to allow the staffers in. Three days later, re:solve contacted the doctor again, and he said he would contact his supervisors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a call from Mr. Shick’s mother on Feb. 17, 2012, the same doctor contacted Western Psych and asked that commitment papers be faxed to him, Mr. Homyak said.</p>
<p>When he was told the process could not be completed that way, the lawyer continued, the doctor said he would follow up but did not.</p>
<p>In his brief to the court, Mr. Homyak identified at least 21 documented times — and possibly as many as 30 — in Mr. Shicks’ medical records that physicians within the University of Pittsburgh Physicians thought about having Shick involuntarily examined.</p>
<p>“What is abundantly clear, however, is that there was no mere passing thought or vague consideration of the possibility of causing Shick to be involuntarily examined someday,” Mr. Homyak wrote. “Rather, necessary action was obvious and apparent to the physicians providing outpatient medical care to Shick.”</p>
<p>Justice David Wecht asked Mr. Homyak during the argument at what point liability attaches.</p>
<p>“I would suggest the line is once the doctors evidence their decision,” Mr. Homyak responded. “Once a decision is made and the doctor acts on it and fails to follow through, that triggers liability.”</p>
<p>But Mr. Conti countered during his argument that liability does not attach until the individual’s liberty has been infringed upon — when the patient is taken for an involuntary exam.</p>
<p>Under the Mental Health Procedures Act, to be examined for involuntary commitment, there must be a certification by a doctor, warrant by county administrator or application by a doctor or peace officer. That, the doctors’ attorneys argue, triggers the necessary due process under the law.</p>
<p>“Mr. Shick at all times was a voluntary outpatient, and it defies law and logic to contend otherwise,” the physicians’ attorneys wrote in their brief to the court. “Moreover, none of the statutory procedures set forth in the MHPA to bring about involuntary commitment was ever begun, and the act therefore has no applicability to defendant’s care.”</p>
<p>They noted, too, that more than a month elapsed from the doctors’ last in-person interaction with Mr. Shick to the time of the shooting.</p>
<p>In his argument, Mr. Conti posed the scenario that a family physician who even contemplates involuntary treatment for a patient — by seeking advice or guidance from another&nbsp;— but chooses not to go that route, could be held liable under Mr. Homyak’s position.</p>
<p>He asked the court to exercise restraint in its decision — calling the potential expansion of liability in the law an “absurd and dangerous proposition.”</p>
