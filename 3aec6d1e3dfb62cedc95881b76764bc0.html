<h1>Playgrounds, organized sports on verge of returning to Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Outdoor recreation is slowly returning to Pittsburgh as the city begins to loosen social-distancing restrictions and Allegheny County begins life in the “green” phase of reopening.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, the city of Pittsburgh announced that certain recreation hubs — including basketball courts, ball fields, playgrounds and spray works — will <a href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/press-releases/press-releases/4029" target="_blank">soon be allowed to reopen</a>, according to a press release. This will be the first time these spaces will be available for public use since the city shut them down in mid-March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>These amenities will be reopened “on a rolling basis,” though the press release also indicated that the city believes “most should be completed” by Monday, June 15. Organized sports will also be allowed to start up again “provided that organizers follow safety guidelines,” though the press release did not specify a date when those would be officially allowed again.</p>

<p>Certain public spaces — like recreation centers, senior centers and swimming pools — will remain closed, along with particular park amenities like restrooms and water fountains.</p>
<p>The Department of Public Works has sent out crews to get ball fields and other sites ready for public enjoyment again and will be “posting signage on their safe use,” according to the release. The city will also restart granting permits for the private use of ball fields and other open-air park shelters.</p>
<p>Playgrounds will be regularly cleaned, though the city is urging parents to ensure their children regularly wash their hands and avoid these sort of spaces if they’re sick. The press release also made sure to specify that the Mellon Park Tennis Center will only be reopening at 50% capacity.</p>
<p>Permits will again be accepted for block parties and other outdoor special events as long as they are limited to 250 attendees or fewer and the organizers provide the city with a “COVID-19 safety plan” complete with “hand-washing and social distancing protocols.”</p>
<p>This is yet another step toward the return of unrestricted sports in Allegheny County. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf announced on May 27 that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/27/Tom-Wolf-professional-sports-Pennsylvania-yellow-green-Steelers-Pirates-Penguins/stories/202005270146" target="_blank">professional sports could return</a> in “yellow” and “green” counties, but that proclamation didn’t apply to amateur sports at any level.</p>
<p>Now, it appears that folks like the members of Pittsburgh Sports League who are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/bop/2020/06/08/pittsburgh-sports-league-pittsburgh-urban-magnet-project-psl-pump-basketball-dodgeball-flag-football-kickball-softball-volleyball-covid-19/stories/202006070001" target="_blank">itching to get back on the field</a> or court may have their wish granted sooner rather than later.</p>
