<h1>Penguins mailbag: What would it cost to buy out Jack Johnson and clear the blue-line logjam? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag.&nbsp;</em><em>Jim Rutherford continued his busy offseason last week with yet another deal. This time, Patric Hornqvist <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/24/patric-hornqvist-trade-penguins-panthers-nhl-stanley-cup/stories/202009240175" target="_blank">waived a no-trade clause</a>. He’s headed to Florida in exchange for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/25/mike-matheson-penguins-trade-patric-hornqvist-deal/stories/202009250137" target="_blank">left-shot defenseman Mike Matheson</a> and bottom-six winger Colton Sceviour.&nbsp;</em><em>Let’s dive right into your questions about the trade and the ripple effect it could have on the roster.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul:</strong>&nbsp;What are your thoughts on the Hornqvist trade? Can the Penguins win it even though they took on salary and said goodbye to a fan favorite?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Hornqvist will forever be remembered and respected in Pittsburgh as a playoff hero. But at 33, he’s not the same player the Penguins acquired in Rutherford’s first move as general manager. He’s been on the injured reserve six times since 2014, including twice last year, and has at least five documented head injuries. With Kasperi Kapanen and Bryan Rust locked in as the top two right wingers, Hornqvist would have been relegated to a bottom-six role.</p>
<p>Simply put, it does’t make sense to pay a 33-year-old a whopping $5.3 million to be a role player. And it definitely doesn’t make sense to pay a 36-year-old $5.3 million to play a role, which is what would have happened had the Penguins not moved on.</p>
<p>So I like the idea of trying to get Hornqvist’s contract off the books now, while he can still add value to another organization. My hesitation about the trade is the return. The Penguins actually took on about $775,000 by acquiring Matheson ($4.875 million AAV) and Sceviour ($1.2 million).</p>
<p>To me, the entire trade hinges upon the Penguins’ ability to turn Matheson into their latest reclamation project. He was a healthy scratch the final two playoff games in Florida and is signed for six more seasons. The Penguins are banking on the fact that Matheson’s skating ability and playing style fit their game better than it did in Florida. They also believe assistant coach Todd Reirden can help maximize the potential of the first-round pick the same way he has with others, namely Kris Letang.</p>
<p>If it works, the Penguins unloaded Hornqvist’s salary, upgraded the left-side of the blue line, got younger and got much faster. But if it doesn’t? They’re on the hook for six more seasons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m willing to say the jury is still out on this trade. But one thing is for sure: Matheson’s dog, Hank, is a v good boy.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Rich:</strong> What do the Penguins do with all those left-handed defensemen and what do the pairings look like with Matheson on the team?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> With Matheson in the fold, the Penguins have a complete logjam on the left side of the blue line. If you include Pierre-Olivier Joseph, the defensive prospect with the best chance to contribute at the NHL level this season, the Penguins have six left-shot defensemen.</p>
<p>The depth chart is as follows:</p>
<p>• Brian Dumoulin; $4.1 million; signed through 2022-23</p>
<p>• Marcus Pettersson; $4.025 million; signed through 2024-25</p>
<p>• Mike Matheson; $4.875 million; signed through 2025-56</p>
<p>• Jack Johnson $3.25 million; signed through 2022-23</p>
<p>• Juuso Riikola; $1.15 million; signed through 2021-22</p>
<p>• Pierre-Olivier Joseph: $1.075 million at the NHL level; signed through 2021-22</p>
<p>Rutherford initially indicated that Matheson has experience playing his off side. However, in a subsequent interview a few days later with Mark Madden on 105.9 The X, the Penguins general manager said the left side of the blue line will be Dumoulin, Pettersson and Matheson.</p>
<p>Rutherford also said he has no desire to trade Dumoulin or Pettersson.&nbsp;Kris Letang and John Marino are clearly the top two righties. So the only spot up for grabs is the right side of the third pairing.&nbsp;For now, Chad Ruhwedel would appear to be the most likely candidate, unless Johnson or Riikola can beat him out while playing their off side. Rutherford has also noted that Joseph can play his off side, although does that put a rookie in the best possible position to succeed?&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Penguins are currently salary cap compliant and don’t necessarily need to make a move. However, my sense is there’s another shoe that drops eventually to get rid of a lefty, either this offseason or before the deadline.</p>
<p><strong>Vince:&nbsp;</strong>What would it take for the Penguins to buyout Jack Johnson?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>It sounds like Rutherford plans for Matheson to supplant Johnson on the left side of the third pairing. That means Johnson is either playing his off side, sitting in the press box or gone.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar with the process, a team can buyout a player to reduce their salary cap hit and spread it out over a period twice the length of the current contract. There’s a somewhat complicated formula to determine the exact numbers. Luckily, for those of us who got Ds in calculus at Greater Latrobe High School, the <a href="https://www.capfriendly.com/buyout-calculator/jack-johnson" target="_blank">good people at CapFriendly have a calculator</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson, 33, has three years remaining on a deal that carries a $3.25 million average cap hit. In terms of real money, the Penguins would pay Johnson $5.5 million instead of $8.25 million. But I think what most fans care about is what it means on the ice and thus what it means for the salary cap.</p>
<p>Here’s the salary cap hit each year if the Penguins pursue a buyout:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2020-21: $1,166,667</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2021-22: $1,166,667</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2022-23: $1,916,667</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2023-24: $916,667</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2024-25: $916,667</p>
<p>•&nbsp;2025-26: $916,667</p>
<p>Obviously, it isn’t ideal to spend money on a player who isn’t on the roster. But it’s less ideal to spend more money for a player who is in the press box.</p>
<p>A trade is still a more-desirable route to take if the Penguins are in fact ready to move on from Johnson. Here’s a trade I’d propose: Matt Murray and Johnson to the Senators for a second-round pick. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/30/matt-murray-trade-rumors-possible-suitors-penguins-nhl-draft-free-agency/stories/202009300136" target="_blank">The Senators need a goalie</a> and a have an astounding $43-plus million (!) in cap space to take on Johnson’s contract.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Penguins could wait until after next year to consider a buyout. That would mean they’re only absorbing a cap hit for four years instead of six.</p>
<p><strong>Jesse:</strong> Would you do Juuso Riikola to Boston for Connor Clifton? Both around the same age, similar cap, Boston needs a LHD, I think, from their roster makeup? Clifton is another cheap RHD next to Ruhwedel.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Truthfully, I don’t know a ton about Clifton, but your sales pitch sounds pretty good. Have you tried texting Rutherford about this?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Clifton played 31 games for Boston this year and is signed through 2022-23 on a deal that pays him $1 million annually. Riikola played in 36 games this year and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/05/juuso-riikola-penguins-re-sign-2020-nhl-jack-johnson/stories/202009050101" target="_blank">just inked a deal</a> that runs through 2021-22 at $1.15 million annually.</p>
<p>The difference, as far as I can tell, is Clifton played in 26 playoff games over the last two seasons. Riikola didn’t play in any.&nbsp;I’m not sure Boston would go for it. For whatever reason, right-shot defensemen are tougher to find. But I like the idea in theory of trading a position of excess for a position of need.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Lisa:</strong> I guess it is really hard to assess GMJR’s moves until they are completely done, but besides moving Murray and I assume a defenseman, what other player could they possibly move? It seems moving any other player either makes the team worse (Rust), or wouldn’t bring much of a return.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> I’m still curious what happens with Jared McCann. He had been mentioned in trade rumors for a while before <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/18/jaren-mccann-contract-pittsburgh-penguins/stories/202009180147" target="_blank">signing a deal that runs through 2021-22</a> with a $2.94 million average annual value. I can’t get a good feel for if that was intended to keep him in Pittsburgh longer ... or make him a little easier to move.</p>
<p>If the Penguins are still contemplating major shakeups, Bryan Rust and Kris Letang are candidates, I suppose. But I agree with you, it would probably create bigger holes than it would fix. A few weeks back, I <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/09/09/jim-rutherford-penguins-trade-rumors-matt-murray-tristan-jarry-nhl/stories/202009090046" target="_blank">wrote about the tradable assets</a>. (And yes, I’m only partially sharing this to point out I called the Bjugstad and Hornqvist moves).&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Yankees Fan:</strong> Do you think they'll consider bringing back Dan Bylsma if Mike Sullivan doesn't last long next season?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Rekindling an old flame with your ex rarely works. If the Penguins want to move on from Sullivan, I believe they have two good candidates standing next to him on the bench. Reirden has been a head coach the last couple seasons in Washington with great success in the regular season and absolutely none in the playoffs. I think he’ll get another chance to be a head coach again somewhere. Mike Vellucci might also get a shot to be a head coach in this league eventually.</p>
<p>Still, my money is on Sullivan keeping his job the next couple seasons. Yes, the back-to-back postseason flameouts are disappointing. Firing three assistant coaches surely sends a message. But don’t forget Sullivan was a legit contender for the Jack Adams Award. He did a remarkable job with an injury-ravaged team through a huge chunk of the regular season,&nbsp;fixed most of the things that were issues in 2018-19 and then had a third of his forward corps traded before a four-month pause. While the outcome in the playoffs was ultimately the same, he deserves some credit for making changes to the team identity during the regular season not to mention those two Stanley Cups.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sherl:</strong> Based on this tweet [below] about the Cup parade taking on regional flair, what unique parade should the Pens have next time they win?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>They could easily set up food trucks with pierogis. Or better yet, a cookie table. Maybe that’s too cliche. OK, here’s my idea: They announce the parade route a week in advance. Then, let people set up their parking chair days early to reserve a spot.</p>
<p>They essentially do that in my hometown of Latrobe for the Fourth of July. People tie their folding chairs to light posts a week in advance just to be in the best position to get a fistful of Tootsie Rolls thrown into their face from point-blank range. I can only imagine what people would do to save a spot closer to Sid.&nbsp;</p>
