<h1>House guardian for Penn Hills cocaine ringleader gets federal prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A young man who guarded a Penn Hills home at the center of the region's largest cocaine ring is headed to federal prison.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak on Monday sent Chace Johnson, 21, to the lockup for 21 months.</p>
<p>Johnson had pleaded guilty last summer to maintaining a drug-involved premises, which was the home of Jamie Lightfoot Jr. at 146 Harvest Lane in Penn Hills.</p>
<p>Lightfoot has admitted that he was a major cocaine distributor across the region for Don Juan Mendoza of Jacksonville, Fla., who has also pleaded guilty.</p>
<p>Lightfoot's house, tucked away in a secluded part of Penn Hills, was the destination point for massive shipments of cocaine, heroin and marijuana from Los Angeles and Atlanta.</p>
<p>Johnson's job was to stay at the home in August and September 2017 as a kind of house-sitter.</p>
<p>"Johnson lived at the center of the drug organization, guarded the money, and assisted in acquiring supplies for distribution," said Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Lanni in a sentencing memo. "His role is much more significant than that of a mule or courier, because he was given a position of high trust in the organization. He had awareness and participation with the [ring] leaders."</p>
<p>The house was the focus of a federal wiretap investigation of Lightfoot, Mendoza and others that became public in November 2017, when agents and police watched ring members arrive in an RV from California hauling 52 kilos of coke, 85 pounds of pot and an AK-47.</p>
<p>Agents had tracked the RV on its three-day trek to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles, one of several the vehicle made to deliver drugs. Other shipments arrived from Atlanta in a van imprinted with a giant image of Mendoza's wife, a rapper who used the stage name "Sno-Cold."</p>
<p>Johnson, who like Lightfoot is originally from Donora, was among some 40 people indicted in the case.</p>
