<h1>Art Rooney II: NFL collective bargaining agreement 'fair for the players, team and our fans'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers president Art Rooney II said he is excited NFL players voted to accept the collective bargaining agreement approved by league owners that he said is a “win-win” for all parties.</p>
<p>“I believe that is fair for the players, team and our fans,” Rooney said in a statement on Sunday. “It will allow the NFL to continue to grow and provide significant increased benefits to both current and retired players.”</p>
<p>League players voted to ratify the CBA by a vote of 1,019 to 959, which was much closer than anticipated. The agreement needed only a simple majority to pass.</p>
<p>The new CBA, which will guarantee labior peace through the 2030 season, means there will be two extra playoff teams in 2020. However, the increase to a 17-game regular season and a reduction to a three-game preseason, if agreed upon, won’t take place until at least the 2021 season.</p>
<p>“It is great that we can now move forward and allow the focus to remain on our team’s preparations for free agency, the draft and then the 2020 season without any disruptions associated with the absence of a new labor agreement,” Rooney said.</p>
