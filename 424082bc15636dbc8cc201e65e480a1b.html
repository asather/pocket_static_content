<h1>Pet Tales: Local dogs will have their days at Westminster this weekend</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When some of the best purebred dogs in the world compete at the prestigious Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show, I’ll be rooting for a Cavalier King Charles spaniel from Pine, bearded collies from Peters and a golden retriever from Ligonier.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They’re not the only Western Pennsylvania dogs among the 2,594 dogs entered (representing 204 breeds), but they’re the ones I’m watching.&nbsp;The conformation judging is Sunday through Tuesday in New York City.</p>
<p>The top five show dogs in 2019 were a Havanese, whippet, boxer, Welsh terrier and standard poodle, according to <a href="https://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/dn-top-20-dogs" target="_blank">The Dog News Magazine rankings</a>. That makes them the frontrunners for best in show at Westminster.&nbsp;Spoiler alert: the top dogs are often upset by dogs with lower rankings. Here are our local dogs’ 2019 rankings in <a href="https://caninechronicle.com/new-statistics/" target="_blank">The Canine Chronicle</a>:&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mufasa, 3 — Grand Champion KB Pride Scottish Warrior’s The Lion King — is owned by Deborah Mitchum of Pine. He finished fifth on the Cavalier King Charles spaniel list and was ranked No. 69 in the Toy Group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zeus, 5&nbsp; — Grand Champion Dunhill Thunderbolt — is owned and bred by Ray and Kathy Harrington of Peters. He was the No. 1 bearded collie, ranked 12th in the Herding Group and was No. 99 on the all-breed list.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zack, 9&nbsp; — Grand Champion Dunhill Steeler Nation — the father of Zeus, is also owned by the Harringtons. They have entered him in Westminster, but it’s a show-day-decision as to whether the Harringtons will put him in the ring to compete against his son. Zack was sixth in his breed last year and won best in breed at Westminster in 2017.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Daniel, 5 — Grand Champion Hillock’s Jack Daniels — is owned and bred by Tammy Tomlinson of Ligionier. He was the top winning golden retriever in 2018 and 2019. Last year he was No. 21 on the all-breed list and was No. 4 in the sporting group.</p>
<p>The show starts Saturday with agility and obedience competition. Breeds are judged during the day on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp;The group judging is broadcast from 7:30-11 p.m. on FS1 (Fox Sports 1). Monday night is for hounds, toys, non-sporting and herding breeds. Tuesday night is for sporting, working and terrier breeds.</p>
<p>At the end of the show Tuesday night, the seven group winners compete for best in show.</p>
<p>This is the first time at Westminster for&nbsp;Mufasa and his owner, Dr. Mitchum. An obstetrics-gynecology specialist, she now works part-time to breed and compete with Cavaliers.&nbsp;While Dr. Mitchum has competed in the ring with Mufasa, she uses professional handler Tyler Mills of Amissville, Va., at bigger shows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mufasa&nbsp;“is a mamma’s boy,” Dr. Mitchum said with a chuckle. His handler usually makes sure she has a ringside seat because he perks up when he sees her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Dr. Mitchum will travel to New York for the show, her husband, Mark Neely, will stay home with Mufasa’s three 6-week-old puppies, and their mother, Champion North Pointe Make Believe.</p>
<p>The Harringtons, meanwhile, have been breeding bearded collies for 30 years. Though their dogs have won best of breed at Westminster several times, they’ve never placed in the herding group.&nbsp;Their professional handler is Katie Bernardin of Chaplin, Conn.</p>
<p>When they’re not at dog shows, the bearded collies are therapy dogs, visiting schools and libraries. When Ms. Harrington was the principal at Pine-Richland Middle School, she took Zack and her other dogs to work. She still sometimes takes them to work as she teaches education majors at local colleges.</p>
<p>Jack Daniels is retiring after the Westminster show, Mrs. Tomlinson said. He is the best dog she has ever bred, she said, and she’s been breeding and showing since 1971.&nbsp;In 2018 and 2019, he was best in show 19 times, and had 50 first-place wins in the sporting group.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The competition, including the daytime judging of all the breeds, is streaming live on <a href="https://www.westminsterkennelclub.org/tv-schedule" target="_blank">westminsterkennelclub.org</a>, the WKC App and the Fox Sports App.&nbsp;</p>
