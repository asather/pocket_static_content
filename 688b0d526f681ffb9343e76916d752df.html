<h1>Implement USMCA </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It took nearly three years to negotiate a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement, so a Mexican auto group’s request to delay implementation of the rules of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement should be approached cautiously.</p>
<p>The group, AMIA, has urged authorities to postpone until January 2021 the rules of origin requirements in the USMCA, which now are to take effect July 1. The group contends that the current deadline does not provide enough time to adapt automotive supply chains.</p>
<p>The USMCA requires 75% of vehicle components be made in North America and 40-45% of the manufacturing of the vehicles be done at factories that pay workers at least $16 an hour. By comparison, NAFTA had a lower North American content threshold and had limited wage requirements.</p>
<p>The wage provision in the new pact means either more components or assembly of vehicles will need to be done in the United States or Canada, which have higher wages, or Mexican auto worker pay likely will need to be increased to comply.</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of vehicles sold in the United States each year have components made in Mexican factories, and many vehicles sold in the United States are assembled in Mexico. So the provisions in the new trade agreement likely will reshape where vehicle components are made and possibly where final assembly is done.</p>
<p>The Mexican auto trade group contends that there needs to be more clarity in the USMCA content rules. If that is the case, that needs to be tackled quickly.</p>
<p>This issue crops up as much of the North American auto industry is shut down because of the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Most U.S. auto plants were shut in the past several weeks, and production has been trimmed at some Mexican auto plants.</p>
<p>While the virus may complicate progress in detailing the content rules, it shouldn’t halt discussions to spell out and reach those terms. A three-month delay, until Oct. 1, should be sufficient to complete the task and get supply-chain plans in place. But waiting until 2021 should be rejected by the United States.</p>
<p>The new trade deal is to be phased in over the next four years, but automakers have to certify compliance with the initial requirements when the agreement takes effect. And that should happen this year, not next year, to provide important protections soon for the auto industry in Ohio, Michigan and nationwide.</p>
