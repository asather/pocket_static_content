<h1>Allegheny County reports 100 new cases of COVID-19 and 2 new deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County tops 11,000 cases of COVID-19 with 100 new cases and two new deaths reported for Friday.</p>
<p>The 100 additional cases come from 1,134 tests that were taken between Aug. 24 and Sept. 10.</p>
<p>The number of tests taken has not been over 1,000 tests since Sept. 4.</p>
<p>Those who have recently tested positive range in age from four months to 94 years old, with a median age of 21.</p>
<p>With the addition of Friday’s cases, the county has had a total of 11,069 cases since the beginning of the pandemic in mid-March.</p>
<p>The two new deaths were both associated with a long-term care facility, according to the county health department.</p>
<p>The deaths occurred among individuals in their 80s and happened on Aug. 23 and Aug. 31. Allegheny County has had 360 COVID-19 related deaths since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania reported an increase of 1,008 cases for Friday. Sept. 3 was the last time the state had an increase of over 1,000 cases for a single day. There have now been 142,885 cases of COVID-19 across the commonwealth.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania reported 225 of the state’s newest cases. Allegheny had the highest increase in the region, followed by Beaver County with 26 new cases.</p>
<p>The state health department also reported 17 new deaths, bringing the state death toll to 7,837.</p>
<p>In a press conference Friday morning, Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine noted an increase in cases among the age group 19 to 24 years old and attributed the increase predominantly to students at colleges and universities.</p>
<p>“We have seen some young people that are congregating at parties or other types of activities and not necessarily wearing a mask, and not social distancing and that is contributing to the spread,” she said. “We want to work with the young people. We want to empower the young people … to make the right decision.”</p>
<p>Dr. Levine also noted that it would be about two more weeks before case counts show the effects of the Labor Day weekend.</p>
<p>Because of the 250 person outdoor gathering limit, there will be no fans at the Steelers or Eagles home games, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>For fans to return to stadiums Dr. Levine said that the state would have to see a “substantial reduction” in the amount of community spread across the state, to even consider changing the outdoor gathering capacity.</p>
