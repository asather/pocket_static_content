<h1>One month into 'non-essential' business closure, state unemployment nears 1.5 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One month after Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all non-essential businesses to close, the number of Pennsylvanians applying for unemployment benefits is fast approaching the 1.5 million mark.</p>
<p>Not only are thousands of Pennsylvanians in the system who have never used it before, but they're landing there as lawmakers and experts debate whether stimulus programs have offered enough aid to help people get through the pandemic and whether governments can afford what they've promised.</p>
<p>Some argue that new $600 federal checks arriving in addition to the traditional state unemployment benefits make the pot too sweet, while others say that might keep low-income workers afloat.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Pennsylvania officials are hoping to get the state’s system ready for gig workers and others who previously were not eligible for unemployment checks to be able to apply as early as this weekend.</p>
<p>The 152,521 claims filed this week through Thursday makes a total of 1,459,371 applications since the governor’s March 16 statewide “non-essential business” closure order. Before the outbreak, the highest number the state had seen&nbsp;was 61,181 in January 2010.</p>
<p>On the other side of that equation is the 707 COVID-19 deaths statewide as of Thursday and 27,735 positive COVID-19 cases —&nbsp;with every county in the Commonwealth now touched by the scourge.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania, like every other state, is grappling with the imperative to bring a highly contagious and deadly virus under control and somehow accomplish that without inflicting lasting damage to the economy.</p>
<p>Caught in the middle are the million-plus unemployed Pennsylvanians, some of whom have now gone a month or longer without a paycheck.</p>

Tom Wolf shuttered nonessential businesses on March 16.</span> <span style="font-size: 14px; line-height: 20px; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-weight: bold; display: block; margin-bottom: 8px; color: #444444;">Daily first-time claims March 15-April 16 in thousands:</span></p>
<p>Government programs, both at the state and federal level, are trying to help.</p>
<p>The latest aid comes courtesy of the Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program in the form of $600 weekly checks.</p>
<p>The federal checks will be paid in addition to beneficiaries’ regular unemployment benefit from the week ending April 4 through July 25. For those eligible, payments will be backdated to the week ending April 4 and paid in a lump sum.</p>
<p>Basic Pennsylvania unemployment payments typically will be about 50% of the person’s average weekly wage, up to around $570.</p>
<p>The federal program has prompted debate about whether it’s too generous, with U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, suggesting earlier this month that the federal aid “can provide many hourly employees a 50% or more increase in wages if they choose unemployment instead of staying on payrolls.” Some have estimated the combined aid payments could amount to $24 an hour.</p>
<p>Currently, Pennsylvania’s minimum wage is $7.25 an hour while retailers such as Target and Sheetz have adopted higher minimum wages. Many retailers are offering bonus pay as the pandemic creates surges in customer demand and strains their workforces.</p>
<p>Marc Stier, director of the Harrisburg-based Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, said Friday that it’s not known how many people will see more money coming in than when they were working —&nbsp;and he suggested that shouldn’t matter.</p>
<p>“That is further evidence that the burden of the fight against COVID-19 has fallen the hardest on Pennsylvanians with low-incomes,” he wrote in an email.</p>
<p>“Anything we can do to help them will not only ensure that suffering from this crisis is fairly shared but also will speed the recovery of our economy as the crisis abates.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the state level, Gov. Wolf has broadened unemployment compensation eligibility criteria to include gig workers, independent contractors, the self-employed and workers with limited work history.</p>
<p>In addition, the Wolf administration has suspended some unemployment laws so workers will be eligible for benefits in their first week of unemployment and dropped the requirement that applicants show that they’re looking for new jobs.</p>
<p>A spokesman with the Pennsylvania’s Department of Labor and Industry said Friday that the state hopes to have the system ready this weekend to <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/Pages/default.aspx" target="_blank">take applications</a> from the gig workers and others who previously did not qualify, with payments made to qualifying applicants two to four weeks after the claim is filed.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>At least one advocacy group is raising concerns that states such as Pennsylvania are overstretching their resources.</p>
<p>Jared Walczak, director of state tax policy at the Tax Foundation think tank in Washington, D.C. says Pennsylvania’s state unemployment compensation trust fund, which covers unemployment insurance program costs, is “woefully underfunded.”</p>
<p>While the federal government is supplementing unemployment compensation in various ways such as the $600 weekly checks, he wrote in an email this week, “none of them provide Pennsylvania or any other state with money to meet its own obligation to provide 26 weeks of regular benefits to each beneficiary.”</p>
<p>According to the foundation’s website, Pennsylvania had only enough funds to cover 11 of the required 26 weeks of benefits it’s required to provide beneficiaries as of April 4.</p>
<p>A state Department of Labor &amp; Industry spokesman on Friday said in an email, “The administration is monitoring the unemployment compensation fund balance. We are paying all UC benefits that are owed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Walczak expects that, once the fund is depleted, the state will take advances from the federal unemployment account.</p>
<p>“These are essentially federal loans which must be repaid (with interest after the end of the year), and they result in federal tax unemployment insurance tax increases on Pennsylvania businesses if there is an outstanding balance after two years,” he wrote.</p>
<p>“Gov. Wolf has expressed the hope that the federal government will bail out Pennsylvania's woefully underfunded unemployment compensation system, but nothing in the relief packages already enacted would do so.” The governor has said previously the state faces a&nbsp;projected deficit of $4.5-$5 billion.</p>
