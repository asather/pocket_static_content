<p>WASHINGTON — Ten days after testing positive for COVID-19, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, said he feels he has “turned a corner” and is optimistic he will be mostly recovered by the end of the week.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, in an phone interview on Monday from his home in home in Butler, said he was grateful to have the support of family and friends during his illness. The 71-year-old lawmaker, who has represented northwestern Pennsylvania since 2011, described experiencing strong flu-like symptoms.</p>
<p>“The big thing was just getting through the early parts of it, where [I had] no appetite, loss of taste, extreme muscle cramping in my neck and back” and chills, Mr. Kelly said.&nbsp;“It knocks you out.”</p>
<p>His doctor prescribed an antibiotic called azithromycin — often referred to as a Z-Pak — and Mr. Kelly said he has avoided respiratory symptoms common with cases of COVID-19, he said.&nbsp;Toward the end of last week, his appetite returned and he feels much better, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, who is diabetic, is one of six members of Congress who have tested positive.</p>
<p>He said his office has been working remotely to address the flood of constituent questions surrounding the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/05/A-burning-question-after-a-2-2-trillion-package-Is-it-enough-for-Pittsburgh/stories/202004010005" target="_blank">$2.3 trillion federal rescue package</a> passed two weeks ago.&nbsp;The package included small business loans, direct cash payments to most Americans and an expansion of unemployment benefits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Though his illness prevented him from attending the vote on Capitol Hill, Mr. Kelly supported the measure in a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We haven’t missed a beat” in helping people sift through the federal aid. “Our people have been available and easily accessible.”</p>
<p>Congress, which has largely fled Washington amid the pandemic lockdown, is already debating details of further COVID-19 legislation, which House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has suggested will focus on economic “recovery,” aiding the economy through the spring and summer.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said he has not heard of any challenges from health care providers in his district in getting the medical supplies and space to handle COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>In mid-March, Mr. Kelly said he had a conference call with more health providers in his district to assess their contingency plans with the dual challenges of a postponement of elective surgeries — a key revenue driver at hospitals — and a surge in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>“They all felt at that time they were all confident about where they were, they were equipped to handle what they were expecting,” Mr. Kelly said. “I don’t think we’ve had anybody since that time get back with us and say, ‘We need ventilators, we need masks, we need personal protective equipment.’”</p>
<p>“We haven’t had those calls,” he said. “We monitor and make sure we stay in touch with all those folks.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said the central challenge was ensuring all Americans follow the federal guidelines and take prevention measures seriously. That means social distancing and staying inside as much as possible — even keeping away from worship services and large gatherings during Easter.</p>
<p>And he urged anyone experiencing symptoms to get a COVID-19 test right away. He said he believed at first that he had the common flu, but his wife thought he should get tested. After a trip to his doctor, and then to Butler Memorial Hospital, his test came back <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/03/27/U-S-Rep-Mike-Kelly-butler-county-republican-tests-positive-COVID-19-pa/stories/202003270124?cid=search" target="_blank">positive for COVID-19 on March 27</a>.</p>
<p>“Get the test done as soon as you can,” Mr. Kelly said.&nbsp;“The biggest concern right now is: Let’s make sure we don’t pass this on to any of our friend relatives or neighbors. Let’s make sure we contain this as much as we possibly can.”</p>
<p>“The more data we collect the more we understand about this,” he said.</p>
