<h1>Hand-offs, not handcuffs: National program for nonviolent criminals may soon be coming to Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jailing people for crimes driven by addiction, poverty and mental illness usually makes those problems worse, according to proponents of law enforcement assisted diversion, or LEAD, a process which is spreading nationally and may be coming soon to Pittsburgh and some suburbs.</p>
<p>LEAD asks police to hand off people believed to be committing certain nonviolent crimes — drug possession, prostitution, petty theft -— to a social services coordinator, instead of to jail. It is being piloted in a limited way in the North Side, and funding from the Allegheny County Health Department is helping the city and a consortium of neighboring suburbs to expand it.</p>
<p>On Jan. 27, a local team will travel to Seattle, the birthplace of LEAD, for training. They’ll then continue building a coalition that’s going to have to include police, social service agencies, prosecutors, public defenders, judges, probation officers and community groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Everybody seems to be ready for some systemic change,”&nbsp;said Jody Raeford, executive director of Foundation of HOPE, a Central North Side nonprofit that has been working with the city’s Zone 1 police on diverting low-level offenders since 2017.&nbsp;The reason for that readiness: “We recognize that what we’re doing is not working.”</p>
<p>In 2018, Allegheny County’s court system sentenced 217 people to jail or prison for drug-related misdemeanors, and another 2,140 to probation.&nbsp;Another 158 people were sentenced to jail or prison for misdemeanors against property, and 1,132 were put on probation for those crimes.&nbsp;LEAD advocates say that’s costly and ineffective.</p>
<p>“If somebody steals a sandwich, don’t put them in jail for stealing a sandwich,” said JoEllen Marsh, a consultant on LEAD to the Congress of Neighboring Communities, or CONNECT, which is pitching the concept to the city’s neighbors.&nbsp;“Just give them a sandwich.”</p>
<p><strong>Pizza, planning and fewer ODs</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 9, Mr. Raeford and Foundation of HOPE’s diversion director, Jeff Williams, were ordering pizzas for police in Zone 1, Zone 2 and the substation in Northview Heights. It was their way of celebrating Law Enforcement Appreciation Day, and thanking police for embracing diversion.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is, diversion doesn’t work unless we have police buy-in,” said Mr. Raeford.&nbsp;“We are very fortunate that Pittsburgh law enforcement is ready for this.”</p>
<p>His agency, backed by several foundations, <a title="LEAD story by Bradbury" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/07/20/juvenile-probation-diversion-program-north-side-pittsburgh-allegheny-county-foundation-of-hope/stories/201907200014?cid=search" target="_blank">works with people ages 12-26 who police have arrested</a> for low-level crimes like theft, drug possession or trespassing, or who seem to be on a risky path. Those charged with crimes see their cases put on hold, and then dropped if they stick with the program of counseling and community service.</p>
<p>The effort was in its infancy when Cmdr. Christopher Ragland took the helm of Zone 1. After consulting carefully with others in the justice system, he pitched the program at roll calls.</p>
<p>“There were a few skeptics,” among the rank and file, Cmdr. Ragland said, but there were also officers who seized the opportunity to put young people on course, rather than in a punitive system.</p>
<p>“We never have the time, training or expertise to find out the root of the [offender’s] problem and be able to refer them to the appropriate agency,” he said. If officers are trained, motivated, and provided with&nbsp;“a streamlined process” that emphasizes rehabilitation over punishment, many of them will choose that route, he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Raeford said his agency expects to be at the center of the expanding diversion effort, which initially will focus on misbehavior related to the opioid epidemic.</p>
<p>As part of its response to the opioid crisis, the Health Department this year dedicated $650,000 from a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention grant to the expansion of LEAD in the city (which is getting $400,000) and the suburbs (for which CONNECT is getting $250,000).</p>
<p>“Year One is definitely a planning phase,” said&nbsp;Otis Pitts, the department’s&nbsp;deputy director of public policy and community relations, who will join Mr. Williams, Ms. Marsh and others for training in Seattle.</p>
<p>Short-term, he’ll be watching for rollout of a LEAD effort citywide and for discussions in five or 10 suburbs. The end goal?&nbsp;“Long term, fewer overdoses.”</p>
<p><strong>What LEAD needs</strong></p>
<p>LEAD was born in Seattle in 2011, as some in the justice system sought an alternative to the crack-era approach to the War on Drugs, which focused on punishment and most often targeted minorities.</p>
<p>“We have a big problem, and if we approach it in the way that drug use has been approached in this country for the last several decades, we’re not going to get a handle on it. We’re going to make it worse,” said&nbsp;Lisa Daugaard, director of the Public Defender Association, which houses the LEAD National Support Bureau, in Seattle.</p>
<p>Today, cities, counties and states are embracing LEAD at a record pace. Some 90 people from 15 jurisdictions are expected for her bureau’s training session late this month.</p>
<p>LEAD done well, she said, means:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>‘Everyone ... wants this to happen’</strong></p>
<p>In December, CONNECT pulled together municipal leaders, shared a report on diversion and made an initial pitch for suburban LEADers.</p>
<p>“Everyone we talked to wants this to happen,” said Ms. Marsh.</p>
<p>“I’ve already bought into the program,” said Richard Bosco, chief of police in Lincoln.</p>
<p>Now, he said, police are&nbsp;“forced to criminally charge, and then we work out all the remediation we can through the magistrate court system.” That’s a clunky process.&nbsp;“If we can push those people down a path to success it’s much more beneficial than throwing them in jail for 24 or 48 hours. That never corrects anything. Quite the contrary.”</p>
<p>“We aren’t looking to put everybody in jail,” said&nbsp;Etna police Chief Tim Rodman. But when officers try to hand people off to, say, a psychiatric hospital,&nbsp;“within an hour, they’re being released,” he said. “We’re doing paperwork and they’re beating us home.”</p>
<p>He’d like to see a social worker on call for hand-offs, or stationed at a regional drop-off spot shared by multiple departments.</p>
<p>There are 109 police departments in Allegheny County, with <a title="Patchwork Policing" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/allegheny-county-police-departments-inequality-budgets/" target="_blank">vastly different resources, leadership and training</a>. And while LEAD can be tailored to the needs of individual communities, it could also be a catalyst for cooperation between departments and&nbsp;a way to&nbsp;“make these boundaries seem less,” said&nbsp;Lydia Morin, executive director of CONNECT.</p>
<p>LEAD already has a big backer in Attorney General Josh Shapiro, whose office has worked with Somerset and Carbon counties to set up diversion programs.</p>
<p>“It didn’t take a lot to sell Somerset County law enforcement on the idea,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Somerset Borough Police Chief Randy Cox.</p>
<p>The county’s program, launched in 2018, has police handing people with addiction-related problems directly to recovery specialists, or&nbsp;transporting them directly to the&nbsp;Twin Lakes Center drug and alcohol rehabilitation facility in Somerset Township. Compared to the four-plus hours of bureaucracy and then court time associated with an arrest, the social services hand-off takes the officer off of the beat for around an hour, said Chief Cox.</p>
<p>So far, though, officers have made just a few handfuls of diversions. The county is about to relaunch the program, said Erin Howsare, director of the&nbsp;Somerset Single County Authority for Drug and Alcohol.&nbsp;“We are going to have a consultant go and train every police department to bring it back to the front of their minds,” and do some advertising, she said.</p>
<p>It makes sense to pitch LEAD to the medical community, too, said&nbsp;Mary Hawk, an associate professor of behavioral and community health sciences at the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health. Medical professionals, after all, see a lot of people with substance abuse problems, and don’t always know how to get them help.</p>
<p>“These are people we love, right?” she said.&nbsp;“We all want the people we love to have opportunities to thrive.”</p>
