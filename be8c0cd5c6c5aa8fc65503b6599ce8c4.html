<h1>Tree of Life evoked a 'collective compassion.' Now a Pittsburgh group uses faith to help others facing trauma.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was an unusual Bible study, from the interfaith group of participants to the opening words:</p>
<p>“With your permission, I'd like to invite us into a moment of trauma,” Rabbi Ron Symons told the group of about a dozen gathered around the table&nbsp;—&nbsp;pastors, chaplains and laypersons representing a range of religious traditions including Buddhist, Christian, Hindu, Jewish and Unitarian Universalist.</p>
<p>With that, Rabbi Symons read aloud a story from the book of Leviticus, which the Jews and Christians at the table consider part of Scripture and the others respect as an ancient spiritual text.</p>
<p>The passage was not one many were familiar with: One in which two sons of the priest Aaron are struck dead after they offer “alien fire” to God.</p>
<p>The Israelite leader Moses, brother of Aaron, then told his brother:&nbsp;“This is what the Lord meant when He said,&nbsp;‘Through those near to Me I show Myself holy, and gain glory before all the people.’ And Aaron was silent.”</p>
<p>More than one of those around the table had the same thought, that even if one accepts Moses’ words as technically accurate, his bedside manner seemed lacking.</p>
<p>“Moses needs a couple units of CPE,” said one, referring to the clinical pastoral education courses used to train chaplains and other clergy in how to deal with hospital patients, grieving relatives and other people going through the worst moments of their lives.</p>
<p>At least one voice at the table, however, saw Moses as trying to find a greater good amid tragedy, and Rabbi Symons recounted the long history of Talmudic scholars who tried to make sense out of this ancient, shocking tragedy.</p>
<p>It’s in response to modern, shocking tragedies — the Oct. 27, 2018, massacre at the Tree of Life synagogue in Squirrel Hill and the cumulative effects of other gun violence in Allegheny County — that the group was seated at the table at the Center for Victims.</p>
<p>The South Side Flats-based organization, which provides comprehensive services to crime victims, is working in&nbsp;partnership with two other organizations: the&nbsp;Center for Loving Kindness, which Rabbi Symons directs at the Jewish Community Center of Greater Pittsburgh, and Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, which fosters cooperation across church denominations.</p>
<p>The three organizations have been hosting a series of gatherings such as this. Interfaith groups meet over a light meal, introduce themselves to each other and hold a trauma-informed discussion of a sacred text.</p>
<p>Then they go on a tour of a thorough exhibit at the Center for Victims on the ways that trauma&nbsp;— whether the experience of a single horrific crime or of living for years in an abusive home&nbsp;— affects individuals physically, mentally and emotionally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Center for Loving Kindness and Christian Associates already had been holding dialogues on violence, racism and other acute issues before the “10/27” attack took place at Tree of Life. The attack, killing 11 from three Jewish congregations, was the deadliest anti-Semitic episode in U.S. history and drew an international outpouring of grief and solidarity.</p>
<p>“The entire world sat shiva” for the victims, recalled Rabbi Symons, referring to the Jewish mourning ritual. But that raised questions from some about the lack of a similar response to those “regularly experiencing violence,” particularly those living in predominately African-American neighborhoods facing high levels of gun crimes.</p>
<p>The new program “is building bridges,” said&nbsp;Geraldine Massey, a counselor at Center for Victims, who lost two sons to gun violence.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our traumas might not be the same,” she said, but it’s a way to&nbsp;learn about and&nbsp;“acknowledge each other’s trauma. That’s one of the reasons I”m so passionate about being at the table.&nbsp;It’s important to me as a black mother who lost two sons. We’ve got to let people know they matter.”</p>
<p>The Rev. Liddy Barlow, executive minister of Christian Associates, said the program builds on her organization’s emphasis on dialogue.&nbsp;“We think good things happen when people who work in the sphere of spiritual leadership are better connected to one another,” she said. And the Center for Victims&nbsp;“brings a very unique kind of expertise to the table.”</p>
<p>The Center for Victims also is embracing the chance to work with spiritual leaders, said the Rev. Darnell Drewery, its community outreach and intervention specialist, who led the visitors on a guided tour of the center’s exhibit on trauma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exhibits at the center include “Your Body on Stress,” showing the ailments from unhealed traumas, and “The Amygdala Hijack,” in which a person’s ordinary interactions with others are overtaken by the human flight-or-fight reflex when something triggers a traumatic memory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The tour also included discussions of paths to healing such as counseling and meditation.</p>
<p>It’s important for faith leaders to know this, said the Rev. Martin Rafanan,&nbsp;a supply pastor for Pittsburgh Lutheran United Ministries.</p>
<p>“We are particularly blessed as religious people to have access to people's root stories,” he said. “They give us their root stories, and they give them to very few people.”</p>
<p>Having people entrust them with their stories&nbsp;“allows us to use this information around trauma-informed care even more effectively,” he said.</p>
<p>Rev. Drewery, who is also chaplain with South Pittsburgh Peacemakers, said that learning someone’s story is a lot more effective than asking,&nbsp;“What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>People will usually reply,&nbsp;“Nothing,” he said, and he agrees.</p>
<p>“There's nothing wrong with them,” he said. Instead he asks,&nbsp;“What happened to you?”</p>
<p>“The question changes the energy in the room,” he said. “The question changes the relationship.”</p>
<p>Such discussions struck a chord with Som Sharma, a Hindu and executive director of the Monroeville-based group AHINSA, which draws inspiration from the non-violent practices of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>“When trauma happens in a community, like Oct. 27, it immediately looks so horrible, so bad for the community,” he said. But it also brought out a “collective compassion,” he said.</p>
