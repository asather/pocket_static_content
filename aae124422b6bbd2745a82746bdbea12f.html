<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 03.04.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok kids, we’re closing in on our tee time so get your questions ready (if you haven’t already).... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, let’s get our chat started...go!!</p>
<p><strong>Quinn</strong>: Good morning, Mr. Dulac, and thanks as always for taking the time. Anyone from the combine stand out as one the Steelers might have a strong interest in at #49 ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Let me preface your question by saying the Steelers do not use the combine to find workout warriors or change their opinions they already have formed about certain players. But I will say I was impressed w how fast Jonathan Taylor ran for a big guy.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Hi Gerry! Now that the football in undies show has ended, has your opinion of who the Steelers should select at 49 changed at all??? I would love Taylor but after his showing, I don’t think he will be there when it’s time to turn in the draft card... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No, my opinion is the same....they need a skill player and they should have plenty to choose from. As for Taylor, yes, his speed (4.39) for a big man was very impressive, which makes him more attractive, but the concern with him is the size of the workload he had in college. He averaged over 300 carries a season for three years at Wisconsin. That’s a lot of pounding before he even gets pounded some more in the NFL.</p>
<p><strong>Mike J.</strong>: Do the Steelers plan on keeping Mike Hilton? He is a good young player for that defense. Would be a shame if he was let go due to lack of cap space <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Every year they face that question and every year Hilton makes it difficult to release him. The problem is they think he is a liability in pass coverage because of his size. But, for a smaller guy, he sure is tough along the line of scrimmage.</p>
<p><strong>Shon</strong>: Are the steelers seriously considering a rb early? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s not off their radar, if that’s what you’re asking.</p>
<p><strong>Big IF</strong>: If we’re active in FA do you see us being active in the draft. Trading out of a spot or two to get more picks? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They really don’t have a lot of leverage to trade out of a spot, let alone two. The only way they are going to pick up a low round pick (6th or 7th) is by trading someone they are willing to discard, and who would that be? Burns? Chickillo? Foster perhaps?</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: I think the Steelers will wait until cuts in August/Sept. to fill many back up / depth positions. Would it only take a second or third round pick in next years draft to jump back into first round or do you think more. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Trust me, that will not be enough. The only way they are getting a No. 1 is by trading away a future No. 1, and once in the past 50-some years is enough. Or by trading Ben, JuJu, Heyward, Watt, Bush, Minkah....</p>
<p><strong>Kool Aid Man</strong>: Ohhhhh Yeahhh! Gerry, you’re great at feeding yinzers delusional thoughts. Besides Austin Hooper, who else will the Steelers sign? Derrick Henry? Amari Cooper? The Steelers are “the best” at working the cap. Surely they can easily sign whoever they want. Let’s kick these rumors up a notch! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Here’s a better delusional thought....try again and see what happens.</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Cam Akers, Jalen Reagor, Chase Claypool, Adam Trautman are all available at 49. What name are you putting on the draft card??? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good choices....Reagor. Easy one.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas ONeal from Avon NC</strong>: With the Steelers having cap issues do you think they will restructure Big Ben’s contract and also release Mark Barron Anthony C. and Ramon Foster to make cap room? Also I think our biggest need is offensive guard or left tackle because Big Al got beat so bad last year so many times. Thank you Gerry for your time. Have a great day <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Do not fret, they will find ways to handle the cap, they always do. Guys like Chickillo and maybe Foster will be let go. Don’t hold your breath on Barron. He plays nearly twice as many snaps as Vince Williams. And it’s not like they have a backup who is ready to step in and replace him.</p>

<p><strong>Mike in BP</strong>: Did you ever get the chance to go to Bay Hill for the Arnold Palmer Invitational or has draft and free agent coverage always gotten in the way? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Years ago I did. But I have played Bay Hill recently, which is even better.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: . If the Steelers use the non-exclusive franchise tag on Dupree they would receive two first round picks if a team made Dupree an offer that the Steelers didn’t match. Ihow much that tag would cost the Steelers as opposed to the exclusive tag. Gerry, thank you for answering my question. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Here’s what I can tell you and you do the math: An exclusive tag requires a team to pay the average salary of the top 5 players at his position from the current league, or 120 percent of his previous year’s salary, whichever is greater. The non-exclusive tag requires the team to pay the average of the top 5 salary-cap hits at his position from the previous five years, or 120 percent of his previous year’s salary, which is greater.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Ok, would it be crazy to think that team doesn’t tag or resign Bud and go after Clowney instead? He has the experience and track record - is a better 1 year option (see Seattle) and may be the same price. That way we could still have the money for Watt’s mega contract, and Clowney with his experience, could help bring up/teach Ola or Skipper. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes that would be crazy. And let’s go easy on the Ola and Skipper thing. That ain’t happening, certainly not right now.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph</strong>: Do you think all this optimism displayed by Cobert will get it done this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It his nature to be optimistic, as it is withn most GMs in all sports. Kinda of like spring training in baseball....everyone looks good and is filled w great hopes. Not saying he’s wrong, just saying it’s human nature.</p>
<p><strong>Utah Jim</strong>: Have the players started voting on the CBA yet? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s possible. But I think the process is going to take a couple weeks at least</p>
<p><strong>Ted Knight</strong>: Do you see any chance the Steelers take TWO receivers in this draft? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not with only 5 picks (or even six).</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: If the team has no plans of signing Dupree long term why would they use the franchise tag and not the transition tag? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Because they want to make sure they keep him and not allow for any outside suitors</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Do you hold the same optimism the FO has for McDonald and Conner??? I have major concerns about their durability to last a full season and I am not confident in their back ups especially at TE. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I do not because their history suggests otherwise. It’s going to be a big decision for the Steelers because Conner is up after this season.</p>
<p><strong>SteelersFanInGA</strong>: I felt optimistic about Diontae Johnson and James Washington at the end of last season, especially given the uneven QB play. Is drafting a WR early waving the white flag on one of them too soon? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not at all. The Steelers need playmakers who can score TDs. That became apparent last season. You can’t expect to lose two of the league’s best players -- 84 and 26 -- and think you’re going to replace their production just like that. I will remind you: The Steelers were the only team in the league to not score 30 points at least once in 2019. Now that is futility.</p>
<p><strong>Barbarian</strong>: Gerry if any of these are available we have to take it at @49 regardless of position: RB Taylor, WR Claypool and Yes Safety Winfield Jr (stud) and maybe even G/C Ruiz.. must go BPA if someone as talented falls no matter if it’s defense.. Right? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s your opinion, so....no.</p>
<p><strong>Pos</strong>: Do you think there is any buyer’s remorse from the Steelers with Gentry? I know it’s been only one year but seems he was kicked to the curb quickly. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. For starters, he was a fifth-round pick, not a first- or second-rounder. Second, according to Kevin Colbert, the Steelers think he has progressed nicely and can be an NFL-caliber TE. We shall see, but there is no remorse whatsoever.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>DennyNevo</strong>: If the CBA passes and the 30% rule goes away, will it be after the Steelers have to make decisions on cutting players for cap room. vs reducing high priced vets caps? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Mike89</strong>: Do you know if the Steelers would consider bringing in XFL TE Donald Parham? Fast, productive (In XFL) and 6’8”. Seems like a good project to take on. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I was asked that question last week too. They could. They scout that league for players so it’s possible</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: How much does Nix make to not play? Will he be a cap casualty this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nix is scheduled to earn $1.45 million this season and count nearly $1.9 million against the cap. My guess is he will be back.</p>
<p><strong>River Rat</strong>: You may have been asked this 100 times, but if we let Dupree go, can we not get better value in the Free agency for the $16 million? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Make that 101....and no.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: What positions to you think will get addressed in FA &amp; then what positions / order do you see for each draft position! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think they will try to address tight end in free agency and thereby eliminating that position for the draft. And I don’t think there will be a tight end in the draft who will have a higher grade on any wide receiver or running back who will be available at No. 49.</p>
<p><strong>DaquidoBazzini</strong>: Any thoughts on Antonio Gibson? Saw him as a RB in the Senior Bowl and he looked good. Could be a good combination of RB and WR for the Steelers. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Sorry, I don’t because I haven’t looked at him and haven’t inquired about him. But I’ll check.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie in florida</strong>: Any chance of getting Landry Jones for back up if he plays better for Dallas of XFL <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They have a backup -- Mason Rudolph. And...no.</p>
<p><strong>Louis</strong>: Ok gerry, so Ed and Ray are Steelers reporters not Steelers fans.. what are You ? Give us some hope! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is hope.....They are reporters too, despite your assessment.</p>
<p><strong>MTScott</strong>: Who’s your early favorite for Augusta this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Patrick Reed, write it down.</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Good Morning Gerry, Lots of discussion of Baron being let go. Thoughts on ILB if that really happens? Doesn’t seem we have much to fill that void. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Exactly right, which is why I wouldn’t count on it.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: dumb question but how do draft picks and salaries work? First round gets x, second round y, so on? or is there a range? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is a limit/range and typically it trickles down from the first pick on down</p>
<p><strong>rambler66</strong>: How likely is it that any draft pick by the Steelers this year is going to have much of an impact in this coming season. Seems like mostly the Steelers will have to win or lose with what they already have for the 2020 season does it not? Especially since they have no 1st round pick. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think that is probably a good assessment, but it depends on which player is taken in the second round. A playmaking WR (like KJ Hamler) could have an impact. A RB like Jonathan Taylor could have an impact. But it’s not like any WR or RB is going to come in and make a huge impact immediately. At least you wouldn’t think.</p>
<p><strong>Nate</strong>: Hi Gerry, thanks for the chats! Besides DT to replace Hargrave, do you think Steelers should draft edge rusher, too? Or should it just be all offensive players? Thanks! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, they are never going to turn a blind eye to a good edge rusher. But I have thought all along the first defensive player they should draft is a defensive lineman, even if they keep Hargrave. They need depth for their rotation and they need a young defensive lineman to help w that and develop.</p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Ben is 38 and we all would like number 7. Why not offer a big hometown discount to sign some valued FA or 2? How many millions can one spend in a lifetime <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Would you take a hometown discount on what you’re worth??</p>
<p><strong>ASIANGOLFERMAN</strong>: Going to give me those 7 strokes? You headed to Augusta this year?When will the cuts start happening? Will the Steelers consider franchising Dupree then trade? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. Soon. And they won’t.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas ONeal</strong>: Do you think Mason R, will be Big Bens Replacement not rushing BIg Ben but at some point we gotta look into another option. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think the Steelers are ready to say “yes,” but I don’t think they are prepared to say “no,” either. The Steelers can win with Mason Rudolph. Will he be BR? Probably not. But he was 5-3 as a starter last year. Project that to 16 games and that’s 10-6. Better than the past 2 years.</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - what was your 40 time last week? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 4.February</p>
<p><strong>DJPAULHOWARD</strong>: Wait...... we NEVER SCORED 30 POINTS IN A GAME LAST SEASON?????? Goodness that’s not good!!! A far cry from the Killer B’s days that’s for sure.We really missed Ben that much? so my question then is what do we do with the back up QB spot. Mason showed no signs of being capable IMO and I doubt we draft one or find one in FA. Is Canada going to be able to get Mason coached up in the event he is called upon or will we find a more capable back up in FA..... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: If you are just realizing this you are not paying attention.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas ONeal</strong>: What are your thoughts on Zach Moss Utah RB, I really like him seems like a 3 down back. Also in the draft with the WR I like Justin Jefferson out of LSU. Also dont know how deep this draft class is on OL but we need a replacement when we let Foster go. BTW REPLACE EDMUNDS. I know your gonna say with who but I wanna see Marcus Allen. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I like Moss and I really like Jefferson among others. Edmunds is fine. Relax.</p>
<p><strong>Steelphilly</strong>: I see the comments by Colbert as a challenge to Ben to come back in top shape and take nothing for granted. What are your thoughts. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ben has come to camp in great shape every year for the past 3-4-5 years. He will do the same this year, too. Stop worrying. He’s a big man. It’s not like he’s a 210-pounder who ballooned to 250. Again...relax</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: Just read a tweet from someone at theFan that 48 should be tagged and traded, what’s the benefit of that?! Seems like the biggest waste of talent and opportunity. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes. And I suggest you not listen to people who don’t know what they’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong>Alan F</strong>: Was there a player at the Combine that really impressed you? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Simmons. Reagor. Taylor.</p>
<p><strong>Nicholas ONeal</strong>: Gerry wanted to say thanks for your time and efforts on keeping football alive in the offseason and keeping us up to date. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’ll put the check in the mail. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, that’s all the time we have today. See you next week.</p>
