<h1>Internet issues surface during Pittsburgh Public Schools' first day of online learning </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools students were experiencing internet connection issues on the district’s first day of virtual school Tuesday.</p>
<p>All classes are being conducted online for at least the first nine weeks of school.</p>
<p>District officials said the connectivity problem was related to one of the district’s internet service providers.</p>
<p>This issue was causing a slow and unreliable connection to district-provided web resources, including Schoology and Microsoft Teams.</p>
<p>“If you are experiencing this at your home, please be patient, our Information Technology team is working to resolve the issue and expect to have full service restored shortly,” the district said in a social media message to parents around 10 a.m.</p>
<p>North Allegheny School District was also reporting problems and posted this message:</p>
<p>We are aware of a widespread network issue that is affecting North Allegheny and many other Districts across the region. Technology Services is monitoring the outage. We will communicate again when service is restored.</p>
