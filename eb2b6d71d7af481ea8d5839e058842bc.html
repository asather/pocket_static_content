<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">BRADENTON, Fla. — Chris Archer was scratched from his scheduled start on Monday because of neck tightness, the Pirates said. The move is precautionary, and Archer is considered day-to-day.</span></p>
<p>The Pirates play the Yankees at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla. Gerrit Cole will make his first start for New York, while Chris Stratton will take Archer’s spot.</p>
<p>“It’s kind of been lingering for several days,” Archer said. “We’ve done some treatment. Just kind of figured that it’s not smart to go out there and force it on Feb. 24. We have a lot of time. We’re going to do some treatment on it and see how it progresses over the next couple days.”</p>
<p>Other pitchers for the Pirates on Tuesday include Edgar Santana, Yacksel Rios, Luis Escobar, Nik Turley and Nick Mears.</p>
<p>Adam Frazier will hit leadoff and play second base followed by Bryan Reynolds in left field. Cole Tucker will play shortstop and hit third. Josh Bell is at first base and batting fourth followed by designated hitter JT Riddle in the No. 5 spot.</p>
<p>Catcher Jacob Stallings is the last regular in the lineup; he’s hitting sixth. Guillermo Heredia will get the start in center field and hit seventh.</p>
<p>Fans can listen to the game on 93.7 FM The Fan.</p>
