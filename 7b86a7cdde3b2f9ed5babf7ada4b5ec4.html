<h1>'Incomprehensible': War memorial in Lawrenceville vandalized on holiday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police are investigating after a war memorial in Pittsburgh’s Lawrenceville neighborhood was vandalized overnight on Memorial Day.</p>
<p>The statue of the World War I Doughboy, located at Penn and Butler streets where it meets 34th Street, was covered in red paint. A message was spray-painted on the base of the memorial, reading&nbsp;“JUNE 19, 1986, GLORY TO THE DAY OF HEROISM.”</p>
<p>"Vandalizing a memorial on any day is wrong, but it is incomprehensible to vandalize this memorial on a day in which we honor those who served and gave their lives for the freedoms we enjoy today,” said city&nbsp;Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich. “Pittsburgh Police will vigorously investigate this crime.”</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Cara Cruz said Monday morning that police are reviewing “all available video footage” from the area. She also said that arrangements are being made to clean the memorial.</p>
<p>Police ask that anyone with information contact them at (412) 323-7800.</p>
<p>It’s unclear around what time the memorial was vandalized.</p>
<p>The Doughboy statue was erected in 1921.</p>
<p>Ken Diulus, a resident of Lawrenceville who served in the U.S. Navy from 1982 to 1985, walked past the statue Monday and couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>"I've lived my whole life here, with the exception of when I was in the service," Mr. Diulus said, "and I have never seen anything like this."</p>
