<h1>Fishing Report: Crappies are spawning and trout are biting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sunday is one of two Pennsylvania fish-for-free days. Anyone can legally fish on the state's waterways with no fishing license required. Lake Erie permits are also not required. All other fishing regulations and private property laws apply. Scattered thunderstorms were predicted from Lake Erie to West Virginia through Memorial Day weekend.</p>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Fog and waves up to 4 feet kept most boaters off the lake. Smallish yellow perch and crappies were caught in the bay.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Conneaut Lake</strong> (Crawford County) Black and white crappies were taken on live minnows and tipped jigs, and largemouths were caught on the north end. The Conneaut Lake Access Area will be closed May 26-29 for road repavement.</p>
<p><strong>Allegheny River</strong> (Warren County) The Starbrick Access will be closed May 28-June 2 for road and parking lot repavement.</p>

Marienville Rod and Gun Club stocked both Spring and Maple creeks and will deliver trout weekly through June at the Tom’s Run Children’s Area, which is open to kids 15 and younger and special-needs anglers.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Run</strong> (Forest County) A children’s area stocked with trout by Kellettville Sportsman’s Club is open for kids up to 15 years old.</p>

<p><strong>Canonsburg Lake</strong> (Washington County) Anglers continued to catch rainbow trout.</p>
<p><strong>Monongahela River</strong> (Greene, Washington counties) Walleye suspended on rocky shorelines and in large tributaries went for split-tail plastic grubs on 1/16-inch jig heads.</p>
