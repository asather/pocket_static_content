<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mt. Lebanon and Dormont have joined to assist residents in need during the COVID-19 pandemic with a new “Neighborhood Aid” program.</p>
<p>Commissioners in Mt. Lebanon discussed the new program at an April 14 virtual meeting.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited and proud to offer this service,” said Commissioner Mindy Ranney.</p>
<p>Residents of either Mt. Lebanon or Dormont can call 412-253-4104 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays to be connected with a customer service represented who will help with a vast array of services such as help obtaining food, medication, financial assistance, business resources and general information. Volunteers in both communities will also be available to run errands for those who cannot or should not leave their homes.</p>
<p>Residents can also visit www.neighborhoodaid.org for services.</p>
<p>Ms. Ranney said about 50 residents in Dormont and Mt. Lebanon have volunteered for the program.</p>
<p>“This will help fill the gap to help a resident navigate the ever-changing landscape of resources,” Ms. Ranney said.</p>
<p>The service is free, although residents are expected to pay for any purchases they request.</p>
