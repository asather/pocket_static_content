<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 02.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Rob</strong>: Jason, Is possible the Pirates might break the record for least wins in a season? Really a sad state of affairs. Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Alright, folks. Welcome to my weekly chat, pushed back a day because of podcast stuff. Thanks for participating. Let's get to those questions. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Rob. No, I don't think that's going to happen. I actually think the Pirates will be half-decent this season. I think they will flirt with .500. I've explained this a lot in these chats, but I think it's important to remember how bad things got last season and why. They do have some decent players -- at the beginning of the year there was at least some shred of optimism and not a ton has changed -- and I can see this new regime having a positive effect. Do I think that means they win 90 games? No. But I also don't think they're going to set a season record for losses in a season. I think they're gonna be better than many of you are giving them credit for.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: The Yankees need a starter...maybe trade Archer for cash? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Um, no. ... One, why sell stock at its lowest point when you don't have to? Two, cash? Really? Nutting would get killed for that move. Three, a young club like this needs a pitcher like Archer. There's more to him, and I think it could very easily come out this season.</p>
<p><strong>Mark C.</strong>: I have seen two separate media folks this morning (Jim Bowden of The Athletic and Jesse Pantuosco of Radio.com) mention Yasiel Puig as a possibility for the Pirates, is this even being hinted at? I just find it odd that two different media sources mentioned this just this morning, and thought I would ask. Thanks Jason for all your hard work! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: No, to my knowledge, this is not anything that has gotten serious consideration from anyone within the Pirates. They're pretty happy with their outfield, honestly. And I think Puig could help certain teams ... just not the Pirates. Not the right clubhouse/state of being able to win right now.</p>
<p><strong>jds317</strong>: The bucs are clearly not contenders this year. Wouldn't it make sense to trade Frazier and install Newman and Tucker in the mid infield now. Likewise, get Hayes on 3rd base asap and if Craig develops....trade Bell for a catcher and OF prospect. Does this make sense to you? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Does it make sense to basically change their entire infield? Easy, jds317. ... One, I'm not in the Trade Bell camp. I would rather they sign him to a long-term extension. But even if they don't, I wouldn't move him this year. I'd wait until the last possible second. Secondarily, Hayes needs to hit at Triple-A before you do anything with him. The same, really, for Tucker. I want guys earning jobs. I don't want to be handing them out. ... That said, if I got an offer for Frazier and it was halfway decent, I would absolutely do it. They have enough at that position to turn Frazier's solid 2019 into a prospect or two.</p>
<p><strong>Harold H.</strong>: Just curious as to your own views on the Astros’ cheating. Also, do you feel Don Kelly escaped reprimand in any way? Thank you. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Lemme take the second part of that first. I truly believe that Don Kelly was not involved. In one way, I believe that because he would've been at first base when the Astros were hitting. How much could he really impact? Secondarily, there's pretty much zero talk of the Astros doing this stuff 2019, in large part because MLB tightened restrictions. Third, I have a tough time believing Don Kelly would ever participating in something like this. As for my opinion, I don't know what else their is to say. Obviously I'm against it. I see why Manfred granted immunity -- I think he had to -- and I think the Astros should be punished. I also don't know how I come down on vacating the championship. They could, but I'm not sure what that actually does.</p>
<p><strong>Harold H.</strong>: What returning players are making you say, “Wow! This guy has improved and could have a good year!” <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I've been encouraged by Polanco thus far. His swing looks good. He's healthy. He's had good at-bats. But again, with him, it's always going to be about health. ... Nick Burdi has been throwing gas. Maybe the biggest surprise or what fits into what your asking is their bullpen. They have a lot of the same guys, but I think that group might surprise some people this season.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Seems as if Larry Broadway and Joe DelliCarri will survive with the Pirates or is that still TBD? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it's too early to tell. They're sort of in a transition period right now. I think time will tell whether the Pirates determine if they want them around long-term, but Ben has talked about respecting what previous people have done and needing to learn from that. I think that's what we're seeing from those guys. My gut feeling, though, is I think they will eventually look to go in a different direction.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Dave</strong>: I'm going to Bradenton to see the Pirates play a couple of games at Lecom park. Where are the best seats? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hey Dave. I've been sitting behind home plate next to the Pirates dugout. I would recommend those. You're crazy close, although there's not exactly a bad seat in the house.</p>
<p><strong>Hogin</strong>: Do we know what player the pirates got back as the PTBNL in the Dickerson deal? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: They received cash considerations. I kinda feel like this one fell through the cracks. The old regime asked for a PTBNL. The Pirates never announced that it was a PTBNL or cash considerations, just the first one. Then all of a sudden, after the deadline, we hear that it had suddenly became cash. That doesn't line up for me.</p>
<p><strong>alan</strong>: Sophmore slump for Renolds? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don't think so. I have a tough time seeing him get too wrapped around the axle with anything.</p>
<p><strong>KB</strong>: Shoutout to you for providing balanced, informative and enlightening coverage. Kudos to Mr. Wilborn as well. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thank you much. And thank you for reading said coverage.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Dave</strong>: Other than pitchers, what starting positions are up for grabs? From what I read the infield and outfield are set. Catcher maybe? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would consider third base up for grabs. I think they would like to see Colin Moran earn the job, but he needs to field better and hit more consistently. I think there's an opportunity for a fourth outfielder to play quite a bit, although Heredia has looked good thus far. ... Catcher ... Maile has looked pretty solid. I have a tough time believing it's not him and Stallings. ... Again, if we're talking about ONLY guys who are on the roster. Obviously there would be upgrades available if the Pirates wanted to go crazy through free agency, which they obviously don't. And I'm not even arguing that they should.</p>
<p><strong>Hogin</strong>: Any idea what the total payroll be going into the season ? Is there Financial flexibility to add at the deadline ? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I sense the sarcasm. Payroll is around $51 million. It should be higher, absolutely. You're not wrong for wanting them to spend more. Shoot, the league average is $100 some million. I can understand their desire to take a prudent approach, but when you're half the league average, you're going to get criticized, simple as that. ... There's financial flexibility to add now, but I don't think that's what they're going to do. I more so expect them to potentially trade guys with strong first halfs at the deadline -- if they do that, I'm talking about guys like Frazier, Kela, Archer, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Dave</strong>: How is One Cruz progressing? I guess we won't see him for a couple of years in a Pirate uniform but he just seems like a fun player to watch. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He is fun to watch, you're right. He's very up and down. One minute he will take a terrific swing and look outstanding. I think he hit the hardest ball of anyone since we've been down here, a double off the wall a couple games ago. But he also has a couple ugly strikeouts. One thing that I've noticed with Cruz is his footwork. It's a little slow for a shortstop. Obviously he has long strides and long levers, but with a position where you need to move quickly, I worry whether that part will allow him to stay at short.</p>
<p><strong>Evil Dave</strong>: I can't see anybody other than Ke'bryan Hayes challenge Moran unless Erik Gonzales has become at least a consistent .260 hitter...Thoughts? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I've liked what I've seen from JT Riddle, but you're probably right. And if Colin Moran hits .280 with 15-20 home runs and 80-plus RBIs, it's gonna be interesting. No, he isn't a very good fielder, but he has shown the ability to hit at times. Do you really want to sit that on the bench? Where else do you play him?</p>
<p><strong>Hogin</strong>: What went wrong with Luis Heredia ? He was the 16 year old prospect from Mexico the pirates signed for 3.5 million ten years ago. Is it a scouting problem or the developmental process? He should be a star by now <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Honestly, Hogin, it's tough for me to say, as I only got on the beat in May 2019. I've read the same stuff you have: poor control, showing up out of shape, etc. Probably a couple things to point out: Getting guys out of Mexico (or Venezuela or the DR) is such a crapshoot. You're getting them young, when so much can change. Secondarily, the Pirates on the whole have struggled in this area, hence some of the changes they made.</p>
<p><strong>Yark</strong>: Thinking unless they add the roster is mostly set with just last couple pitching spots up for grabs holland will get 1. Think that kuhl and Santana get optioned. If brault isnt 5th starter him too? And can holmes and nevi get through waivers? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you on most things being set. I also think they keep Holland as the lefty in the 'pen. Erlin, Howard and Jerez have been awful thus far, and they need Holland's personality. Brault has looked solid, and I'm expecting him to win the No. 5 starter gig. I think Santana stays up here. He's been healthy and has looked good. I see no reason whatsoever to move him out. I think they could sneak both of those guys through. Holmes is kind of a wild card for me. He has the talent to make the club. He needs to figure out his control issues ... which, so far so good there.</p>
<p><strong>Mike Lanza</strong>: It seems to me that, every year, the team's management and reporters project more optimistic results from Polanco than he ends up delivering. Why do you think this is? Does he really have bad luck every year? If he comes up short again, do we finally balance our expectations for him with what he delivers? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Mike, I'm not really that in to commenting on what others have said before. The best I can do is write and say what I think. I saw a version of Polanco last year that stunk. His swing was long. He chased. He was terrible in right field. He couldn't throw. I haven't seen that stuff thus far. His swing is more compact. Said to Shelton yesterday -- and he agreed -- I don't think I've seen one bad chase yet. The arm is good enough. He's going back for balls and so far hasn't turned anything into a circus. Again, I don't care what happened before, but he looks like a major league RF at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>Hogin</strong>: What 3 players will have a Bobblehead night in 2022? I say Reynolds, Keller and Burdie <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: If you're looking for safe bets, I'd swap out Newman for Burdi. But I would love to see a Nick Burdi bobblehead with the glasses.</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: I hope yor're right for having optimism for the Pirates. I admit that it is fun to watch the new arms and wonder what the futire holds for them and what they might do for the Pirates. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: The people who are overly negative on the Pirates weren't around the mess they were last season. Also, when you talk to guys, it became painfully obvious how behind the times they were from a pitching perspective. Add that to a better approach to fundamentals and an offense that should be at least middle-of-the-road competent, I just don't get how they're going to worse than 69 wins. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. That's gonna do it for this week. Gotta get ready for this one. Thank you as always for participating. Enjoy the ballgame!</p>
