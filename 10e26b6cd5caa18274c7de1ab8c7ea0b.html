<h1>Gerry Dulac: Steelers won't completely ignore defense in NFL draft. Here's why</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the Steelers are leaning toward taking an offensive skill player with their first pick in next week’s draft, finding players to better the depth on their much-improved defense will be something of a priority as well.</p>
<p>And, even though they <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/16/bud-dupree-franchise-tag-steelers-2020-kevin-colbert/stories/202003160074" target="_blank">placed the franchise tag on Bud Dupree</a>, that doesn’t mean they won’t make their first defensive pick an outside linebacker.</p>
<p>The Steelers lost two inside linebackers during the offseason — they released starter Mark Barron and backup Tyler Matakevich left in free agency — but they might be more interested to find a backup for Dupree and T.J. Watt who can spell their two edge rushers. That opening was created when the Steelers released Anthony Chickillo, who had been the top backup at outside linebacker.</p>
<p>The Steelers have a pair of young backups on the roster — Ola Adeniyi and Tuzar Skipper — but they won’t turn their back on a player who they think is better, particularly at the most important position on their defense.</p>
<p>The desire to find a quality backup is rooted in a change of defensive philosophy that began last season.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Tomlin and defensive coordinator Keith Butler started using Dupree and Watt more as pass rushers and run stoppers and reduced the amount of times they dropped into coverage. The Steelers have always asked their outside backers to play pass coverage, more so than other teams who used a 3-4 defense, even when they had James Harrison and LaMarr Woodley as an outside tandem. But that began to change in 2019.</p>
<p>The result was Watt (14½) and Dupree (11½) combining for 26 sacks, the most since Harrison and Woodley had a combined 27½ in 2008. However, because they were taking on offensive linemen more frequently, it also meant the Steelers had to substitute more frequently, especially with Watt, who plays with such high energy that he often loses his breath.</p>
<p>Like all NFL teams, the Steelers pre-draft process has been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic that has prevented them from attending all but one pro day — Tomlin and general manager Kevin Colbert were at Clemson — and from face-to-face visits with prospects on the South Side. But when they were at the NFL combine in February, the last real evaluation opportunity, Colbert called the outside linebacker prospects “an unusual group.”</p>
<p>“When we came out of the fall, we all graded guys, and we looked at those grades and thought that it was a pretty strong group,” Colbert said. “But I said, let’s make sure. Every time we do this it’s still coming out strong, and after we do this combine it may come out stronger or it might come out a little bit less. But it’s unusual.”</p>

<p>The Steelers will also look intently at two other defensive positions in the draft – inside linebacker and safety – and one could have an effect on the other.</p>
<p>Inside linebacker is the only spot on the defense where the Steelers will have to find a new starter. They released Barron, in part, because they saved $5.25 million against the salary cap this season. But, also, the veteran safety-turned-linebacker struggled to get comfortable with the defense because he practiced only one day every week because of nagging injuries</p>
<p>So what now?</p>
<p>The Steelers have several options to replace him. The immediate solution is to use Vince Williams, whose snaps were drastically reduced last season because of the presence of Barron and rookie Devin Bush. But they are reluctant to use him in the same role as Barron because of his problems in pass coverage.</p>
<p>One move the Steelers have given consideration is moving strong safety Terrell Edmunds into that role in some of their defensive packages. That, though, would be contingent on drafting a safety. However, because offseason training activities are not expected to take place, and with the possibility of preseason games being canceled because of the COVID-19 pandemic, there might not be enough time to experiment with the move.</p>
<p>Colbert has mentioned the development of Ulysees Gilbert III, last year’s sixth-round draft choice from Akron, as a possibility to fill that role. But, again, with the lack of OTAs and possibly a preseason, the coaches won’t have a chance to evaluate young players such as Gilbert in the spring or summer.</p>
<p>The Steelers would also like to add a defensive lineman to help with their rotation and ease the loss of Javon Hargrave, even though they traded to acquire defensive end Chris Wormley from the Baltimore Ravens.</p>
<p>However, with only six draft choices, and just two in the top 102, the Steelers will have to be judicious how they prioritize their desires.</p>
