<h1>Carnegie Mellon to delay start of spring semester; will condense duration to reduce time on campus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Saying the pandemic&nbsp;“will likely continue through the winter months,” Carnegie Mellon University is pushing back spring semester to Feb. 1 and will condense it to 14 weeks with a shortened exam period and spring break week replaced by two spring break days.</p>
<p>Provost James Garrett, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/the-provost/campus-comms/2020/2020-09-10.html" target="_blank">in an email Thursday to students and employees</a>, said the adjusted schedule will reduce time on campus during the flu season and also assist international students by providing “more time for visa processing and travel to arrive for spring semester,” he said</p>
<p>The semester was to have started about three weeks earlier, on Jan. 11, spokesman Jason Maderer said.</p>
<p>A number of colleges and universities have modified in-person semester start- and end-dates to reduce the number of weeks that students will be on campus given concerns about COVID-19 and flu infections. Officials at Carnegie Mellon and other universities this summer have said significant numbers of overseas students would not arrive in time for the fall semester start and could have similar problems in the spring.</p>
<p>The share of international students arriving for fall was not immediately available Thursday from Mr. Maderer or Carnegie Mellon.</p>
<p>As of last fall, about 13,300 students out of <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ira/Enrollment/pdf/fall-2019-pdfs/fall-2019-university-total-enrollment-by-location-type.pdf" target="_blank">Carnegie Mellon’s total enrollment of 14,800</a> belonged to the Pittsburgh campus, according to the university’s website.</p>
<p>The university opted to begin the fall semester online and transition to a mix of remote and-person classes. On Thursday, Mr. Garrett described spring plans as follows:</p>
<p>&nbsp;“We currently intend to offer spring semester classes in the hybrid-learning approach similar to the fall semester (i.e., remote only, in-person plus remote and in-person only), which allows flexibility in the way students choose to pursue their CMU education,” he wrote. “Our hybrid-learning approach allows students to continue their education throughout the spring semester even as the course of the pandemic evolves.</p>
<p>Instead of spring break week, “two individual break days will be distributed throughout the semester,” Mr. Garrett wrote. “These two break days are in addition to the three days of break that were already scheduled on the spring 2021 calendar for mid-semester break and Carnival.”</p>
<p>Mr. Garrett proved the following outline for the spring semester:&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>First day of classes:</strong> February 1</p>
<p><strong>Mini classes 3:</strong> February 1 - March 19</p>
<p><strong>Mini 4:</strong> March 22 - May 7</p>
<p><strong>Spring Carnival:</strong> April 15 -17</p>
<p><strong>Last day of classes:</strong> May 7</p>
<p><strong>Final exams:</strong> May 8 -16</p>
<p><strong>Commencement:</strong> May 23.</p>
