<h1>Penguins mailbag: How do you grade the deadline-day trades?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome back to Mike’s Mailbag!</em></p>
<p><em>Every other week, I ask for your Penguins questions and then answer the best ones here in this segment. My bosses call it reader engagement. I just like the idea of making you do half my job for me.</em></p>
<p><em>Time to let it rip.</em></p>
<p><strong>Rich S.:</strong> The Penguins were active during the trade season. I want to hear your opinion on the two trades that were made on deadline day now that the players have a couple games under their belts.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> The first trade — Patrick Marleau for a conditional 2021 third-round pick — feels low-risk to me. To give up a mid-round pick for a 40-year-old veteran who has done everything but win a Cup seems like the kind of gamble a team in win-now mode should be making. Right now, he’s playing on Evgeni Malkin’s left wing. We’ll see if he sticks there. But the Penguins believe he can still skate and in the limited time I've seen him with Pittsburgh, he seems to use his veteran savvy to find his shot. I kind of liken it to how Michael Jordan slightly adapted his game late in his career, using his brain more than relying so much on physical skill.</p>
<p>The second trade — Conor Sheary and Evan Rodrigues for Dominik Kahun — I mostly like. The Penguins never wanted to give away Sheary in the first place, but he became a salary-cap casualty. It makes sense they would want to reacquire him, given his history with the Penguins and, more specifically, Crosby.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I was a little surprised to see they gave away Kahun in the deal. You have to give something up to get something. I get that. But I thought Kahun fit the Penguins’ scheme and style. I had him penciled in on Malkin’s left wing for the stretch run. It seems to be a move where the Penguins are counting on a more proven commodity (Sheary) over young potential (Kahun).</p>
<p>When you add in Rodrigues, who has already played all three forward spots in his first four games, the moves as a whole added depth and versatility to the roster. With Dominik Simon injured and Brandon Tanev sick, we’re already seeing that paying off.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jakey Y.:</strong> What’s your favorite type of Penguin?</p>
<p>I like this one.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Sheryl:</strong> Am I weird for not panicking over the recent losing streak? I mean, I wasn’t happy about it, but I also didn’t think it was the end of the world.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;No, you’re not weird. You realize teams go through slumps and the Penguins have consistently been one of the NHL’s better teams.</p>
<p>There are a couple reasons for the skid so far as I can tell. Let’s take a step back and look at some of them and see if it’s just a blip on the radar or a concern.</p>
<p><em>Secondary scoring:</em> It was non-existent during the losing streak. Even after Tuesday’s 7-3 win, no member of the bottom six has found the back of the net in seven games. Getting Nick Bjugstad back makes the third line look much more potent and the trades at the deadline added depth. Maybe things change, but they need more from guys who aren’t on the ice with Crosby or Malkin.</p>
<p><em>Power play:</em> It was just 1-for-18 during the skid. Bryan Rust snapped that drought on Tuesday. But there have been issues with the power play all year. In fairness, literally every single member of the power play has been hurt this season, most of them for large chunks of the year. But I wouldn’t count on the power play to be one of the offensive engines this postseason the way it was during previous Cup runs.</p>
<p><em>Defense:</em> The pairings were obviously not optimal. Getting John Marino and Brian Dumoulin healthy has made an instant and obvious difference.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Crosby:</em> I put him on the list only because he did himself, which is exactly what you want your captain and team leader to do. I think he was trying to send a message and it seemed like it was received. After tallying just one point during the lull, Crosby snapped out of it in a big way with a three-point night on Tuesday. Look, he’s still one of the best players in the game. He played the first part of the season injured. Then, while working back from a really significant surgery, he’s been skating between two brand new linemates. I’m sure when it matters most, Crosby will be at his best.</p>
<p><strong>Richard H.:</strong> Do you think Mike Sullivan will ride with Matt Murray or Tristan Jarry in the last four weeks of the regular season? Or will Sullivan continue to flip between the two until he makes a decision in the last week of March and the first week in April?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong> Sullivan was asked a similar question before Tuesday’s game and didn’t really tip his hand one way or the other. For what it’s worth, Murray will make his second-straight start on Thursday night, the first time the Penguins have broken the goaltender rotation since Feb. 6. I know everyone wants to read into each and every move, but this does feel like a real opportunity for Murray to seize the net.</p>
<p>I know everyone wants the Penguins to settle on one goalie, and for good reason, but honestly the fact that we’re still having this discussion this late in the season shows that there isn’t a clear answer.&nbsp;Murray is the proven commodity. He has the two Cups. You know he’s not going to lose his cool in the biggest situations because he’s proven it before. But Jarry’s stick-handling is an X-factor. And over the entire length of the entire season, he’s been more consistent.</p>
<p>Ideally, one guy will catch fire in the next two weeks and make the decision for the Penguins, possibly beginning Thursday. But if one doesn’t, my personal opinion is that Jarry deserves to be rewarded for playing better over the entirety of the season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Randy:</strong> Too late now but why didn’t David Warsofsky get the call up when the D-men were injured?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>When the Penguins talk about their defensive corps, they always include Zach Trotman in that discussion. They feel within the organization he’s one of their nine NHL-caliber defensemen, which is why he was recalled.</p>
<p>But you make a good point. The Penguins chose to play the right-handed Trotman on his off side in place of lefty Juuso Riikola. Recalling the left-handed Warsofsky would have allowed the Penguins to slot all their defensemen in on their natural side. I guess they must have felt Trotman on his unnatural side was better than Warsofsky on his natural side.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa N.:</strong> What are you favorite Girls Scout cookies?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>I’m a big-time chocolate peanut butter guy. So Tagalongs are up there for sure. But in my own personal opinion, Thin Mints are the way to go, especially if you put them in the freezer overnight. Trust me.</p>
<p>I also want to point out that Girl Scout cookie season coincides with Lent, when a lot of people give up sweets. While on one hand Girls Scouts are most certainly doing God’s work, I also haven’t ruled out the possibility they’ve been put on this Earth to tempt us.</p>
<p><strong>The Blue Prince:&nbsp;</strong>Which one do you prefer for the first round of the playoffs: Pens vs. Caps or Pens vs. Flyers?</p>
<p>Playoffs!?! (Sorry had to do it.)</p>

<p>Personally, I want to see Penguins vs. Capitals and not just because I still have a ton of friends from college who stayed in D.C. after we graduated. These two teams have played so many great series over the years. Had the Capitals beaten the Penguins in 2016 or 2017, I could have seen them win the Cup. The same goes for 2018. Had the Penguins won that series, I could have seen them winning it all instead of Washington.</p>
<p>I’m not ready to say the winner of a Penguins-Capitals series would take home the trophy this year. But if both teams can get it together the last month of the season, they’ve both got a real shot.</p>
