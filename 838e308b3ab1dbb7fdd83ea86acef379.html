<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 10.01.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Zeise</strong>: Lets get started</p>
<p><strong>The S’Liberty Kid</strong>: Hi Paul---Thanks for your good work! Are Steelers fans the most critical in the NFL? If not, what city is? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I lived in Philly. Fans here aren’t even close!!</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Hi Paul, Steeler fan angst over Randy Fichtner may be a bit over the top, but do you personally feel like he holds back the talent on offense? Should he let Ben call more plays? Mahomes is talented, yes, but I look at what the Chiefs do and wonder why we can’t be just as creative at least in the playcalling. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s just say I’m not a fan but he takes too much criticism. The Steelers try to play to their strengths but also protect Ben. If Ben called plays he would be sacked a million times.</p>
<p><strong>nivek morris</strong>: You discussed the best quarterbacks in the NFL in your mailbag yesterday and left out Russell Wilson. Was that an oversight, or don’t you think he’s among the league’s best? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It was an oversight. He is second only to Mahomes in my eyes</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Should there be any reason to get excited about Kumar Rocker on the Pirates, since he’ll just be pitching for the Yankees in 5 years? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I can only say this - that’s a long ways away! I mean enjoy him if he turns into a great player until he is no longer here.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Peering into your crystal ball...how many fans do you think they’ll allow at the Super Bowl? That week is definitely gonna be a little different this year. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would say 20,000 max</p>
<p><strong>Is It Just PR?</strong>: I see that the Steelers are asking Gov. Wolf to allow them to have fans at their next game. If Wolf’s lock down orders were shut down by a court why do the Steelers, or anyone, need his permission? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They don’t want to make waves. They want to maintain a good working relationship with authorities so they are gonna do things the proper way</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Z. South Side</strong>: Hey Paul. so will the week just be a bye week for Steelers or ? Thanks <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes that’s what it sounds like</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Hi Paul, do you think Oneil Cruz will start the season next year with the Pirates if his legal issues are resolved? Could he be groomed as a possible replacement for Polanco? Thanks. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I think he will be a guy who starts in AAA. He isn’t ready and now with this stuff I am sure they will hold him back</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: Any idea why Newman’s defense suffered this season? Do you think he fits into the Pirates’ future plans? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No just one of those things. A lot of guys regressed and a lot has to do with just a strange season.</p>
<p><strong>JR</strong>: Paul: will Pitt go 5-0 into the game with Miami? Can Pitt best Notre Dame? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes but Boston College won’t be an easy game. They should kill NC State but BC the next week will be tricky. I like their chances to beat ND as well</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats Paul. if you could make another Minkah like trade what position would you trade for? I am happy with the 3-0 start but I am not sure we have enough to get past KC. not sure anyone does! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I would trade for an inside linebacker that can cover. That is their biggest need I think</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Any chance Pens can get a first round pick for Murray if they throw in Johnson and pay some of his salary? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I don’t think so. I’m not sure what the return will be but I’d be shocked if they get that much</p>
<p><strong>Walter Sobchak</strong>: In your mail bag column last week you made the comment “Shelton knows what he is doing”. I have to ask - exactly what evidence can you present that would convince fans that is true? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: That’s actually a fair question. The answer is not much but he has the right pedigree and experience and knows the game well. I think he is really going to do a good job once he gains a little more experience</p>
<p><strong>Greg M</strong>: Where do you see Pitt ending up this year? I think realistically 8-3 would be a great season and do a lot for the program. They will play ND tough, as usual and the Miami game could be close. Don’t see them competing with Clemson, though. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They have a hard schedule coming up. I think it is going to be interesting to see the Miami game. 8-3 would be a good season but 9-2 would be a good step forward</p>
<p><strong>Hogan</strong>: Fan of autumn golf, yay or nay? If yay, liberal use of the leaf rule, I assume? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love golf as long as it is warm enough to play. Less than 50 I’m not a fan. And yes the leaf rule is ALWAYS in play</p>
<p><strong>Benny</strong>: Paul, are you on board with my banishment to the dog house after a few fumbles? They were not quite Mendenhall like in the grand scheme of things.... <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No but this past weekend you weren’t productive. I can forgive a fumble or two but you have to run harder and better</p>
<p><strong>Mike in MD</strong>: When do you think we may hear about one of the goalies getting traded by the Pens? I would think that it would be before the draft, and I am expecting it to be Murray, but you never know. <br> <strong>Omahalion</strong>: I imagine that moving the bye week to this week is unwelcome news to the players, but I do think that they should be a bit more circumspect in comments about the Titans and how they deserve to lose out as a result of the virus. Every team is just a dropped mask away from being in the same boat. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is gonna be MUrray and I would assume it will happen sooner rather than later <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Omaha - yes the whining about moving a game is silly. And there was no way yet to know if anyone did anything wrong. It could just be bad luck</p>
<p><strong>Church Lady</strong>: Who had the ugliest uniforms in the Pitt - Louisville game? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Pitt. I hate those newfangled Gen Z uniforms. They look stupid</p>
<p><strong>ROD HELMUT</strong>: Paul, when you compare Pitt and Penn State and the pros that they send, it does not even seem close. Pitt has sent way more - and greater - players to the NFL than Penn State. How can this be when it seems Pitt loses the recruiting battles every year. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Penn state has more in the NFL. The quantity favors PSU. There is an argument that Pitt has produced more elite players but PSU has produced more overall</p>
<p><strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, I would think the NFL Players Association would chime in on the Steelers essentially losing their bye week. Paying 13 weeks in a row into the playoffs seems like a competitive disadvantage. In fact, with Tenn, Baltimore and Dallas in a row on the road, maybe the playoffs are in jeopardy? <br> <strong>TP Ranger</strong>: Paul, this is just a comment on the mailbag item earlier in the week when a reader suggested that you were being unfair to the police in your discussions about the Steelers social justice program. You have been an icon of common sense in this polarizing discussion, and I for one want to commend you for your comments. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: They can’t worry about that stuff. They just have to get through the season and complete all games. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Thanks. I try to use common sense</p>
<p><strong>Robert Jones</strong>: Is The Masters going to feel like The Masters in November? And your pick of the big cat is overly optimistic at best. Ever have a bad back in chilly weather? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yeah I know. It will be a younger guy that wins but I can dream!</p>
<p><strong>The Young and the Naked</strong>: So do the Steelers get screwed out of a bye week for this ? That doesn’t seem fair <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: It is life in 2020</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Once again, the Pirates win a few meaningless, no pressure games at the end of the year and management uses that to say that major changes are not needed. How many years in a row will that fly with Pirate fans? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: There will be some changes. They will continue to try and turn over the roster</p>
<p><strong>Not a Sport</strong>: So with the debate lunacy that occurred they forgot to ask the two real questions. Are NASCAR drivers athletes ? and who is the athlete in Horse Racing ? The jockey or the horse ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: All of the above are athletes</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed</strong>: Hey Paul, you mentioned you lived in Philly, where at? I live in Bensalem, Pa. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Southwest, Media, Wayne, West Chester</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Although I love their D, Pitt’s offense still leaves A LOT to be desired. I hoped that year two with Pickett and Whipple would produce better results. Why still so conservative and unproductive? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: The offensive line is not consistent. And Kenny Pickett is not consistent enough</p>
<p><strong>SDWC</strong>: Do you know if Lucas Krull is done for the season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have not heard</p>
<p><strong>Sports Harder</strong>: If I wanted to go as Paul Zeise for Halloween this year how should I go about it ? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Don’t do that. And on that note I must say good bye. Thanks for all your questions!!!</p>
