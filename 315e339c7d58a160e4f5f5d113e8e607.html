<h1>Inspection at Beaver County nursing home found residents were in 'Immediate Jeopardy'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On May 2, <a href="https://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/content/publicweb/ltc-survey.asp?Facid=020802&amp;PAGE=1&amp;NAME=BRIGHTON+REHABILITATION+AND+WELLNESS+CENTER&amp;SurveyType=H&amp;COUNTY=BEAVER" target="_blank">the second of five days that Pennsylvania Department of Health inspectors spent investigating</a> a Beaver County nursing home with the worst COVID-19 outbreak in the state, inspectors found such egregious violations of infection prevention guidelines that they found the violations placed residents in “Immediate Jeopardy.”</p>
<p>That incredibly rare finding of Immediate Jeopardy for a nursing home — which resulted in a federal fine of $58,260 that continues to grow by $110 a day until all the problems are resolved — came after an extraordinary first day of the investigation on May 1, according to the report released online last week by the state.</p>
<p>On May 1, between 4:35 p.m. and 6:05 p.m., in just 90 minutes of observations in different locations around the large building, inspectors found more than two dozen violations of infection prevention in six of the 11 units of the nursing home — they would eventually find more violations in three more units — by a range of employees from nurses aides, to licensed practical nurses, to registered nurses.</p>
<p>Inspectors declared a finding of Immediate Jeopardy — which is for “a situation in which entity noncompliance has placed the health and safety of recipients in its care at risk for serious injury, serious harm, serious impairment or death,” <a href="https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Guidance/Manuals/downloads/som107ap_q_immedjeopardy.pdf" target="_blank">according to federal regulations</a> — the next day. It was not until May 5 that the finding of Immediate Jeopardy was removed after the facility agreed to retrain all of its staff and make other changes.</p>
<p><em>A letter dated June 2 and addressed to Dana Wittman, administrator at Brighton Rehabilitation &amp; Wellness Center, says a survey of the facility found that its "most serious deficiency to be one that comprises a pattern ... that constitutes immediate jeopardy to resident health or safety."</em></p>
<p>According to the state Department of Health, Immediate Jeopardy findings during nursing home inspections have occurred between 22 and 39 times per year since 2016, compared to between 4,700 and 5,300 inspections each year.</p>
<p>According to state data, Brighton currently has had 332 residents test positive for COVID-19 since it had its first positive case on March 26. A total of at least 82 of those residents have died after contracting COVID-19. And at least 108 of its staff members have tested positive. All of those figures are the most for any nursing home facility in the state, according to state data.</p>
<p>While the May 5 report itself is troubling, what makes it more troubling, according to experts, families of residents and an attorney for one family, is that the inspection occurred just two weeks after similar findings by state inspectors at Brighton in April, and during a federal inspection a week after the May 1-5 inspection.</p>
<p>“The biggest issue I see is that the five day survey done by the state [May 1 to May 5] was very comprehensive and found dozens of violations, all of which should have been corrected with the April 17 inspection,” said Bob Daley, an attorney representing Jodi Gill, whose father, Glenn, is a resident at Brighton, in a lawsuit she has filed against the state for failure to provide proper oversight of Brighton. “But to see that [inspectors] are there a week later [May 12 to May 14] and are finding the same kind of problems? I don’t know what to say.”</p>
<p>The violations the inspectors found on May 1-5 were for the most basic — but incredibly important in a COVID-19 outbreak — protocols: failure of employees to wash hands after changing gloves; failure to change gloves after working with one resident and before working with another; failure to wear masks while in the building; failure to have soap and paper towels available; failure to cover both clean and dirty linen carts; and failure to properly clean equipment like thermometers or glucometers that are used daily on residents.</p>
<p>“It’s just very basic stuff that [state Department of Health Secretary] Dr. [Rachel] Levine talks about every day: wash your hands, wear a mask. And when you see [some employees] also haven’t had training in over a year, it all becomes a consistent issue,” Ms. Gill&nbsp;said, referring to a finding by inspectors that 17 employees had gone at least a year without infection prevention training, as required by federal regulations.</p>
<p>In one of the infection prevention violations that inspectors observed as they watched, a nurses aide — identified only as “Employee E13” in the report — was observed on May 1 wearing gloves in the room of a COVID-19 positive resident on the building’s fifth floor in room 525. She was&nbsp;preparing to take the resident’s temperature with a thermometer and read the oxygen saturation with a pulse oximeter.</p>
<p>But before the aide could do that, she noticed that the resident’s urinal was half full. She set down the thermometer and oximeter on a table, picked up the urinal, emptied it in a soiled utility room down the hall, returned and took the resident’s temperature and oxygen levels. Then she walked across the hall into room 526 with two residents who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19, and took their temperature and oxygen levels with the same devices.</p>
<p>“Throughout this observation, NA Employee 13 did not remove her gloves, perform hand hygiene, or clean her equipment between patients,” the inspector wrote.</p>
<p>But the inspectors, while addressing specific employees’ failures that they observed during their five days there, came down hardest on the buildings’ Director of Nursing Eve Hamilton (DON) and Nursing Home Administrator (NHA) Dana Wittman for not properly managing and training the building’s more than 400 employees.</p>
<p>“Based on the findings in this report that identified that the facility failed to consistently maintain an infection prevention and control program which placed residents in Immediate Jeopardy,” the inspectors wrote in their report. “The NHA and DON failed to fulfill their essential job duties to ensure that the federal and state guidelines and regulations were followed.</p>
<p>“Based on a review of job descriptions, clinical records, and staff interviews, it was determined that the Nursing Home Administrator (NHA) and the Director of Nursing (DON) did not effectively manage the facility to make certain that proper infection control procedures were followed to protect residents from cross-contamination, infections, virus' and disease in the facility,” the inspectors wrote.</p>
<p><em>In another letter, also dated June 2, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services discusses the survey results and plan of correction.</em></p>
<p>Brighton would not make Ms. Hamilton, who has been director of nursing since the current owners, Comprehensive Healthcare, bought the nursing home from Beaver County in 2014, nor Ms. Wittman, who only began her job there in March, available for an interview.</p>
<p>“Our facility administrators, nursing administration, and our entire staff continue to work relentlessly to enact the evolving protocols set forth by government health officials to control the spread of this virus,” Brighton’s owners said in an emailed statement, in part, responding to the May 5 report. “That said, we recognize that due to the unprecedented nature of this virus, few individuals have been perfect in their response to COVID-19. That includes some staff [in] our facility. However, in any instance where a staff member may have gone outside of proper protocols, leadership works to immediately correct the staff member to ensure compliance.”</p>
<p>Brighton also said that it is disputing some of the findings in the May 5 inspection report.</p>
<p>But Sam Brooks, a project manager for The National Consumer Voice for Quality Long-Term Care, an advocacy organization in Washington, D.C., said it was the right move to place most of the blame on management, not employees at Brighton.</p>
<p>“All the violations they are seeing [in Brighton] was from a lack of training and quality control, which is management’s responsibility,” said Mr. Brooks, who previously worked at Community Legal Services in Philadelphia and worked on projects involving Pennsylvania nursing homes, reviewing thousands of similar inspections, also known as surveys. He reviewed the Brighton inspections at the request of the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>“Remember,” he noted of the specific observations inspectors found at Brighton, “these [employees] are being watched by the [state] surveyors and they’re still committing these violations.”</p>
<p><em>This is a statement of deficiencies and a plan of correction made by the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services within the Department of Health and Human Services and addressed to Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center.</em></p>
<p>What troubled Mr. Brooks the most was reading the April 17 inspection, which was just for one day vs. the five days the state spent at Brighton in May, but still found many of the same problems.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing they found in May they wouldn’t have found in April,” he said. “They just looked harder” in May.</p>
<p><a href="https://sais.health.pa.gov/commonpoc/content/publicweb/ltc-survey.asp?Facid=020802&amp;PAGE=1&amp;NAME=BRIGHTON+REHABILITATION+AND+WELLNESS+CENTER&amp;SurveyType=H&amp;COUNTY=BEAVER" target="_blank">During that April 17 inspection, state inspectors found many of the same basic violations </a>of infection prevention protocols as they did two weeks later, this time in seven of the 11 units in the building.</p>
<p>The inspectors wrote that they “determined that the facility failed to make certain social distancing was maintained by staff, properly store clean linens and soiled laundry, provide proper supplies to perform hand washing, properly store biohazardous waste, ensure sinks are accessible to perform handwashing, properly wear gloves and perform hand hygiene and create a clean and sanitary environment which created the potential for the cross-contamination and the spread of diseases and infections.”</p>
<p>After pressure was brought on the federal government to do something, on May 12 federal inspectors from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services showed up at Brighton — a rare instance of CMS investigating directly. Nearly all nursing home inspections are done by state inspectors.</p>
<p>Documents released by CMS, including a preliminary report of that May 12-14 investigation, shows that inspectors were still finding problems with employees use of protective equipment, problem with disinfecting medical equipment, and a new finding that Brighton staff were not assessing residents every eight hours for COVID-19 symptoms and signs.</p>
<p>“This failure [not to assess residents every eight hours] had the potential for a delay of COVID-19 treatment,” the inspectors wrote.</p>
<p>During one glaring example of the problems with knowing when to wear protective equipment, a CMS inspector observed two employees - listed only as “E1” and “E2” - in a COVID-19 positive patient’s room doing a Facetime call with the resident and their family. But neither employee was wearing goggles as required, with one wearing their goggles on their foreheard, not covering their eyes, and the other did not have any goggles at all.</p>
<p>When asked why she was not wearing eye protection, E1 replied to the inspector: “We are doing activities. Should I be wearing eye protection?”</p>
<p>Diane Menio, executive director for the Center for Advocacy of the Rights &amp; Interests of the Elderly (CARIE), an advocacy group based in Philadelphia, reviewed the three inspection reports at Brighton at the request of the Post-Gazette and was struck how common violations were occurring in front of inspectors.</p>
<p>“It’s not hard to read those reports and think that every given day, even when [inspectors] aren’t there, it’s happening,” she said. “When you look at these [reports] you wonder how much we could have done to prevent this [outbreak in nursing homes] from happening.”</p>
