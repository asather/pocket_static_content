<h1>Live streams will be big for Western Pennsylvania high school teams this fall</h1>

<p>As Dave McBain sat in his office Tuesday at West Allegheny High School, he glanced across the room at a cart that was supporting six cardboard boxes, most of which had large “Fragile” stickers strewn across them.</p>
<p>“They’re coming out Tuesday the 8th to install the cameras,” said McBain, the school’s athletic director.</p>
<p>For high schools in Western Pennsylvania, cameras are taking on the utmost importance this fall. In these COVID-19 times, live streaming could be the only way many family and fans are able to catch a glimpse of their children and favorite teams playing sports, performing in the marching band and leading cheers.</p>
<p>Facebook Live. YouTube. Hudl. Pixellot automatic cameras. They are early front-runners for MVP this fall. Many schools, large and small, are scrambling to have their systems up and ready by their football home openers. Most WPIAL teams kick off the regular season Friday.</p>
<p>“We’re in the process of doing it,” said Clairton High athletic director Ted Ulmer, who added that the school’s football team will likely use either Facebook Live or YouTube to stream games. “I think the biggest challenge right now is working with the tech department in order to do that. They’re working on setting up things for our schools, so we’re taking a backseat to that. The nice thing is we don’t have a home game until the 25th.”</p>
<p>After previously ordering that spectators be prohibited from fall high school sporting events, Gov. Tom Wolf reversed course Wednesday when his COVID-19 guidance for sports <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/09/02/high-school-sports-pennsylvania-spectator-ban-tom-wolf/stories/202009020122" target="_blank">was altered to allow fans at games</a>. But schools must not exceed the event limits of 250 (outdoors) and 25 (indoors), a total that also accounts for players, coaches, officials and game workers. Many schools were already tight when it comes to fitting everybody in, so the new guidance likely won’t help significantly.</p>
<p>For the majority of schools, this live-stream undertaking is brand new. Such is the case at Frazier High, a small school located in Fayette County. Athletic director John Malone has been on the job for only six weeks, and he also works in the district teaching special education and a K-12 gifted program. Installing an elaborate broadcasting system wasn’t in the school’s budget, so it will go with a student-run system that is being supervised by another teacher. They’ll use Facebook Live to stream football and volleyball games.</p>
<p>“I’m not a tech guy, so they teach me. I just need to make sure we have all of the proper equipment to get it running,” said Malone, who at 27 is one of the youngest athletic directors in the WPIAL.</p>
<p>Being a much larger school with more resources, Baldwin High will have what athletic director John Saras called “a full-blown production.” Through the Fighting Highlanders Sports Network, the school will stream home and away football and soccer games. The football games will also include play-by-play, and the production will continue during halftime to include the band performance.</p>
<p>Baldwin’s system is homegrown, as four recent graduates — Jack Hillgrove, Jake Mysliwczyk, Ryan Milan and Evan Laurent — will handle the production. Hillgrove, grandson of Steelers and Pitt play-by-play man Bill Hillgrove, will handle the play-by-play at home games. Hillgrove said Mysliwczyk is coordinating most of it. They will have two cameras, one in the press box and the other on one of the sidelines. Hillgrove will also do a weekly interview with Baldwin football coach Tim Sweeney which will air before every game.</p>
<p>“I had a conversation with Mr. Saras about a year and a half ago when he took over,” said Hillgrove, a senior at Waynesburg University. “He wanted to do a lot for the athletic community, start a Baldwin stream and make it unique, and do it with Baldwin guys through and through.”</p>
<p>The events do carry a price tag for fans, who can pay $10.95 for a single game or $59.95 for the season.</p>
<p>“We figured if you’re a regular coming to the games Friday nights, that’s $6. And if you bring someone else, that’s another $6, so we thought $10.95 was fair,” said Saras, adding that he hopes to get some sponsors involved, too.</p>
<p>The National Federation of State High School Associations offers a system that is one of the most popular among WPIAL schools. It works with a company named Pixellot, which streams events using automated cameras installed in stadiums and gymnasiums. Any sports played at those venues, high school and middle school, are filmed. Among the schools using the Pixellot system are West Allegheny, Trinity, South Allegheny and South Side Beaver.</p>
<p>“It’s a self-contained unit with two cameras, and it follows live-ball action,” McBain explained. “We just don’t have the numbers to do it in volleyball (due to the event limit). You can’t get in there with a tub of butter and a shoe horn. Overall, I think it’s a good opportunity. It’s also nice for families not in town who will now get to watch the games.”</p>
<p>NFHS charges subscribers $10.99 a month or $69.95 for the full year. Access to any event being broadcast by the NFHS Network across the country is included. Some schools are picking up that charge for families of players. Others are not.</p>
<p>“We pay the subscription fees for our families to watch it,” said Trinity athletic director Ricci Rich, whose school began using the Pixellot platform last year. “The main thing is that we didn’t want our families to miss seeing their kids play.”</p>
<p>Due to the pandemic, NFHS/Pixellot rolled out its “High School Support Program” in July, which waives the fee of the two cameras. Schools still must pay a one-time installation fee of $2,500, and a portion of the subscription fees goes to the school’s athletic program.</p>
<p>“We have seen exponential growth year over year since its inception in 2013,” Mark Koski, CEO and head of marketing for the NFHS Network, said in an email. “Additionally, this year alone we are already seeing an increase in viewership following our announcement of the NFHS Network High School Support Program that provides schools two free automated Pixellot cameras.”</p>
<p>The pandemic has provided many challenges for athletic directors, Seneca Valley’s Heather Lewis among them. Luckily for her, Seneca Valley already had a video system in place pre-pandemic. It includes a student-run program that broadcasts everything from sports to musicals, as well as a Hudl Focus camera that was installed in the school’s gym last year. The camera is linked to a YouTube channel that anyone can watch.</p>
<p>“We’re really lucky to have that program,” said Lewis. “When we installed the camera, we weren’t looking at [the fact that] there was going to be a global pandemic. We were just looking for efficient ways to broadcast our events.”</p>
<p>All of these options undoubtedly create a much different game day environment for families and fans.&nbsp;Dave Arledge, whose son Alex is a standout quarterback for Burrell, is already making plans with other parents to hold small viewing parties at each other’s homes.</p>
<p>“When we do it at my place, we’ll maybe go out on the patio deck and make a fire,” he said. “Fall is perfect weather for that. You have to make the best of it. I might even have to fire up the grill.”</p>
<p>Unique times call for creative ways to make the best of a difficult situation. And chances are some schools, if not many, will continue the streaming when the pandemic phases out.</p>
<p>“We’ve got our community and we have alumni across the country just like other schools,” Ulmer said. “We have a big following on our Clairton football Facebook page. I think this is something moving forward that we’ll do.”</p>
