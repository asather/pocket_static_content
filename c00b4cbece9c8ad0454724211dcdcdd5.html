<p>Jalen Hurts to the Steelers?</p>
<p>ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr., mocked Hurts, the former Alabama and Oklahoma quarterback, to the Steelers with their first pick at No. 49 in the second round in his latest mock draft.</p>
<p>Kiper’s pick raised some eyebrows in these parts because the Steelers have Ben Roethlisberger under contract for two more years and committed to Mason Rudolph as their top backup immediately after the season ended.</p>
<p>Kiper explained why Hurts will be attractive to NFL teams Wednesday morning.</p>
<p>“Lamar Jackson and Taysom Hill really help him,” Kiper said. “Taysom Hill will be the heir apparent to Drew Brees in New Orleans. No one wanted him when he came out of BYU. Before Lamar Jackson was Lamar Jackson, he was playing in packages behind Joe Flacco. To me, he’s that kind of player. New England and Pittsburgh could be possibilities.”</p>
<p>Hurts began his career at Alabama, where he led the Crimson Tide to two national championship games and earned freshman All-America honors in his first season. After losing his job to Tua Tagovailoa, Hurts transferred to Oklahoma, where he completed 70% of his passes for nearly 4,000 yards.</p>
<p>Noting the copycat nature of the league, Kiper believes Hurts can have similar success as a dual-threat quarterback.</p>
<p>“I still question him seeing the field, but he’s improved,” Kiper said.</p>
