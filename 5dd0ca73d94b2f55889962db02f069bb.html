<h1>Pitt finds non-conference replacement, will open vs. Austin Peay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For all the speculation and upheaval around college football’s fall season, Pat Narduzzi said his team is “pretty crisp” at the moment. After Tuesday morning’s practice, Pitt had 14 training camp sessions under its belt. The Panthers scrimmaged in full pads Saturday, with the defense narrowly winning on a two-point conversion tiebreaker. Position battles rage on as new starters emerge.</p>
<p>“They’re having fun. Their minds are a little bit better than they were a week ago or 10 days ago or 15 days ago,” Narduzzi said Tuesday around 12:30 p.m. “I feel right now that we’re going to put out a good product, once we find out who we’re playing (in the season opener). Which we still don’t know.”</p>
<p>Well, by 4 p.m., the Panthers knew. That’s how quickly things change in today’s college football news cycle.</p>
<p>Pitt will host Austin Peay from the Ohio Valley Conference on Sept. 12 at Heinz Field, filling the Panthers’ non-conference slot previously occupied by Miami (Ohio). The Panthers were supposed to pay $1.1 million to play Miami (Ohio), but that game was nixed when the Mid-American Conference postponed its fall slate two weeks ago.</p>
<p>Instead, Pitt will welcome the Governors, who went 11-4 and reached the Football Championship Subdivision quarterfinals in 2019.</p>
<p>While every FCS league has postponed fall sports, the Ohio Valley Conference is one of a few that is allowing its programs to schedule games in the fall — and Austin Peay is taking advantage of that opportunity. The Governors are scheduled to open the college football season on Aug. 29 against Central Arkansas, play at Cincinnati on Sept. 19 and now travel to Pittsburgh the week before.</p>
<p>Narduzzi said prior to the announcement that Pitt was “dancing around with a few folks.” But he felt confident athletic director Heather Lyke would lock down an opponent that can commit to the ACC’s COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>The ACC requires non-conference opponents to comply with its testing frequency, which is currently once a week, 72 hours prior to competition. However, Narduzzi expects those protocols to get stricter as the season approaches. He said last week that conference officials are discussing two PCR nasal swab tests earlier in the week and a Friday antibody test for every member of the team.</p>
<p>Narduzzi also said he was hopeful a replacement for Miami (Ohio) was secured by Thursday at the latest, so Pitt’s staff can go to work.</p>
<p>“Our [graduate assistants] and quality control guys are ready to do an all-nighter once we find out,” Narduzzi said. “It’s kind of like the NCAA tournament. You’re in the tournament, you get to the Sweet 16 and you don’t know who you’re playing yet.”</p>
<p>Now that the Panthers know, Narduzzi and his staff will introduce the players to Austin Peay’s depth chart and key players by Sunday, maybe sooner. Up until this point, Narduzzi’s players weren’t suffering by not knowing the opponent. In a normal year, they wouldn’t be prepping for the opening foe this early anyway.</p>
<p>But the coaching staff? That’s a different story.</p>
<p>Pitt’s staff typically starts scouting the Week 1 opponent after returning from the road recruiting in May. Of course, this May the coaches were at home, dissecting and making game plans over Zoom. Narduzzi said Pitt’s offensive and defensive coaches spent a week, maybe more, prepping for Miami (Ohio) during quarantine.</p>
<p>Narduzzi also lamented that his staff dedicated time to scouting North Carolina, Virginia and Duke — ACC Coastal opponents that were removed from Pitt’s conference slate during the league’s reshuffled scheduling last month. For someone so regimented in routine, it annoyed (and still annoys) Narduzzi that those hours were wasted.</p>
<p>But he acknowledged that North Carolina’s Mack Brown, Virginia’s Bronco Mendenhall and Duke’s David Cutcliffe probably wasted time preparing for Pitt, too. And now Austin Peay head coach Will Healy is in the same boat as Narduzzi: game planning how to beat a new foe in two weeks’ time.</p>
<p>“You’d like to know a heck of a lot earlier than this,” Narduzzi added. “But it’s equal for both of us.”</p>
