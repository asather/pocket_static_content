<h1>Port Authority schedules public sessions for long-range planning</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority will begin a series of online public input sessions next week as the first opportunity for residents to say what they want from public transit over the next 25 years.</p>
<p>The authority has been preparing for the long-range planning process since last summer but didn’t officially launch the effort, dubbed NEXTransit, until June 1. Working with consultant Michael Baker, the authority hopes to have a plan in place early next year.</p>
<p>“This the first opportunity for the public to provide input,” spokesman Adam Brandolph said.&nbsp;“We want robust pubic input. Obviously, with coronavirus, public outreach is different right now.”</p>
<p>The sessions, which begin July 27, will give six opportunities for residents to participate online or by telephone. Each session will begin with the same prerecorded presentation followed by discussion and questions with staff.</p>
<p>Later, the agency will conduct a survey to gather information and hopes to have in-person meetings when the COVID-19 pandemic eases.</p>
<p>Port Authority started a series of broad neighborhood meetings in January aimed at general transit concerns and ideas, but they were cut short by the pandemic. The NEXTransit sessions are aimed specifically at goals and plans for the next five, 10, 25 years.</p>
<p>“We want to hear all the ideas,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“If you think there should be better connections to the airport, tell us about it. If you think there should be light rail to the North Hills, let us know.”</p>
<p>Once the agency hears all the ideas, planners and consultants will develop priorities based on what people want and what could be reasonably affordable. That means no gold-plated subway to Cranberry no matter how many people want it.</p>
<p>“NEXTransit will give us the opportunity to inspire, innovate and implement ideas that promote a robust transit network that is accessible, equitable, reliable, flexible, comprehensive and safe,” CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman said in a news release.</p>
<p>“Whether it’s an extension of a busway, adding more trips to an underserved community, or placing greater importance on alternative-fuel vehicles, we want to hear what riders and non-riders want from their public transit system.”</p>
<p>One early element of the plan is expected to be a recommendation for a new maintenance garage that could cost $140 million or more. Right now, the agency’s expansion is limited because it doesn’t have space to handle more than the 720 buses in its current fleet.</p>
<p>The plan is expected to be a&nbsp;“living” document that adapts as needs, priorities and technology change over the years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At least we can get a sense for what the general wants and needs of the public are now,” Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>Here’s the schedule of online meetings, with two sessions scheduled each day:</p>
<p>• Monday, July 27, at 1 and 7 p.m.</p>
<p>• Aug. 6, at 9 a.m. and 5:30 p.m.</p>
<p>• Aug. 25, at 12:30 p.m. and 4 p.m.</p>
<p>Anyone who wants to participate online should visit&nbsp;<a title="NEXTransit meetings" href="https://nextransit.network/series1" target="_blank">https://nextransit.network/series1</a>. To participate by phone, dial&nbsp;855-925-2801 and use meeting code 8676.</p>
