<h1>Pirates sign fourth-round draft pick, announce coaching assignments for summer camp</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates continue to make progress in signing all of their selections from the 2020 MLB Draft.</p>
<p>On Monday, they announced their fourth-round pick, right-hander Jack Hartman, had signed his deal with the Pirates.</p>
<p>Hartman played his junior and senior seasons at Appalachian State, where he developed into a reliable reliever. In the shortened 2020 season, he accrued four saves, a 3.00 ERA and 22 strikeouts in 10 appearances, improving off the 2019 season in which he threw 26 strikeouts in 20 appearances.</p>
<p>Before his time with the Mountaineers, Hartman was primarily a position player at the College of Central Florida his sophomore season and Tallahassee Community College his freshman year.</p>
<p>“Jack hasn’t been pitching for very long but already shows very promising stuff with a fastball/slider&nbsp;combination that we believe has a chance to be very effective at the professional level,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said in a statement. “He’s a strong, physical pitcher with strong character and work&nbsp;ethic. We look forward to working with Jack in a Pirates uniform.”</p>
<p>Hartman’s signing adds to those of first-round pick <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/24/nick-gonzales-pirates-signing-2020-first-round-pick/stories/202006240126" target="_blank">Nick Gonzales</a> and fifth-rounder <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/27/pirates-logan-hofmann-contract-mlb-draft/stories/202006270049" target="_blank">Logan Hofmann</a>. Carmen Mlodzinski, Jared Jones and Nick Garcia — the competitive balance, second-round and third-round picks, respectively — have yet to sign.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching Assignments</strong></p>
<p>After releasing their 59-man summer camp roster on Sunday, the Pirates released an updated version of it on Monday with extra coaching assignments added in.</p>
<p>Baseball operations special assistants Jamey Carroll and Scott Elarton, along with infield coordinator Gary Green, will join the Pirates’ coaching staff in Pittsburgh. Minor league managers Brian Esposito (Triple-A Indianapolis), Joel Hanrahan (Double-A Altoona) and Miguel Perez (Low-A Greensboro) will be joined by Altoona hitting coach Jon Nunnally in Altoona, who will be coaching the alternate training site roster otherwise known as the “taxi squad.”</p>
