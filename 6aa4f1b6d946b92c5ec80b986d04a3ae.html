<h1>'We don't want to panic': Pirates staying vigilant about coronavirus protections</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — The Pirates got reminded of the virtues of proper hand washing and covering their mouths when they cough on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The team held a meeting with every player and staff member to discuss safety protocols for the virus that has caused about 3,000 deaths around the globe.</p>
<p>“This has been a collaborative effort from the commissioner’s office to the players association, to the CDC, to the World Health Organization and local government to create awareness,” Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk said about the meeting. “We wanted to create awareness of the signs and symptoms. We also wanted to make sure everyone is aware of the universal precautions that we should all be doing anyway.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, staff members spent the off-day doing a deep clean of their spring training facilities as a precaution for the newly discovered coronavirus, which causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The deep cleaning included using a sanitizing machine to disinfect the team’s clubhouse, offices, press box, suites, dugouts and concession stands.</p>
<p>News about COVID-19 hit close to home for the Pirates since one of the two known cases in Florida was in Manatee County, where the Pirates make their spring home in Bradenton. The other case was in Hillsborough County.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure guys are aware of what’s going on without creating panic,” Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon said. “It hits a bit more. We knew it was coming to America at some point, but when it’s this close, it makes you pay attention to it.”</p>

<p>The players were appreciative of the team taking the extra precautions for safety.</p>
<p>“We are probably a bit more alert than other teams with there being cases so close to us,” catcher Jacob Stallings said. “It was cool that they’re taking steps to make sure we’re safe.”</p>
<p>MLB has advised players to take precautions such as making sure the players don’t touch baseballs or pens handed to them by fans for autographs. Also, the league recommended players get up to date on their flu vaccines.</p>
<p>“They told us to be careful about our hygiene and how many high-fives you’re doing without washing your hands,” Taillon said. “It’s scary because it’s new and it’s spreading. But at the same time, there’s a lot of other dangerous things out there, too. So we don’t want to panic.”</p>
<p>No member of the organization or people around the organization has noted any symptoms of COVID-19.</p>

<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>• Chris Archer had a successful live batting practice session on Monday. The team expects Archer to pitch in a spring training game in the coming days.</p>
<p>• Steven Brault has a left shoulder muscle strain and will be shut down for two weeks, and Tomczyk acknowledged that the time frame likely will not work for Brault to be ready for opening day.&nbsp;Brault started to notice symptoms as camp started, but it became unbearable for him during his outing against the Orioles on Feb. 28.</p>
<p>“I’ve been feeling it for a little while. And we had been trying to deal with it and trying to work on it,” Brault said. “And it got to the point where throwing in that last game, it was good the first inning and then in-between innings it froze up.</p>
<p>“So when I went out for a second inning, I didn’t have anything. That’s when I knew it would probably be a good idea to come in and get it checked out.”</p>
<p>Brault struggled with a shoulder strain last season, which caused him to miss time. It appears that injury is in the same area.</p>
<p>“They can’t know for sure if it’s still the same thing,” Brault said. “So the idea is we’re taking it as if like maybe we didn’t take enough time and let it heal last year.”</p>
<p>• Clay Holmes is in a walking boot with a left fibula bone fracture. Nelson Cruz of the Twins hit a line drive that caromed off the bone in a game on Saturday at Fort Myers.</p>
<p>• Erik Gonzalez completed his baserunning progression as he recovers from a foot fracture. Gonzalez should be playing in games soon.</p>
<p>• Luke Maile is having a full workday on Wednesday. He is recovering from a left hamstring strain.</p>
<p><strong>Signings</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates agreed to terms on contracts for all 27 pre-arbitration eligible players before Wednesday’s split-squad games. The list includes pitchers like Kyle Crick, Nick Burdi, Brault, Holmes, Mitch Keller and Richard Rodriguez.</p>
<p>Position players like Jason Martin, Ke’Bryan Hayes, Oneil Cruz and Cole Tucker also were on the list.</p>
