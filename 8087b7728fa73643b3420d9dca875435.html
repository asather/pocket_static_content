<p>Whatchu gonna do when they come for you?</p>
<p>That’s a question yinzers will be able to get some answers to in several new episodes of the television series “COPS” that will feature Pittsburgh police.</p>
<p>Last week, the docu-style drama, which has been running for over three decades, tweeted out a photo of a city police cruiser heading across the Roberto Clemente Bridge.</p>
<p>“Pittsburgh, we have arrived,” the tweet read.</p>
<p>Three different production crews filmed throughout the city for about eight weeks last summer, gathering enough footage for five episodes, said Pittsburgh Public Safety spokeswoman Cara Cruz.</p>
<p>The first episode will air at 10 p.m. Monday, Feb. 10 on the Paramount Network.</p>
<p>Crews taped in zones 2, 3 and 5, as well as with narcotics and vice detectives, Ms. Cruz said.</p>
<p>Currently in its 32nd season, COPS will air two more Pittsburgh-based episodes in March. The show begins a new season this summer when the remaining two episodes will air.</p>
<p>COPS has filmed in Pittsburgh twice before; once in the early 1990s and again in the mid-2000s.</p>
