<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>United Hydrogen Group Inc. of Canonsburg has been acquired by Latham, N.Y.-based Plug Power Inc. for $65 million in a deal that included cash, stock and assumed debt, according to the companies.</p>
<p>In addition to United Hydrogenâ€™s offices in Southpointe, where six people work, the company operates hydrogen generation facilities in Charleston, Tenn. The Tennessee plant generates 6.4 tons of hydrogen daily, with plans to produce up to 10 tons a day.</p>
<p>The deal gives Plug Power, a veteran manufacturer of fuel cells, the resources needed to become a major supplier of hydrogen, which is used in making hydrogen fuel cells. The cells combine hydrogen and oxygen to generate electricity to power warehouse forklifts and experimental cars.</p>
<p>In addition to United Hydrogen, Plug Power purchased Giner ELX for $58 million. Newton, Mass.-based Ginger makes machines that generate hydrogen from water.</p>
