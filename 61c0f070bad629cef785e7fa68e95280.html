<h1>For St. Vincent archabbot, a new chapter of 'prayer and work'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Growing up in a Barberton, Ohio, parish whose multiple priests served as positive role models for him, Martin Bartel always thought about going into the priesthood himself. But after graduating from college with a business degree, he began to have other ideas.</p>
<p>“I kept putting it off,” he recalled. “I was wanting a career, wanting a car, wanting an apartment. But he realized if he didn’t at least explore the priesthood, his indecision could end up being a decision. “I said, I’d better give this a try.”</p>
<p>So his pastor said, “I know of this place in Latrobe,” and recommended he pay a visit to a historic monastery in the rolling hills of Westmoreland County. So he went for a&nbsp;weekend visit in 1978.</p>
<p>“If they would have permitted it, I would have stayed then and there,” he recalled.&nbsp;“The friendliness, the hospitality, the spirituality of the monks, I just can’t put it into words any more than I just felt absolutely at home.”</p>
<p>As soon as they did permit it, he entered St. Vincent Archabbey and became a novice monk.</p>
<p>More than four decades later, the Rev. Martin de Porres Bartel is now archabbot of St. Vincent Archabbey, the spiritual and administrative leader of one of the world’s largest Roman Catholic monasteries. (The abbey gets its “arch” prefix as an honorific in tribute to the historic prominence of the 174-year-old Benedictine monastery).</p>
<p>More than 150 Benedictine monks&nbsp;— some priests, some religious brothers&nbsp;— are based at the archabbey.&nbsp;About 100 of the monks reside at St. Vincent, with others serving parishes throughout the region, still others in schools and other ministries in more distant states, as well as Brazil and Taiwan.</p>
<p>Father Bartel’s fellow monks elected him in late June to succeed longtime Archabbot Douglas Nowicki, who has retired.</p>
<p>On Friday, members of the St. Vincent community gathered for a Mass as Greensburg Bishop Edward Malesic conferred a formal blessing on the new archabbot.</p>
<p>On one level, Archabbot Bartel, 64, has the resume for an administrative job.&nbsp;In addition to his master of divinity degree from St. Vincent Seminary, he has a law degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a master of business administration degree from Bowling Green State University.</p>
<p>He taught business at St. Vincent&nbsp;— then served as its president from 1995 to 2000.&nbsp;He jokes that he got the presidential appointment because he must have “missed a meeting,” but he found the work “particularly rewarding to see what we were accomplishing in the lives of our students.”</p>
<p>For much of the past two decades, he has served as pastor in the dioceses of Greensburg and Pittsburgh. Since 2013, he has been pastor of St.&nbsp;Frances Cabrini Parish in Center Township, a job that expanded by the time he finished last month to include administering three more partner parishes in Beaver County.</p>
<p>But Archabbot Bartel’s job description includes more than administration.</p>
<p>“The abbot ... is to hold the place of Christ in the monastery,” says the Rule of St. Benedict, the ancient governing principles of Benedictine monastic life. “ ... (He) should regulate and arrange all things so that souls might be saved and the monks may go about their activities without justifiable grumbling.’’</p>
<p>Archabbot Bartel plans to draw as much as anything on his pastoral experience.&nbsp;“Absolutely my number one responsibility is to be a spiritual father to all of our monks,” he said. “... It’s very rewarding being in the front lines of Catholicism and faith and worship.”</p>
<p>St. Vincent still is drawing new members, even if the numbers of people entering Catholic vocations is lower than it was decades ago. On Friday and Saturday, the monastery also formally welcomed two new novices, while one monk each took simple and solemn vows (steps in the monastic process).</p>
<p>“Despite a culture that may be telling us otherwise, people continue to hear a call, a voice in their heart and mind that says God wants some of us to devote ourselves to this kind of life in a more full-time way,” Archabbot Bartel said.</p>
<p>The Rule of St. Benedict is often summarized as&nbsp;“Ora et Labora,” Latin for prayer and work. Archabbot Bartel recognizes the challenge of balancing the rhythms of daily monastic prayer with the demands of being a pastor, teacher or administrator.</p>
<p>“I have felt that tension every day of my life,” he said.</p>
<p>In the monastery itself,&nbsp;“it’s a little easier to keep the prayer times because the life here revolves around it.” Parish life, however, revolves around “funerals, weddings, anointings, budgets, spaghetti dinners, you name it,” he recalled. “You try to make sure you get those [prayer times] in the course of your day. One day it might be 6 a.m., another might be 10 p.m.”</p>
<p>But working within “that tension helps me to do justice to both.”</p>
