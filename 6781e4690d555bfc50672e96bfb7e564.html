<h1>TV Q&amp;A: What’s going on with KDKA-TV’s morning news?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions online every Friday <a href="http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in" target="_blank">in Tuned In Journal blog at post-gazette.com/tv</a>. Here’s a selection of recent queries.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: What is going on with Channel 2. First they let Rick Dayton and Susan Koeppen go but now they bring John Shumway to the morning news?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— MARIE VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> At first I thought maybe Shumway was just subbing in the mornings, but his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=311137709932016" target="_blank">Facebook post from earlier this month</a> says morning work is his new assignment, moving him off afternoon reporting.</p>
<p>Every half-hour from 5-7 a.m. Shumway is in studio to present a local story he’s produced for the morning news. Then he solo anchors the 7-9 a.m. news block on WPCW-TV while doing local cut-ins during “CBS This Morning” on KDKA.</p>
<p>This change-up follows KDKA’s layoff of morning anchor Rich Dayton. Adding Shumway takes some of the load off remaining morning anchor Heather Abraham.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happened to MSNBC’s Contessa Brewer? I’ve not seen her on-air in years and can find nothing online about where she’s gone.</strong></p>
<p><strong>And where is MSNBC’s Thomas Roberts, and why isn’t he anchoring anymore?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;LAINA, REGENT SQUARE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Brewer left MSNBC <a href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/contessa-brewer-leaving-msnbc_n_936972" target="_blank">in 2011</a>. She joined <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/contessa-brewer/" target="_blank">CNBC as a correspondent and fill-in anchor </a>in 2017.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Roberts left MSNBC in 2017 and in June 2018 became an evening anchor at the CBS affiliate in Atlanta, a job he left in August 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there any news on when Xfinity will add the app for HBO Max?</strong></p>
<p><strong>— LINDA VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> There is still no deal between Comcast and WarnerMedia to bring an HBO Max app to Xfinity.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happened to MacGyver’s sidekick, Jack?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;JP VIA FACEBOOK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Actor George Eads chose to leave the series, reportedly to spend more time with his daughter in Los Angeles (“MacGyver” films in Atlanta).</p>
<p>His November 2018 request to producers to leave the show came after<a href="https://www.tvinsider.com/733937/george-eads-leaving-macgyver-cbs/" target="_blank"> reports of some sort of altercation in October 2018 where he stormed off the set.</a></p>
<p><strong>Q: Why did Conan O'Brien's show on TBS go from an hour to a half hour? Was any reason ever given?</strong></p>
<p><strong>—&nbsp;JARED VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> Yes, this was covered extensively when the announcement was made in 2018. Basically, there’s a lot of competition in late-night, and “Conan” found more success in special episodes — like his visits to foreign countries — than in the regular late-night talk show format. So TBS opted to rejigger the show’s format to the style that was working best for it already.</p>
<p>“I’ve been pushing for this for a while: something that fits the modern landscape, that certainly fits the way I interact with my fans more,” O’Brien said in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/arts/television/conan-obrien-talk-show-half-hour.html" target="_blank">a conference call with reporters covered by The New York Times</a>. “I was looking for something more lean and agile.”</p>
<p>Earlier this month “Conan” became the first late-night talk show during the pandemic to resume filming from a performance space, moving into Los Angeles’ Largo at the Coronet.</p>
