<h1>Add opportunities and more will hunt, Game Commission says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Whether they’re longtime hunters, young adults or school kids, the No. 1 reason given for the decline in hunting is time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In polls, public meetings and conversations, the Pennsylvania Game Commission has heard hunters of all ages say they hunt less often or drop out of the sport altogether because they can’t find the time.</p>
<p>“Opportunity has a lot to do with it,” said spokesman Travis Lau. “[Opportunity to] keep existing license buyers satisfied and coming back year after year, making it easier for occasional hunters to get out, encouraging people who’ve never hunted to give it a try.</p>
<p>“Extending seasons, adding weekend days to a season, creating new hunting seasons — those things give hunters more time to hunt [and] begin to erase that primary reason people walk away from hunting.”</p>
<p>It’s not just about the loss of tradition, he said. State and federal governments use revenue from the sale of hunting licenses and firearms to fund most wildlife management. Also, hunting seasons are regulated so that the annual harvest accomplishes most wildlife management goals.</p>
<p>Late last month, the board of commissioners gave preliminary approval to a slate of 2020-21 hunting seasons and bag limits that seek to increase hunting opportunities.</p>
<p>The biggest change is the addition of three Sundays to the hunting schedule, approved by Pennsylvania in a series of historic votes in 2019. A day of Sunday hunting will be added to the statewide archery and firearm deer seasons, as well as the statewide firearm bear season.</p>
<p>Squirrel season would be extended into the warm weeks of September. Archery deer would extend deeper into the rut and overlap with the general bear season. The state would bring back a three-day Thanksgiving turkey hunting season and add a week to the archery bear season.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s mentored hunting program was expanded in recent years. A hunting recruitment tool that was initially open only to youth under 12 now offers opportunities to unlicensed hunters of all ages.</p>
<p>The Saturday start of deer season, which began last year, is considered by the Game Commission to be an expansion of hunting opportunity. Included in the proposed 2020-21 seasons are eight days of uninterrupted deer hunting: a Saturday opener Nov. 28, followed by a Sunday hunt Nov. 29 and continued through Saturday, Dec. 5. The season would resume Dec. 7 and end Dec. 12.</p>
<p>“There was a spike in hunting license sales before the [2019] firearm deer opener,” said Mr. Lau. “There may be a number of reasons for that, among them the opportunity that the Saturday opening created for people who had been unable to get off work or school on a Monday.”</p>
<p>Some hunters see it differently.</p>
<p>“It’s true we had a 1,067 increase in license sales in the 18-34 age group before opening day,” said Randy Santucci, southwest regional director of Unified Sportsmen, a statewide group that has challenged Game Commission policy on this and other issues. “But if you look at the big picture, the trade-off is just awful.”</p>
<p>The McKees Rocks resident opposed the Saturday start in testimony before the Game Commission last year, warning that ending the 60-year Monday opening day would irrevocably destroy hunting camp culture. Weeks ago, Mr. Santucci circulated statements from business owners and state Sen. Scott Hutchinson, R-Butler, outlining lost retail sales at some shops due to the loss of the Monday opener. He will be among several speakers invited to testify Feb. 20 at a meeting of the state House Game and Fisheries Committee in Charleroi during a review of the 2019 deer season opener.</p>
<p>“The increased sales could be part and parcel of the cumulative effect of every increase in hunting opportunity in the last five years,” he said. “The Game Commission is saying it’s all because of the Saturday opener.”</p>
<p>“If the agency is trying to make the sport more appealing from the family perspective, I think they’ve missed the boat. Opportunity can help, but in the big picture opportunity has not proven to stimulate as many sales as it has taken away tradition, as we’ve done here.”</p>
<p>The public is invited to observe the meeting of the House Game and Fisheries Committee from 5 to 7 p.m. Feb. 20 at the Mon Valley Career Tech Center, 5 Guttman Blvd., Charleroi. Comments on the proposed 2020-21 seasons and bag limits, as well as other Game board actions, will be accepted through the next meeting of the Game Commission on April 6-7.
