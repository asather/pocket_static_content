<h1>Darius Kasparaitis gifted his series-winning stick and puck to ... Alex Ovechkin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An important part of Penguins lore is now in the hands of one of the team’s greatest rivals.</p>
<p>In 2001, the Penguins were locked in a hard-fought Eastern Conference semifinal series with the Buffalo Sabres. Games 5 and 6 resulted in <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/playoffs/2001-buffalo-sabres-vs-pittsburgh-penguins-eastern-conference-semi-finals.html" target="_blank">3-2 overtime victories for each team</a>. The Penguins wound up beating the Sabres in Buffalo in Game 7 — you guessed it — 3-2 off an overtime goal by Darius Kasparaitis that sent the Penguins to the Eastern Conference final (where they lost to the defending champion Devils in five games). It was easily the biggest goal of Kasparaitis’ career, who <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/k/kaspada01.html" target="_blank">only scored 27 goals</a> during his time in the NHL from 1992-2006.</p>

<p>Kasparaitis apparently kept the stick and puck he used to score that series-winning goal. On Tuesday, he said on Instagram that he is “donating” both to none other than Washington Capitals star Alex Ovechkin.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor and I hope he will catch the great one,” Kasparaitis wrote on Instagram.</p>
<p>He was presumably referring to “The Great One” Wayne Gretzky, who owns the <a href="https://www.hockey-reference.com/leaders/goals_career.html" target="_blank">NHL career record</a> for goals scored with 894. The 34-year-old Ovechkin is eighth all-time on that list with 706 career goals. (In case you were wondering, Mario Lemieux is 11th with 690 goals, Sidney Crosby is 56th with 467 and Evgeni Malkin is 87th with 416.)</p>
<p>Ovechkin took to Instagram himself and thanked Kasparaitis for the generous present.</p>
<p>“All hockey fans remember the goal that Darius Kasparaitis scored in the 7th game against the Sabres?” Ovechkin said, via a little help from Google Translate. “So this stick is now in my collection, and then it will be in my museum! Thank you very much for such a gift!”</p>
