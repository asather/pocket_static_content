<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Theater announced Thursday night that it will not be moving forward with a planned production of the play “American Son” due to growing concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We are so proud of the artists and community members who have come together to tell this incredible story, and we’re heartbroken to not be able to share it further,” Marya Sea Kaminski, the show’s artistic director, said in a statement.</p>
<p>The show — about a mother and father waiting in a police station for information about their son — was in previews and scheduled to open Friday. Both the opening night and the rest of the show’s run have been canceled.</p>
<p>Kaminski made the announcement along with managing director Lou Castelli and Pittsburgh Public Theater’s Board of Directors. The show was being directed by Justin Emeka and would have starred Bianca LaVerne Jones, David Whalen, Michael Patrick Trimm and Guiesseppe Jones.</p>
<p>A dramatized version of “American Son” is currently streaming on Netflix featuring the original Broadway cast, which includes Kerry Washington, Steven Pasquale and Jeremy Jordan.</p>
<p>“What’s exciting for me is how much we are adding to the story with the four people we have in the room, and how much we are bringing to the story with who we are,” Emeka <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/02/28/American-Son-Pittsburgh-Public-Theater-Netflix-Broadway/stories/202002280147" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette</a> in early March regarding Pittsburgh Public Theater’s version of&nbsp;“American Son”.</p>
<p>“I feel like we are offering something special, beyond what’s been done.”</p>
<p>“American Son” is not the first Pittsburgh theater cancellation due to COVID-19 concerns, though it is the most high-profile.</p>
<p>Point Park University&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/03/12/Point-Park-Pittsburgh-Playhouse-moves-forward-with-Pippin/stories/202003110137" target="_blank">canceled its run of “Pippin”</a> after its first and final show Thursday evening, the University of Pittsburgh opted to postpone its upcoming production of the musical “Head Over Heels” and Bricolage canceled this weekend’s performance of its storytelling series “WordPlay.”</p>
<p>City Theatre also announced late Thursday night that it had decided to cancel the remaining performances of the play “Cry It Out”.</p>
<p>“This is uncharted territory for us and we do not make this decision lightly,” City Theatre said in a statement. “Our artists have put in an incredible amount of work in order for this important and heartwarming story to be shared. If you are currently ticketed for ‘Cry It Out’, we will be contacting you individually to discuss options.”</p>
<p>As of now, the production of the Tony-winning musical “The Band’s Visit” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2020/03/12/The-Band-s-Visit-Benedum-Pittsburgh-COVID-19-City-Theatre/stories/202003110122" target="_blank">currently playing at the Benedum Center</a> continues to be performed.</p>
