<h1>Masks for everyone at WVU — even in classes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We’re talking a lot of masks, here.</p>
<p>West Virginia University will require all students, faculty and staff to wear them this fall while on campus, including in classrooms, as part of a plan to reopen the land-grant university for the new school year amid the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>There will be other changes to campus life, too, <a href="https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus/what-you-need-to-know#academic-calendar" target="_blank">many announced Wednesday</a>, including a requirement that all students and employees complete a COVID-19 education course before Aug. 11.</p>

<p>The on-campus fall semester that starts Aug. 19 will run without a fall break and conclude earlier than usual on Nov. 24 — with a week of remote instruction after Thanksgiving, followed by final exams that also will be taken remotely.</p>
<p>Spring semester will start Jan. 19 and run — without a spring break — with classes ending April 30, followed by finals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There will be mandatory testing for the coronavirus. Classroom densities will be reduced by 50% whenever possible, and the instruction itself will be a mix of in-person and remote instruction. There will be travel and campus-visitation restrictions, and fall study abroad is canceled.</p>
<p>WVU president E. Gordon Gee said university officials weighed the wisdom of bringing students back to campus, but moved ahead with necessary precautions after concluding students preferred it even with restrictions, including the masks.</p>
<p>“We are planning to provide a kit containing a mask/face covering as students, faculty/staff arrive or return to campus,” said WVU spokeswoman April Kaull. “We’ve ordered 42,000 masks and gaiters to accommodate them on our three campuses.”</p>
<p>The amount needed actually could be 35,000 to 37,000, depending on final enrollment figures, she said.</p>
<p>University officials said they <a href="https://www.wvu.edu/return-to-campus" target="_blank">will be providing additional details</a> in the coming days and weeks before a final welcome-back announcement Aug. 4.</p>
<p>“This is new territory. We may not always have all the answers,” Mr. Gee said in a message to students and employees. “Be mindful that public health conditions may change that would redirect our work.”</p>
