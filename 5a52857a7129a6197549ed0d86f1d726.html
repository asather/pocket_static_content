<h1>Two-out runs doom Pirates Monday, entire series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>MILWAUKEE — Pirates manager Derek Shelton talks often about learning and developing. It’s not necessarily exciting to read or hear about, but with where the Pirates are, it’s absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>The Pirates picked up a couple of teaching points Monday during a 6-5 loss to the Brewers at Miller Park, one that finished a series where Milwaukee did much of its damage with two outs.</p>
<p>Of the 23 runs the Brewers scored, 16 came with two outs, including a single from pinch-hitter Orlando Arcia off Chris Stratton in the eighth inning Monday, which allowed center fielder Ben Gamel to score the go-ahead run.</p>
<p>“It is a teaching point, and it comes down to execution and not trying to do too much,” Shelton said. “Once we get over that hump of trying to do too much with the pitch, we’re going to execute the pitch, we’re going to be out of innings, and we’re going to give ourselves a chance to go out and continue to play.</p>
<p>“If we don’t execute those pitches, we put ourselves in a situation where balls are up, and guys get hits.”</p>
<p>The pitch selection was curious, as the sequencing was similar to what Stratton did against Arcia on Saturday — fastball for a strike, then back to the slider. Shelton had no problem with the pitch selection. He had a bigger issue with the location, believing the pitch from Stratton a little too hittable.</p>
<p>“We got him to 2-2, and I would’ve preferred he threw him two sliders in a row,” Shelton said. “We just didn’t execute the pitch. It wasn’t the pitch selection. It was the execution of the pitch.”</p>
<p>Arcia’s single, of course, came with two outs, after Nik Turley allowed a double to Gamel and intentionally walked another pinch-hitter, Avisail Garcia.</p>
<p>In the ninth, the Pirates stood no chance, as the real Josh Hader reappeared. The Brewers closer inexplicably lost his control on Saturday, walking five to blow a lead Milwaukee would eventually get back, but he was unhittable Monday.</p>
<p>Hader struck out Cole Tucker, Erik Gonzalez and Adam Frazier for an easy save.</p>
<p>“Really good back end, and they just locked things down,” Shelton said of Hader and Devin Williams, who combined for 2 2/3 innings with no hits or runs allowed and seven strikeouts.</p>
<p>While it appeared the Pirates might be headed for a lopsided loss, they evened the score with a run in the fifth and two more in the sixth. Those came on Frazier’s run-scoring single, and a two-out, two-run single from Jose Osuna.</p>
<p>The Pirates got off to a sloppy start, as they made a pair of errors — both by Kevin Newman at second base — and Trevor Williams walked two and hit a batter in the first four innings.</p>
<p>Milwaukee scored its first two runs on the first Newman miscue. Ranging to his left while playing second base, Newman had the ball kick off the heel of his glove. He hurried and made a throw, but it wasn’t accurate, the ball ticking off the outside of Colin Moran’s glove at first.</p>
<p>It was a tough situation, too, as it looked like the Pirates were about to escape a nobody-out, bases-loaded jam; Williams got a strikeout and a grounder to second before Newman’s miscue with two outs.</p>
<p>Gonzalez tied the score with his third home run of the season in the third inning, a two-run shot off left-hander Brent Suter.</p>
<p>A clean single from Gamel in the third pushed the Brewers ahead, 3-2, before another errant throw by Newman — this time on a relay while trying to complete a double play — allowed catcher Omar Narvaez to score.</p>
<p>That gave the Pirates 28 errors on the season, moving them into a tie with the Giants for the most in Major League Baseball. The Pirates led MLB in errors last season with 121.</p>
<p>“We’ve got to catch the ball,” Shelton said. “That’s extremely important. We’ve been inconsistent in certain places, and we can’t continue to make routine errors.”</p>
<p>Williams rang up a high pitch count. He was at 84 through four and didn’t make it much longer; Shelton lifted Williams after he gave up a solo home run to Brewers second baseman Keston Hiura leading off the fifth.</p>
<p>“Body felt good, arm felt good, stuff felt good,” Williams said. “It wasn’t the most efficient outing. They did a good job of sticking to their hitting plan.”</p>
<p>Jacob Stallings went 1-for-3 to finish August with a batting average of .392 (20-for-51). Jason Kendall (.400 in September 2004) remains the last Pirates catcher to hit .400 or better in a month.</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Tyler Bashlor worked a 1-2-3 seventh. Although his sinker has averaged 94.8 mph this season, he touched 97 mph several times. … Gregory Polanco struck out twice, giving him 37 strikeouts in 79 at-bats this season, a rate of 47%.</p>
