<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 04.06.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi everyone. Not a whole lot has changed for the Steelers since last we chatted, but we're here for your coronacatharsis all the same.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Knock on (lots of) wood, the Pittsburgh area so far is relatively safer on the virus. Could that lead to the city, and others where the risk is smaller, hosting many more NFL games than normal? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's well above my pay grade, but I do remember when this all first started canceling events that the NBA was looking at potential neutral site venues in cities less affected by COVID. No idea if people who matter are still thinking along those lines, but it would be interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Hi Brian! Thanks for the chats! Has Barron been signed as a free agent yet? Can the Steelers get him cheaper to help with depth? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nope, he's still out there. I addressed the possibility in my mailbag on Thursday <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/02/eric-ebron-pittsburgh-steelers-antonio-brown-mark-barron/stories/202004020127" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/02/eric-ebron-pit...</a></p>
<p><strong>AA</strong>: Do we see the Steelers taking a QB in any round of this year’s draft? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Personally, no. But I have seen some of the national mock draft folks slot a QB to the Steelers, usually as early as the third-round comp pick. I've seen Jalen Hurts linked the most, but also Jacob Eason from Washington. The logic to that is that the Steelers could use an upgrade at backup QB, and a cheap one. But I still don't think it's gonna happen. It doesn't align at all with what the team has said about Mason Rudolph since last season ended.</p>
<p><strong>Pishquedoodle</strong>: Have ever looked at NDSU edge rusher Derrek Tuszka? Could be a sleeper in 5th or 6th, but I have hunch we will hear from him on Sundays in the future. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Certainly not a guy who's been on my radar, dear Pishquedoodle, but once you get into that range, I don't mind a "sleeper" pick. Especially for the Steelers and especially at a position like edge rusher, where they have two studs currently but could use someone to develop behind them.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi brian, Who do you think steeler will draft in 2nd round. I think they should go Ol Rb or Lb <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, guest. I do think they should draft an OL and LB (maybe even two of each) at some point, but I don't love the idea of going RB again. I was initially advocating for a TE at 49, but now that Eric Ebron is in the fold, I've been on the WR corner. Ray Fittipaldo and I went back and forth on this at length in our podcast last week (he says RB, I say WR). Check it out if you haven't <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/02/pittsburgh-steelers-mock-draft-podcast-jonathan-taylor-james-conner-kevin-colbert/stories/202004020150" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/02/pittsburgh-ste...</a></p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sue</strong>: Brian, let’s think you are the boss, @ 49 if an OL is available like Ruiz and Cushenberry vs a WR like Hamlet, Reagor and Claypool .. and they are BPA.. how would you rank those five players if you have to choose one thru five in your view? Rank them for us, Thank you! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Those WRs are very close for me. I'd probably go Chase Claypool, Jalen Reagor, KJ Hamler, Cesar Ruiz, Lloyd Cushenberry. But I could easily hear the argument the Steelers need a playmaker like Reagor or Hamler more than a big-bodied type like Claypool. Had the Steelers not signed Stefen Wisniewski, I'd probably want Ruiz more than all of them.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: IF Jameis Winston was willing to take a reasonable salary at backup money and come in knowing he was going to only backup Ben for next two years, what would be the downside in that for the Steelers? Steelers would then have much better insurance for Ben while he still plays and someone who would still be in his 20s and can be a franchise QB when Ben retires. Plus Winston could benefit from learning behind Ben. I just don’t see the downside in that if the money was right. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure, if the money's right, that could make sense. But you have to also account for locker room chemistry, and throwing another big personality in there like Winston's might be risky. And good luck getting any NFL player, especially a competitor like Winston, to just say "OK, sure, I'm happy to ride the bench for two years."</p>
<p><strong>This Guy</strong>: This guy is starting to wonder if we will even have an NFL season and if we do will it be drastically different. What are you hearing/thinking? I'm already super bummed the Riverhounds season may not happen...they won't take away the Steelers too will they? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't know, This Guy. Logically, it's more likely to be an NFL season without fans. Hard to imagine? Yes. But worth it if it means having a season at all? I say also yes. This is all uncharted territory, though. Who thought we'd ever not have an NCAA tournament? Just don't be surprised by anything at this point is what I would suggest.</p>
<p><strong>Tom88</strong>: Brian, I hope you and yours are safe and sound. Do you think the Steelers would take Dobbins if he is available for their first pick? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, Tom, same to you. I am safe, but hardly sound. From the sounds of Kevin Colbert last week, I'm not ruling out a running back at all, even if I personally wouldn't go that route. And as long as they're considering a running back, I don't see why they wouldn't be considering the big three of JK Dobbins, Jonathan Taylor and D'Andre Swift.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Marcus Allen was a stud DB at Penn State, why do you think this hasn't carried over to the pro game? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Lot of coverage responsibility, and at the NFL level, the receivers and quarterbacks are better than you're facing in college football, even the Big Ten. Plus it doesn't help him that they drafted a first-rounder at his same position the same year. He's effectively been blocked by Terrell Edmunds, and I'm not sure either one of those two can be a true free safety, such as it is in the Steelers' scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Blood sweat and beers</strong>: Have you heard anything on Akeem Davis Gaithersburg A very versatile player who can play lb/cb/s big and fast ranked around 80 <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah he seems to be the consensus for next-best ILB after you get past the tiers of Isaiah Simmons from Clemson (in a class by himself at the top) then Kenneth Murray from Oklahoma and Patrick Queen from LSU. Davis-Gaither might be a bit of a reach at 49 though, and I still think the Steelers are determined to go offense there, so we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: I guess the chances of the Steelers being on Hard Knocks has diminished since the shutdown <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Never really thought the Steelers would be in position to be mandated to appear on Hard Knocks. But given the other candidates this year, and how much of a no-brainer it would be to pick them, I figured it'd take an act of god for the Steelers to avoid it. And, well, here we are...</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: How would you rank the Steelers’ needs? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>DallasDave</strong>: What are your thoughts on some of the Future Reserve players? I think John Battle looks promising. I am expecting the Steelers to bring in a lot of UDFAs and former AAF players this year to compete for depth due to our Cap situation. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah I think John Battle from LSU, signed back in January, has the best chance of being a Kam Kelly type this year (not that he played particularly well when he got his shot, but still). As far as XFL products go, the linemen are a little interesting. Cavon Walker was productive as a defensive tackle in that setting, and Jarron Jones has quite the backstory of injuries and position changes since being a big time recruit at Notre Dame.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan</strong>: If we had to go defense, In your estimation which ILB and/or OLB player would be worth taking with our first pick value wise.. meaning reasonable player Not one that obviously more than likely won’t be there.. thanks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That's a good question. I'll say Josh Uche, edge rusher from Michigan. Played with Devin Bush and we know how the Steelers like those Wolverines.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Brian - Do the Steelers view Ola and Tuzar as promising? They are the only real depth at OLB and did not address in FA (though could in the draft) <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Lack of action in free agency could suggest that yes, they do think they have a couple promising prospects in those undrafted guys from Toledo. But lack of either one getting reps ahead of Anthony Chickillo last year (and, to an extent, even Jayrone Elliott) ISN'T as encouraging. Tuzar Skipper's process has been kind of strange given the way he made the team, then didn't make it, then went to NYG but ultimately wasn't called back right away after getting cut there.</p>
<p><strong>BIGBenito</strong>: Thanks for your chats Brian. I appreciate your time. <br> <strong>BIGBenito</strong>: Who do you think will be available at WR when the Steelers pick at 49? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You're welcome, Benito. That very question was sort of the inspiration behind the two first-round mock drafts I've done. <br> <br> One where only three wideouts go in Round 1: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/24/steelers-mock-draft-nfl-2020-prospects-pittsburgh-needs/stories/202003010271" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/24/steelers-mock-...</a><br> <br> And one where 10 go in Round 1: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/31/steelers-mock-draft-nfl-2020-prospects-pittsburgh-needs-wide-receivers/stories/202003310002" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/31/steelers-mock-...</a><br> <br> Naturally, the real scenario will likely be somewhere in between, but you're probably most realistically looking at guys like KJ Hamler, Jalen Reagor and maybe Donovan Peoples-Jones in that range.</p>
<p><strong>GM</strong>: In your opinion now that Brady's gone from the division. What's stopping us from getting SB #7? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Tom Brady's gone from the division but Lamar Jackson and the Ravens aren't. Patrick Mahomes is still in the AFC. And last I checked, you still have to beat an NFC team to win the Super Bowl, so it's not as if TB12 is completely out of the picture. Not that I expect the Bucs to be that good, but hey, they might be better than the Patriots this year.</p>
<p><strong>paul</strong>: I think they should target a Center with their 1st pick and have him back up guard and learn for a year or 2. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not a bad idea Paul, but Maurkice Pouncey is still only going to be 31 this season. Granted, he has said that when 7 retires, he's done too. Most of the top interior OL in this draft have center experience.</p>
<p><strong>Jud</strong>: What free agents do you think the Steelers are still kicking the tires on? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sounds like they're probably done in FA, at least for a while. Now that we're into the second wave and getting ever closer to the draft, most teams are focusing more on that and allocating their cap room for rookies. That's especially true for the Steelers, who are "up against it" as Kevin Colbert put it last week.</p>
<p><strong>HeathenSteeler</strong>: Brian, Love your chats. My question is do you think that a guy like Dobbins would be better suited to the Steelers than Taylor or Swift? Dobbins is a hard runner and has very good hands in the passing game. I personally think he would be the best fit for the Steelers if they had their choice of the big 3 and they were in on a #1 RB this year. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thank you, Heathen. I don't think Dobbins is any more a fit than those other two. Taylor might even be the ideal back in this draft for the Steelers given his size and breakaway speed. I think he's more capable of being a true three-down back than those other two.</p>
<p><strong>Boston Yinzer</strong>: Hi Brian. What happens to players' contracts if the season is cancelled? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Short answer: No one knows. Longer answer: There'd probably be a lengthy and heated legal battle of some sort between the NFLPA and the league itself. Chalk this up as one of the many reasons, maybe the biggest, as to why the NFL figures to do everything within its power to not lose this season. That'd be a huge drain on revenue all around.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: To your knowledge, is Ben working out throwing to a receiver yet? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yes, Ben has said he's thrown with Steelers teammate Ryan Switzer. But last I saw of him, he was at home social distancing with his family and imploring others to do the same.</p>
<p><strong>Jud</strong>: How much access do you have at this point? Are there conference calls with the media? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not a ton, but that's fairly standard for this time of year anyway. The Steelers put together conference calls with local media for Kevin Colbert, Eric Ebron, Derek Watt and Stefen Wisniewski over the past couple weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Krut</strong>: Hey Brian- Thanks for the Corona chat. I believe we have a 2 year window to be a SB contender with Ben. My opinion is to get him protection and weapons. OL, WR, RB. When he retires we are going to need and find that franchise QB again. History says that guy isn't available in late rounds (except Brady). Do you sense that feeling around the team too? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure. I don't think you'll ever hear NFL owners, GMs or coaches use the cliched "window" terminology, but they've certainly been open about placing a lot of confidence in Ben Roethlisberger as their quarterback until he isn't. And talking to players last year when he went down, there was a lot of acknowledgement that you simply don't replace a franchise quarterback. You just try to do the best you can to find ways to work around it. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And just like that, another hour has flown by. Thanks for stopping by, everyone. Keep an eye out for another podcast from Ray Fittipaldo and me later this week, in addition to our usual slate of stories on post-gazette.com.</p>
