<h1>Jordan Stovka: The legacy of Mac Miller</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I woke up early to gray, overcast skies on the morning of Jan. 17.</p>
<p>With cold air seeping through thin walls, I made myself a cup of tea, curled up on my twin-sized mattress and played Mac Miller’s new, posthumous “Circles” over my speakers. For 48 bittersweet minutes, I did nothing but sit and listen.</p>
<p>In doing so, I experienced an odd sense of discontentment and closure, excitement and sadness. While the soulful melodies satisfyingly balanced with energetic catchiness, lyrics like “I cannot be changed / I cannot be changed” and “Everybody’s gotta live / everybody’s gotta die” were haunting reminders of the late songwriter’s demons. “You’re feeling sorry / I’m feeling fine” comforted just as much as it burned.</p>
<p>When the album finished with the song “Once A Day,” I did what any normal person would do with the last words of someone they loved: I played them over and over again.</p>
<p>It’s a strange phenomenon to grieve someone you’ve never met.</p>
<p>To anyone outside of the Mac universe, I probably sound overdramatic and delusional, claiming to have mourned him for at least a minute every day since his death. My own family had trouble understanding why I’d driven 300 miles to my home city of Pittsburgh to attend his vigil at Blue Slide Park.</p>
<p>Anyone who has followed his discography, though, can attest to the odd closeness they feel toward Mac Miller. He seemed to be just as authentic with his listeners as he was with his friends and family.</p>
<p>We, as his loyal fans, saw him come of age. His albums and mixtapes are like childhood school photos that replace one another in the same frame each passing year. “KIDS” was full of teenage ideas, with songs about Nikes and skipping class. “Watching Movies with the Sound Off” represented a young person’s growth, as Mac opened up about issues like depression and addiction. “Swimming,” released a month before Mac’s death, saw the 26-year-old singing about the importance of self-care.</p>
<p>Mac invited each of us into every stage of his life. In return, we wove him into the soundtrack of ours.</p>
<p>I grieved his death by playing his music nonstop but, before long, the experience of listening to Mac no longer seemed the same.</p>
<p>His voice adopted a ghostly quality, and certain lines — “To everyone who sell me drugs / Don't mix it with that [expletive]&nbsp;/ I’m hopin' not to join the 27 club”&nbsp;—&nbsp; became extra chilling given the circumstances of his death.</p>
<p>I took some time away, not listening to his music at all. I needed some distance from the emotional distress that lingered with every beat, rap and sample.</p>
<p>Within the past year, I’ve come to reserve Mac’s music only for sacred, emotional spaces. His music — particularly his later releases — accompany me only on long drives alone in my car or late at night as I lay awake counting paint chips on the ceiling. “Swimming” consoles my homesickness and heartbreak, while “Circles” is for moments of meditation and contemplation.</p>
<p>I hear similar feelings from fellow Mac fans. We lament together about the unfairness of his death, and confer about how deeply his music still stings. Even now, many have told me that they have yet to listen to the new album because they’re waiting for the perfect uninterrupted hour of solitude they want to appreciate it properly.</p>
<p>I’ve played “Circles” on repeat for myself since its release, realizing that the album alone creates the desired intimate space for those who listen. And when paired with “Swimming,” the two records complete a conversation that was previously left unfinished. Where “Swimming” is confessional, “Circles” is aspirational. While the former is frustrated with destructive monotony, the latter is dedicated to growth and healing.</p>
<p>It’s been said that with this posthumous release, Mac’s career and life have come full circle. He left us not only as a rapper, but as an accomplished songwriter, musician and artist. He was not just a performer; he was also a loyal friend and an empathetic confidante.</p>
