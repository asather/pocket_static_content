<h1>Alterations proposed for Alcosan wet weather plan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It took more than two decades for the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority to come up with a federally acceptable plan to remove billions of gallons of sewage-laced stormwater from area rivers and streams, but just three months to propose major changes to the wet weather plan.</p>
<p>One of those changes, according to an Alcosan PowerPoint shown at a virtual public meeting in August, would reroute the Monongahela River stormwater storage tunnel away from the river on a cross-city corridor deep underneath Uptown and the lower Hill and Strip districts. The proposal would extend that tunnel under the Allegheny River near where I-579 crosses on the Veterans Bridge, and link it to a planned Ohio River storage tunnel on the North Side that will be built along the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. From there, the water would go to the Alcosan treatment plant in Woods Run.</p>
<p>Joseph Vallarian, an Alcosan spokesperson, declined to identify the exact route of the proposed crosstown tunnel, saying in an email response to questions that despite the PowerPoint, “There is not a finalized map for public consumption at this time.”</p>
<p>The U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh approved a consent decree in May committing Alcosan to a $2 billion-plus Clean Water Plan that provides a blueprint for reducing stormwater and sewage overflows into the region’s rivers and streams that occur almost every time it rains.</p>
<p>That plan shows the Mon tunnel following that river to its confluence at the Point and then routing under the Ohio River to the North Shore.</p>
<p>The proposed modifications would add a total of 1.1 miles to the more than 15 miles of 14-foot diameter storage tunnels Alcosan plans to build 125 to 130 feet underground, mostly along the rivers. It would also eliminate all six interconnections with existing sewer mains and outfalls, and remove a new pumping station and retention basin in the Monongahela River drainage.</p>
<p>The aim of the proposed changes, Mr. Vallarian said in his email, is to improve sewer-system efficiency and reduce costs, though he added that the total cost of the sewer-system upgrade, estimated at $2 billion-plus, hasn’t changed.</p>
<p>He said the final tunnel alignment would depend on multiple factors, including property acquisition and ongoing adjustments to the plan.</p>
<p>“Any tunneling will be deep and disruption will be very little, if at all,” Mr. Vallarian wrote. “Naturally, we will be having discussions with affected stakeholders as time progresses.”</p>
<p>But Tom Hoffman, a Sierra Club consultant who attended the virtual Aug. 12 meeting, was critical of Alcosan.</p>
<p>“The ink isn’t even dry on the federal consent decree and Alcosan is requesting these major, major changes,” Mr. Hoffman said.</p>
<p>“Our feeling is that after taking 25 years to come up with a plan, we have a real problem with the way this was done. The changes need to be scrutinized with the same attention the original plan was.”</p>
<p>John Stephen, a leader of the Negley Run Watershed Taskforce and member of Alcosan’s Municipal Advisory Committee, also said Alcosan’s decisions on such a major regional infrastructure investment should be made more openly because they impact overlapping stormwater control, riverfront access, flood mitigation and integrated watershed management.</p>
<p>“The consent decree requires Alcosan to establish a Municipal Advisory Committee that, if fully engaged, could help with transparency,” Mr. Stephen said. “Providing periodic updates on its engineering or flow-management planning would bring the surprises to an end.”</p>
<p>Alcosan plans to submit its proposed changes to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection on Oct. 1 for review and approval, Mr. Vallarian said, and to the Allegheny County Health Department for review and comment.</p>
<p>The proposed revisions would extend the Ohio River storage tunnel 2.7 miles up the Allegheny River, under the North Shore. It will be built first and is closest to the Alcosan treatment facility in Woods Run, which is undergoing a $300 million expansion that will eventually double its treatment capacity.</p>
<p>The Allegheny River tunnel will be shortened by 2.5 miles. The Monongahela River tunnel, in addition to being rerouted, will be extended by four-fifths of a mile.</p>
<p>“Our studies show that refinements to the tunnel alignments and lengths will more quickly provide cleaner and healthier rivers and streams,” Mr. Vallarian wrote.</p>
<p>The plan approved in May also included as many as six connections between existing and new tunnels, but Alcosan now says that “eliminating most of the connections would reduce costs without compromising the performance of the system.”</p>
<p>The existing consent decree does contain “adaptive management” language that allows it to be altered to use new technologies, including “green infrastructure” such as bioswales, permeable pavement, and roof and rain gardens, to better reduce overflows.</p>
<p>While all of the proposed changes address what Mr. Vallarian called the “gray backbone [of] the Alcosan system,” he said municipal-source controls and use of green infrastructure to keep stormwater out of the sewer system could provide “parallel paths to reducing costs and increasing the efficiency of the system.”</p>
<p>The proposed plan alterations would not change the project completion date, now at the end of 2036, Mr. Vallarian said.</p>
<p>The Alcosan system, which was built in the 1950s and serves about 825,000 people, is one of hundreds of older sewer systems in the U.S. that were designed to channel storm-swollen sewage overflows directly into rivers and streams to prevent damage to treatment facilities.</p>
<p>The federal Clean Water Act, passed in 1972 and amended in 1987, made most of those discharges illegal, and the authority and its 82 municipal customers and the city of Pittsburgh have known since 1994 that they must significantly reduce the estimated 9 billion gallons of annual overflows. In 1997, the EPA threatened to fine Alcosan and its member communities $275 million if the unhealthy discharges continued.</p>
<p>Alcosan’s proposed tunnels will let the system store the wet weather flows rather than discharge them into area waterways. During dry weather, the stored stormwater and sewage would flow to the treatment plant.</p>
