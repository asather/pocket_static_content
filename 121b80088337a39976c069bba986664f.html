<h1>Pittsburgh police chief wants more cooperation from protesters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police Chief Scott Schubert is calling for more cooperation from protesters to avoid future arrests.</p>
<p>Demonstrations were held several days last week outside Mayor Bill Peduto’s home in Point Breeze and began a day after plainclothes officers in an unmarked white van arrested Matthew Cartier, 25, during a Black Lives Matter protest in Oakland.</p>
<p>Protest leaders called the act a “kidnapping,” but police defended the arrest, alleging that Mr. Cartier repeatedly blocked traffic for the protesters, creating hazardous conditions and repeatedly refusing officers’ directions to stop, officials said.</p>
<p>“We understand there’s a divide,” Chief Schubert said Thursday in an emailed statement through public safety spokeswoman Cara Cruz. “We need to figure how to lessen that divide so we can have some communications to keep them safe. That’s all I want to do is keep people safe.”</p>
<p>The police chief could not be directly reached for comment Thursday.</p>
<p>Authorities are willing to allow some civil disobedience, meaning they will allow protesters to block intersections for long periods of time during protests, Ms. Cruz said.</p>
<p>“... He is asking for more communication and sharing of demonstration routes so that large groups of protesters (on average 150 to 300 people each week) don't come into contact with vehicles when they take a sudden turn on to a new street or bridge,” she said.</p>
<p>Police are currently assigned to direct traffic and close streets as needed, but don’t know where protests may be heading, Ms. Cruz said. Without advance notice, it is difficult for officers on motorcycles to quickly block streets and redirect traffic.</p>
<p>“Thankfully no one has been hurt, but that is precisely what police are trying to avoid,” Ms. Cruz said.</p>
