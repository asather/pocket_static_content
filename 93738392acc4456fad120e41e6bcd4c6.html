<h1>Penguins on pause: Matt Murray's uneven season sparks questions in the crease</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Penguins goalie Matt Murray was cruising along through the first month of the 2019-20 season. He posted a 7-3 record with a more-than-solid .923 save percentage and a 2.2 goals-against average. In other words, he was looking every bit like a two-time Stanley Cup-winning goaltender on the top of his game.</p>
<p>Then November happened — a month that jump-started a goalie controversy and, perhaps, even changed the dynamic between the pipes for years to come.</p>
<p>For the second consecutive year, Murray endured an early-season slide. It seemed every game he was giving up at least one head-scratching goal. The numbers backed it up. He was pulled from games twice, went just 2-2-4 with a .867 save percentage and 3.53 goals-against during the second month of the season.</p>
<p>The uneven performances opened the door for Tristan Jarry. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/10/tristan-jarry-penguins-matt-murray-contract-goalie-question/stories/202004090110" target="_blank">He seized the opportunity</a>, setting a Penguins shutout record on the way to becoming a first-time All-Star in his first full NHL season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By Nov. 30, the Penguins’ goaltending debate reached its tipping point. At this juncture, Murray was already beginning to lose the net to Jarry. He was starting only on the second night of back-to-backs when, typically, the backup gets the nod. Then, he allowed five goals in a 5-2 loss in St. Louis.</p>
<p>The outing marked the end of a particular rough stretch in which Murray allowed 18 goals in four games. From there, Murray made just three starts (all on the second half of back-to-backs) in the month of December.</p>
<p>As his two championship rings show, Murray is often at his best when the stakes are the highest. He began to settle in during final stretch of the now-suspended season, steadying his play after the new year. In 2020, he’s 9-5-1 with a .905 save percentage and 2.73 goals-against average.&nbsp;At the same time, Jarry’s play came back to earth.</p>
<p>Murray appeared to be gaining an edge in the competition just before the season was suspended. He helped the Penguins snap out of a six-game losing skid against Ottawa on March 3 and had earned starts in three of the last four games.&nbsp;</p>
<p>During a video conference call with reporters a few weeks back, coach Mike Sullivan was asked who starts in net when the season resumes. It was a joke, of course, considering no one has any clue if, when or how the season might come back.</p>
<p>But after the November in which Murray stumbled and Jarry starred, the Penguins goaltending questions aren’t going away.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> Penguins fans showed the worst side of themselves Jan. 19. During a Sunday afternoon showdown against the Boston Bruins, Murray allowed two goals on just three shots to open the game. A smattering of Penguins fans jeered the goalie with Bronx cheers when Murray made an easy stop on a dump-in shot from the red line.</p>
<p>Murray,<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/01/19/Ron-Cook-Penguins-Boston-Bruins-goalie-Matt-Murray-Sidney-Crosby-Mario-Lemieux-sellout-streak/stories/202001200041" target="_blank"> who said “no comment”</a> when asked about the faux applause after the game, responded. He was solid enough the second half of the game to help the Penguins rally from a three-goal deficit to capture a 4-3 victory against one of the best teams in the Eastern Conference and one of the defining wins of the regular season.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Murray’s .899 save percentage is the lowest mark of his five-year career.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Who starts in net? That’s been the question since November, really. But now, it will finally be the time to make a call. Murray is the known commodity. He’s been there. He’s won Cups. He’s stood tall in big moments. Sullivan seemed to be trending that direction, giving Murray starts in three of the last four games. But only time will tell what he ultimately decides.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Murray and Jarry will both become restrict free agents this offseason. Murray, who made $3.75 million this year, could be in line for a hefty pay raise. But the Penguins are almost always fighting against the salary cap. Will they be able to afford a long-term investment?</p>
