<h1>Inmates file class-action suit against county jail, warden over virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three Allegheny County Jail inmates have sued the jail and its warden in federal court, saying they and other inmates should be released to reduce the risk of getting sick from COVID-19.</p>
<p>The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the Abolitionist Law Center and the Pennsylvania Institutional Law Project along with law firm Dechert LLP, say the jail conditions are putting them and other inmates in danger because of lack of social distancing.</p>
<p>The suit says the jail has released some 600 people in recent weeks, earning praise from advocates, but that Warden Orlando Harper has not taken advantage of the new space available. He has not consolidated housing units, according to the complaint, leaving one floor empty while inmates on other floors remain housed two to a cell.</p>
<p>Bret Grote, legal director of the Abolitionist Law Center, called the warden’s inaction “reckless” and warned that the current conditions will lead to infection and death in the jail.</p>
<p>Inmates at the jail share a sink, toilet and desk and cannot maintain six feet of distance between them as recommended by the CDC to prevent infection, the suit says.</p>
<p>Alexandra Morgan-Kurtz, managing attorney at the Pennsylvania law project, said jails are the “epicenter” of infection across the country. At Rikers Island in New York, she said in a release, the infection rate has been seven times higher than the rate in the city.</p>
<p>Plaintiffs Michael Graham, Alexus Diggs and Heather Connolly say they suffer from various health problems, including hepatitis, asthma and hypertension, and are at greater risk for virus complications. The suit says the jail is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and the due process clause of the 14th Amendment, since all three inmates are being held in pre-trial detention on minor charges.</p>
<p>The suit is asking for their release and the release of all similarly situated inmates.</p>
