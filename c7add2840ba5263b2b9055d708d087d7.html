<h1>Paul Zeise: Teams interested in Tom Brady would be extremely disappointed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Tom Brady, possibly the greatest quarterback of all time,&nbsp;is about to hit the open market, and it’s one of the big stories of the NFL offseason. Every day we get reports of some team that may be interested. We hear what Brady told his agent, or what a source close to him or close to the Patriots is saying. We even heard reports about a phone call that took place between Brady and Bill Belichick that went poorly last week.</p>
<p>It all makes sense, I suppose, because he is a high profile player, but let’s get real — Brady now is not Brady of even five years ago, and no team should make him anywhere close to the&nbsp;highest paid quarterback in the league. He is 42 years old and will be 43 when the season begins. He is closing in on 300 career games (actually 350 when you add his playoff games) and 12,000 (including playoffs) pass attempts. He has clearly dropped off from what he was, and he’s clearly no longer the elite level passer he used to be.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyone who has watched Brady in the last two seasons knows that his physical tools are diminished. He can’t move out of the way of pass rushers anymore. His completion percentage last season (60.8%) was the third lowest of his career. His yards per attempt (6.6) was the second lowest of his career. He threw less than 25 touchdown passes for the first time since 2006. The numbers don’t lie, nor do what our eyes are telling us of the trajectory of Brady’s career path.</p>
<p>That’s why it seems like utter lunacy that teams are lining up to sign Brady. Really? Are these people not paying attention to what Brady has actually done in recent years? Do they not understand the shelf life and likelihood he is going to get worse, not better?</p>
<p>Apparently not. There is one team, and only one team, that should even be considering signing Brady to a big deal, and that is the New England Patriots.</p>
<p>I don’t know that Brady has another run in him, but if he’s going to make one more, that is the only place he will be able to do it. He will be playing for the great Bill Belichick, and Brady still knows the system better than anyone on the planet.&nbsp;The Patriots could add a couple of weapons, and with that defense and him in that familiar offensive system, they would immediately become a Super Bowl contender again.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/28844042/playing-tom-brady-2020-nfl-free-agency-four-offers-one-winner-60-million-guaranteed#gb" target="_blank">Three other teams</a>&nbsp;are said to be most interested in his services: Tampa, Tennessee and the Los Angeles Chargers. We have also heard some rumblings about the Raiders. I have to laugh when I see the names of these teams because combined they have won a total of two Super Bowls since 1981 (Raiders&nbsp; in1983, Buccaneers in 2002). The fact that they are heavily interested in looking at a soon-to-be 43-year-old quarterback as their savior explains why that is.</p>
<p>Sure, Tampa is coached by Bruce Arians, the quarterback whisperer. But he’s also a guy who loves to throw the ball and nearly got Ben Roethlisberger killed by having him drop back a million times, even though his offensive line couldn’t block. Roethlisberger survived because he was a big, strong 20-something and could scramble. Brady would be a sitting duck in that offense and probably not survive the season.</p>
<p>Tennessee makes some sense with it’s run-heavy offense, and the quarterback isn’t asked to do much more than manage games. But given that, why would you pay a game manager $30-$35 million a year if you can have one like Ryan Tannehill for much, much less?</p>
<p>The Chargers are moving on from an old quarterback with diminished skills and have far more holes. And the Raiders already have a better quarterback than Brady at this stage.</p>
<p>All of this speculation has been fun and fueled almost nightly stories during a slow time for the NFL, but it makes very little sense to me. If we were talking about Brady as a 32-year-old, I would be interested in it, but we aren’t. We’re talking about a player who is just about at the end of his career and not worth anywhere close to what teams might be willing to pay him.</p>
