<h1>Dallas police chief announces new policy to release videos of critical incidents within 72 hours</h1>

<p>DALLAS — Dallas Police Chief U. Renee Hall on Tuesday announced a policy to release videos of police shootings and use-of-force incidents within three days of someone suffering serious injuries or dying. But it was unclear how the changes would work in practice.</p>
<p>Videos of police shootings and in-custody deaths are often a challenge to obtain through open records laws because the department will often consider them part of an “ongoing investigation” and withhold their release. It is unclear if the policy will apply to cases that become part of a criminal investigation.</p>
<p>According to a copy of the new General Orders obtained by The Dallas Morning News on Tuesday evening, the chief still has the “discretion to publicly release, in whole or in part” any video recording related to a critical incident. The policy also says it does “not waive the department’s right to withhold other audio or video recordings or investigative materials in the same or any other” case.</p>
<p>The department said videos also will be made public when someone dies in custody, according to a police news release.</p>
<p>Previously, videos involving police shootings, use of force or deaths in custody were released on a case-by-case basis, and in some instances when people have died, it has taken years for the footage to become public.</p>
<p>The announcement comes after more than a month of protests in Dallas against police brutality.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, after criticism about the use of less-lethal ammunition at protests, Dallas City Manager T.C. Broadnax and Hall announced several policies aimed at reform. Among them: formally banning chokeholds and any force intended to restrict a person’s airway in its General Orders; a warn-before-shooting policy; and a duty to intervene when force is applied inappropriately or is no longer required.</p>
<p>Chief Hall had promised to implement the video policy, which is effective immediately, by the end of June.</p>
<p>Chief Hall said the order will allow an opportunity for the injured person or relative of the deceased to review the footage before it is released. The officers who are involved in such incidents, the district attorney and the Office of Police Oversight director will also have an opportunity to preview the recordings.</p>
<p>“This is another step in our efforts to establish a foundation of transparency and trust among DPD and our communities,” Chief Hall said in a statement.</p>
<p>The department also said it will begin posting monthly traffic and citation data, including analysis of race and ethnicity.</p>
