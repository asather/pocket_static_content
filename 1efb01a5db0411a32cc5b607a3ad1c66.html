<h1>Gerrit Cole makes Yankees debut as Pirates tie New York, 3-3</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TAMPA, Fla. — Gerrit Cole opened his Yankees career with a scoreless first inning, as his current team tied one of his former ones, 3-3, on Monday at George M. Steinbrenner Field in Tampa, Fla.</p>
<p>Cole struck out Bryan Reynolds and Josh Bell during a 20-pitch inning that also included a walk to Cole Tucker, who battled out of an 0-2 hole.</p>
<p>“It’s in a good spot,” said Cole, who threw first-pitch strikes to all four batters he faced and got his fastball up to 98 mph. “I wasn’t working too hard. That certainly is encouraging.”</p>
<p>The Pirates scored in the ninth to force the tie. They’re now 0-3-1 this exhibition season.</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/02/24/Chris-Archer-scratched-from-Monday-s-start-vs-Yankees/stories/202002240103" target="_blank">Chris Archer was scratched</a> from this start Monday morning because of neck soreness, Chris Stratton took his place. The middle reliever fared well, allowing a walk and striking out Giancarlo Stanton in one inning of work.</p>
<p>“I felt like I threw OK,” Stratton said. “I had a game plan to try and attack with some fastballs and curveballs. I feel like we did a good job of that. Just have to get a little bit better command. Overall, I would say it’s a good one to build on.”</p>
<p>Geoff Hartlieb, Edgar Santana, Yacksel Rios, Luis Escobar, Nik Turley, Sammy Reyes and Pedro Vasquez combined for seven innings of scoreless work, issuing three walks and striking out eight. Nick Mears gave up three runs in his one inning — one on a wild pitch, another via a two-run single from Brandon Wagner.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Jacob Stallings led the Pirates’ offense with a pair of hits, including a double.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh got its runs when Hunter Owen (pinch-running for Reynolds) scored on a double-play ball in the sixth inning. Oneil Cruz came around to score on a passed ball an inning later, and Jason Martin singled home Andrew Susac in the ninth.</p>
<p>Pirates hitters struck out 14 times and left 15 men on base. Frazier, Reynolds and Bell went a combined 0-for-8.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The highlight of the night came on a double play to nail Stanton in the bottom of the fourth inning. Adam Frazier made a diving stop and flipped to Tucker, who caught the exchange with his bare hand before whipping a throw to first.</p>
<p>“I’d be lying to you if I said I didn’t feel pretty good about that one,” Tucker said.</p>
<p>Another excellent defensive play came in the second inning, when Guillermo Heredia ran down a long fly ball from Yankees left fielder Clint Frazier in center field.</p>
<p>In the first inning, after a Phillip Evans error, Stratton smartly covered third base, allowing Tucker to chase down the loose ball and get an out.</p>
<p>“We don’t practice that one,” Tucker said. “If someone misses the ball, we just get another one. That was just kind of reactionary. That’s the beauty of baseball. We’re going to see another crazy play that we weren’t expecting [on Tuesday].</p>
