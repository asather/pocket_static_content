<h1>Dapper Dan honors: Cam Heyward is an All-Pro in the community too</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rufus and Judy Jordan of Highland Park used to buy tickets and attend the Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction. They were avid fans of Pittsburgh’s sports teams, especially the Steelers and Pitt athletics. After their grandsons moved to Georgia, the Jordans fostered their love of the Steelers by sending them black and gold gear.</p>
<p>Next month, at the 84th Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction, the Jordans won’t have to purchase tickets to see their favorite sports stars up close and personal. The recipient of the 2019 Dapper Dan Sportsman of the Year honor is their grandson, Steelers All-Pro defensive end Cam Heyward.</p>
<p>“If you’ve lived in Pittsburgh, you know about the Dapper Dan and understand the work it does for the Boys and Girls clubs,” Heyward said. “The names you can rattle off who have won the award — Joe Greene, Willie Stargell, Sidney Crosby, Ben Roethlisberger, coach [Mike] Tomlin, Bill Cowher, Andrew McCutchen — they’re all legends in the Pittsburgh community. I can’t fathom putting my name next to theirs.”</p>
<p>Heyward will put his name next to theirs and many other Pittsburgh sports greats Feb. 10 at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown. Others being honored include Tomlin (Dr. Freddie Fu Sports Leadership Award), the Pitt volleyball team (Sportswomen of the Year) and Bill Hillgrove (Lifetime Achievement Award).</p>
<p>Heyward’s Pittsburgh roots run deep. His father, Craig “Ironhead” Heyward, was a star running back at Pitt and played 11 years in the NFL. Craig met Charlotte Jordan when they were sophomores at Pitt and had three sons together. Connor, like his father, is a running back who played at Michigan State. Corey played basketball at Georgia Tech.</p>
<p>Cameron, the oldest of the Heyward boys, was selected by the Steelers in the first round of the 2011 draft out of Ohio State and has developed into one of the top interior defensive linemen in the NFL. He earned All-Pro honors for the second time earlier this month and is playing in his third consecutive Pro Bowl on Sunday in Orlando, Fla.</p>
<p>Heyward’s most productive seasons have come in the past three years after a torn pectoral muscle ended his 2016 season. He has posted 29 of his 54 career sacks in the past three seasons and set a career high with 83 tackles last season.</p>
<p>“I hope I’m getting better with age,” Heyward, 30, said.</p>
<p>Heyward, a two-time nominee for the NFL’s Walter Payton Man of the Year award, also is an All-Pro when it comes to his work in the community. It’s fitting the Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction benefits the Boys &amp; Girls clubs of Western Pennsylvania because his father earned his nickname “Ironhead” while frequenting a Boys &amp; Girls Club in Passaic, N.J.</p>
<p>When Craig was a teenager, another boy at the club smacked him over the head with a pool cue. The nickname “Ironhead” was coined after Craig barely flinched, launching an iconic name that would follow him throughout his football career.</p>
<p>“The Boys &amp; Girls clubs helped raise my dad and kept him out of trouble to an extent,” said Heyward, who remembers going to Boys &amp; Girls clubs where he was raised in Georgia. “I just think being involved in it as a kid, they give you opportunities. It doesn’t have to be sports. The social cues you can develop there, having a place where you can feel safe, it’s been great what they have done. My dad was always going to Boys &amp; Girls clubs here, going to Children’s Hospital and visiting kids. My dad always had a big heart when it came to children.”</p>
<p>His father’s work in the community, as well as the community spirit his mother and former Ohio State coach Jim Tressel instilled in him, inspired Cameron to start <a href="https://www.thecameronheywardfoundation.org/" target="_blank">The Heyward House foundation</a> in 2015. The foundation supports a number of causes, including Boys &amp; Girls clubs. It also supports other charities that are near and dear to Heyward’s heart.</p>
<p><strong>• The Southeastern Brain Tumor Foundation</strong>&nbsp;— A nonprofit organization that funds research to find a cure for brain cancer, which took Craig’s life at the age of 39. The charity saw a big spike in donations in 2015 when the NFL began to fine Heyward for wearing eye black with “Iron Head” written on them. “We started getting more involved when I was getting fined for the eye black thing,” Heyward said. “They reached out. They were making them, we were selling them off, and we were sending the proceeds to them. Now we just donate money back. My dad had a brain tumor and suffered from it. We understand we’re pretty fortunate to give back.”</p>
<p><strong>• DKMS</strong>&nbsp;— An international nonprofit dedicated to fighting blood cancers and blood disorders through creating awareness and raising funds. This is a cause close to Charlotte’s heart and Cameron has ramped up his efforts to help. “We want to eradicate all blood cancers,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>• KidsVoice</strong>&nbsp;— A local organization that represents children in the child-welfare system. “They make sure young kids have proper legal representation,” Heyward said. “We’ve been working with them since we started. It’s been really cool. We have a backpack drive, a birthday club. We get kids together and have a night out for them. I got hooked up with them through the United Way.”</p>
<p><strong>• Craig’s Closet&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;– This organization provides high school boys in the Pittsburgh area with free dress clothes for interviews, internships, banquets and more. This honors Craig, who arrived at Pitt with one suit and changed shirts, ties and belts on every occasion so as to not draw attention to his limited wardrobe.</p>
<p><strong>• Smyrna Stars basketball team and the Iron Indians 7-on-7 football team</strong> – Heyward grew up playing football and basketball. He once played on the same AAU team as Herb Pope, Terrelle Pryor, D.J. Kennedy and DeJuan Blair. The Smyrna Stars are a Georgia-based AAU team. The Iron Indians are a local football team from Penn Hills.</p>
<p>“Cam is just a blueprint for what players should aspire to be,” Tomlin said.&nbsp;“He does everything right. There’s routine in how he moves, and it’s all about team, it’s all about Pittsburgh, so he’s a blueprint. He’s experienced a lot of personal success, but that’s just a byproduct of how he moves. This guy is all Steelers. This guy is all team, and it comes out in everything he does every day.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Heyward and his wife, Allie, have three children, and they’re raising them with the same charitable principles that Craig and Charlotte infused in Cameron.</p>
<p>“I know I’m very fortunate situation,” Heyward said of his philanthropic efforts. “I have a chance to give back. Not only give back but be a role model. I remember growing up, I’d just observe people, see how they function, see how leaders work. Leaders want to give back. My mom always reinforced that. It’s a way of a life.”</p>
