<h1>Prince Charles calls on Britain’s furloughed workers to pick produce to help farmers</h1>

<p>Prince Charles on Tuesday threw his voice behind a noble effort to assist harvesters who are hampered by the pandemic.</p>
<p>The Prince of Wales called on his countrymen to join the Pick for Britain campaign, which encourages furloughed workers to assist British farmers by picking produce.</p>
<p>“If we are to harvest British food and vegetables this year, we need an army of people to help,” Prince Charles said in a video on the official Clarence House Twitter page. “In the coming months, many thousands of people will be needed to bring in the crops.”</p>

<p>The U.K. government rolled out the drive Tuesday, urging students and the out-of-work to match with open slots for the seasonal farming.</p>
<p>Officials promised the campaign will provide an opportunity for Britons to snap up some cash while helping to feed the country during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Fruit growers typically rely on seasonal labor in the summer months, but the supply of hands has dried up due to travel restrictions imposed amid the virus.</p>
<p>Prince Charles said in March he had tested positive for COVID-19, but the 71-year-old recovered with fairly mild symptoms.</p>
