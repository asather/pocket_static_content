<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Protesters gathered at Friendship Park Friday afternoon to begin an “ally-led” march of mostly non-black people showing solidarity with protests over the killing of a black man by Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>The event, one of several set for Friday to honor George Floyd, also marks the 27th birthday of Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed by police in Louisville in March.</p>
<p>“Black leaders and community members deserve to rest, but that doesn’t mean we can allow the anti-racist rebellion to fall silent,” stated one protest sign.</p>
<p>Donned in military camo gear she obtained while serving in Afghanistan, volunteer medic Elisabeth Braunfield said she came to the protest to “be useful.” “I can’t just watch this on TV,” she said. “In Afghanistan, people of all colors watch your back.”</p>
<p>In the center of the narrow stretch of Friendship Park, free water bottles and coffee were provided.</p>
<p>At around 12:30, protesters moved from the park on the way to Shadyside.</p>
<p>Later today, a gathering is set for West Liberty Avenue on the Beechview/Dormont border.</p>
<p>At around 6 p.m., the South Pittsburgh Coalition for Peace is hosting a "community prayer and peace vigil" at the Lighthouse Cathedral parking lot "in honor of George Floyd and all victims of racial and social justice," according to the organization's press release.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon Public Library is also memorializing victims by asking members to observe silence for 8 minutes and 46 seconds at 3:45 p.m. to mark the time a police officer knelt on Mr. Floyd’s neck.</p>
<p>Moments of silence were also being observed by medical personnel in Oakland.</p>
<p>Protests are set to continue through the weekend, extending through the region.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Upper St. Clair Black Lives Matter group will host a "peaceful gathering" at the Upper St. Clair Municipal Building. Protesters will be "engaging in nine minutes of silence" as well as listening to community speakers to discuss their personal experiences with discrimination.</p>
<p>On Sunday, events are set for the Hill District, Market Square and Vandergrift.</p>
