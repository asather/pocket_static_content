<h1>Sparring industry and safety advocates urge Congress to regulate self-driving cars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — As questions continue to swirl around the development of self-driving cars, safety advocates and industry officials pressed lawmakers Tuesday to move forward on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2017/09/06/The-SELF-DRIVE-Act-just-passed-the-U-S-House-here-s-what-that-means-for-autonomous-vehicles/stories/201709060138?cid=search" target="_blank">long-stalled legislation</a> to govern the testing and future operation of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>Yet the panelists testifying before the House Energy and Commerce Committee sparred over what that legislation should do — highlighting key disagreements that remain over how to spur innovation without putting pedestrians, bicyclists and other motorists in danger.</p>
<p>The dust-up on Capitol Hill comes more than three years after Congress first waded into regulation of self-driving cars, a fast-growing industry in Pittsburgh that has seen companies like Uber, Argo AI, Aurora and Aptiv open shop to build on decades of artificial intelligence research at Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>The industry has touted the promise of fully autonomous vehicles as a future of traffic deaths at near zero, increased mobility for the elderly and disabled and higher living standards.</p>
<p>But safety advocates have pointed to the present-day reality of cars&nbsp;navigating public roads&nbsp;with various stages of autonomy, without first addressing thorny issues like the legal liability in the event of an accident and whether state and local laws can preempt federal standards.</p>
<p>Nearly 1,500 self-driving vehicles are being tested by 80 companies across 36 states, said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, a Virginia-based trade association that includes autonomous vehicle developers.</p>
<p>Two of its members, Aptiv and Lyft, have provided more than 50,000 rides in Las Vegas since 2018 to a customer satisfaction of 4.97 out of five stars,&nbsp;Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p>“We see an American thirst for these,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He cast self-driving cars as a public safety measure, with U.S. highway accidents today causing more than 30,000 motor vehicle deaths.</p>
<p>Autonomous systems “don’t get distracted, they don’t get tired, they don’t drink too much,” Mr. Shapiro said.&nbsp;“We can’t wait for everything to be perfect, the way some have asked for. Every day we delay, literally, we’re killing people.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro clashed with other panelists like Cathy Chase, president of Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety. The Washington, D.C.-based organization&nbsp;released a poll on Tuesday showing&nbsp;85% of adults are concerned about sharing the road with a driverless car as a motorist, bicyclist or pedestrian.</p>
<p>Her testimony included pictures of crashes and other incidents involving autonomous vehicles being tested on public roads. She singled out the March 2018 accident in Tempe, Ariz., in which an Uber test vehicle struck and killed a pedestrian, prompting Uber to temporarily halt its testing in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The accident revealed “glaring need for sensible safeguards, protocols and regulations for AVs which are not yet being sold but are being tested on public roads,” Ms. Chase said.</p>
<p>In a letter to the committee, Danielle Burr, Uber’s head of federal affairs, wrote the company “remains deeply regretful” for the crash and has “used the facts from these investigations&nbsp;and other sources to enhance our self-driving program.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro acknowledged mistakes can happen — but shooting for zero fatalities is unrealistic.</p>
<p>“The reality is we are going to experience incidents&nbsp;with self-driving cars even in the future,” Mr. Shapiro said. “Not everything can possibly be anticipated, and the only way to view that helpfully is to view that against the number of lives we are actually saving.”</p>
<p><strong>Legislation stuck</strong></p>
<p>Tuesday’s debate over the virtues and fears of autonomous cars came as federal legislation remains stuck.</p>
<p>In September 2017, the House Energy and Commerce Committee passed — by a 54-0 vote — the Self-Drive Act, which was then approved by the full House in a voice vote. But the legislation died in the Senate.</p>
<p>Last July, a new session of Congress revived work on the legislation, sending letters to automakers and safety advocates to gather input.</p>
<p>This week, a spokesperson for the House committee the House and Senate committees continue to negotiate and “seek feedback from stakeholders to reach consensus on that legislation.” Spokespeople for the Senate Commerce Committee and its chair, Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Miss., did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“We must get this over the line,” Rep. Debbie Dingell, D-Mich., said at the start of the hearing. “We’ve worked hard to find consensus over the last year, but now is the time of action. I beg my colleagues that we will do so, and I hope this hearing is the momentum for us getting it done.”</p>
<p>The industry wants legislation to speed up the testing and development of driverless cars.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro pressed for more exemptions from federal safety standards that would allow up to 100,000 test vehicles on the road nationwide in the coming years. It also is pressing for federal regulations to govern the industry, preventing state and local governments from creating a patchwork of laws. Uber’s letter to the committee reflected those demands as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But some advocates want other provisions.</p>
<p>Any legislation clearly should hold manufacturers responsible for following the rules of the road, said Daniel Hinkle, senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice, an organization of trial lawyers who have represented consumers injured in automobile accidents.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Automated driving is not inherently safe, nor inevitably safe,” Mr. Hinkle said.&nbsp;“Automated vehicles have demonstrated challenges with bridges, turning left, spotting bicycles or identifying animals in the road.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>He called out Uber for forcing accident victims into mandatory arbitration, which critics say removes a consumer’s ability to pursue collective and public legal action against a company.&nbsp;“They just wanted to make it go away,” Mr. Hinkle said.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Tumlin, director of transportation at the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency, said he wants Congress to create a national database of every driverless vehicle&nbsp;safety incident and to require companies to provide data from sensors.</p>
<p>Cities and states, he added, need to be able to write their own laws while federal regulations sort out nationwide standards.</p>
<p>“It would be irresponsible for Congress to interfere with the ability of state and local officials to protect the public from risks we learn of through the testing process,” Mr. Tumlin said.</p>
