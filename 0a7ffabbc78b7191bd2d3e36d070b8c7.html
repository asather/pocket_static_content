<h1>Black Lives Matter demonstration in Greensburg counters VP Pence's visit just blocks away</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Holding signs that read "Stop police brutality" and dressed in attire supporting the cause, dozens gathered Thursday morning in Westmoreland for a Black Lives Matter rally just around the corner from a Cops for Trump coalition, which was assembled to support Vice President Mike Pence.</p>
<p>"This is not about (Pence)," said Lorence King, of Greensburg, one of the organizers of the BLM rally and a member of grassroots nonprofit Voice of Westmoreland. "This is about us and our community.</p>
<p>"They come straight into our town and they go right to the police. To me, that's an escalation of violence. Rather than trying to heal our community, this is what they chose to do. ... There are people who are facing evictions and many are stressed about their finances right now."</p>
<p>The vice president’s event at the Greensburg Police Department brought together the Cops for Trump coalition, one of the many groups designed to support President Donald Trump’s re-election campaign.</p>
<p>The police rally began at noon and was held near city hall in Downtown Greensburg’s Mid Town Plaza. A portion of South Main Street was closed until the rally ended.</p>
<p>Hours before Mr. Pence's rally began, and about a half-mile away, less than 100 people social distanced in bleachers and others sat cross-legged in the grass at St. Clair Park in front of the Robertshaw Amphitheater listening intently as Mr. King testified about discrimination from police.</p>
<p>“From police pulling me over asking me where I'm going; (to) when I was 15, when I was 16, when I was 17, walking to my friend's house (in) broad daylight (and getting) stopped by the police. (They asked)&nbsp;‘What you doing? Where you going? What's your business here? Where are you coming from?’</p>
<p>“Even when I was with my white friends, they would single me out, but they would tell the others, ‘It's alright, we're talking to him.’ ”</p>
<p>Mr. King finished emotionally. "I can't breathe in this country," he said into the microphone as the&nbsp;crowd applauded.</p>
<p>The message shared by Mr. King and others was contrasted later by the one shared at Mr. Pence’s rally, where he told the crowd that&nbsp;“law enforcement isn’t the problem. Law enforcement is the solution.” During the rally outside Greensburg’s police headquarters, Mr. Pence said the Trump administration is committed to maintaining law and order and would&nbsp;“back the blue.”</p>
<p>At the BLM protest, where multiple people shared their own perspectives, some asked for the help of a higher power.</p>
<p>Sam Anthony, 70, of Greensburg, and former pastor of Journey Church in Hollidaysburg, Blair County, spoke about God's love and the importance of trust. He urged everyone to love one another the way "God loves us."</p>
<p>"No matter who you are, no matter the color of your skin, or what you've done, God is on your side and wants to fight for you," he said. "Nothing and no one can take that away from you."</p>
<p>The demonstration lasted nearly three hours and ended just before Mr. Pence's rally.</p>
<p>The gathering was organized by Voice of Westmoreland.</p>
