<h1>GOP state House candidate appeals to Supreme Court in challenge to Gov. Wolf's shutdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A candidate for state representative and several Western Pennsylvania businesses challenging Gov. Tom Wolf’s order closing all non-life-sustaining establishments during the COVID-19 shutdown have appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.</p>
<p>In Monday night’s court filing, Allegheny County Republican Danny DeVito, who is running for a seat in the 45th District that covers Kennedy and Robinson, along with the local businesses, is asking the Supreme Court to issue a stay of the governor’s order, arguing that it is causing “unprecedented damage to the economy,” according to attorney Marc A.&nbsp;Scaringi who filed the petition on his behalf.</p>
<p>The request was jointly filed by Mr. DeVito’s campaign, along with Realtor Kathy Gregory, B and J Laundry in Erie, Blueberry Hill Golf Course in Russell, Warren County, and the Caledonia Land Co. in Sheffield, Warren County.</p>
<p>“What we're saying is businesses have a right to use and control their own property,” Mr. Scaringi said. “This business closure order essentially has evicted these owners from their places of business. The government can't do that without providing due process of law.”</p>
<p>The court filing stated that without intervention, tens of thousands of businesses may not be able to recover from the severe financial distress caused by the shutdown.</p>
<p>On March 19, the governor issued his order requiring all businesses that are not “life-sustaining” to close their physical operations as a safety precaution due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The state Supreme Court rejected the challenge to Mr. Wolf’s order earlier this month.</p>
<p>Last week, Mr. DeVito, 27, joined more than 100 protesters gathered in front of the City-County Building in Downtown Pittsburgh to voice opposition to Mr. Wolf’s business closures and stay-at-home orders. That protest was mirrored by a larger demonstration at the state Capitol in Harrisburg, where most expressed concern over the economic impact of the shutdowns, and some called the closures illegal on constitutional grounds.</p>
<p>Others indicated skepticism of public health experts and the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The governor last week outlined a color-coded system featuring three phases — red, yellow and green — to begin relaxing restrictions on businesses and residents amid the COVID-19 crisis. Mr. Wolf’s administration said it will use metrics from the state Department of Health, and a data tool being developed by Carnegie Mellon University, to determine when regions are ready to move into a new phase.</p>
<p>Those metrics involve requiring regions to have an average of less than 50 cases per 100,000 individuals over a 14-day period.</p>
<p>He has said that his separate stay-at-home order is the best way to help stop the spread of COVID-19.</p>
