<h1>Mike White's high school sports chat transcript: 09.15.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Week 1 is in the books with football. Let's get right to it.</p>
<p><strong>NorthSouth</strong>: Any freshman that really stuck out in the first week of Football? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Quarterback at Jeannette Brad Birch threw for 246 yards. Penn Hills is starting a freshman at QB Julian Dugger. I saw another one in person who looks like he has ton potential. Quinton Martin of Belle Vernon. Running back-receiver. Really good size.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: I was pleasantly surprised to see Mars-Hampton game on 22 The Point last Friday night. Just assumed there would be no broadcasts this fall due to COVID. They have a great schedule too; Pine -USC this week, S Fayette-Peters next week. Do you know if AT&amp;T Sports plans to pick up games after Pirate season is over like they usually do? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes The Point has a schedule full of games throughout the season. Even a few Thursday games. Like South Fayette and Peters next week. Also could see KDKA's WPCW start games in a few weeks. So, yes some will be on TV. Not sure about championships yet.</p>
<p><strong>Quad North Fan</strong>: Will the judges ruling yesterday allow fans at games on Friday? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You're talking about the judge who ruled Governor gathering limits are unconstitutional. I'm not sure of the effect. But some schools were already doing what they wanted with crowds this past Friday. PIAA board has executive meeting tomorrow. They're only going to discuss this. No actions or nothing formal will come out of meeting.</p>
<p><strong>mike</strong>: TJ that good or is West Mifflin that bvad <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: TJ is still very good. Real surprise, right? Hard for me to believe they are as good as last year but they are championship material again. I don't think West Mifflin is bad, but I also don't think they are real strong, either. I heard no reports on how Nahki Johnson did.</p>
<p><strong>Doc Hensla</strong>: Mike, any teams that really surprised you in a good and bad way after week 1? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: How about Leechburg beating Greensburg Central 55-37. GCC was in P-G top 5. Leechburg winning is one thing. But 55 points? Leechburg has been bad for many years, but they started to turn corner last year. FYI Leechburg has longest current playoff drought in WPIAL. Hasn't made playoffs since 1988.</p>
<p><strong>Bones</strong>: Heard Butler's best VB player, Carney (sister of Devin) is not playing for butler. Has she transferred?? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have no idea. I also have no idea about her brother, Butler basketball player Devin Carney.</p>
<p><strong>Steven</strong>: With Belle Vernon beating McKeesport, is this finally the year they can overtake TJ when it matters? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: We'll see next Friday. But BV has defeated TJ before, remember. I think Matt Humbert has turned into one of the best coaches in the WPIAL. Won at Ringgold and now look what he's done at Belle Vernon.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: I know it’s only one game, but still, Quips are amazing aren’t they? New Castle is never a slouch to play. Love the attitude of that program. “4A? Just tell us when and where we play”. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Amazing? C'mon. Not to downplay Aliquippa's program, but are you really that surprised they beat New Castle? Few years ago I watched Aliquippa totally handle New Castle at Aliquippa. I think all through the years most thought Aliquippa would be competitive in higher classifications than 2A or 3A. Now, I didn't say 5A or 6A. But they did lose a number of starters from last year. I don't know if they will get to WPIAL championship again in 4A, but it certainly was a nice start. And looking at that conference, it would be no surprise if they won it.</p>
<p><strong>stripes37</strong>: KO quarterback is a really nice player. Had the chance to see him at Ambridge on Friday. Nice running game and decent defense too. KO should be heard from in AAA. Ambridge has some really good skill players, but very small on both lines. Two really good coaches in Don Phillips and Greg Perry. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: First off, Ambridge has struggled for a while. Won one game in past four seasons. Don Phillips is an all-timer, but he's trying to climb a mountain at Ambridge. Not easy. Maybe dropping to 3A this year will help. As for KO QB it's Logan Shrubb. Yes, he's very good. Not big time Division I prospect but still very good high school QB. Needs about 400 yards passing to become only 5th QB to throw for 5,000 yards and run for 2,000 in career. Phil Jurkovec is one of the other four.</p>
<p><strong>JP</strong>: Watched the TJ WM game did not see hear Nahki Johnsons name called until the second half when the TJ backups were in the game. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: OK. Well, it was first game. I've said that Nahki does have loads of potential. Gotta like his size and athletic ability. But I think he still has things to prove.</p>
<p><strong>slick rick</strong>: Who will benefit more on the recruiting end of things, the colleges playing now or those who are going to play in the spring? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: For recruiting? I don't know if that matters a whole lot. Sure, kids probably would like to see a team play in the fall. But I really don't think a high school kid is going to say, "I'm not going to go to XXXXXX college because they are playing in the spring." <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Just FYI. Two very good Class 5A games this Friday - Pine-Richland at USC and Penn-Trafford at Peters. But next week? Might be best night of season for big games. Three games matching 1 vs. 2. Central and NA. Pine and Gateway. Belle Vernon and TJ.</p>
<p><strong>Jumbo Jack</strong>: How many 5A teams have legit chance this year? Pine and Gateway ahead of the pack it seems. Actually all three games you mention look like championship previews <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Upper St. Clair is good. Peters Township is still good. So is Penn-Trafford and don't forget Moon. Yes, Pine and Gateway are the top two teams --- right now. But I'm tellin' ya, those others are very good. The Pine vs. USC game should be very interesting. I'll take Pine.</p>
<p><strong>slick rick</strong>: Basketball teams are playing in fall preseason leagues right now. Why are they allowed to play now if they are limited to only 2 official scrimmages? What is the difference? Do football teams and baseball teams play preseason games? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Basketball teams have been playing in summer leagues and fall leagues forever. It doesn't count. It's not the start of the official season. Look at baseball. There are high school teams that play fall baseball. In football, teams play 7 on 7 games. Just can't be in full pads. You're allowed to do these things. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It's been fun, but we're done. See ya next Tuesday at 11 a.m. Be good.</p>
