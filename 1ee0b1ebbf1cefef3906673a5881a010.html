<h1>A Pittsburgh couple's Florida retreat is a peaceful, artful sanctuary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With an enviable contemporary art collection and several homes to display it, Pittsburghers Jacqui and Jeff Morby decided their Ocean Reef home on Key Largo, Fla., would be perfect as a&nbsp;sanctuary and showcase for some of their favorite pieces.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Interior designer Gil Walsh and her team worked with the couple to create this artful environment, taking into&nbsp;account the house’s architecture, the Morbys’ lifestyle and their collection.</p>
<p>“I know their style and sense of how they like to live,” she said.</p>
<p>“These are not projects that I do alone. Clients need to participate because this is their brand.”</p>
<p>The Morbys were enthusiastic participants and knew the process well; the interior&nbsp;designer&nbsp;helped create the ambiance in their Martha’s Vineyard home as well. “We have worked with Gil for years,” Mrs. Morby said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Morby is co-chair of the <a href="https://curealz.org/" target="_blank">Cure Alzheimer’s Fund</a>,&nbsp;a nonprofit that supports research directed at finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease. He and his wife helped found the charity with two other families. He is also&nbsp;chairman of the Morby Family Charitable Foundation, and the couple are members of the national council of the World Wildlife Fund. Mrs. Morby also serves on the board of the NPR Foundation and Lead Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The couple had been living in a condominium adjacent to Ocean Reef and decided they wanted more space because they were spending more time in Florida. The 1970s contemporary was the first and only house they looked at.</p>
<p>“We walked in the front door and said, ‘We want this house,’” Mrs. Morby said.&nbsp;“The view is unbelievable, with a broad view of the water and an island. It is just spectacular.”</p>
<p>An&nbsp;acrylic&nbsp;sculpture by Alyson Shotz helped determine the palette of the home. The sculpture refracts light and changes colors throughout the day.</p>
<p>“Sometimes it’s deep purple. Sometimes it’s a&nbsp;rose color, and a lime green comes in,” Mrs. Morby said. “Toward the evening it turns a silvery gold or gold.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they saw the piece at Art Basel in Miami Beach, it had a hold on it, so the Morbys moved on and bought something else.</p>
<p>“We had the name of the gallery, so when we bought this house we called, and they told us the sculptures were done in a series of three,” Mrs. Morby recalled.</p>
<p>One was still available, and they bought it. Ms. Walsh immediately began using its varied spectrum.</p>
<p>“We started in the living room with that sculpture and the changing of the light through the day and the ocean and the coloring that comes off the water,” she explained.</p>
<p>A beautiful blue green became the living room’s dominant shade, accented with purple, lavender and other colors from the sculpture.&nbsp;"The Sea," an oil painting by Miriam Schapiro that hangs over the fireplace, was also an Art Basel find.</p>
<p>“We had wandered all over looking for the right piece of art to hang over the fireplace,” said Mrs. Morby. “It is a 1959 abstract expressionist painting, and the shapes mimic the sculpture.”</p>
<p>Ms. Walsh concurred. “That painting complements the sculpture, and the room all came together.”</p>
<p>The dining room needed to be both beautiful and functional, the designer said.</p>
<p>“When we got to the dining room table, we talked about how Jeff wanted it to accommodate a certain number of people and not be obtrusive. He wanted it to be sculpturally pleasing,” Ms. Walsh said.</p>
<p>Her team found a Florida artist to do the tabletop of crackled grass. It measures 120-by-60 inches and rests&nbsp;on a pair of 20-by-28-inch bases. The table seats 12 and is surrounded by low-profile chairs made from wood and outdoor wicker that Mr. Morby selected.</p>
<p>“The chairs are organic and are perfect,” Ms. Walsh said.</p>
<p>Organic elements are found throughout the house, from the master bedroom’s rope-wrapped bed to the dining table’s coral stone base.</p>
<p>“The base of the table is two pieces of really old coral stone that you can’t find anymore,” said Ms. Walsh, who sourced them at an antique store.</p>
<p>The designer and her clients insisted on an addition that maintained the integrity of the house, which had no second story. The Morbys had an architect design a two-story wing.</p>
<p>“It fits beautifully with the house. It looks like it was always there,” said the designer.</p>
<p>She noted a reeded bamboo element in the ceiling of the new guest bedroom. “We worked with the Morbys and the architect to make it work with the home and feel like you are in the [Florida] Keys.”</p>
<p>The dining room ceiling is also bamboo, Ms. Walsh noted, complementing the couple’s vintage bamboo furniture. “We added bamboo paneling in the study to carry the bamboo theme of the original ceilings.”</p>
<p>The staircase, which has an iron balustrade, offers a wonderful art display wall made from ribbed sheets of bamboo. A circular pendant light mimics the chandelier over the dining room table. Both are custom pieces.</p>
<p>“We wanted them to be artistic and sculptural as well,” Ms. Walsh said. “The lights over the dining room table were set low enough to light the table and high enough to avoid interfering with the view.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Morby said lots of wall space was a must. “We really like our art and enjoy living with it and looking at it and talking about it.”</p>
<p>“Landscape with Boats” by Roy Lichtenstein sits above a red Asian console across the foyer from a floor-to-ceiling artwork by Venezuelan artist Arturo Herrera. Its white expanse pops against a blue Venetian-glazed wall.</p>
<p>“That was in our Pittsburgh house, and when the blue wall was finished I thought, ‘I have the perfect piece for this,’” Mrs. Morby recalled, adding that it was one of the first pieces of art she and her husband bought.</p>
<p>Venetian glazing, which involves wax and crushed marble, is common in Key Largo, she said.&nbsp;“We do a lot of this in Florida because wallpaper does not do well here.”</p>
<p>Off the living room is a hallway where photographs of Andy Warhol by William John Kennedy hang.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot of thought went into how to hang the art and the placement of the art,” Ms. Walsh said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Each element that goes into a home has to satisfy the client and work within the vernacular of the design of the home.”</p>
<p>“Gil was fabulous,” added Mrs. Morby.</p>
