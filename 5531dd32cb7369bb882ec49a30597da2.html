<h1>In a holding pattern: Airport traffic can't shake COVID-19 downturn</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh International Airport’s rebound appears to have stalled at the gate.</p>
<p>After seeing passenger traffic bounce back earlier this summer after tumbling 96% in April because of the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport’s numbers appear to be leveling off.</p>
<p>And with airlines bracing for massive layoffs and an uncertain future without more federal aid on top of the $25 billion doled out in March that prohibited them from cutting jobs through Sept. 30, airport officials aren’t optimistic about a change in fortunes anytime soon.</p>
<p>“Everything is contributing to this. The fact is that the pandemic is still an issue for a lot of people and the economy. These things all add up,” said Christina Cassotis, CEO of the Allegheny County Airport Authority, which operates Pittsburgh International.</p>
<p>The airlines’ predicament hasn’t helped the authority’s efforts to get started on a $1.1 billion airport modernization, which would include construction of a new terminal for ticketing, baggage and security.</p>
<p>At one time, the authority had hoped to start site work on the project in April. But the pandemic has interrupted those plans.</p>
<p>Although the authority’s board amended several contracts related to the modernization Friday, Ms Cassotis said she does not see any construction starting this year.</p>
<p>She noted much of that has to do with the airlines, which would essentially finance the projects through fees they pay to the airport, and their level of comfort in proceeding.</p>
<p>“They just have other things on their minds right now,” she said. “We’re respectful of what is happening in their business.”</p>
<p>Without additional aid, American, the airport’s second-largest carrier, has said it could be forced to cut 19,000 jobs. United has placed the number at more than 16,000.</p>
<p>Southwest, the airport’s largest airline in terms of passengers, hopes to avoid job cuts after a quarter of its payroll, or about 17,000 people, agreed to leave permanently or temporarily. Delta also expects to minimize layoffs thanks to voluntary leaves, buyouts and shorter work schedules.</p>
<p>The airport had been seeing steady improvement in passenger traffic numbers since hitting rock bottom in April.</p>
<p>By June, traffic still was off significantly —&nbsp;down 78.2% —&nbsp;but appeared to be trending in the right direction. But the July and August numbers released Friday showed a slowdown.</p>
<p>Traffic decreased 72.7% in July and 70.3% in August. Ms. Cassotis said the authority’s own forecasts predict that traffic will be off about 70% for the rest of the year.</p>
<p>“I don’t know whether we will beat that or not,” she said. “So far, we’re beating it a little bit.”</p>
<p>A number of factors have contributed to the stagnation. Travel to Canada and the Caribbean remains suspended. The two carriers that serve Europe from the airport —&nbsp;British Airways and Condor —&nbsp;have yet to resume their flights.</p>
<p>One bit of good news is that British Airways is now targeting a March 28, 2021, restart for its service to London after missing a relaunch scheduled for Aug. 2 and another that was set for Oct. 2.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis said the authority continues to talk to Condor about resuming its seasonal flight to Frankfurt, Germany, next year, “although no commitments have been made yet.”</p>
<p>What travel has returned to the airport has been mainly related to leisure, she said. Business, for the most part, remains grounded.</p>
<p>Overall, while the airport has seen a bit of an uptick in demand in recent weeks, planes are only about half full. Passenger counts at the airport’s security checkpoints have “stagnated since early July.”</p>
<p>“We are tracking and hopeful that the fall will be a little bit more robust, but we’re not sure about that yet,” Ms. Cassotis said.</p>
<p>Not everything has been horrible. Flights to Tampa, Myrtle Beach and Las Vegas have seen an increase in capacity.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the authority has introduced a number of measures, from more frequent cleanings to Plexiglass barriers to mask requirements and the use of robotic floor cleaners armed with ultraviolet light disinfecting technology to try to help boost traveler confidence.</p>
<p>But Ms. Cassotis noted that the airport itself is only one step in the journey. Travelers also must have confidence in flying in an airplane and in visiting other places amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>That such confidence still appears to be lacking is borne out in yet another measurement —&nbsp;the year-to-date numbers through August.</p>
<p>Overall traffic is down 60.3%, “a result of reduced demand due to the coronavirus pandemic.”</p>
<p>“That,” Ms. Cassotis sighed, “is the understatement of the century.”</p>
