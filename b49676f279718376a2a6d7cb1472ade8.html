<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No one was hurt and no one was home Monday morning as Pittsburgh firefighters put out a blaze in Hazelwood.</p>
<p>The fire started on the second floor of a home that is part of a unit of three rowhomes, Battalion Chief Ron Dunlap said. It was first reported to authorities just before 7:30 a.m., dispatch officials said.</p>
<p>While the fire spread to the third floor, Chief Dunlap said it was contained to just that home.</p>
<p>“The crews did a good job and knocked (the fire) down pretty quick," he said. “We kept it out of the other houses."</p>
<p>Gas and electric utilities were shut off during the blaze.</p>
