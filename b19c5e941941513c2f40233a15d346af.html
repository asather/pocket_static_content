<h1>Wilkinsburg man who solicited porn images from children in Fla., Minn., is sentenced</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Wilkinsburg man who was found with child pornography on his phone after admitting to the FBI that he coerced minors in other states to send him nude images was sentenced Tuesday to three years in federal prison.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Arthur Schwab imposed that term on Jason Harris Jr., 36.</p>
<p>The case against him started in June 2018 when police in Minnesota received a complaint from a woman who found that naked images of her 7-year-old son had been sent by Skype to someone calling himself “Allahondro Juan Villareeyell.”</p>
<p>Police determined that the conversations originated on PlayStation and continued on Skype.</p>
<p>Records searches turned up an email account, and a subpoena to Google came back to a house on Wright Street in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Then, in Oct. 2018, Wilkinsburg police received information from the sheriff's office in Tampa, Fla., that someone had enticed a 13-year-old boy to take nude images of his 6-year-old brother and send them to someone using Kik — an online messaging system —&nbsp;with an IP address that came back to the same Wright Street address.</p>
<p>FBI and police executed a search warrant at the house on Dec. 6, 2018, where Harris lived with several other people.</p>
<p>When agents told him someone at the house had been using the internet to coerce children to send nude images and videos, he “abruptly stated ‘it was me,’ ” the FBI said in an affidavit.</p>
<p>Agents then seized his phone.</p>
<p>They found nothing regarding the children in Minnesota or Florida, but they did find chats in which Harris requested and received an explicit image from a young girl. They also recovered 171 other child porn images and three child porn videos.</p>
<p>Harris pleaded guilty in June.</p>
<p>His lawyer, Michael Waltman, asked the judge for probation, saying his client suffers from a "litany" of mental health problems and has an extremely low IQ.</p>
<p>Prosecutors acknowledged his mental health problems but said prison was warranted in part as a deterrent to stem the worldwide scourge of child pornography.</p>
