<h1>‘Throwing machine’ Steven Brault dazzles against Cardinals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Before Thursday’s game, Steven Brault met with his catcher, Jacob Stallings, and set a few ground rules. The left-hander said he really didn’t want to think or analyze scouting reports. Meanwhile, Brault promised Stallings that he wasn’t going to shake any signs. He was going to have fun and throw.</p>
<p>“I was going to be a freaking throwing machine,” Brault joked.</p>
<p>With the Pirates looking to snap an eight-game losing skid and their starters continually aiming to pitch deeper into games, the throwing machine revved it up and checked both of those boxes with a complete-game gem during Pittsburgh's 5-1 victory over the Cardinals at PNC Park on Thursday.</p>
<p>Brault commanded his stuff and went right after hitters, carving out a home in and around the strike zone and spending the next 2 hours, 25 minutes there. A couple times Brault pumped his left fist in celebration, including when he fanned Cardinals first baseman Paul Goldschmidt swinging to end it, the 16th consecutive batter Brault retired.</p>
<p>“[Pitching coach] Oscar [Marin] and I talked about after my last outing about just competing more, attacking and trying to get outs as soon as possible and that being the mindset,” Brault said.</p>
<p>It’s a smart plan. One Brault executed, too. But what he did wasn’t so much about a mindset as it was evolving as a pitcher, learning something about himself.</p>
<p>A couple times when Brault went 2-0 on a batter, he didn’t get cute. He shifted back to attack mode. When Stallings began to notice that Brault’s changeup — a project pitch for him this season — was giving the Cardinals problems, the catcher began calling it more and more.</p>
<p>By the later innings, Stallings said he was having Brault throw fastballs in certain places just so he could work back to the changeup.</p>
<p>"That's a pitch that's gotten a lot better for Steven this year," Stallings said of Brault's changeup. "You see two-seam spin, it starts to slow down, and it's got a lot of depth to it. It was definitely on [Thursday].”</p>
<p>Despite throwing his changeup 22.5% of the time this season, Brault used it 31% against the Cardinals. Brault walked two and struck out eight in 110 pitches, 65 for strikes. Only three balls the Cardinals were considered hard-hit — 95 mph and above. Two of those resulted in outs.</p>
<p>“He attacked the zone,” manager Derek Shelton said. “He went right after guys.”</p>
<p>While also avoiding one — his manager.</p>
<p>Brault said he purposefully steered clear of Shelton in the later innings, not wanting to trigger a thought in his manager’s mind of potentially pulling him and eliminating the chase for his first nine-inning complete game since college.</p>
<p>“It’s little mind games, like, when you're on the sideline in football and you kind of go stand by the coach, trying to crane your head so he'll see you and you can go in,” Brault said. “It’s kind of the opposite — avoid him, so he doesn't call on me in class and try to take me out.”</p>
<p>Brault’s previous MLB high for innings pitched was seven, which came Aug. 17, 2019 against the Cubs. Thursday marked just the fourth time he worked more than six innings in a game.</p>
<p>The Pirates offense took advantage of what turned out to be a bullpen game for the Cardinals after starter Dakota Hudson after two innings with right elbow tightness. They got their big hit in the fourth: a three-run homer for Gregory Polanco against left-hander Austin Gomber.</p>
<p>Polanco has obviously battled slumps this season and came into Thursday’s game in another sizable one, with no hits in his past five games and just two in his previous 36 at-bats.</p>
<p>But with two outs and the Pirates looking to capitalize on back-to-back walks to start the inning, Polanco flashed his tantalizing potential with one swing of the bat.</p>
<p>Getting a 2-2 slider from Gomber, Polanco drove it 407 feet at 109.3 mph to right-center field, giving the Pirates a 3-1 lead.</p>
<p>“It’s been a struggle," Polanco said. "It’s been hard for me to hit the ball lately – I mean, the whole season, obviously. Any time I catch one and I can hit the ball on the barrel, it feels really good, man."</p>
<p>The Pirates also got a run-scoring double from Stallings and a sacrifice fly from Josh Bell. Ke'Bryan Hayes and Bryan Reynolds added a couple of strong defensive plays, too.</p>
<p>But given the issues Pirates starters have experienced — just two quality starts coming into Thursday’s game, four times completing six innings — Brault’s gem was very much needed and appreciated.</p>
<p>"I wasn’t worried,” Stallings said. “I was interested to see how it would play out. He doesn't like a whole lot of information anyway. We'll talk more about him than hitters, typically. That's just how he is. I guess we'll probably do the same thing next time."</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Hayes was hit by a pitch in the seventh inning but shook it off and stayed in the game. … Erik Gonzalez has three hits in his last 30 at-bats (.100). … Bell saw his 10-game hitting streak come to a close. He went 0-for-2 with a walk, strikeout, RBI and run scored.</p>
