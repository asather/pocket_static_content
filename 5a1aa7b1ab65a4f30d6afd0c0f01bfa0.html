<h1>Fayette County cocaine distributor in cross-country ring gets 5-plus years in prison</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Fayette County distributor for one of the largest drug rings ever prosecuted in western&nbsp; Pennsylvania is headed to federal prison for more than five years.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak on Thursday imposed a term of 70 months on Devon Bell, originally of New Salem, Pa., who had pleaded guilty in May to his role in a massive ring that federal agents say was run by Don Juan Mendoza of Jacksonville, Fla., and his top lieutenant, Jamie Lightfoot Jr. of Penn Hills.</p>
<p>Bell, 27 when he pleaded, had admitted to trafficking in 500 grams or more of cocaine and has been detained since April 2018.</p>
<p>Bell conspired with Jamie Lightfoot, his brother Deaubre Lightfoot and other members of a network that the FBI said transported cocaine from Los Angeles and Atlanta to Jamie Lightfoot's home in Penn Hills.</p>
<p>From there it was distributed across the region, especially in Fayette County. Prosecutors said the Lightfoots delivered large quantities of cocaine to Bell at multiple locations in Fayette County, including his residence in New Salem.</p>
<p>Bell then used his home and other residences to re-package and distribute the drugs to other customers in Fayette County.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Tim Lanni asked the judge to give Bell a high-end sentence given the scope of the drug organization and Bell's role in it.</p>
<p>"Until his arrest, [he] was able to enjoy a nice, even luxurious life-style with little or no work experience and almost no reported income," Mr. Lanni said in sentencing papers.</p>
<p>He said Bell was able to buy and renovate multiple homes using drug money.</p>
<p>"A sentence at the low end of the guideline range or even the middle would send a message that committing such serious crimes is an acceptable pay off," Mr. Lanni said.</p>
<p>But Bell's lawyer, Paul Gettleman, asked for a lower-range sentence, saying there was no substantial evidence that Bell received drugs at his home or that the house was the center of drug activity.</p>
<p>He also said Bell did not enjoy a life of luxury. Bell lived in a duplex owned by his father and did work on it in lieu of paying rent, Mr. Gettleman said. As for buying multiple houses, Mr. Gettleman said Bell bought three homes through a tax sale in Fayette County for a total of $1,000. One burned down and the other two are vacant and awaiting renovation, he said.</p>
<p>"Bell, as noted in his presentence memorandum, in no way profited from his lifestyle because he had no lifestyle to speak of," Mr. Gettleman wrote. "He is a single dad who take care of his kids and that is a full-time job as any single parent would know."</p>
<p>In addition to the 70-month term, Judge Hornak imposed a probationary term of four years.</p>
<p>Federal agents were monitoring the Mendoza ring for months and in November 2017 tracked a cross-country RV shipment from Los Angeles to Jamie Lightfoot's home on Harvest Lane. Inside, agents and police recovered 52 kilos of cocaine, 85 pounds of marijuana and an AK-47.</p>
