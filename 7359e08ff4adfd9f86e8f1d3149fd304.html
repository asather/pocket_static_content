<h1>Texas’ lieutenant governor says he, ‘lots of grandparents’ would give lives to save economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While speaking on Fox News on Monday night, Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick said that as a senior citizen, he would exchange his life to keep the American economy afloat.</p>
<p>"So my message is that, let's get back to work, let's get back to living, let's be smart about it, and those of us who are 70 plus, we'll take care of ourselves," Patrick said on Tucker Carlson's show. "But don't sacrifice the country."</p>
<p>Patrick, who turned 70 last week, said he does not want the economy to collapse because of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>"No one reached out to me and said, as a senior citizen, are you willing to take a chance for your survival in exchange for keeping the America that all America loves for your children and grandchildren? And if that's the exchange, I'm all in," Patrick said in the Fox News interview.</p>
<p>"I just think there are lots of grandparents out there in this country like me -- I have six grandchildren -- that what we all care about and what we love more than anything are those children," Patrick continued. "And I want to live smart and see through this, but I don't want the whole country to be sacrificed, and that's what I see."</p>
<p>Carlson asked Patrick, "You're basically saying that this disease could take your life, but that's not the scariest thing to you? There's something that would be worse than dying?"</p>
<p>Patrick said yes, and that if restrictions continued for several more months, the economy would collapse.</p>
<p>"I intend to be around a long time on your show, but it's worth whatever it takes to save the country," Patrick said.</p>
<p>"The point is, our biggest gift we give to our country and our children and our grandchildren is the legacy of our country, and right now, that is at risk," Patrick continued. "I feel like, as the president said, the mortality rate is so low, do we have to shut down the whole country for this? I think we can get back to work."</p>
<p>A clip of the interview went viral on Twitter, garnering thousands of retweets and comments.</p>

<p>Patrick’s statements came hours after Texas made national headlines when its&nbsp;governor and attorney general moved to ban most abortions in the state during the coronavirus outbreak, declaring they don’t qualify as essential surgeries.</p>
<p>Attorney General Ken Paxton said Monday that the order issued over the weekend by Gov. Greg Abbott barred “any type of abortion that is not medically necessary to preserve the life or health of the mother.”</p>
<p>Failure to comply with the order can result in penalties of up to $1,000 or 180 days of jail time, Paxton said.</p>
<p>“No one is exempt from the governor’s executive order on medically unnecessary surgeries and procedures, including abortion providers,” Paxton said. “Those who violate the governor’s order will be met with the full force of the law.”</p>
<p>The issue also has flared in Ohio, where abortion clinics received letters Friday from Republican Attorney General Dave Yost ordering them to cease all “non-essential” surgical abortions. Yost wrote that the procedures violate a March 17 order issued by the state health director.</p>
