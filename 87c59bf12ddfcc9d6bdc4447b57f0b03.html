<p>Taylor Gang Entertainment has a new artist on the roster.</p>
<p>The label founded in 2008 by Pittsburgh rap star Wiz Khalifa has added 26-year-old Northview Heights rapper Fedd the God, whose real name is James William Fedd Jr.</p>
<p>He joins a Taylor Gang crew that also includes Juicy J, Ty Dolla $ign, Berner and Chevy Woods.</p>
<p>With the announcement comes his debut single <a href="https://biglink.to/kingjames" target="_blank">“King James,”</a> produced by Sledgren and Chris Dreamer.</p>
<p>“We are extremely excited to bring Fedd into the family and can’t wait to see him grow!” Taylor Gang president Will Dzombak said in a statement.</p>
<p>According to a Taylor Gang release, Fedd the God “earned a reputation for throwing wild parties” and he formed a bond with Dzombak after the rapper got into a fight with a friend of the TG president.</p>
<p>Fedd the God’s project “The Feddko Zone” will arrive later this summer.</p>
