<h1>Joe Starkey: Steelers should think hard about a running back in NFL draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Running backs are like Sheetz convenience stores. You can find one anywhere —&nbsp;and no, this is not headed toward a Jeff Reed joke.</p>
<p>Chris Carson was a seventh-round pick. Aaron Jones went in the fifth round, Alvin Kamara the third. The San Francisco 49ers are rolling with guys who weren’t drafted at all.</p>
<p>Plus, the Steelers have other needs.</p>
<p>I get it.</p>
<p>But it’s not like they’re solid and settled at the position. James Conner is down to one year on his contract and can’t seem to stay on the field. Benny Snell Jr. is a questionable option as Conner’s competition/backup.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong. That could be a workable pair. Conner is very good when healthy. Snell showed promise. It might have to be a workable pair, considering the Steelers have only a handful of picks at the moment and won’t be called until the middle of the second round.</p>
<p>But the idea of drafting their back of the future (maybe the very near future) has to be enticing, given the circumstances at hand.</p>
<p>For one, the second round seems to be a sweet spot for some electric running backs — Dalvin Cook, Derrick Henry, Nick Chubb, Joe Mixon — and this year’s draft is stocked. It is deep with big-talent backs. Big-name ones, too.</p>
<p>For another, the position has been devalued to the point where a bona fide gem (see: Bell, Le’Veon) could drop into your lap on Day Two. The Steelers’ first pick is No. 49 — one pick behind where they snagged Bell in 2013.</p>
<p>Charlie Campbell (no relation to Earl) of walterfootball.com is one of the more accurate mock drafters around. He has just two running backs going in the first round — Georgia’s D’Andre Swift and Wisconsin’s Jonathan Taylor. Others project a one-back first round.</p>
<p>Campbell has Clemson’s Travis Etienne going 47th to Atlanta — think he’d give the Steelers backfield a jolt? — which would leave the likes of Ohio State’s J.K. Dobbins and Utah’s Zack Moss available (others believe Dobbins will go much earlier).</p>
<p>And, depending on if they declare, Oklahoma State’s Chuba Hubbard and Alabama’s Najee Harris — two monster talents — could still be on the board when the Steelers come to bat.</p>
<p>How could you not be tempted to swing for the fences?</p>
<p>I mean, a tight end would be fine. A depth receiver or a promising offensive lineman would be nice. But those positions can be filled in other places, too, just like running back can. George Kittle was a fifth-round pick.</p>
<p>Keep these two truths in mind …</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> None of this and nothing else matters if Ben Roethlisberger does not return to form, especially if the Steelers don’t bring in a just-in-case veteran quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> The Steelers function best, under Mike Tomlin and across time, with an effective running game centered around a work-horse back. Those two entities allow them to close games efficiently and keep the defense fresh.</p>
<p>A dink-and-dunk passing attack can serve as a de facto running game, it’s true, but there is something to establishing yourself physically in a football game. Especially, it would seem, for the Steelers.</p>
<p>Remember the six-game winning streak in 2018, the one that had everybody thinking Super Bowl? Conner posted four 100-yard games in that stretch.</p>
<p>Remember the seven-game winning streak to end the 2016 regular season? That all revolved around Bell, who ran for 835 yards in the first six, then ran wild in the first two playoff games.</p>
<p>The eight-game winning streak in 2017 began with Bell’s 179-yard performance against Kansas City, before Roethlisberger heated up (helps open the pass game when teams are fearful of your star running back).</p>
<p>There are all kinds of theories as to why the Steelers running game was a running joke all season — Mike Munchak’s departure as line coach and run-game coordinator, Conner’s injuries, Randy Fichtner’s play-calling, the line’s advancing age.</p>
<p>The list goes on, and there is probably truth in all of it. But the primary reason for this team’s inability to establish a significant ground game almost seems too obvious. Tomlin spoke to it late in the season.</p>
<p>“(It’s) because we’ve got young QBs and young wideouts and people pack the box,” Tomlin said, before adding, “And we could perform better.”</p>
<p>For better or worse (I say better), most of the line is returning. The top three receivers are set. The running backs might be OK as is. Might be better than that if Conner stays healthy. But if, say, Dobbins or Hubbard or Moss is staring the Steelers in the face at No. 49, they’d have to be awfully tempted.</p>
<p>Not every year is stocked like this one.</p>
