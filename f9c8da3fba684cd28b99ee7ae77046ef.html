If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p><p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Is next season considered do or die for Mike Tomlin if the Steelers miss the playoffs for a 3rd straight year?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> No. I am convinced he could go 6-10 next year with Ben Roethlisberger and we’d hear all about three coaches in 51 years and the Steelers way. That’s just how they do things. I don’t want to be the one to deliver the bad news, but that’s just how the Steelers do business. They don’t fire coaches. They like stability. And in Tomlin’s case, he won a Super Bowl so that buys him a lot of time. Tomlin is a good coach, so I don’t have an issue with them keeping him around, but this idea that a Super Bowl means you get a lifetime contract is silly. Plenty of guys have won Super Bowls and been fired in the past. Tomlin shouldn’t be fired or on the hot seat, but he also has not maximized his time with Ben Roethlisberger.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Franklin:</strong> I know that James Conner is a fan favorite but he is not the answer. What can the Steelers do to address the running back position?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> I would actually go out and draft one and maybe sign a veteran, too. I just don’t know that any of the running backs they have are good enough or durable enough. They absolutely need to address this position in the offseason. I don’t know that they can get a veteran at a reasonable price, but they need to try.</p><p><strong>Chet:</strong> Predict the depth chart at quarterback for the Steelers next year. And is Devlin Hodges on an NFL roster next year?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> Ben Roethlisberger, Mason Rudolph, Paxton Lynch. I really believe they are committed to Rudolph as their future quarterback, so they aren’t going to go sign some veteran. And Hodges will not be on a roster.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Thomas:&nbsp;</strong>Is the Redskins’ offer for Tomlin still on the table? Let’s hope so.</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> Well considering they are hiring Ron Rivera, probably not.</p><p><strong>Mike:</strong> Are the Steelers going to hire a quarterbacks coach? If they are going to come back with Devlin Hodges and Mason Rudolph as the two backups, they better hire someone to work with them.</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> Mike Tomlin sort of addressed this Tuesday. It sounds like they will consider it, and it would make sense if Rudolph is indeed going to be the backup. I know I am in the minority, but I absolutely agree that Rudolph should be the backup next year. I think he can do it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Jake,@ScarQuip:</strong>&nbsp;Is OL the biggest need in the draft for the #Steelers?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> No, I think they have a lot of in house options and I’d much rather see them find an inexpensive veteran they can plug in. I think they have other areas to address in the draft, and offensive linemen sometimes take a few years to develop. I could see a situation where B.J. Finney, Zach Banner or Chuks Okorafor and Matt Feiler are all starters. There will be some shakeup, but I think they have the bodies already to pull it off.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MattK IX,&nbsp;@MattKriz:&nbsp;</strong>The Penguins are playing at a 110-point pace and aren’t creating much separation in the standings. Which teams in the Metro are going to be able to keep it up and which will fall off?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> The four playoff teams from that division are the Capitals, Penguins, Hurricanes and Islanders. I am not sold on Philadelphia. I am not sure what the order will be, though I think it will be Caps, Islanders, Pens and then Carolina. Those four teams are all going to be tough outs in the playoffs, so it should be a lot of fun watching them go at it. The Eastern Conference in general is wide open this year.</p><p><strong>Marty:</strong> Paul, I appreciate your optimism about Pitt football but I can’t get excited about a team that struggles to win the Quick Lane Bowl. All of the players coming back is a good thing, but don’t you think the offensive line is still going to struggle? And isn’t Pat Narduzzi, game day coach, always going to hold back Pat Narduzzi, recruiter and program builder?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> That’s a good point. Narduzzi does need to improve in some areas on game day. He has built a very strong program, though, in terms of the talent and depth, and that’s a great start. He now needs to get this offense in gear, and I think there are elements in place for that to happen, as well. Every coach makes game day blunders, but if you have a good program in place and enough talent, I think you can overcome that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ryan, @supekrc:</strong>&nbsp;Will the Pirates increase or decrease payroll this year?</p><p><strong>Paul:</strong> I think it will be very similar to last year. It may be a little less because they will shed some bigger salary players. It could go up a little because of the arbitration players. I don’t see a change in philosophy on spending, though, and can’t see any real investment in new players being made.</p></body></html>
