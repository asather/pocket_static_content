<h1>Pa. Supreme Court won't hear Alex Hribal's appeal in Franklin Regional mass stabbing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Supreme Court said on Monday the it would not hear the appeal of Alexander Hribal, who pleaded guilty to wounding 19 students and a security guard at Franklin Regional High School during a mass stabbing in 2014.</p>
<p>Hribal, 22, is serving 23&nbsp;½&nbsp;to 60 years in prison after pleading guilty to multiple counts of attempted homicide and aggravated assault in January 2018.</p>
<p>He is currently being held at the State Correctional Institution at Albion.</p>
<p>In October, the Pennsylvania Superior Court upheld Hribal’s sentence, finding that Westmoreland County Common Pleas Judge Christopher Feliciani made the right decision in having Hribal tried as an adult. Hribal argued that his case should have been heard in juvenile court since he was 16 at the time of the April 9, 2014, attack.</p>
<p>The court also dismissed Hribal’s argument that he should have been allowed to plead guilty but mentally ill to the crime — which Judge Feliciani rejected.</p>
