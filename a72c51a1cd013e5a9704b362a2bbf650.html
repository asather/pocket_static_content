<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania reported no new COVID-19-related deaths and 521 new cases, the state health department said Monday.</p>
<p>The last time the state had zero deaths in its daily report was Aug.17. With the additional cases, the state has had 134,025, while the death toll remained at 7,673.</p>
<p>Of the 521 newest cases, 82 come from Western Pennsylvania. Allegheny County saw the highest increase on Monday with 37 new cases, followed by Washington County with 16.</p>
<p>This is the 11th day in a row that Allegheny County reported less than 100 new, single-day cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county’s new cases come from 732 tests that were obtained between Aug. 25 and Aug. 30. Those who have tested positive range in ages 4 to 100 years old, with a median age of 34.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of the pandemic, the county has had 10,347 positive cases of the virus, 330 deaths and 969 hospitalizations.</p>
<p>According to the most recent data from the state, Allegheny County currently has 62 people hospitalized for COVID-19, 15 of which are require mechanical ventilation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county health department also announced that as of Sunday, all positive antigen tests will be counted as probable cases.</p>
<p>“Cases with positive antigen tests were previously only counted as probable cases if they also had symptoms of COVID-19 or had close contact with a known case. Now all positive antigen cases will be counted as probable cases regardless of symptoms or exposure,” the health department said.</p>
<p>The antigen test is a more recent and faster test for COVID-19 that some universities and health systems are using. It works by detecting proteins that are part of the virus, and results are received within hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This change will only be applied to future cases.&nbsp;</p>
