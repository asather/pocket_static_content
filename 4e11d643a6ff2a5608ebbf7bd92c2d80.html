<h1>Port Authority cellphone app for bus fares to be tested</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority is getting ready to move ahead with a new mobile app that will allow riders to pay transit fares using their cellphones.</p>
<p>At board committee meetings Friday, the authority announced it would begin installing equipment next week on 50 buses that use seven routes to begin testing the mobile app.</p>
<p>The app has been under development for more than a year through a contract of nearly $2 million with Masabi and will go through two rounds of testing before it becomes available to the general public, said Jeffrey Devlin, the authority’s chief information officer. The initial testing will be done by authority employees and select groups for about six week to make sure the monitors that read the cellphone app work properly.</p>
<p>Monitors will be installed on 24 buses based at the Collier garage and 26 at the Ross garage. If the monitors, called validators, work properly, the authority will order the rest of them for installation on all 720 buses plus all light rail vehicles.</p>
<p>Then there will be a second round of testing that will include some public participation.</p>
<p>Mr. Devlin said it is too soon to know when the system will be available to the general public.</p>
<p>The system will work like this: A rider will download the app to a cellphone and purchase their preferred fare — a day pass, weekly pass, monthly pass or annual pass — using a credit card or bank account before they get on the bus or light rail car. When they get on, they show their phone to the monitor, which will be to the right of the fare box on buses, to pay the fare.</p>
<p>Mr. Devlin stressed that the system also will allow people without cellphones to buy their fares on a computer.</p>
<p>The authority will continue to accept cash and the prepaid ConnectCard to pay fares.</p>
<p>“It’s just another option we’re making available to our riders,” Mr. Devlin said. “The beauty of it is, you can be standing at the bus stop and purchase the gate and 12 seconds later get on the bus and use it. You don’t have to do it in advance like the ConnectCard.”</p>
<p>Under its contract, Masabi also receives a declining percentage of each fare as the use of the app increases.</p>
<p>A committee also recommended the authority's board approve a $1.7 million contract with Michael Baker International Inc. to help it develop a long-range plan that will project service needs across Allegheny County over the next 25 years.</p>
<p>The plan, which will take two years to develop, will be one of the key topics when the agency begins a series of public engagement meetings Jan. 29 at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.</p>
