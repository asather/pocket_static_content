<p>The closure of Reservoir Drive in Highland Park to vehicular traffic — meant to facilitate social distancing — also&nbsp;has restricted access to certain amenities to people with disabilities, advocates told the city Monday.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the&nbsp;city announced it had closed Reservoir Drive to all non-emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>The parking area reserved for people with disabilities at the end of Farmhouse Drive remains open, but during a public Zoom meeting for the City-County Task Force on Disabilities, community member Tina Calabro raised the issue of accessibility.</p>
<p>Ms. Calabro said that the city is in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act based on the Title II regulations, which say that public facilities must be accessible to people with disabilities.</p>
<p>“It appears that the city did not consider how people with mobility limitation would access park amenities that are located along the 1.3-mile Reservoir Drive,” said Ms. Calabro.</p>
<p>Some of those amenities include an ADA-accessible playground, picnic shelters and benches.</p>
<p>Ms. Calabro also noted that the lack of proper signage telling people how to get to the ADA parking was another misstep with the new regulations.</p>
<p>Hillary Roman, the ADA coordinator for the Office of City Planning, said that the city is “going to make adjustments,” though she didn’t specify what adjustments would be made.</p>
<p>Because there is no definite timeline for when things will be fixed, Ms. Calabro said that she plans to file a formal ADA grievance with the state.</p>
<p>“I don't think anyone did this with any specific intention,” said Ms. Roman. “The reaction internally has been pretty nimble, but the city is working pretty hard to address this. Hopefully in the future these types of missteps don’t occur.”</p>
<p>The new configuration forces vehicles into a small turnaround at the main park entrance at the top of Highland Avenue. Vehicles that used to park along curbs along Reservoir Drive now must find other areas, often on Highland Avenue.</p>
