<h1>Steelworkers try to unionize workers at Carnegie museums</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh reopened its four venues to the public Monday, 500 of its employees launched efforts to organize a union.</p>
<p>The museum employees work at The Andy Warhol Museum and Carnegie Science Center on the North Side and at Carnegie Museums of Art and Natural History in Oakland. They are seeking representation by the United Steelworkers of America.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 6:30 p.m. Monday, the union launched a multimedia campaign on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/steelworkers/videos/1181498068851437/" target="_blank">Facebook Live</a> and YouTube. Employees from each of the museums are shown talking about why they have chosen to join together and bargain for a safer workplace and fair wages and benefits.</p>
<p>Workers participating in the campaign perform a variety of jobs at the museums, including assisting visitors and caring for exhibits, according to an announcement from the United Steelworkers.</p>
<p>The USW represents 850,000 workers employed in metals, mining, pulp and paper, rubber, chemicals, glass, auto supply and the energy-producing industries, along with a growing number of workers in health care, public sector, higher education, tech and service occupations.</p>
