<h1>Latter-day Saints plans Pittsburgh temple</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints plans to build a temple in Pittsburgh, a milestone reflecting the growing population in this region of believers traditionally known as Mormons.</p>
<p>Latter-day Saints Church President Russell M. Nelson this week announced plans for temples in Pittsburgh and seven other places around the world ranging from Dubai to Shanghai.</p>
<p>The announcement comes nearly four years after the dedication of Pennsylvania’s first temple, dedicated in Philadelphia in 2016.</p>
<p>There were no details about a specific location for the Pittsburgh temple, or a construction timeline, in Mr. Nelson’s announcement.&nbsp;“Church architects will work with local officials so that the temple will harmonize with and be a beautiful addition to each community,” Mr. Nelson said.</p>
<p>While current figures weren’t immediately available, the church <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2014/09/15/Mormon-population-expanding-in-Pittsburgh-region/stories/201409140090" target="_blank">reported about 9,000 members in the Tri-State area in 2014, when it expanded from two to three stakes,</a> a structure similar to a diocese.</p>
<p>Mr. Nelson’s announcement came Sunday during the church’s General Conference, a semi-annual series of teaching sessions, sermons and announcements, which was held online this year from the church’s Salt Lake City, Utah, headquarters due to the coronavirus shutdowns.</p>
<p>The church announcement touted the significant role that Pennsylvania played in Latter-day Saints history. Church founder Joseph Smith, whom the church reveres as a prophet who restored the ancient Christian faith, married Susquehanna County native Emma Smith, and they lived there from 1828 to 1830. It was there that he produced much of the Book of Mormon, which he said was translated from ancient golden plates he had discovered in New York through the guidance of an angel.</p>
<p>The church currently has 168 dedicated temples worldwide, with others under construction, Mr. Nelson said.</p>
<p>While the Latter-day Saints have meetinghouses for routine Sunday worship and other activities, temples occupy an important role in the faith. The church believes its temples are modeled on the ancient biblical temple, and that it is only within temples that certain sacred rites of the faith occur. These include proxy baptism for the dead and the “sealing” of married couples and families for eternity.</p>
<p>Although Latter-day Saints have historically been called Mormons, leaders of the church moved away from using that name in recent years, emphasizing the use of the church’s full name.</p>
