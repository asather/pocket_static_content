<h1>Paul Zeise's mailbag: What's all the fuss about Cole Tucker?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.&nbsp;Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Trags:</strong> What’s all the hoopla over Cole Tucker? He is an awful hitter and strikes out often with the bases loaded. I don’t get it at all. Help me out?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Tucker represents the Pirates future to so many. I think people want him to be a star because there just haven’t been many stars come through the Pirates system in recent years. I don’t know if he will come around with the bat, but if he doesn’t then he will be a light-hitting middle infielder and yet another example of how hoarding prospects doesn’t always make sense. Think of all the players the Pirates have held onto like they were gold coins that turned into not much of anything. That is the trickiest thing about baseball — figuring out when players’ value is the highest. A lot of Pirates prospects recently were far more valuable as prospects than they were as players for the actual club. Tucker is young, but he does need to show some semblance of figuring it out at the plate this year.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> I know you young people want to believe in the Pirates, but how can you? How can you believe in a team that is merely a cash cow for the owner? I like Ben Cherington, but he has an impossible job.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Wow, I am thankful that you consider me in the category of&nbsp;“young people.” As for the Pirates, I can only give them the benefit of the doubt that they are trying to figure out how to win. I agree they could pay more for salaries than they do, but the question is how much more? Nobody seems to have that answer, and that’s part of the problem.</p>
<p><strong>Marty C:</strong> Is it possible that the Pirates could actually get hot to start the season and finish with like 30-31 wins?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:&nbsp;</strong>Sure it is possible. It’s also possible they could finish with 10 wins. We have seen in short samples that the Pirates play really well and win games. There is so much unknown and so many variables with this short season. There is no margin for error either.</p>
<p><strong>Nate:</strong>&nbsp;Do these people that say they are “conflicted” with sports returning realize that America had sporting events during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic that killed an estimated 20 million to 50 million people globally?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know what one has to do with the other, but OK. The big thing with the&nbsp;“conflicted” crowd is they apparently think that makes them sound empathetic and as if&nbsp;“they care more” when in reality it doesn’t. I can say without question that I understand fully how serious the COVID-19 pandemic is. I also understand that it is OK to know that and want to enjoy some sense of normalcy, and that doesn’t mean I don’t care. We need to learn how to safely co-exist in a world where it exists because it isn’t going anywhere. Saying&nbsp;“I am conflicted” about sports coming back is basically saying you are conflicted about whether or not we should live our lives as normal as possible, and that’s silly.</p>
<p><strong>Jack:</strong> I fail to see how playing separate national anthems is going to cause unity or bring people together. Can you help me with this one?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> It isn’t and it won’t. As I wrote a few weeks ago, it is a short-sighted decision based in emotion and not common sense. African-Americans have fought for years to earn the same rights and equality as white people. We should be fighting for an America where the the ideals of the national anthem embraces all people of every race, gender and color. It makes no sense to want to have a separate national anthem to play. It is window dressing.</p>
<p><strong>Michelle:</strong> The NBA chose to “live in a bubble” for three months to protect each other from coronavirus exposure. Is this what all sports who want to continue to play will have to do? How likely is it to keep 22 teams, the players, coaches, announcers and referees quarantined? Can contact sports and COVID-19 exist together?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> We are about to find out, right? I don’t know if the bubble thing will work, but I do know they are going to give it the old college try. And if the goal is that nobody ever gets a positive test, then no, sports can’t co-exist with COVID-19. But that’s not the stated goal of any of these safety procedures. I think the NBA and NHL will work out just fine.</p>
