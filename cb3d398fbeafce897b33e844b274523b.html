<h1>In West Virginia, Oglebay Resort welcomes guests — with some changes — as states ease pandemic restrictions</h1>

<p>Six-year-old Hayley Cavalier wasn’t specific when asked what she wanted to do during the unofficial start of summer.</p>
<p>“Everything,” she said, shyly, holding the hand of her mother, Diana Cavalier. On the agenda: paddleboats, miniature golf and fireworks.</p>
<p>They were waiting with Rita Ewing, all of Jefferson Hills, to check into their cabin at Oglebay Resort and Conference Center in West Virginia. The family has often visited the resort about 60 miles outside of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>It was the first kickoff of the season for Oglebay, a year-round resort near Wheeling. And after weeks of lockdown meant to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic, people seemed eager to visit for a weekend getaway or a day trip as states begin to ease restrictions on businesses.</p>

<p>“They had great specials on cabins, so it was a nice chance to get out,” said Ms. Ewing.</p>
<p>Speaking through a mask, Ms. Ewing said she wasn’t concerned about the trip, though some relatives that had been invited to join them opted to stay at home.</p>
<p>“You have to play it smart. We have things with our hand sanitizer and masks. We came prepared.” Ms. Ewing said. “This isn’t going away anytime soon.”</p>
<p>With sunny skies and temperatures in the upper 70s, the golf carts prowled the greens and people lined up — hitting the marks on the ground to keep visitors spaced apart — to get kayaks and paddleboats for the lake, the playground or aerial course. The pool, petting zoo and massage services are still closed due to the pandemic. Masks for guests were encouraged but most decided to forgo them on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>This is the third year that Becky Mikelonis of Scott Township, has visited the West Virginia destination for Memorial Day weekend with her sisters Nora Kohnfelder and Oliva Kohnfelder and daughter Adelyn.</p>
<p>Olivia Kohnfelder, of South Fayette, said they were prepared to cancel if they felt they needed to, but they ultimately felt it was safe to make the weekend trip.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to feel kind of back to normal,” said Nora Kohnfelder, of Greentree.</p>
<p>But, with a mask around her neck, she said it’s important for people to take precautions.</p>
<p>“Just because things are open and everyone has their own opinion on whether to wear masks, as things open up, it’s only going to work if people think about social distancing and keeping other people safe.”</p>
<p>The parking lot — which had license plates from West Virginia, of course, along with Pennsylvania, Virginia, Maryland, Ohio and as far as Georgia — was steady but not flooded as folks ventured out.</p>
<p>Still, Oglebay isn’t hurting for guests. The resort’s 54 cabins were booked for the weekend and 75% of the 270 lodge rooms were rented, according to Beth Whitehouse, general manager of the resort.</p>
<p>“The guests have been very patient as we all adapt to these changes that we’ve put in place with social distancing and extra sanitizing and cleaning procedures,” she said.</p>
<p>The resort is known for its buffet, which is still in place, but employees now serve guests rather than let customers queue up and hover over open food.</p>
<p>The fireworks display will be a little different to maintain space among visitors. This year it will be drive-in style: People will be asked to stay in their cars or open up the back to watch the show.</p>
<p>“And they can responsibly pull out a chair,” Ms. Whitehouse said.</p>
<p>Jessica Lucas of St. Clairsville, Ohio, watched her two kids, Carson, 12, and Berlin, 14, on the aerial course.</p>
<p>“I told them this morning to get dressed because we’re going out,” she said. “I think people should use common sense. I see that they’re only letting a certain number of people on at a time and wiping down the harnesses.”</p>
<p>As a bee flew close by, Ms. Lucas said, “I don’t think I’ll ever complain about bugs again.”</p>
