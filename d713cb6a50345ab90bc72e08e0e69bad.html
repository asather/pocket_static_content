<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC cemented its status as the top team in Group F with a dominating 6-0 victory against Philadelphia Union II on Saturday at Subaru Park in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Two first-half goals from the dynamic attack of Ropapa Mensah and Daniel Griffin forced Philadelphia to make four changes at the break. The win marks the first time the Riverhounds (2-0-0) have started a season with six points from the first two games. Steevan dos Santos subbed in for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/soccer/2020/07/16/robbie-mertz-riverhounds-usl-championship-2020-season/stories/202007150154" target="_blank">Upper St. Clair native Robbie Mertz</a> with 10 minutes left in the match and immediately converted two headers to complete the rout.</p>
<p>“We had to battle early on,” coach Bob Lilley said in a statement. “They’re an athletic team that has pace. The first half was pretty even. We were able to settle down as the half wore on and rotate the ball while finding space in the wide areas. The two goals before half were very important. I thought we played a pretty good second half.</p>
<p>“We were fortunate we didn’t concede a goal — the first few good chances fell to Philadelphia. I think once we got on track the guys were intelligent in their play. It’s good to see the movement up front. Overall, it was a pretty good performance. It’s important that we got our three points and now we can turn our attention to the Indy Eleven game on Wednesday.”</p>
<p>The Riverhounds’ first home match of the season is set for 6 p.m. Wednesday against Indy at Highmark Stadium. The game will be televised on ESPN2.</p>
