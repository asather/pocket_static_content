<h1>The Rolling Stones will invade Pittsburgh in June -- for the 11th time</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In June 1964, an up-and-coming British band that had a hit with a Buddy Holly cover pulled into West View Park’s Danceland. The Rolling Stones played to a few hundred people, some of whom pelted them with cups because they had long hair.</p>
<p>Three months later, their more famous British rivals, The Beatles, played their one and only Pittsburgh show at the Civic Arena to 12,600 fans who screamed so loudly that no one could hear the band.</p>
<p>The oldsters thought this rock ’n’ roll thing was just a fad. Even the musicians themselves figured they’d move on to other things.</p>
<p>“I’d rather be dead than sing ‘Satisfaction’ when I’m 45,” lead singer Mick Jagger told People magazine in 1975.</p>
<p>Now, here we are, 56 years after the Stones invaded Pittsburgh, and on June 23, the band will pack Heinz Field. Three days before, Ringo Starr of The Beatles will be Downtown, playing to thousands at <a href="http://www.ppgpaintsarena.com/events/detail/ringo-star" target="_blank">PPG Paints Arena</a>.</p>
<p>“Not Fade Away,” the Stones’ first single to chart in the States, turned out to be prescient; three original band members are still on board.</p>
<p>On the 15-city No Filter Tour, Jagger will be 76, as will Keith Richards, who is expected to outlive the cockroach. Ronnie Wood, who joined the Stones in 1975, is the new kid at 72. Providing the backbeat will be a 79-year-old jazz hipster by the name of Charlie Watts.</p>
<p>They’re all slim, they all still have hair and Jagger, who had heart valve replacement surgery in April, still has those moves.</p>
<p>This will be the band’s 11th show here. That counts one at Danceland, five at the Civic Arena, two at Three Rivers Stadium, one at PNC Park and another at Heinz Field. Like the song goes, “this could be the last time.”</p>
<p>Except we said that the last time. And the time before that.</p>
<p>On their last trip to the Steel City, arriving after a gorgeous rainbow stretched over Heinz Field, the band played a 19-song set that began with “Jumpin' Jack Flash” and included classics like “Tumbling Dice,” “Paint It Black,” “Gimme Shelter,” “Sympathy for the Devil” and "Satisfaction.” “You Can't Always Get What You Want” was performed with the Penn State University Concert Choir.</p>
<p>We don’t know yet what the ticket price will be when tickets for the June show go on sale on Valentine’s Day, but it’s going to be right around a car payment — for a compact. When tickets for this tour’s Toronto show went on sale earlier this year, they started at $199.</p>
<p>“$275 for guys pushing 80?” a reader posted on the PG’s Facebook page. “Have fun yinz guys!”</p>
<p>“I can spend less at the Carnegie Museum to see dinosaurs,” another wrote.</p>
<p>For what it’s worth, the dinosaurs at the museum aren’t going anywhere.</p>
