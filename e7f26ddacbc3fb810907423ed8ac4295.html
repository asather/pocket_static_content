<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 05.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we will start our chat in about 30 minutes, so get ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I see a lot of questions already in the queue so let’s get started.</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: Hi Gerry, hope you’re well. If Conner and the O-Line stay healthy...Super Bowl champs. I’m calling it. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’ll write it down.</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: Can Devin Bush improve upon a really good season last year? What’s your viewpoint on him being a TOP LB....I mean top 3 linebacker. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Where he has to take a big step is being able to call out the defensive sets for the front seven. I thought he had a really good rookie year, aside from several blown coverages, so I think he will be even better in 2020. I’ll hold off on the top 3 stuff for now.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs. Sue</strong>: Gerry I’ve seen that Brian, Ray and yourself have mentioned not having a rooting interest.. It is hard to believe you guys not rooting for the Steelers after interviewing this guys all season long, not to mention: living in Pittsburgh as well, going to their games, etc.. for me I have to think you guys either love them or hate them.. don’t tell me you guys wouldn’t be happy if they win the SB? Something doesn’t make sense! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t love em, I don’t hate em, because I have a job to do. Sure, I’d like to see them win for the guys I like, specifically the coaches. And, sure, it’s always better for us and more exciting for everyone when they win and even go to the Super Bowl. Interest is through the roof. But I don’t root to the point where I’m disappointed or devastated when they lose or am ecstatic when they win. Now, if I get bonuses based on wins and playoff advancement, I might root. But that is not the case.</p>
<p><strong>Puddintain</strong>: In the middle of the D, Bush and Fitzpatrick patched two gaping holes, however without Hargrove that creates an uncertainty. I like the DL coach a lot and hope Buggs might blossom. A penny for your learned thoughts please. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They will miss Hargrave but not nearly to the point if they lost Heyward or Tuitt. It won’t be as bad as last year when Tuitt missed 2/3 of the season. A bigger uncertainty will be how they manage the inside position next to Bush when Vince Williams isn’t in the game. That’s the real issue.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Any picks for the MNF crew? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Dandy Don, Giff and Howard</p>
<p><strong>DavieJ in WI</strong>: Do you see Ju Ju as Steelers go to WR or do you see Washington stepping up (or another WR)? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: JuJu is the man, but you saw Washington and Diontae Johnson really develop last year. Ben’s trust and reliance is with the guy he knows best -- JuJu</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Loved the golf Sunday. How about Mario and Gretzky with Justin Thomas and Books Koepka? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’ll pass.</p>
<p><strong>Freddie</strong>: I think James Washington is a little underrated/undervalued.. I really like this kid, he is so strong, works hard good attitude and just had a great season based on circumstances.. is it possible we keep our 4 top WR for a long time in your view? They all look very promising, we are well set at WR I believe.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I agree with you about Washington, but there is no way a team can keep its top 4 wide receivers. Not even its top three. At least two of them will go free agent in seek of bigger and better money. It’s a position that will rotate bodies every three years.</p>
<p><strong>elcid1997</strong>: Hi Gerry! I read your piece on Minkah. He talks about being willing to move around the defense now that he knows the playbook better. I remember the reason he asked to be traded was Miami moving him around the time and not keeping him in his natural free safety position. Do you have a sense why he is willing to move around more now? A sense of trust with the coaches? Being on a team that contend? Knowing the Steelers aren’t going to ask him to move around that much anyway? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, one, I think he is just speaking the company line, but, more important, I think he would have said anything to get out of Miami. All of the things you suggested are in play in this instance, including the Steelers’ intent to move him around. They do not have plans to do that other than maybe 1 or 2 different looks to confuse a defense.</p>
<p><strong>Retire21</strong>: Odds someone will sign AB and have him for the playoff run after 8 gAme suspensions. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There’s always some dummy who thinks they can make it work with him.</p>
<p><strong>The Die Hard Steelers Fan</strong>: Gerry, if #7 is 100% healthy, I think the Steelers young corps of WR’s could be scary in 2020. I also think D. Johnson will push JuJu for the #1 spot. Could the Steelers have the best Offense in the AFC North this year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, maybe the AFC North, but I remind you not to forget how the Ravens can run the ball, much better than the Steelers. But the Steelers have the advantage with the passing game, provided Ben is healthy, because they have better receivers with the addition of Chase Claypool and TE Eric Ebron.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Gerry I really appreciate your great work and insight especially during these times. The only comment I have is that I am not 100% sold on the quality of some of our assistant coaches. Seemed as though Cowher had more impressive staffs. Miss Munchak. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, I don’t think there is any question about which staff had the better assistants. All you have to do is look at the number of Cowher assistants who went on to become head coaches in the NFL (7). Tomlin, though, did bring in Munchak, who might be the best assistant hire ever.</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Gerry, with a lot of weapons on offense &amp; BB returning do you think this offense is a top 10? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It has a chance, but let’s not get too ramped up about it. Let’s see what happens when Ben is back.</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Gerry -- Love the chats. If the season is played without fans, will the players be asked to take pay cuts to offset the revenue losses ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not this year. But it might affect the salary cap in 2021.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: As much as I love Cam Heyward and believe he is a great guy and player, a big contract would be rewarding him for past performances at his current age. A 2 year deal should be offered at a reasonable salary without breaking the bank. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Uh, hate to tell you, contracts are typically awarded on what you have done, maybe more so (though hopefully) than on what you might do. Cam Heyward deserves every penny and length of terms he can get.</p>
<p><strong>‘Double Divot Dewey’</strong>: Steeler’s had a solid draft and helped themselves in free agency, but I still think that the season hinge’s on the play of Ben. He can improve just about all the positions on offense and help the defense as well with ball control. Am I dilusional? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are not. Every season -- this one, past ones -- all hinge on Ben.</p>

<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: There is a bit about Minkah F. in the news these days and how defenses stopped throwing his way after he was settled in at FS. How much of that was because opposing coaches knew the Steelers couldn’t score and therefore saw no need for risky deep plays regardless of the FS? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think that might be part of it. By the same token, teams are looking for ways to get a lead, not keep the game close.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler fan in Ohio</strong>: Hi Gerry -- Do you see any circumstances where Coach Tomlin would ever leave for another job ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I can’t answer that. Of course, it’s possible. Maybe he will won’t like the money he gets offered, though he is among the top paid coaches in the league now. Or maybe he won’t like life after Ben. But who knows?</p>
<p><strong>JIm</strong>: Seems like we are putting a lot of eggs in the Ben/Mason baskets. What if Ben can’t come all the way back and Mason isn’t the answer ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are living in your fears. And what if TJ, Cam, Bud and Minkah all get hurt???</p>
<p><strong>JDaven</strong>: Do you think NFL players will have to take a pay cut this season because they are missing practices? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope. Do you think coaches will take a pay cut because they don’t have to conduct them??</p>
<p><strong>BB</strong>: Gerry - the obligatory golf question....did you watch The Match? If so, what did you think of it? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I liked it better than the first one, except for the same old typical Tiger behavior, especially the final 9 holes.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: People keep talking about the nose tackle position being our biggest weakness, which I get but don’t agree with. Surely depth at inside linebacker is the biggest concern, right? At least at safety (depth) and nose tackle we could go out and get a free agent if it came down to it. ILB is slim pickins <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are correct. How can nose tackle be a major concern when they don’t use a nose tackle 70 to 75 percent of the time? People act like losing Hargrave is losing Aaron Donald. Don’t get me wrong, I thought Hargrave was a nice player. But how good can a guy be when his he plays more and his numbers go down, especially playing with 97, 48 and 90???</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - is it me or is there very little need as we sit today on the offensive side of the ball for the Steelers? Defensive needs seem mostly depth - do you agree? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Correct again. A little better depth on the d-line, though I will wait till I see how Chris Wormley performs and Isaiah Buggs develops. And what to do at ILB next to Bush and a backup at safety. Otherwise, all good.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis</strong>: Would it be wise for the Steelers to make a trade for a player like Rashaan Ridick, ILB, if they could get him for a 6th round pick? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s still possible, once they get to camp or if they play preseason game, they could add an inside LB. But I don’t expect that to happen, not now.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: With the drafting of Highsmith, do you think that rules out signing Bud to a long term deal? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: With or without Highsmith, I don’t think Bud was getting signed to a long-term deal. But, if Highsmith shows he can be a starter-capable guy, that will only seal the deal.</p>
<p><strong>Stlrdave1</strong>: Gerry, Thanks as always for your chats. As a transplanted life long Steeler fan now living in Nevada, my appreciation of the Steeler organization is never in doubt. I would think stable teams with the same coaches and staff would have a leg up due to this unusual season upon us. Agree? And thank you as always. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Absolutely. Stable staffs, veteran players, most starters returning. All in their favor in these strange times.</p>
<p><strong>Vince D</strong>: Hello Gerry, James Conner seems to be a very level headed and honorable guy. Given how attached he is to Pittsburgh, do you think he will demand top running back money as a free agent, or would he take less to stay here ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: James is a good person, but I don’t think the Steelers are going to offer him a second contract unless he proves he can stay healthy in 2020 and repeat what he did in 2018. But he is not a RB who will command big money as a free agent.</p>
<p><strong>Alan in Nashville</strong>: Good morning, Gerry. One thing I’ve noticed through the years is that the term “Steelers insider” is used way too often. Even a HOF guy like Eddie Boo obviously doesn’t have great access anymore. That being said, you appear to be as close to the real deal even though you’re not advertised as such. Especially when you answer a question resolutely like “They are not going to...” My question, and I’m not asking you to give away the farm, do you have sources above and beyond the others? You do a great job. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You are very wise and perceptive. Humility prevents me from answering your question. But someone please pay the man!</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: Will there be any ‘camp battles’ to keep an eye on or are the starters pretty much all set? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’m just hoping there will be a camp to have a battle. But, if there is, the only real “battle” will be to see which player can best move into that Mark Barron role when Vince Williams is out of the game -- Marcus Allen, Ulysees Gilbert, possibly Terrell Edmunds in certain packages? Antoine Brooks? Otherwise, all set.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Was there a particular reason (other than no Ben) for Switzers decline last year? He looked a lot slower than the previous year. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He wasn’t slower, but he did get injured. He was never a big production guy anyway, but Ben likes him.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Gerry - do you think the 53 man roster players are currently on the 90 man roster or do you think there will be a trade or post cutdown pickup to bolster depth at ILB, S, and/or DL? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are always looking to add better players, so, yeah, that can happen once they get on the field and get close to the start of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Excited about the offense this year, do you think we are being overlooked this year? With basically no offense we almost made the playoffs last year. Without Ben teams were just teeing off against the run, not sure people though about what a big loss Ben was to the offense, no team respected our passing game. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ben’s absence affected every aspect of the offense, even the running game. There was no no-huddle, shifting and sliding protection, changing out of running plays or passing plays, everything.</p>
<p><strong>Harold B</strong>: Are you in the train of thought that that the brownies are the brownies or are they for real this time? I mean in real they have a team like never before.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Until they show me they can do it....</p>
<p><strong>RD</strong>: Initially I was skeptical of the McFarland pick. I agreed with many of your associates that if they didn’t pick a RB in round 2, it wasn’t worth wasting a pick. Since then, I’ve watching video of him and have been impressed. Seems like an every down back; can catch, not just fast but quick. If he can learn pass pro, do you think he could affect the decision on Connor for next season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’ve said all along I like the concept -- drafting a change of pace back who is a playmaker -- so long as you use them the right way. It’s possible that could affect the Conner situation, but I don’t think rookies, without OTAs and maybe preseason games, are going to see a lot of time in 2020.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Gerry, knowing Steelers fans as we do - if the games are played without fans, can you see throngs of the faithful showing up to party outside the stadium anyway? I envision a situation where the Steelers score and you can hear the roar of the crowd from outside the stadium. Not that I would encourage that, being it defeats the purpose of not allowing fans inside. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t think fans will be allowed outside or around the stadium or even in the parking lots, if fans are not allowed in the stadium. So I don’t see any of that happening.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: What positions of depth would the Steelers most likely to be able to fill through roster cuts from other teams or trades? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Either safety or ILB. Beyond that, not any at all</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Hello Gerry: Now that the draft has settled a bit, and the Steelers did take a RB, do you sense the Steelers have had ANY contact with veteran free-agent RBs like McCoy, etc.? It seems that the lack of ground game in recent years would mean they must have all angles covered...not to say the lack of effective O-line play is not a factor. Have you heard anything and might we see someone added? I am hoping so based on the question marks presently in that RB room. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They have no immediate interest in McCoy or a player like that, and have had no discussion about that.</p>
<p><strong>Les</strong>: About how many tickets for Steeler games go to season ticket holders? I’m always curious as to how many tickets are sold to the general public. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t know the number available to the public, but not as many as you think.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: In April of 2019 the Steelers signed Big Ben to a 2-year $68 million contract and he rewarded them by scorching the Patriots for a sweet, sweet 3 points before having a season ending injury in the second game. In hindsight would the Steelers have been better off moving on from Big Ben after his contract ran out last season or will he somehow rebound from his dismal 2019 performance? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: Saw a listing of “elite” quarterbacks and expectations for the upcoming season. Mahomes, Brees, Russell, Jackson and Brady to name a few. Major slight to Big Ben, qb who has 1/3 of nfl franchise leading super bowl wins, slam dunk hall of famer and recent 5000 yd season. Absurd! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Happens all the time. Ridiculous</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: Who is going to take over Mark Barron’s position? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: TBD</p>
<p><strong>Butch</strong>: Prediction on who starts at right tackle and left guard? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Feiler at RT, Wisniewski at LG</p>
<p><strong>Kevin in Bedford</strong>: What kind of record do you see this year 9-7?? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: 10-6</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do you foresee any labor issues going forward in the NFL like are brewing in MLB? The NFLPA clearly has less bite than the union in baseball. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No I don’t. They just settled the labor dispute for another 10 years. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, kids, I’m out of time. Sorry I couldn’t get to all your questions. See you next time.</p>
