<h1>Scottdale crane hauler pleads guilty in fatal accident in Pine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Scottdale man has pleaded guilty to manslaughter in connection with a collision on Gibsonia Road in Pine. The crash, in March of 2018, killed a pickup truck driver.</p>
<p>Charles Wayne Hunter, 71, appeared before Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Randall Todd Monday. He pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and recklessly endangering another person.</p>
<p>In exchange for the plea, the District Attorney’s office withdrew a homicide by vehicle charge.</p>
<p>Both sides agreed to a sentence of two years of house arrest and five years probation, with the first two years of probation overlapping with the house arrest.</p>
<p>On March 12, 2018, Hunter was traveling eastbound on Gibsonia Road hauling a crane. While rounding a bend between Karrington Drive and the Pennsylvania Turnpike, he lost control of his pickup truck and the 43,500-pound crane attached. According to the criminal complaint, his crane began to tip over, and he crossed the double yellow line into the oncoming lane of traffic.</p>
<p>The crane first struck a tractor-trailer combination, forcing the trailer through the guardrail, tearing off its left front tire and causing major damage to an attached 18,000-pound log skidder, police said.</p>
<p>Still going approximately 50 mph, the crane landed on top of another pickup truck.</p>
<p>Jay Watts, the driver, was pronounced dead at the scene of head trauma.</p>
<p>Just before coming to a stop, the crane slid into a third vehicle — a Chevrolet pickup truck.</p>
<p>According to police reconstruction, Mr. Hunter was traveling between 53 and 57 mph in a 35-mph zone. The bend in the road was marked with a speed limit of 25 mph.</p>
<p>Police also said Hunter was operating an unlicensed crane company at the time of the crash.</p>
