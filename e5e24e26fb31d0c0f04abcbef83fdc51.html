<h1>Catch a park program Thursday on PA's state insect, the firefly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the traditional thrills of childhood is getting tougher every year. Catching lightning bugs was once a summer evening pastime that formed a glowing connection between kids and nature. Today, most of the planet’s 2,000<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2020/02/10/firefly-lightning-bug-bioluminescence-Pennsylvania-Firefly-Festival/stories/202002070123" target="_blank"> firefly species are waning in population</a> due to habitat loss, pesticide use and light pollution.</p>
<p>Spaces are still available for an educational and participatory firefly program Thursday evening at Moraine State Park in Butler County, part of a state Department of Conservation and Natural Resources celebration of the park’s 50th year.</p>
<p>“We call it a family event, but the kids get most excited about it,” said&nbsp;Mike Shaffer, one of the park’s environmental education specialists. “They’re interesting creatures and it’s a chance to get outside at night.”</p>
<p>An annual firefly festival in Forest County celebrating Pennsylvania’s state insect was canceled this year. Moraine’s event will be held from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Thursday at Pavilion 7 near McDanel’s Boat Launch on the North Shore of Lake Arthur. It will start with a PowerPoint presentation explaining the biology and conservation of fireflies and segue to a free-for-all catch ’em if you can.</p>
<p>“Any program that gets you out at night using other senses is very, very special,” said Mr. Shaffer.</p>
<p>Fireflies are technically soft-bodied beetles that produce a biochemical “cold light.” With no infrared or ultraviolet frequencies, there is no increase in temperature. The bugs mate from May to September at Pittsburgh’s latitude.&nbsp; Males blink patterns that vary by area, signaling their availability to females. The females turn on patterned flashes in reply.</p>
<p>Many of the events scheduled to celebrate Moraine State Park’s semi-centennial were canceled.</p>
<p>As a COVID-19 precaution, participation in the firefly program will be limited to 25 pre-registered visitors. Register by calling the park office at 724-368-8811. Visitors will be required to wear a mask or face covering and social distancing will be in effect.</p>
