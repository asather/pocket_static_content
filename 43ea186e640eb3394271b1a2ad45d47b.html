<h1>Petition seeks change to Central Catholic's 'racially biased' hairstyle policy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Central Catholic student wants the high school to change its policy on hairstyle that he believes unfairly targets black students.</p>
<p>JD Younger, 15, a sophomore, <a href="https://www.change.org/p/petition-to-lift-the-ban-of-braids-locks-and-twists-at-central-catholic-high-school?recruiter=1034303244&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_medium=facebook&amp;utm_campaign=psf_combo_share_abi&amp;utm_term=petition_dashboard&amp;recruited_by_id=4716f100-373d-11ea-93d3-85d25c8d70c9&amp;share_bandit_exp=abi-20111641-en-US&amp;share_bandit_var=v2&amp;utm_content=fht-20111641-en-us%3Av12&amp;fbclid=IwAR3FlNoR6FASHgq1Wik-MVvCwd944yueOUxGXUnPpvdCn4Da1Y-Hg6WV7M4" target="_blank">launched a Change.org petition</a> Tuesday that seeks to&nbsp;“lift the ban of braids, locks and twists” at the school.&nbsp;The petition had more than 4,700 signatures shortly after 5 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I’m hoping they take into consideration that they have a population of African-Americans, and you have to take into consideration their culture,” said JD, who is black.</p>
<p>JD said he started the petition after a couple of his friends came to school with twists in their hair and were told by school officials to remove them or go home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Catholic’s student/parent handbook states&nbsp;“shaved heads or hairstyles with designs, patterns, lines, weaves, spikes, braids, locks, twists or ponytails are not permitted.”</p>
<p>The handbook also says hair must be its natural color, clean, neatly combed, not totally covering the ears or eyes,&nbsp;or fall below the shirt collar, and sideburns may not extend below the ear or extend forward toward&nbsp;the cheek. It also prohibits facial hair except for&nbsp;“neatly trimmed” mustaches.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Central Catholic officials could not be reached Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>JD said he knows the school policy and follows it, but he&nbsp;believes it is&nbsp;“outdated and racially biased.” He said he wears twists outside of school that sometimes leave patterns in his hair when they’re removed, which has led to school staff to question him about it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said he and multiple other people have brought up their objection to the policy to school officials multiple times, but the issue has always been a non-starter.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>JD, who is a running back and defensive back on the Central Catholic football team, said he believes he has support from his classmates and even some school staff.</p>
<p>“I feel like there needs to be a voice,” he said.</p>
