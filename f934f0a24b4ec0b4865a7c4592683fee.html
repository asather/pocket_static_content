<h1>Macy's is closing 29 stores after drop in holiday sales</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Struggling department store chain Macy’s said Wednesday it will close 29 stores in coming weeks, after sales dropped during the closely watched holiday season.</p>
<p>The closures will include 28 Macy’s locations and one Bloomingdale’s store, according to a company spokesperson who declined to provide further details.</p>
<p>The company said Wednesday that same-store sales — a key measure at stores open at least one year — fell 0.6% in November and December. That compares with the 1.1% growth recorded during the same period last year. Analysts said the retailer’s performance was disappointing during a relatively strong holiday season in which overall retail sales grew 3.7%.</p>
<p>“Macy’s performance . . . shows the group is still losing customers and market share at a rapid clip,” Neil Saunders, managing director of research firm GlobalData Retail, wrote in a note to clients.</p>
<p>Macy’s, founded 162 years ago in New York, was for decades one of the nation’s preeminent retailers. It had anchor stores at hundreds of shopping malls and was one of the largest sellers of apparel in the U.S. But changing consumer habits and mounting competition from Walmart, Amazon and Target have reversed the its fortunes in recent years. Same-store sales fell 1% in the first nine months of 2019, while profits were down 40%. (Jeff Bezos, the founder and chief executive of Amazon, owns The Washington Post.)</p>
<p>In addition to 680 Macy’s and Bloomingdales stores, the company operates 171 Bluemercury beauty stores.</p>
<p>Shares of the retailer’s stock fell slightly — about 0.2% — Wednesday morning. Macy’s in 2016 announced plans to shutter 100 of its stores, though the company declined to say whether the latest closures were included in that count.</p>
<p>The announcement come on the heels of widespread turmoil among brick-and-mortar retailers. Last year retailers announced plans to close a record 9,300 stores, according to Coresight Research.</p>
<p>Furniture and home goods chain Pier 1 Imports said Monday it would close up to 450 of its 936 stores.</p>
<p><em>This story was updated at 3:10 p.m on Jan. 8 to reflect that Macy’s was founded 162 years ago.&nbsp;</em></p>
