<h1>GNC shares fall below $1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>GNC shares closed Thursday at 99 cents, a level that can draw the attention and possible delisting warning from the New York Stock Exchange if shares remain below $1 for 30 days.</p>
<p>Even given Wall Street’s overall poor performance this week due to the COVID-19 virus fallout, the Pittsburgh-based health and wellness retailer’s 20% drop from Wednesday’s $1.24 share price close is notable, even if the reasons for it are unclear.</p>
<p>GNC officials did not respond to a request for comment late Thursday afternoon. The company has not yet reported its fourth quarter and full year 2019 financials.</p>
<p>Now eight years after its initial public offering in 2012, GNC shares in late November 2013 hit $60 but have steadily declined since the summer of 2015.</p>
<p>The Dow closed Thursday down 10% at 21,200.62, its worst day since 1987.</p>
