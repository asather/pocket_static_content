<h1>Gerry Dulac's game-by-game prediction for the 2020 Steelers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just because the National Football League <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/07/steelers-schedule-released-2020-nfl-afc-north-monday-night-football/stories/202005070177" target="_blank">released its 2020 schedule last week</a> does not mean the games will be played on the dates assigned — if at all. So much of what happens is dependent on the uncertain developments associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Predicting what will happen to preseason games or when the regular-season might begin is likely more difficult than finding hand sanitizer on a store shelf.</p>
<p>But, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/gene-collier/2020/05/10/2020-nfl-schedule-release-gene-collier-tom-brady-drew-brees/stories/202005100048" target="_blank">going on the assumption</a> the league will try to play 16 regular-season games, if at all possible, here is a game-by-game prediction of what will happen with the Steelers if the 2020 season is played as scheduled. And, of course, barring a repeat of what happened last season at quarterback:</p>
<p><strong>Sept. 14, at New York Giants, 7:15 p.m.</strong> – In his first game since his elbow surgery, a cautious Ben Roethlisberger relies on his running game against a Giants defense that allowed the second-most points in the NFC in 2019. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 24-13</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sept 20, Denver Broncos, 1 p.m.</strong> – After losing their past two openers at Heinz Field, the Steelers get off to a 2-0 start against a Broncos team that still doesn’t have a quality quarterback. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 27-17.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sept 27, Houston Texans, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Steelers score at least 30 points for the first time in 23 games and come out on top against the Texans in the first-ever reunion of the three Watt brothers. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 31-24</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oct. 4, at Tennessee Titans, 1 p.m.</strong> – Trying to stop Derrick Henry with a team that relies on sub-package defenses is like trying to prevent grass from growing in the spring. Too many mismatches. <strong>Prediction: Titans, 24-16.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oct. 11, Philadelphia Eagles, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Eagles added a lot of speed at wide receiver in the draft, but they still haven’t beaten the Steelers, who have managed just 25 points in the past three meetings, at Heinz Field. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 23-20.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Oct. 18, Cleveland Browns, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Browns haven’t won at Heinz Field since 2003. No reason for that to change in Myles Garrett’s first game against the Steelers since, well, you know. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 30-17.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Oct. 25, at Baltimore Ravens, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Steelers’ fast start gets slowed in M&amp;T Bank Stadium against a Ravens team that might be better than last year’s unit that was 14-2 and the AFC’s top seed.<strong> Prediction: Ravens, 27-19.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov. 1</strong> – OPEN DATE</p>
<p><strong>Nov. 8, at Dallas Cowboys, 4:25 p.m.</strong> – New Cowboys coach Mike McCarthy is 0-2 against his hometown team since the Packers beat the Steelers in the 2011 Super Bowl. Not anymore. <strong>Prediction: Cowboys, 26-23</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov. 15, Cincinnati Bengals, 1 p.m.</strong> – No. 1 overall pick Joe Burrow gets his first look at a Steelers defense that has made a habit of chewing up rookie quarterbacks. Make it 13 consecutive losses to the Steelers. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 34-17.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov. 22, at Jacksonville Jaguars, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Steelers have won their past three in Jacksonville but have never scored more than 25 points in 13 games there. Won’t matter against a Jaguars offense in disarray. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 24-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Nov. 26, Baltimore Ravens, 8:20 p.m.</strong> – This is the start of three prime-time games in four weeks, and the Steelers will need an Emmy-winning performance if they want to take the AFC North title from the Ravens. <strong>Prediction: Ravens 34-30.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dec. 6, Washington Redskins, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Redskins did nothing to improve an inept offense that averaged 12.6 points in 11 of their final 13 games. But there’s always seems to be that one game the Steelers lose when they shouldn’t.<strong> Prediction: Redskins, 23-20.</strong></p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/.media/2/2019/07/31/e8cb627f-df86-4bcb-a445-72a34e955033.jpg" alt="Go to section"> </a></p>
<p><strong>Dec. 13 – at Buffalo Bills, 8:20 p.m.</strong> – The Steelers have not finished strong each of the past two seasons, going a combined 2-7. Could this be another slide that leads to another non-playoff season? Uh, no. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 17-16</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dec. 21 – at Cincinnati Bengals, 8:15 p.m</strong>. – A game at Paul Brown Stadium is always a welcome sight for the Steelers, who are 22-3 there since the facility opened in 2000. The Steelers inch closer to a wild-card playoff spot.&nbsp;<strong>Prediction: Steelers, 30-17</strong></p>
<p><strong>Dec. 27, Indianapolis Colts, 1 p.m.</strong> – The last time Philip Rivers played at Heinz Field, he led a 16-point comeback in the second half for the Los Angeles Chargers. This time, the Steelers clinch a playoff spot. <strong>Prediction: Steelers, 24-20</strong></p>
<p><strong>Jan. 3, at Cleveland Browns, 1 p.m.</strong> – The Steelers, with their playoff seeding secure, rest many of their regulars. That allows new Browns coach Kevin Stefanski to achieve a rarity — the team’s first season-ending victory since 2009. <strong>Prediction: Browns, 23-16</strong></p>
