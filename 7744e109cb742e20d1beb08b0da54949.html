<p>Here’s what you need to know about testing for COVID-19:</p>
<p>A doctor will order the coronavirus test based on a medical evaluation and history of recent travel.</p>
<p>The test can be done at a doctor’s office, hospital or clinic.</p>
<p>The physician will swab the back of the nose and throat for specimens.</p>
<p>By Monday, two big commercial diagnostic labs operating in Western Pennsylvania —&nbsp;LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics Inc. —&nbsp;will be doing coronavirus testing.</p>
<p>UPMC Health Plan does not cover testing by LabCorp. Check your health plan or contact your insurance carrier to confirm coverage details.</p>
<p>Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, Cigna Corp. and CVS Health’s Aetna plans are waiving co-pays and deductibles for coronavirus testing. Other plans may be considering similar offers.</p>

<p>Test results are sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.</p>
<p>If you test positive, you may be asked to stay at home, away from others, for 14 days. The quarantine is voluntary.</p>
<p>Most COVID-19 cases are mild; some cases are fatal, especially among the elderly and people with underlying medical conditions.</p>
