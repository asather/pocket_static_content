<h1>New Castle track star James Thomas has lots to 'Cheer' about</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At high school track meets, people still ask coach Drue Flora&nbsp;what happened to James Thomas, a track star who graduated almost four years ago from Union Area High School in New Castle.</p>
<p>“He’s the best athlete I’ve ever seen,” said Flora, his high school track coach. “I’ve never seen anybody that good at something.”</p>
<p>What has happened to James Thomas has been a wild journey from New Castle to Ypsilanti, Mich., to Corsicana, Texas, where a Netflix documentary about his junior college cheerleading team has launched him into the spotlight.</p>
<p>In the last few weeks,Thomas has appeared twice on “The Ellen DeGeneres Show,” amassed more than 45,000 Instagram followers and been stopped in public by strangers who are fans of the show.</p>
<p>The Netflix documentary “Cheer” follows cheerleaders at Navarro College as they try to win their 14th national championship, providing an unflinching look at what cheerleaders achieve and endure, both physically and emotionally.</p>
<p>Fans include Reese Witherspoon, Chrissy Teigen and J.J. Watt.&nbsp;His roommate Jerry Harris, one of the show’s breakout stars, interviewed celebrities such as Brad Pitt and Laura Dern on the Oscars red carpet Sunday,</p>
<p>Thomas, who sometimes sports a La Roche Redhawks shirt on the show, isn’t heavily featured on “Cheer,” but gets plenty of screen time as a roommate of Harris and one of the show’s other stars, La’Darius Marshall.</p>
<p>On one of his “Ellen” appearances in January, Thomas hoisted Kendall Jenner 6 feet in the air as part of a cheer stunt. When he met Jenner and realized that she knew who he was, “I freaked out,” he said.</p>
<p>On Instagram, he posted a photo as he got off the plane in Los Angeles for a second stint on “Ellen.”</p>
<p>“Look to my right and it’s @kendalljenner this time. THIS ALL SOO CRAZY!” he wrote.</p>
<p>Thomas, 21, grew up in New Castle, going to the basketball and football games of his two older brothers. But what really drew his attention was the cheerleaders — particularly the girls of rival Neshannock High School as they tumbled back and forth.&nbsp;“I thought, ‘Wow, I want to do that.’”</p>
<p>In his bedroom, he practiced tumbling on his mattress. On the day he figured out a back handspring, he immediately ran outside to try it in his front yard. He did one, then two in a row, and was tumbling across the yard when his little brother’s school bus pulled up.</p>
<p>While Thomas wanted to try cheerleading himself, “in our area it’s wasn’t something that boys do. They don’t cheer,” said Natalie Fee, who has owned Natalie’s Cheer and Tumble in New Castle for the past 16 years. “When he first did it, there were boys cheering down in Pittsburgh, but he was one of the first boys that cheered here.”</p>
<p>When he started high school, Thomas finally convinced his mom to let him try cheerleading. He took tumbling classes and then progressed into competitive cheerleading, becoming the first boy to compete at Fee’s gym.</p>
<p>“He has natural talent but he’s had to work for everything he has,” said Fee, whom Thomas calls his “cheer mom.”</p>
<p>“He was in the gym every night, every day. He has a key to the gym. He can go in at any time to work.”</p>
<p>Initially, he and his mother kept his cheerleading a secret from his father. “We didn’t want to make my dad mad,” said Thomas. “He wanted me to do the whole football thing, whole basketball thing.”</p>
<p>But when Thomas had his first out-of-state competition, they told his father. He came to Ohio to watch, and was indeed critical.</p>
<p>“They’re not using you enough,” Thomas recalls him saying. “You can do way more than what you’re doing. You need to be in the front.”</p>
<p>His father is now one of his biggest supporters. “He’s watched the show more than I have,” laughed Thomas.</p>
<p>As a cheerleader at Union High School, Thomas was sometimes told that he was the most entertaining part of basketball or football games. He also began running track.&nbsp;He won WPIAL titles in the high jump and 110 meter hurdles and qualified for state championships his junior and senior years in four events: hurdles, long jump, triple jump and high jump.</p>
<p>“As you saw on ‘Cheer,’ he can jump out of the ceiling,” said Flora, his track coach.</p>
<p>Thomas went to Eastern Michigan University for track and cheerleading; he quickly realized he wanted to cheer more than he wanted to run or jump. When he went to the National Cheerleaders Association college national championships in Daytona, Fla., and watched the legendary Navarro team compete, he knew that was where he wanted to be.</p>
<p>He tried out for coach Monica Aldama and waited anxiously for the message that would arrive three weeks later telling him that he made it. He competed at Navarro in 2018 and for the 2019 season documented on the show. He has returned this year for a third season, recently posting on social media that he “made mat” again, meaning he will likely be one of the 20 team members competing in Daytona for the national championship.</p>
<p>Back in New Castle, Fee has had more boys come through her gym in recent years. She thinks some of them saw Thomas cheer at football and basketball games.</p>
<p>“When he’s home for a couple weeks, I make him teach. The kids absolutely look up to him,” she said. “To see him do what he loves and make it to where he’s made it is just overwhelming. We’re so proud of him.”</p>
