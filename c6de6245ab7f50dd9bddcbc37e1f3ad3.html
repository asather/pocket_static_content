<h1>Justin Champagnie's shooting, scoreless droughts and more observations from Pitt's loss at Miami</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Freshmen are, by their very nature, unpredictable beings, capable of awe and optimism in one moment and endless frustration and bewilderment in the next. When a college basketball player is early in his (or her) career, they don’t have the experiences on which they can fall back and on which they can lean, making each game or play that much more unpredictable.</p>
<p>Pitt saw as much over a 96-hour stretch with one of its most important, and youngest, players.</p>
<p>Coming off a career-high 22 points in a win Wednesday at North Carolina, forward Justin Champagnie wilted offensively in a 66-58 loss at Miami, finishing with eight points and 11 rebounds and missing 13 of his 16 shots and all four of his 3-pointers.</p>
<p>It was the continuation of what has been a streaky, up-and-down season for the freshman, but only so many of his shortcomings, at least on the offensive end, weren’t the kind of things typically associated with first-year players. Champagnie was taking open, sometimes high-percentage shots; he simply wasn’t making them.</p>
<p>Of his 13 missed shots Sunday, only one was an outright ill-advised one, an off-balance hook shot three minutes into the second half. Some of the shots were quite makeable, be it a contested layup, an open corner 3 or a missed jumper in the middle of the Hurricanes’ zone (examples of the setup for such shots are below).</p>
<p>As the game wore on, many of his jumpers were short, including an air ball on an open 3 from the top of the key in the second half with only 5-foot-7 Chris Lykes there to defend him.</p>
<p>Based on the criteria Pitt coach Jeff Capel has set for Champagnie when it comes to shot selection, there was no sort of drastic divergence on the Brooklyn native’s part.</p>
<p>“As long as he’s taking good shots, that’s the main thing,” Capel said Monday on the ACC coaches teleconference. “We want him taking good shots and making good decisions. If he’s doing that then we’ll live with the results.”</p>
<p>There are the moments where it works, too, where Champagnie finished on shots close to the basket that he too often missed on a night in which he was off on three of his five layups, shots that could have altered the complexion of the game. In one instance, a player who uses physicality effectively, sometimes even embracing it, finished at the basket through contact.</p>

<p>Coming off the forgettable night in South Florida, Capel plans to treat Champagnie as he has throughout the season.</p>
<p>“We try to help him not to get down on himself if he’s missing, which, for a freshman, can happen,” Capel said. “Move on to the next play. That’s something we’re continuing to try to help Justin with.”</p>
<p><strong>Pitt’s defense was pretty good, but made critical miscues</strong></p>
<p>Against the No. 24 team in Division I in offensive efficiency, Pitt’s defense comported itself fairly well, holding the Hurricanes 10 percentage points below their season average from 3 and right at its points per possession average for the season (1.05).</p>
<p>There were, however, some noticeable slip-ups. In the first six minutes, the Panthers gave up two easy baskets on backdoor cuts, both of which were the result of a guard pushing too far up while trying to apply pressure, only for their man to slip behind them unnoticed.</p>

<p>Against Dejan Vasiljevic, a 6-foot-3 guard shooting better than 40 percent from 3 on the season, Pitt players too often gave him too much room to shoot, whether it was Champagnie not sliding up to defend him coming off a screen or Ryan Murphy playing too far off him late in the shot clock while the Panthers sat in their zone.</p>

<p>Vasiljevic finished with 13 points, going 3 of 9 from 3-point range.</p>
<p><strong>The perplexing scoring droughts continue for the Panthers</strong></p>
<p>Sunday’s game, in some ways, ended before it really ever got the chance to begin in earnest, with Miami scoring the game’s first 16 points.</p>
<p>For Pitt players, coaches and even its fans, it’s a maddeningly familiar trend — watching as their team goes for minutes (that can feel like hours) without so much as scoring a point. On Sunday, the Panthers went the game’s first 6:11 without a point. It marked the fifth time in the past six games that they’ve gone scoreless for at least four minutes:</p>
<p>6:11 — Miami; outscored in that time, 16-0</p>
<p>4:55 — North Carolina; 8-0</p>
<p>4:51 — Wake Forest; 7-0</p>
<p>4:29 — Binghamton; 5-0</p>
<p>5:18 — Northern Illinois; 9-0</p>
<p>That those early-game woes were occurring against a team that ranked 214th (of 353 Division I teams) in defensive efficiency entering the night, comfortably the worst mark of any ACC team, only made them more aggravating.</p>
<p>Unlike its previous opponents, Miami took full advantage of the opportunity Pitt’s parade of missed shots created.</p>
<p>“The way we started each half, it’s not good enough,” Capel said after the game Sunday. “It’s not worthy of winning. The basketball gods don’t reward you for that.”</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>2,167:</strong> Days that have elapsed since Pitt last beat Miami (a Feb. 5, 2014 overtime victory), the second-longest stretch Pitt has without a win against an ACC opponent. In a conference featuring the likes of Duke, North Carolina, Louisville and Virginia, the Panthers have gone the longest without beating N.C. State (Jan. 4, 2014), Miami and Clemson (March 8, 2014).</p>
<p><strong>2</strong>: Offensive fouls Xavier Johnson drew on Lykes in the first half in a game in which Lykes, the Hurricanes’ leading scorer entering the night, fouled out in just 19 minutes. The two played against one another in the Washington Catholic Athletic Conference.</p>
<p><strong>10</strong>: Points from Terrell Brown on Sunday night. It marked the first time he finished in double figures since he had 13 in Pitt’s season-opening win against Florida State on Nov. 6.</p>
