<h1>Lefty's in the Strip closed by health department for COVID-19 violations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lefty’s bar in the Strip District was ordered closed Friday night by the Allegheny County Health Department for breaking multiple rules designed to limit the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The facility, at 2021 Penn Ave., was cited for exceeding capacity limits indoors and outdoors; failure to enforce physical distancing in the takeout area, and serving alcoholic beverages without providing food, according to the inspection report.</p>
<p>Lefty’s must remain closed for at least a week and submit a COVID-19 prevention plan before its permit is reinstated.</p>
<p>The operator of the facility could not be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The closure marks the third time a food business in the county has been shuttered by the health department for mitigation problems during the pandemic. The previous closures included the Young Men’s Republican Club of Allegheny County on the North Side and Seven — a bar/lounge in the Cultural District, Downtown.</p>
