<html><head><title> Trump: Iranian general was killed to ‘stop a war’ </title></head><body><p>WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump said Friday he ordered the killing of a top Iranian general “to stop a war,” not start one, but in the tense aftermath the Pentagon braced for retaliation by sending more troops to the Middle East.</p><p>Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argued the U.S. case with allies in the Middle East and beyond, asserting that Friday’s drone strike killing Gen. Qassem Soleimani was a necessary act of self-defense. He asserted that Gen. Soleimani was plotting a series of attacks that endangered many American troops and officials across the Middle East.</p><p>The ramifications of Mr. Trump’s decision to kill Gen. Soleimani were still coming into focus Friday; they could include an end to the U.S. military partnership with Iraq in fighting the Islamic State extremist group. Some Iraqi politicians called the attack, which also killed an Iraqi general, a violation of Iraqi sovereignty and questioned whether U.S. forces should be expelled. The U.S. has about 5,200 troops in Iraq, mostly to train and advise Iraqi forces fighting IS.</p><p>In brief remarks to the nation, Mr. Trump said the Iranian general had been plotting “imminent and sinister” attacks. At the Pentagon, Army Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had “compelling, clear, unambiguous intelligence” of Gen. Soleimani plotting violent acts.</p><p>Mr. Trump called Gen. Soleimani a ruthless figure who “made the death of innocent people his sick passion. ... We take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over.”</p><p>The president warned Iran against retaliating. He said the U.S. military has Iranian targets “fully identified” for counter-retaliation. The U.S. has a wide range of offensive and defensive forces in the Gulf area within range of Iran.</p><p>Asked about possible retaliation, Gen. Milley told reporters, “Is there risk? You’re damn right there’s risk.” He added, “There is a range of possible futures here, and the ball is in the Iranian court.”</p><p>As Iran warned of “harsh” reprisals, the U.S. Homeland Security Department watched for trouble brewing on the domestic front and reported “no specific, credible threats” in the first hours after the American attack in Baghdad, said the department’s acting secretary, Chad F. Wolf.</p><p>Senior State Department officials said the drone strike near the Baghdad international airport was based on intelligence that suggested Gen. Soleimani was traveling in the area to put final touches on plans for attacks that would have hit U.S. diplomats, troops and American facilities in Iraq, Lebanon, Syria and elsewhere in the Mideast. The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity under State Department ground rules, would not be more specific but said it clearly called for a decisive U.S. response.</p><p>Democrats in Congress questioned the administration’s approach, while making clear they don’t regret Gen. Soleimani’s demise. Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, noted that Mr. Pompeo said the administration wants to “de-escalate” tensions with Iran.</p><p>“I think the jury’s out on that,” Mr. Warner said. “I hope they’re successful on that. I think it could have brought in more congressional leaders and allies to help make that case ahead of time.”</p><p>Fears about the repercussions of killing Gen. Soleimani persisted throughout the administrations of President George W. Bush, a Republican, and President Barack Obama, a Democrat, according to officials who served under both. Gen. Soleimani, they calculated, was just as dangerous dead and martyred as he was alive and plotting against Americans.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/world/2020/01/04/Trump-Iranian-general-was-killed-to-stop-a-war/stories/202001050115</original_url>
