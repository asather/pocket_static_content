<h1>COVID-19 shutdown weighs on UPMC's six-month results</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The COVID-19 shutdown of nonemergency surgical procedures&nbsp;weighed on Pittsburgh health giant UPMC in the first half of the year, sending its operating margin into the red.</p>
<p>Revenue from core medical services for the six months that ended June 30 was $11.1 billion at the Downtown-based hospital and health insurance system, up 9.1% from $10.1 billion a year ago, while the operating margin slipped to negative 0.3% for the January to June period from 0% in 2019.</p>
<p>A negative operating margin means that expenses have outpaced revenue to pay those expenses.</p>
<p>UPMC on Wednesday reported a loss of $165 million for the six months, a swing from a gain of $372 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Operating income was off 25% to $59 million for the six months compared to $79 million a year ago.</p>
<p>Medical-surgical admissions were down 13%, hospital outpatient revenue per workday was off 4% and physician service revenue per weekday decreased 14% from the comparable period a year ago.</p>
<p>The good news is the bleeding may have been stanched at UPMC with the lifting of the surgical procedure ban by Gov. Tom Wolf and the return of patients, said Leslie C. Davis, senior vice president.</p>
<p>Gov. Wolf had ordered the ban to try to contain the outbreak of COVID-19, a highly contagious disease with no cure.</p>
<p>“Most of our patients have come back,” Ms. Davis said during a briefing Wednesday at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex in Cranberry. “And that’s true across the country. Some emergency-department volume has not come back and may never come back.”</p>
<p>Care in hospital emergency departments is costly and can be less thorough when compared to doctors’ offices and outpatient clinics, and Ms. Davis said UPMC Health Plan members were increasingly encouraged to seek care through primary care physicians, which costs less and often results in better care.</p>
<p>“While government guidelines and patients’ preferences resulted in the postponement of many scheduled surgeries and procedures, our clinical volumes began to return to pre-pandemic levels during the second quarter as our patients continued to seek UPMC care,” interim CFO Edward Karlovich said in a prepared statement.</p>
