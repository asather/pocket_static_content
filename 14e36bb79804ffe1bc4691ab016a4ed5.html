<h1>Tuned In: BBC America went wild for natural history programming and got Wonderstruck</h1>

<p>PASADENA, Calif. —&nbsp;Sometimes you see a cable network make changes in its programming or genre emphasis and you just scratch your head. But usually there’s a good reason for it, as in the case of BBC America leaning into nature programming, including this weekend’s premiere of “Wild India” (8 p.m. Saturday).</p>

<p>Launched in 1998, BBC America grew to be known largely for its imported British drama series. While the network had a mix of programming, BBC America has in recent years turned more to natural history series even as it remains the home to “Doctor Who,” “Killing Eve” and reality show “Top Gear” (returning at 8 p.m. Aug. 30).</p>
<p>Surely that’s at least partially the result of a changing media landscape. In 2014 AMC Networks acquired a 49.9% equity stake in BBC America from Discovery Communications (commercial entity BBC Studios owns the majority share of BBC America). Discovery’s networks are rooted in nonfiction programming, so BBC America didn’t really compete directly with what was on Discovery’s channels. But AMC Networks leans more toward scripted fiction with original series across its roster of channels. In addition, AMC Networks is a partner in streaming service Britbox, operated by BBC Studios and ITV, a home for scripted British comedy and drama.</p>
<p>With about 500 scripted series expected to premiere in 2020 across broadcast, cable and streaming services, it’s become harder for scripted shows to break out. Plenty of networks —&nbsp;including A&amp;E and MTV —&nbsp;have bailed on scripted programming altogether. BBC America hasn’t done that. “The Watch,” based on the Terry Pratchett “Discworld” novels, is almost complete but still had about two weeks of work left before the pandemic shut down production. Yet drama premieres are fewer and further between on BBC America as AMC Networks balances programming across its portfolio of properties.</p>
<p>BBC America’s newfound emphasis on natural history shows stems from the success of “Planet Earth 2” in early 2017 when BBC America became the TV home to past and future landmark series from BBC Studios’ Natural History unit.</p>
<p>“We just see new enthusiasm around this content,” said Courtney Thomasma, executive director for BBC America, at an AMC Networks party in January during the Television Critics Association winter 2020 press tour. “It actually feels like a really natural evolution of the brand to be buying beyond just one genre.”</p>
<p>It’s also a calculated play to stake out space in a genre where the competition is less severe. Sure, there’s National Geographic Channel, some PBS programming and the occasional nature show on Discovery, but The New York Times reported there were roughly 130 nature series premieres in 2019, a drop in the bucket compared to those 500 scripted series.</p>
<p>“Last year, we worked with a cultural anthropologist on why nature was resonating so strongly at this moment because we saw a huge surge in viewership around ‘Planet Earth 2’ and an even bigger premiere for ‘Blue Planet 2’ in the U.S. and globally,” Ms. Thomasma said, noting that “Planet Earth 2” launched in the U.K. just after the Brexit vote and in the U.S. not long after the 2016 election.</p>
<p>“There’s a real feeling of uncertainty and instability in some of our political and social institutions. … And actually we found nature programming does a lot of the same work as being in nature. A lot of people receive a lot of the same benefits: [Nature TV] lowers anxiety and promotes deeper relaxation, promotes feelings of awe and inspiration and curiosity.”</p>
<p>In November BBC America launched Wonderstruck, a micro-network rebranding of its Saturday programming as a destination for nature series.</p>
<p>“It’s the most universal broadest programming that we have: all ages, all parts of the country, all points in the political spectrum,” she said. “It’s premium programming that’s not objectionable. You can watch with your entire family, and it’s at a moment where we feel as a society we really need this.”</p>
<p>And that was before the global pandemic. In April, BBC America temporarily expanded Wonderstruck to a second day of the week —&nbsp;Thursday —&nbsp;and launched WonderstruckTV.com, a free digital companion site offering short-form nature videos.</p>
<p>BBC America says in the eight months since Wonderstruck launched in November, the network has seen audience growth on Saturdays in total day (+28%), prime time (+53%) and in key demos compared to the three months prior to the launch.</p>
<p>In a follow-up June phone interview, Ms. Thomasma said every place BBC America added nature programming in April resulted in an increase in consumption, from the network’s website, to on-demand and the overall audience on TV.</p>
<p>This week’s hourlong “Wild India,” narrated by Sir David Attenborough, explores Karnataka in Southern Indian, which makes up just 5% of the country’s landmass but is home to 25% of all of its animal species.</p>
<p>Ms. Thomasma noted natural history programs may be themed around habitats or continents or animal families while “Wild India” is centered on place.</p>
<p>“One of the things we actively try to do is provide U.S. viewers the opportunity to travel, and that was sort of the mission before COVID hit this year,” she said, “but it’s probably never been more relevant.”</p>
<p>In August, Wonderstruck debuts “Earthflight” (8 p.m. Aug. 1), a six-part series narrated by David Tennant (“Dr. Who”) that takes viewers into the skies alongside birds and over wildlife spectacles. And in 2021, Wonderstruck reboots “Meercat Manor,” following the descendants of the original clan featured in Animal Planet’s 2005-08 series.</p>
<p><strong>Kept/canceled/reunited</strong></p>
<p>HBO renewed&nbsp;“Perry Mason” for a second season.</p>
<p>PBS’s “Masterpiece” will bring back “Grantchester” for a sixth season and “Baptiste” for a second.</p>
<p>USA canceled “Briarpatch” after a single season.</p>
<p>A reunion movie of the British sci-fi comedy “Red Dwarf” debuts Sunday on streaming service Britbox, which is also home to all previous seasons of the show.</p>
<p>Food Network made a new two-year deal with Robert Irvine that includes new episodes of “Restaurant Impossible” and a spinoff series, “Restaurant Impossible: Back in Business” (9 p.m. July 30), aiding previously featured restaurants impacted by the pandemic.</p>
<p>VH1 will follow six drag queens —&nbsp;Yvie Oddly, Asia O’Hara, Derrick Barry, Kameron Michaels, Naomi Smalls and Vanessa “Vanjie” Mateo — in their personal and professional lives in spinoff series “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Vegas Revue” as they appear in a live Las Vegas stage show.</p>
<p><strong>Channel surfing</strong></p>
<p>In 2018 a feature film about transgender Pittsburgh massage parlor boss Dante “Tex” Gill fell apart after an uproar over the casting of Scarlett Johansson as Gill, who identified as a man. Now the project, “Rub &amp; Tug,” is being developed as a potential TV series written by Our Lady J. for New Regency Television with Gill’s widow, Cindy Bruno Gill, serving as a consultant. … Green Tree native Zachary Quinto (“NOS4A2”) will lend his voice to “Walking Dead” creator Robert Kirkman’s upcoming animated superhero series, Amazon’s “Invincible.” … “Star Trek” fans without a CBS All Access subscription, take note: “Star Trek: Picard” season one debuts on DVD and Blu-ray on Oct. 6. … BET will air six season-three episodes of CBS All Access’ “The Good Fight” 8-11 p.m. Monday and Tuesday.</p>
