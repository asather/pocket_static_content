<p>Two Democratic lawmakers have introduced legislation that would provide a $2,000 monthly payment to qualified Americans until employment levels bounce back from the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Reps. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, and Ro Khanna, D-Calif., introduced the “Emergency Money for the People Act.”</p>
<p>“The economic impact of this virus is unprecedented for our country. As millions of Americans file for unemployment week over week, we have to work quickly to patch the dam – and that means putting cash in the hands of hard-working families,” Ryan said in a press release. “Many Ohioans are just receiving – or about to receive – the first cash payment we passed in the CARES Act. Now it’s time for Congress to get to work on the next step to provide relief for those who have been hardest hit in this pandemic.”</p>

<p>Under the terms of the proposal, Americans over age 16 would receive a $2,000 monthly payment until employment returns to pre-COVID-19 levels. The bill would also close a loophole in the existing stimulus bill that kept college students and adults with disabilities from receiving a payment if they are claimed as a dependent.</p>
<p>Unlike the current stimulus which is paid through direct deposits or checks, the EMPA would also distributed funds through a pre-paid debit card or mobile money platforms such as Venmo, Zelle or PayPal.</p>
<p>Married couples earning less than $260,000 would qualify for at least $4,000 a month, lawmakers said. Qualifying families would also receive an additional $500 per month per child for up to three children.</p>
<p>Those who had no earnings, were unemployed, or are currently unemployed would also be eligible.</p>
<p>The payment would be guaranteed for at least six months or until the employment to population ratio for people age 16 and older is above 16%.</p>
