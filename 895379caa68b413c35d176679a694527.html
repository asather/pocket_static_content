<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb, a prominent Western Pennsylvania Democrat in a swing district carried by Donald Trump in 2016, is endorsing Joe Biden for president.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, in an interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Sunday, said he's endorsing the former vice president because he's focused not only on who can win the election, but who can get things done and govern when they're in the White House.</p>
<p>His endorsement isn't so much ideological, Mr. Lamb said, as it is on behalf of working class people in his district who are looking for change.</p>
<p>"You know, they need help now and they can't afford 10 years of debate over some of these high flying proposals," Mr. Lamb said. "They need someone who can run the ball over the goal line, and I think the vice president can do that."</p>
<p>According to a Biden campaign official, Mr. Lamb will campaign on behalf of the vice president as a surrogate in New Hampshire next weekend.</p>
