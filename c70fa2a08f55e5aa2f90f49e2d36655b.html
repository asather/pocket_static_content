<h1>Jason Mackey's Pirates chat transcript: 09.02.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hello, everyone, and welcome to my weekly Pirates chat. Thanks for stopping by. We’ll get going around noon, but feel free to fire away now:</p>
<p><strong>Tom</strong>: I know it’s only one game, but Pirate’s management certainly looks foolish to let Hayes stay in Altoona, while playing other mediocre athletes. “We wanted to showcase players for trade possibilities!” What claptrap! Let the young guys earn their spurs! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Tom. Claptrap. That’s a new one for me. Anyway, I don’t have an issue with it. Sure, I can see why people wanted Hayes up here sooner. That’s fair. But I think we should also look at this big-picture, and it’s much better to bring him up a little too late than a little too early. I think the timing of this stuff is going to be essential for this new group, and I’m perfectly OK with erring on the side of caution as long as guys are able to make the transition. That said, it’s one game. A lot to see learn about and see play out.</p>
<p><strong>Aileen</strong>: I felt terrible for KeBryan Hayes’ family that they couldn’t be at PNC Park to see his debut. Couldn’t the Pirates have allowed them to sit in one of the luxury suites or somewhere where they would have been physically distanced from the team? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Logically, yes. Logistically and legally, no. I agree it’s stupid. I think it’s stupid that we can’t have small groups of fans inside sports venues -- socially distanced and with arrival and exit times, etc. But to my knowledge, the Pirates do not have the authority to make such a decision.</p>
<p><strong>J-town Johnny</strong>: Jason, love the chats. Do you think Bryce Harper for the money he is making is the most overrated player in baseball? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Johnny. Dollar for dollar, I won’t disagree with you. Not a big Bryce Harper fan, honestly. Seems to be a lot of ego there. I hope I’m wrong reading it from the outside, but that’s my perception.</p>
<p><strong>Joel</strong>: Hi, Jason. I can’t really fault Cherington for doing nothing at the trade deadline because he had nothing to deal due to poor performance and injuries. At least Hayes made a splash in his debut. This is maybe too open-ended a question, but what now? What are the priorities for the balance of the season and the off season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Joel. Good question. I’d list a couple things. One, let’s see what happens with Hayes. Was last night a one-off or the norm? We don’t know. Two, Erik Gonzalez. Is he an every-day player, or has he enjoyed a hot start? I wanna find out. I wanna see Mitch Keller come back. I wanna see Jared Oliva at some point. (Jason Martin was a dud.) I wanna watch Cole Tucker more in center. I wouldn’t be opposed to seeing Oneil Cruz or Nick Gonzales get a shot.</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: You and many others have said the best thing to do with Gregory Polanco is keep playing him and hope he works it out. I agree especially in a lost season like this. <br> <strong>Rich</strong>: Sorry, didn’t mean to send that. If the Pirates keep playing Polamco and he does eventually start to hit, do they immediately try to trade him to anyone for anything as long as they can unload all or nearly all of his salary rather than risk him reverting to current form or getting hurt for $11 million next year or do they decide he’s their answer for fight field in 2021? And if he never does get into any kind of form, if what we see is what we keep seeing for the rest of this year what do they do? Will they hope he works it out next spring or early next season or is there a point where you see them cutting bait and eating that $11 million? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Rich, short answer is yes: I’d keep playing him. I think you have to. With the goal of what you said, that he figures it out, gets hot, and maybe someone wants him. Long-term, it would help them a lot to trade Polanco. Given his injuries and poor performance, I really don’t think they can.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: Hi Jason. Great job with the deadline chat although it would have been more exciting if the Pirates had made some trades. Do you have any indication that the Pirates were close to making any deals and do you anticipate moves being made in the offseason? Thanks. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Yuri. Appreciate that. They got down the road on a couple things, yes. Musgrove was one. Also, this isn’t terribly unique. Happens a lot, including with Neal Huntington last year. And, yes, I do expect some of these deals the Pirates held off on to materialize over the winter.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hey Jason, no questions for you. Just a shoutout to young Mr. Hayes on his Pirates debut. Like Cole Tucker, he exudes love for the game. It’s <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Young Hayes was fun to watch.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Did Gustave ever officially go to Altoona? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Last I heard he was quarantining because he came here from the DR. But, yeah, when that is through, he will report to Altoona. I would also expect to see him in Pittsburgh at some point.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Considering their record and their standing, will the Pirates finally use the rest of this season giving the young guys (e.g., Cole and Hayes) a chance to play everyday rather than players (e.g., Moran) who we know will not be a part of our future? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: First, Matt, I wouldn’t punt on Moran maybe being a part of their future. He could be, albeit as a DH. And I wouldn’t have an issue with that, at least the short-term. I think his days as a third baseman are over, but he can still hit. He’s been one of their better bats this season. But, of course, with their record as bad as it is, they better be letting the young guys develop.</p>
<p><strong>Rick in Turtle Crick</strong>: Hi Jason...do you see Tucker’ future in the infield or outfield? If outfield, is center field or right field better suited for him? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Honestly, Rick, at the beginning of this thing I might’ve still said infield, thinking they move Frazier, back comes Tucker. I’ve changed my mind. I’ve liked Tucker in CF. At this point, I wouldn’t be shocked if he’s their opening day CF next season.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Although I understand the reasoning behind the Pirates lack of activity at the trade deadline, is there any hope for much more over the offseason if our trade commodities (Frazier, Williams, Polanco) do not improve (statistically speaking) over the remainder of this season? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Yes, as I said before, I think they will revisit some of those trades this season. Frazier would make says if there’s more interest after a hot month. Even Musgrove or Williams. Would not trade Kuhl. If they can get anything at all for Polanco, I think they should do it.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie</strong>: Likelihood that the Hayes news was a distraction from no activity at the deadline? Seemed odd to come out right at 4:00 pm Monday from literally every person who covers the team. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I’m not sure, Charlie. I think it probably was related to the deadline and playing other guys to try and get something for them. I don’t necessarily have an issue with that. As for a distraction? I don’t think that’s it. I don’t think they’re playing their top prospect as a PR stunt. And, I mean, that’s news these days. I broke it. Two minutes later MLB.com had it, then the Athletic, DK, Trib. Probably less than 10 minutes later, it’s confirmed. Same thing when national guys get stuff. It’s reporting in 2020, and it would be the same way if somebody else got something and I was chasing.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Off the wall comment and question....I have an MLBTV subscription to watch the Pirates. However, I cannot stand Joe Block as an announcer. I listen to every announcer in the league, and I don’t dislike the man. I just cannot stand his voice and prattling jokes. Do you know how Pirates’ announcers are evaluated? If he is calling the game, I always switch to the opposition’s broadcast. That’s me, and I am not calling for his dismissal. It just makes me wonder how they evaluated and whether the Pirates have any voice in those evaluations? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t share your opinion on Joe. He’s one of the most prepared people I’ve ever been around. He’s also extremely personable and loves what he does. ... I do wish the broadcasts as a whole focused on baseball more. Like sometimes with McKenry or Wehner, they’ll get into real nitty gritty, nerdy stuff. May be just me, but I love that. I feel like sometimes they can stray a little far into obscure stories and stay on them for too long, ignoring the game. But, no, I don’t know how those guys are evaluated. That’s not my world.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: Somehow, the Pirates have 20 (half of their 40-man!) projected for arbitration this offseason. What do you see more likely--the majority tendered with a return of basically the same roster in 2021, or around half, with stop gaps to fill the created holes? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: It’s hard to give a blanket answer to that, Dave. I think you’re probably going to see a little bit of both. If I had to pick one, I would say the majority tendered with a return of basically the same roster in 2021. I think bringing back only half of the arb-eligible guys is a little lower than I expect.</p>
<p><strong>Donna</strong>: Jason, are there any upcoming free agents the Pirates may be interested in and have a chance of signing? Keep up the great work! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Thanks, Donna. It’s tough -- if not impossible -- to predict that. I don’t expect this group to start spending a bunch of money soon. I think tangible on-field improvements (read: winning games) will have to happen first. Until that, their free agent signings are going to be non-descript guys who are way too tough to predict. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Have to do something, folks. Be back in 10.</p>
<p><strong>Tony</strong>: Hi Jason, Could this have happened at the trade deadline: The Pirates trade Kela to a team and get a PTBNL in return. If Kela pitches for that team the Bucs can choose from a list of prospects..all probably mid-level. If Kela doesn’t pitch for that team in 2020, the Pirates choose from a list of tomato cans. Is that scenario allowed under MLB rules? What a disappointment Kela has been this year. At this point I don’t even care if he pitches for us this year. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Hi Tony. Not to my knowledge. Especially the tomato cans part. I don’t believe trades can be made on a contingent basis -- whether or not that player pitches. I think if you make a trade, the acquiring has to give up something, even if it’s international bonus pool money. Can’t be tomato cans. And considering they didn’t trade Kela, I don’t think they had any offers in hand.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Maybe I’m not up to speed on how much development should be expected, but I thin bringing Hayes, Newman, Tucker, and Reynolds p in the past year is not bad. With this years development of Rodriguez and Stallings, and the yet-to-fully-be-fulfilled strength of Bell and Polanco, I don’t feel too bad about the team in the field or at bat. Still need lots of help on the mound. Am I too optimistic? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think you’re probably more rationale than most. Look, the Pirates have some pieces here. Reynolds, Newman, Bell, Hayes, Tucker ... they’re not completely screwed. But they’re not deep enough to account for injuries, they don’t have enough pitching, they need more offense, top to bottom organizationally they need more talent, they need to do that on the cheap ... My point: They’re not starting from zero on the scale of 0-100, but they’re obviously not at 80 either.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: I’m probably not permitted two questions, but I do wonder why managers refuse to move guys down in the order when they are struggling. Last night, I would have gone Gonzalez, Newman, Frazier, Moran, Bell, Stallings, Hayes, Osuna, and Tucker. That would scare me more as a pitcher than Tucker early in the order. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: You can ask two. I answer everything asked as long as it’s not rude, defamatory or pushing some sort of political agenda ... For context, last night it was Gonzalez, Tucker, Newman, Bell, Stallings, Moran, Hayes, Frazier, Osuna. ... We’re saying Tucker is too high? He’s hitting .292 over his last 48 at-bats. I’m fine, in this lineup, with him hitting anywhere outside of 3-4-5. ... Meanwhile, you’re telling me Frazier should be higher because he’s been hitting better? He’s at .250 over his last 48, to use the same sample size. Now, I’m not saying batting average is everything because it’s not. It has its flaws. But I think we may be quibbling here. The issue isn’t the order of the players. It’s the performance of them.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Let Reynolds miss all the time he needs, that’s fine in my book; however, technically his three allowable days on the Paternity List are up. Does he come back today? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think he does, yeah. Although I say that with this caveat: I obviously know nothing about the health/situation with his wife and child. That’s most important. But I wouldn’t stretch out his paternity leave -- and shift him to the restricted list or whatever it would be -- because he’s in a slump.</p>
<p><strong>Cy in Cali</strong>: Speaking of announcers, I’ve noticed that sometimes they don’t comment or connect with what the camera is showing. For example, Baez make a great play and almost threw out Gonzalez at first. After Gonzalez was forced at second, it looked like he gave Baez props for making the great play, yet the announcers never commented on it. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think it’s real easy to watch a game on TV and Monday Morning Quarterback the whole thing. If you did it, I’ll bet I could watch you and say, “Man, why doesn’t he ever talk about this?” <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Let’s change that to, ‘Man, why doesn’t Cy ever talk about this?’ I don’t know if you’re a male or female, don’t wanna insult anyone, and it certainly doesn’t make an ounce of different when it comes being a baseball fan.</p>
<p><strong>Dean</strong>: The Pirates have been going thru catchers the past years and when I first saw Jacob Stallings I thought this was another throw in to just fill the position. But the more I see of him he seems like he is the real deal. Do you think they finally found the player that best suits their needs at this position. Or will he be a back up in future playing. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Agree with you, Dean. I think he snuck up on some people. I’m perfectly fine with Stallings for now. I would like to see them infuse some young talent at the position, a guy who might be ready in 3-4 years. By that point, Stallings will be around 34. Would have no issue with him functioning more as a backup by that. But for right now, I’m fine with Stallings behind the plate.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Although I appreciated “Guest’s” question regarding the evaluation of Pirate announcers and your response, I just wish that the announcers could at least try to be somewhat objective in their broadcasts! I grew up listening to Bob Prince and Nellie King ON THE RADIO and, although your knew that they rooted for the Buccos, they were not nearly as blatant in their biased, subjective, homer announcing as Walk, McHenry and Wehner and Block. Those four sound like PR spokespeople for the Pirates! <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I agree with you there. But that’s not a Pirates thing. That’s a sports in 2020 thing. Penguins did the same stuff. They view telecasts as a PR tool, not objective coverage. However, what they should realize is you can do both. Look at Phil Bourque, for instance. I think Bourquey is tremendous. Insightful. Funny. Just a good, fun dude. But he rips the Penguins when warranted. He also praises them when warranted, and he gets excited. I don’t have any issue with the excitement if you’re also gonna criticize when it’s called for. That’s where some of the PR vehicle broadcasts lose me.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: I’ve asked this same question every week I think, but it continues, should we be worried about Josh Bell? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think so, no. But I’ll ask you, what is worrying about Josh Bell going to accomplish? He’s under contract for this year. I don’t think it’s smart to non-tender him for next year. So you’re gonna pay him, and thus you need to play him. He showed signs in Milwaukee. I would be patient. He didn’t suddenly forget how to hit. Guys through struggles. He’s had a tough month.</p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: 4 out of 5 of the Pirates top prospects are infielders . At what point do they think about converting them to another position? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I think they probably need to consider it with Oneil Cruz. Other than that, I don’t see an issue. Say hypothetically that Cruz becomes a RF. What’s wrong with Tucker in CF, Cruz in RF, Peguero at SS, Gonzales at 2B, Hayes at 3B? Would need to see what this means for Newman and Gonzalez on the current roster. Maybe you trade them for pieces, I don’t know. But it’s not like anybody lacks a path to playing time there.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: I like Tucker in center. Seems like he’s really taking to the position. But are they wasting his talents by not playing him at SS? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t look at it that way. I think Gonzalez would be fine there. I wanna see Peguero. I’ve heard good things. But Tucker is an athlete. What’s it matter if that plays out in CF or SS?</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: As in previous years, I’ve been disappointed with our errors and base running. Which coaches are in charge of those areas? It’s frustrating sometimes. Thanks Jason . <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t blame you, Frank. It frustrates me, too, and I’m not a fan. Baserunning is Tarrik Brock and also Joey Cora to a degree. Cora works with the infielders on fielding, Brock with the outfield. Glenn Sherlock handles the catchers. I wouldn’t absolve Shelton or Don Kelly either, but let’s remember that it’s first incumbent upon the player, too.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: How can anybody dislike Joe Block? Such a natural baseball voice and his pre game uniform descriptions are poetry. Give me Block and Rock every game <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t know if this is sarcasm or what. Not trying to make Joe out to be Vin Scully. But I don’t think he deserves the criticism, either. He puts a lot of time and effort into this, and I think he does a very good job.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: I feel like this trade deadline really wasn’t about accruing talent but more about freeing up roster space. I’m not advocating giving up Frazier/Osuna/Polanco for absolutely nothing, but gotta admit I was a little disappointed not to see them go. Now there’s a logjam in the infield and outfield. Don’t know how much longer I can watch Adam Frazier ground out to second <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, had to handle some breaking news. Back now. ... I think you’re only going to have to worry about that for another month, honestly. I wouldn’t be surprised if they traded Frazier this offseason. And I’d hardly call those logjams. We’re talking about a few guys failing to hit .200.</p>
<p><strong>Diane</strong>: Jason, I saw what Cy was referring to and agree with him. Maybe the announcers aren’t always looking at the monitors or maybe the people behind the camera aren’t communicating with them. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I understand. I’d also cut them some slack because announcers aren’t in ballparks. They’re trying to do everything remotely. It’s tough to have your attention everywhere all the time.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: So Musgrove and Reynolds potentially joining the active roster today--do we just see two more options? Also, is Austin Davis just going through intake testing? <br> <strong>Gabe</strong>: Just to be clear, wasn’t sarcasm. I legitimately enjoy Joe Block <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, cool. I’m not saying we can’t have a critical discussion about what you like and don’t like. We can do that with me. I have faults, and there are things I can do better. I just don’t like the blanket blasting of a guy.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: Just going to throw my hat in the ring...I can’t stand any of the commentators. I was watching the other team’s feed, but now that I’m continually blacked out on MLB TV I am forced to listen to #BucsBooth, and it’s awful. Cringy Robby interviews, random in-game interviews, meandering nonbaseball stuff, continual trashing of modern baseball/not being up-to-date with modern baseball. It honestly makes me not want to watch. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Bringing the telecasts more into the modern era should be a focus, I agree. I think they’ve done better. Also, I don’t broadcast the games. I cover the team. If you have issues with them, take it up with them, maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: Short of injuries happening, is Hayes the last rookie call up we’ll see this season? Not sure where they’re gonna find the roster space to bring up Oliva or Cruz <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I don’t think it’s the last one. I think they’ll find a way to get one or both up here.</p>
<p><strong>Matt from LA</strong>: Whatever became of Neil Huntington? Is he still in baseball? I do know that Hurdle decided to retire and leave Pittsburgh but do you know where he moved to? Not stalking either one, just curious? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Believe Hurdle moved full-time to Florida. Neal moved back to Cleveland. Actually, I’m not sure he ever left. Both are still getting paid to do nothing, so I think they’ll continue to do that in a bit. I think you’ll see Neal’s name surface again once his contract with the Pirates is up.</p>
<p><strong>Eddie Shack</strong>: Jason, when does baseball season start? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Good one.</p>
<p><strong>Ricky</strong>: When’s cederlind and puig reporting? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Not sure on Puig. That’s gonna be tricky. Gotta think we’re close on Cederlind.</p>
<p><strong>Cole tucker</strong>: How would my arm rate compared to other CFers <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: I would say average. It’s not a cannon, but I don’t think it’s bad either.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: What’s the breaking news? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Pirates are all wearing No. 21 on Roberto Clemente Day.</p>
<p><strong>Spazeroski</strong>: won’t Polanco have to be part of a package with another player (Frazier, Williams, Gonzalez, etc) that we basically give away to u load his salary? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Potentially. Depends on what he does the rest of the way. If he’s bad, I would imagine there would have to be a few sweeteners. I still don’t think it would happen. Just too tough.</p>
<p><strong>Gabe</strong>: What purpose does JT Riddle serve? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: None. Nothing against the guy, but the playing time should go to other people. He was an is a placeholder.</p>
<p><strong>Henry W.</strong>: Can you tell us what the breaking news is? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Pirates are all wearing No. 21 on Roberto Clemente Day.</p>
<p><strong>Spazeroski</strong>: Couldn’t disagree more with the opinion of Joe Block. I enjoy him and Walk a lot. It is Greg Brown who is hard to listen to. If there is a question here it would be how if us decided who dies which game on tv. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: Folks: This isn’t a forum on whether or not you like the TV broadcasts. If you have a question, I’m happy to answer it. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Will</strong>: Any update on Austin Davis? I assume he’s going through Covid testing? <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: He is, yes. No update as of now. Still going through the protocols. <br> <strong>Jason Mackey</strong>: OK, folks. I gotta run and get home for some Zoom calls. Thanks for doing this. Will talk to you again next week.</p>
