<h1>State Police prize education, encouragement over enforcement actions for COVID-19 violations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If that rural hair salon, suburban mom-and-pop shop or urban bar opens in violation of the governor’s orders, don’t expect state troopers to swoop in immediately, sirens blaring, and start hauling proprietors away.</p>
<p>Instead, “willful noncompliance” will continue to be the trigger for aggressive enforcement of pandemic orders by Pennsylvania State Police as counties transition from red to yellow status during the COVID-19 crisis, a top agency official said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Short of that, the commonwealth’s 4,500 state troopers will continue to work on education and encouragement as a first step to deal with violations of Gov. Tom Wolf’s various orders to combat the spread of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>So far, Lt. Col. Scott Price noted during a conference call with media from across the state, enforcement actions have been limited since March. Across the state, troopers have issued 329 warnings to business but only one citation; and 34 warnings and seven citations for violations of the governor’s stay-at-home order.</p>
<p>One such incident was an underage drinking party at an Econo Lodge motel room in Snyder County, where three people from other counties gathered in violation of the stay-at-home order. That, Lt. Col. Price said, would count as willful noncompliance, as would having to respond multiple times to a call or someone having multiple violations.</p>
<p>Troopers have mostly dealt with a cooperative populace and misunderstandings about the governor’s orders, he said.</p>
<p>Often those have been cleared up with conversation rather than confrontation.&nbsp;And while Lt. Price hopes that trend will continue, he said troopers will invariably&nbsp;become more proactive — and low crime rates during the pandemic might start to rebound —&nbsp;as counties move from red to yellow status as a result of more traffic, more people out and about and more businesses open.</p>
<p>Conflict is likely inevitable, though. Lt. Col. Price said in areas where the state police are not the primary law enforcement agency and serve as backup to the locals,&nbsp;“Our posture pretty much remains the same...We don’t intercede or second-guess the actions taken by municipal police departments. ... Are&nbsp;we going to go in and enforce the governor’s orders if a municipal police force doesn’t? And the answer to that is no, that’s not how we operate.”</p>
<p>In places where state police have primary jurisdiction, they will enforce as needed. And if the local district attorney opts not to prosecute, that’s not an unfamiliar situation.&nbsp;It happens already, Lt. Col. Price said, in arrests for small amounts of marijuana.</p>
<p>‘We will take the appropriate enforcement action based upon the law...and we respect the district attorney’s discretion to not prosecute beyond that.”</p>
<p>As for business that open unlawfully, state police plan to approach such situations with restraint — but from the position that county rules do not outrank state dictates.</p>
<p>“We would encourage compliance and likely engage in a conversation with the Department of Health, determine whether the Department of Health would want to pursue some sort of closure order for the business,” Lt. Col. Price said, answering a hypothetical question about a restaurant reopening without proper authorization. “I think we would maintain the position that the county doesn’t have the authority to supersede that order .”</p>
<p>State police are acutely aware of the rift between some counties and the governor’s office on plans to phase in reopening, and the agency is monitoring the situation.</p>
<p>Just this week, the governor rebuked counties and business that plan to reopen without state approval.</p>
<p>But for now, according to Lt. Col. Price, both sides have been “engaging in a discourse” that is part of democracy. Troopers have not been deployed out of concern that serious problems might arise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re aware of the situation,” he said. “We’re aware that it’s sometimes contentious.”</p>
