<h1>Paul Zeise: James Harrison is simply auditioning for a job as a hot-take artist</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>James Harrison said something outrageous. Wow, stop the presses! This is the least surprising Steelers&nbsp;“news” we have had in a few months.</p>
<p>It is hiring season for the national networks who are all getting their lineups ready for the football season, which is right around the corner. We’ve seen the networks almost weekly make announcements about lineup changes and people they are adding to this team.</p>
<p>Harrison was an all-time great Steelers player but he hasn’t played in a couple of years. And he ended his career by forcing the Steelers to cut him and then signing with the Patriots. It certainly didn’t endear himself to Steelers fans but it was a move he could have recovered from had he just kept his mouth shut when he was done playing.</p>
<p>He didn’t, though, and in the process has made himself into somewhat of a cartoon character by saying outlandish things. The latest came when Harrison said on a podcast with Willie Colon<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/14/james-harrison-mike-tomlin-comments-steelers-nfl-bounties/stories/202005140147" target="_blank"> that Mike Tomlin handed him an envelope, presumably full of cash,</a> after he was fined $75,000 for a hit on Browns receiver Mohamed Massaquoi.</p>
<p>“The G-est thing Mike Tomlin ever did, he handed me an envelope after that,” Harrison told his former teammate as part of a 90-minute interview. “I ain’t gonna say what, but he handed me an envelope after that.”</p>
<p>The fallout from this has been funny. Art Rooney II issued a statement saying, essentially, that Harrison is telling stories. Saints coach Sean Payton made some nonsensical comparison to his situation with “Bountygate” and hinted that the NFL will look the other way for Tomlin but wouldn’t for him.</p>
<p>Steelers fans, already tired of Harrison’s antics, expressed outrage that he would further betray the Steelers in this way. And even a local <a href="https://twitter.com/colin_dunlap/status/1261270656357928963?s=20" target="_blank">talk show host tweeted essentially</a> that Harrison should be forever ex-communicated from the Steelers’ club.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Stop the madness already. This isn’t the first time Harrison has said something outrageous and generated headlines. He knows exactly what he is doing and all of you are falling for it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For one thing, Harrison never said what was in the envelope — he hinted there was money but never said it — nor did he say what the envelope was for. He never mentioned an amount if there was money in the envelope, and as media member <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidMTodd/status/1261301992430997504?s=20" target="_blank">David Todd pointed out</a>, you can’t put $75,000 in an envelope, as it would require 750 $100 bills.</p>
<p>Harrison is smart and knew exactly what he said. And he knows that he said something that sounded inflammatory but in reality was vague enough for him to be able to say people are overreacting to it. That’s exactly what he did, and for all we know, Tomlin did hand him an envelope — with a birthday card and a $50 bill in it for one of Harrison’s kids.</p>
<p>This is a brilliant strategy, actually, but his antics have become boring. It is crystal clear what he is doing. Harrison isn’t saying things about the Steelers to get a rise out of Steelers fans, he is saying outrageous things to try and get a job on one of these national hot take shows, or on NFL Network, or anywhere he can get paid to talk about football.</p>
<p>And it won’t shock me if some network, desperate for a new, bold, brash face to talk loud and say outrageous things might hire him. Someone <em>should</em> hire Harrison. He would fit right in with the Shannon Sharpes and Nate Burlesons of the world as he doesn’t ever have to be insightful, he just has to be loud and say things that generate headlines.</p>
<p>Harrison has mastered this art and he also has mastered the art of walking it all back, as he did exactly that on Instagram on Friday. Harrison said <a href="https://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2020/05/15/james-harrison-lashes-out-at-reaction-to-his-envelope-claim/" target="_blank">Tomlin didn’t pay him to hurt anyone</a> and that he wasn’t the only one giving him money to cover his fines.</p>
<p>Unfortunately this is what gets you on television on these national hot take shows these days. It isn’t about what you say, it is about how loud you say it and how outrageous or controversial it is. Harrison will fit right in and would be a heck of a lot better than a whole lot of these guys who are trying so hard to stay relevant.</p>
<p>I know there are no sports to distract us, so every day is a slow news day and Harrison has taken advantage of this. He was in the headlines for 24 hours, he got his name out there again for network employers looking for ex-athletes willing to give hot takes and he got a rise out of Steelers fans.</p>
<p>He accomplished what he wanted to, but anyone who is still bent out of shape about what he said doesn’t understand show business. Harrison is a hot take artist, and he now just needs a canvas to paint on. His comments Thursday were just more proof of this and should be taken with a grain of salt&nbsp;</p>
