<h1>Pirates whiff 16 times in ugly loss to Indians</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In this battle of inept offenses, the Pirates came out on top.</p>
<p>Or, really, the bottom.</p>
<p>However you want to look at it, the Pirates were powerless against Shane Bieber and the pitching-rich Indians, as Cleveland completed a three-game series sweep with a 2-0 victory over the Pirates on Thursday at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The Pirates struck out 16 times and finished the series with 35 punchouts. Meanwhile, they mustered just two extra-base hits over three games, including none Thursday.</p>
<p>It's true that they've been on the other end of some terrific pitching performances this season: Jack Flaherty, Brandon Woodruff, Tyler Chatwood and even Aaron Civale’s complete game on Wednesday. But whether it's those guys or Bieber, sooner or later the Pirates have to do something.</p>
<p>"We have faced really good pitching, but we have to hit," manager Derek Shelton said. "We have got to have better at-bats. And that's not just [Thursday]. We've got to have more consistent at-bats, and it's something that we're not doing right now, obviously."</p>
<p>After entering this series as the second-worst offensive team in baseball, ahead of only the Indians, the Pirates proved themselves to be a (not-so) worthy challenger.</p>
<p>It's the fourth consecutive loss for the Pirates, who fell to 4-17. Meanwhile, Bieber (5-0) alone has more wins than the Pirates.</p>
<p>“Yes, we are facing really good arms,” Jacob Stallings said. “But we can do better.”</p>
<p>The Pirates knew they were facing a tough task with Bieber, who came into Thursday’s game with 54 strikeouts, tied for third-most over five starts in MLB history dating back to 1906.</p>
<p>Bieber appeared as advertised, leaning on a four-seamer, cutter, knuckle curve and slider. The 25-year-old gave the Indians six innings of shutout ball, allowing six hits with no walks and 11 strikeouts.</p>
<p>Even though all of Bieber’s stuff was sharp, his knuckle curve was especially nasty; he used to get five of his 11 strikeouts, including Colin Moran on a check swing in the fourth inning. Moran did not like the call and was ejected after sharing his feelings with third-base umpire Tripp Gibson.</p>
<p>“He did what he does to everybody else in the league,” Stallings said. “He just has a bunch of pitches. They’re all really good pitches. He has really good command. When you have good command and good stuff, it makes for one of the best pitchers in the league, if not the best. He’s just really good.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, after the Pirates exploded for seven runs in the second inning last Thursday in Cincinnati, it has been awfully quiet since. Pittsburgh has totaled just four extra-base hits in 44 innings, including one home run.</p>
<p>The Indians made things tough on Trevor Williams, who endured a bunch of long counts. He needed 90 pitches to get through four innings, allowing an earned run on six hits with two walks and five strikeouts.</p>
<p>While the Pirates are missing two of their five starters — Mitch Keller and Joe Musgrove — Williams’ resurgence has been a positive story, lowering his ERA from a career-worst 5.38 in 2019 to 3.70 this season.</p>
<p>The Indians grabbed a 1-0 lead in the second inning when designated hitter Franmil Reyes and right fielder Tyler Naquin led off with singles. Catcher Beau Taylor, who started the season in an 0-for-16 funk, broke out with his first hit of 2020, scoring Reyes.</p>
<p>Cleveland doubled its lead in the eighth, taking advantage of a few things that have plagued the Pirates so far this season. Chris Stratton walked two of the first three men he faced. The middle one, Naquin, singled.</p>
<p>With the bases loaded, Taylor hit a ball to first base. Josh Bell fielded it but delivered an awkward, submarine-style throw home, one that pulled Jacob Stallings up the third-base line and off home plate. Everybody was safe, Reyes scored, and an error was charged to Bell.</p>
<p>“I tried to reach as far as I could,” Stallings said. “He said he kinda got a bad grip on it.”</p>
<p>It was the 21st error of the season for the Pirates. Only two MLB clubs have made more. Worse, their rate of errors per game (1.0) is actually worse than what it was in 2019 (.75), when the Pirates led all of baseball with 121 errors.</p>
<p>The frustration has to be mounting with the Pirates.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the offense, the injuries, the bullpen, defense or baserunning — not to mention the unsightly record — 2020 has been a huge challenge for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Williams said the Pirates are still trying to work hard and maintain a positive attitude, but like facing really good pitchers, they know that sooner or later they have to start producing results.</p>
<p>“We’re all trying to keep as much perspective as possible,” Williams said. “There’s no denying that we’ve lost a lot of games, and we are all guys that demand greatness and demand perfection.</p>
<p>“If you guys were seeing us work out every day, you would see that guys are grinding here every day, and guys are doing everything possible to take the next step forward.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>Newman’s two hits stretched his hitting streak to nine games. … Erik Gonzalez was thrown out while trying to steal in the third inning. Pittsburgh’s success rate stealing bases (.538) ranks ahead of only the Nationals (.417).</p>
