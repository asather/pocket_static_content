<h1>Duquesne falls short to St. Bonaventure, 83-80</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne had finally climbed back against St. Bonaventure.</p>
<p>The Bonnies had held the lead for most of the game, staving off Dukes runs and pushing them further away until the very end.</p>
<p>But with 1:36 left Saturday at Robert Morris’ UPMC Events Center, sophomore guard Sincere Carry hit a turnaround jumper from the free-throw line to draw Duquesne even (77-77). Then, junior forward Michael Hughes had a huge block on the other end to force a baseline inbounds play.</p>
<p>Momentum seemed to be on the Dukes’ side with the game on the line, but on the inbounds, Duquesne got caught ball-watching and lost track of St. Bonaventure guard Kyle Lofton. Lofton hit a dagger 3-pointer from the right wing to give the Bonnies the lead.</p>
<p>Carry missed a 3 on the other end, and St. Bonaventure made a baseline jumper, removing all doubt about the outcome. The Dukes (17-6 overall, 7-4 Atlantic 10 Conference) fell, 83-80, dropping from third place to sixth in the A-10 standings in the process.</p>
<p>“They were just making,” junior guard Tavian Dunn-Martin said of the Bonnies after the game. “They had wide-open shots, and they were just making. They took advantage of wide-open shots, and that’s really all I can say.”</p>
<p>The game was a track meet throughout. Shots were falling left and right as the teams took turns making runs and building momentum. Duquesne got big 3-pointers from Dunn-Martin and Carry, while St. Bonaventure (16-8, 8-3) made 47.6% of its 3s.</p>
<p>The result was a back-and-forth game, with the Bonnies extending their lead to 9-10 points before the Dukes would fight their way back moments later.</p>
<p>At the end, Dunn-Martin paced both teams and tied a career high with 25 points, while Carry got all 17 of his points in the second half. Meanwhile, Lofton led St. Bonaventure with 21 points, and center Osun Ossunniyi racked up 12 points and nine reboounds the Bonnies outrebounded Duquesne, 41-27.</p>
<p>“First off, hats off to St. Bonaventure,” Duquesne coach Keith Dambrot said after the game. “I thought that was probably one of their best games they’ve played offensively all year. Shot the ball at a high rate. We made some mistakes, but they also made some shots, and every time we made a couple, they made a couple, which made it difficult.”</p>
<p>Dambrot said junior forward Marcus Weathers, who averaged a team-high 15 points per game before Saturday, was a little sore and banged up. He subbed out early on and received some attention from team trainers before returning to the game and finishing with seven points in 27 minutes.</p>
<p>Dunn-Martin, stepped up instead, and he did so from the jump, hitting four 3-pointers, a layup and two free throws for 16 first-half points, while fifth-year senior center Baylee Steele added 10 points in the first 20 minutes.</p>
<p>On the other end, though, Duquesne got gashed from beyond the arc, an area where it is typically very stout. But St. Bonaventure made five of its first nine 3-pointers, setting the tone for the rest of the game and taking a 43-38 lead at halftime.</p>
<p>Carry woke up in the second half to help the Dukes stay in it, while Dunn-Martin continued to hit big shots. It was Lofton and the Bonnies who got the last laugh, though, sending Duquesne home with a hard-fought effort, but a loss nonetheless.</p>
<p>“We just had a bad start to the second half, but our team showed a lot of grit and a lot of fight, and we stayed together,” Carry said. “We took the punch, and we bounced back. I mean, that’s the only positive thing that you can take from a game like this. We’ve just got to go in to practice and try to find a way to finish it next time when we play them again.”</p>
