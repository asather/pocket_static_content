<h1>Are homemade face masks effective in protecting against COVID-19? </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How effective are homemade cloth face masks in preventing the transmission of COVID-19?</p>
<p>It’s a deceptively complex question. While it might seem obvious that covering your mouth and nose would make it more difficult to contract the virus,&nbsp;the data, it turns out, are as conflicted as health officials’ messages on the matter.</p>
<p>In March, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said that masks were not effective in protecting the public in an emphatic Tweet asking individuals not to buy masks due to a shortage of equipment in hospitals. And&nbsp;Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar spoke against non-healthcare workers wearing masks.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“[Wearing masks] could actually sometimes be more harmful to you than not wearing a mask, because if it’s not fitted right you’re going to fumble with it,” Mr. Azar told a House of Representatives Appropriations subcommittee in February.</p>
<p>Then, on April 3, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that anyone who cannot social distance wear a mask while at work or in public, and on April 19, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s order that all citizens wear masks at work became enforceable by law throughout the state.</p>
<p>Why the reversal?</p>
<p><strong>Inconclusive data</strong></p>
<p>“I don’t want to speculate about people’s motives, but if you don’t explain clearly to the public why you’ve changed course, that erodes trust,” said Baruch Fischhoff, a psychologist at Carnegie Mellon University and a member of the National Academy of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine.</p>
<p>Mr. Fischoff, who said he was speaking as a private citizen, contributed to a rapid expert consult on the efficacy of cloth masks published by the academy on April 8. The consult states that while using properly fit cloth masks may provide some benefit, “the current level of benefit, if any, is not possible to assess.”</p>
<p>“Someone made the call that the protection is worth the inconvenience,” Mr. Fischhoff said.</p>
<p>When asked about the change, CDC press officer Marcus Hubbard said in an email that the new recommendations were driven by three factors:&nbsp;“increasing and widespread transmission of the new coronavirus across the country;” growing evidence of asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic spread; and <a href="https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600(20)30134-X/fulltext" target="_blank">reports</a> from Asian countries stating that&nbsp;“a cloth face covering worn in public can reduce the chance of spreading respiratory secretions or droplets when people need to be in places with others, such as shopping for groceries and seeking medical care.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hubbard also said that&nbsp;the reason to wear a mask is not to protect the wearer, but rather to protect others in proximity to the wearer.&nbsp;He did not respond to requests for the specific reports the CDC is citing.</p>
<p>This reasoning does not explain why Mr. Azar and other health officials previously advised against wearing face masks.&nbsp;Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment. While the CDC did not advise against wearing masks, it did initially say they were only necessary for those exhibiting symptoms.</p>
<p>There are only a handful of earlier scientific studies that examine cloth masks’ effectiveness, and some provide conflicting information due to different testing strategies and fabric quality. A 2008 study on whether cloth masks help contain the flu concluded “any type of general face mask usage can still decrease viral transmission” as part of a broader intervention strategy.</p>
<p>However, one 2015 study determined that cloth masks could theoretically increase wearers’ chances of catching a virus due to moisture retention and improper reuse or cleaning, though this may have been an anomaly. (Cloth masks can and should be cleaned in a typical home washing machine.)</p>
<p>“Theoretically, sure, people wearing masks may be more inclined to touch and manipulate it, leading to more touching around your nose and eyes,” said Dr. Raymond Pontzer, an infectious diseases expert at UPMC. He characterized the idea of a cloth mask creating a moist environment ripe for infection as “a stretch.”</p>
<p>“There’s disagreement among the experts on cloth masks and whether they have any impact,” he said. “If they have any impact it’s not in protecting you, it’s in protecting other people, as they do seem to decrease the amount of droplets you expel by just breathing and talking.”</p>
<p>Dr. Pontzer said that a policy reversal is to be expected in an evolving pandemic, with new information is coming to light daily. He said he wouldn’t fault health organizations for pivoting due to new information.</p>
<p><strong>Virus&nbsp;</strong><strong>chauffeurs</strong></p>
<p>Sola Talabi, a nuclear risk expert at Pittsburgh Technical, offered a more physical perspective on masks. He is not an infectious disease expert, but he said the research models he uses to explore inhalation risk of contamination from nuclear power plants are&nbsp;also applicable to studying how a virus travels given the similarity in particle size and movement patterns.</p>
<p>“The truth is even a cloth mask protects both the wearer and others,” he said. “The debate between the CDC and the White House and the World Health Organization on masks — God bless them, they’re smart people but they’re best at telling you what happens after it enters your body, not before.”</p>
<p>Any mask will have some effect on particle transmission, according to Mr. Talabi, who said that the ideal conditions used for prior studies and research on cloth masks would not accurately reflect how the virus travels in a real world environment.</p>
<p>Scientists are still exploring precisely how the coronavirus is transferred, but it is most likely a blend of two different methods. First, the virus particles exist in droplets, which are heavy enough to fall to the ground and could be caught even with a cloth mask. Second, the virus can exist in smaller bioaerosol particles that travel much farther and might be too small to be trapped by a cloth mask.</p>
<p>Previous respiratory viruses’ primary mode of transmission is by droplet, according to Dr. Pontzer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Nobody has worked out the percentage of how much of the [COVID-19] virus travels by droplets vs. aerosol particles,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Talabi said that based on his research, the virus does not travel as an individual particle but as an agglomerate of fluid and virus particles large enough to be slowed by even a cloth mask. He is currently working to secure National Institute of Health funding to further his coronavirus research and attempting to publicize his findings.</p>
<p>For his part, Mr. Fischhoff said that popular thinking on masks runs the gamut from the idea that masks provide wearers a false sense of security to the idea that they provide a constant physical reminder to engage in healthy practices like social distancing and hand washing.</p>
<p>He said there is a strong body of research on respirators like the much-discussed N95, some research on surgical masks, but simply not enough on cloth masks.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why [the CDC] flipped, and it would be nice to have research on this rather than using pop psychology and intuitions about other people’s behavior,” he said. “That would be quite nice.”</p>
