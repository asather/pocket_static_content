<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ALTOONA — When Major League Baseball earlier this month released its report on the Astros’ sign-stealing scandal, many Pirates fans probably wondered what it meant for Pittsburgh’s new bench coach, Don Kelly, who was Houston’s first-base coach in 2019.</p>
<p>At this point, it looks like not much of anything.</p>
<p>Speaking after a Pirates CARE-a-van event on Wednesday at Dick’s Sporting Goods in Altoona, where a group of coaches and players shopped with kids thanks to a partnership with the Salvation Army, Kelly said he’s never been questioned about his former employer’s practices.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t there for what apparently went on,” Kelly said. “I never got interviewed. I never talked to anyone. I was not part of any of that stuff that went on.</p>
<p>“Quite frankly, last year, there are guys in the dugout now; that stuff couldn’t have gone on last year because of the MLB-sanctioned guys who were in the video room and all that stuff.”</p>
<p>The fallout from the sign-stealing scandal ultimately cost (now former) Astros general manager Jeff Luhnow and manager A.J. Hinch their jobs, along with Boston’s Alex Cora — who was Houston’s bench coach in 2017 — and now-ex Mets manager Carlos Beltran, a player on that World Series-winning team.</p>
<p>Kelly was close with Hinch, who viewed the Mt. Lebanon native and Point Park product as future manager material, the same as many around baseball.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to get too deep into it, but you hate to see stuff like that go on and the consequences from what apparently happened, especially with people you care about,” Kelly said.</p>
<p>The Astros’ propensity for stealing signs became public knowledge — and obviously a controversial topic — after former Houston pitcher Mike Fiers broke rank and offered details about the team’s elaborate-yet-archaic system in November 2019.</p>
<p>According to the Houston Chronicle, MLB instructed video monitors at Minute Maid Park early last season to listen for the sound of someone banging on a trash can — the way the Astros told hitters what pitch was coming.</p>
<p>Kelly, who was a scout for the Tigers at the time, said he had no direct knowledge of the Astros potentially stealing signs while he was there, but he has been following what the fallout has meant for Houston’s entire organization.</p>
<p>“Everything that’s going on, having been there, you hate to see it with people you know,” Kelly said. “But it was from two years prior, apparently. I don’t know anything about what was going on. Everything that’s coming out in the news, that’s what I know, as well.”</p>
<p>As a player, Kelly said it was not uncommon to notice different tells on a pitcher live: what he does with his glove when throwing a curveball, arm slot, how he strides, etc. All of that is normal, so long as it’s discerned with the naked eye, not via technology.</p>
<p>“It’s part of the game,” Kelly said. “I know from when I played, there are times that you go up there, you see something that’s different, but you don’t even know what you see. You just know that there was something different. It could be an arm slot. It could be a glove. There are times you walk back, and you’re like, ‘Man, something was different on that pitch.’ But you don’t know what you saw.”</p>
<p>Kelly maintains that he didn’t see anything in Houston that would compromise his position with the Pirates. And at this point, it appears Pittsburgh has absolutely nothing to worry about regarding its new bench coach.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t there,” Kelly said. “I’ve been up front with everyone. I’ve talked to [manager Derek Shelton] and [general manager] Ben [Cherington] about it. They know. Even from the MLB investigation, there was nothing from this year. It was all from 2017.”</p>
