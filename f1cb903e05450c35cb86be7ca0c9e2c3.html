<h1>Penguins sign Sam Lafferty to new 2-year deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins have rewarded Sam Lafferty after an encouraging rookie year.</p>
<p>The team announced Thursday that Lafferty, a restricted free agent who hails from Hollidaysburg, had signed a new two-year contract. The one-way deal has an average annual value of $750,000. He’s under contract through 2022-23.</p>
<p>“We have been very pleased with Sam’s development,” Pittsburgh general manager Jim Rutherford said Thursday in a statement. “His size and speed are big advantages in today’s game, and his style of play complements our team well.”</p>
<p>The 25-year-old made his NHL debut last October and played 50 games in 2019-20. His six goals were tied with John Marino for the most among Penguins rookies. He added seven assists and finished the regular season with a plus-5 rating.</p>
<p>Lafferty appeared in just one playoff game. It did not go well. After a rocky night against the Montreal Canadiens in Game 3, he was again a healthy scratch.</p>
<p>Still, Lafferty showed promise in his first NHL season and with his combination of size and speed, he can become a bottom-six mainstay if he further develops. The 6-foot-1, 195-pound forward saw time at both center and right wing as a rookie.</p>
<p>The Penguins drafted Lafferty in the fourth round in 2014. He spent four years at Brown, twice being named an All-Ivy League performer. After turning pro in 2018, he had 55 points in 84 games at the American Hockey League level.</p>
<p>With Lafferty now under contract, fellow forward Anthony Angello is the only remaining RFA among last season’s Penguins. He will likely sign a similar deal.</p>
