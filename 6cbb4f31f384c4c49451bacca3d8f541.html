<p>The Penguins started the postseason Saturday night with more playoff experience than any of the 24 teams in the NHL’s coronavirus-delayed postseason tournament, a combined 1,208 games.</p>
<p>They’re going to need every bit of it to survive the allegedly overmatched Montreal Canadiens in their best-of-five qualifying round series.</p>
<p>Game 1 Saturday night turned out to be a nightmare for the Penguins <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/08/01/penguins-canadiens-game-1-recap-overtime-penalty-shots/stories/202008010068" target="_blank">in a 3-2 overtime loss</a>. The heavily favored Edmonton Oilers endured a similar headache earlier in the day when they were stunned by the Chicago Blackhawks, but I’m sure that doesn’t make you or the Penguins feel any better. Stanley Cup history says if you lose Game 1 of a best-of-five series, you lose the series 81.9% of the time.</p>
<p>I don’t imagine you like those odds going into Game 2 Monday night in the bubble in Toronto.</p>
<p>Montreal’s Jeff Petry ended the suspense on this August night — imagine that, hockey in August —&nbsp;as midnight closed in with a wrist shot through traffic at 13:57 of overtime, but that’s not when the Penguins lost the game.</p>
<p>They lost it early when they fired shot after shot at Montreal goaltender Carey Price and couldn’t score. Going in, the Canadiens knew they needed Price to be huge, and he was. They rode the momentum he gave them to take a 1-0 lead on a lucky deflection goal by Jesperi Kotkaniemi and a 2-0 lead on a shot by Nick Suzuki that Matt Murray probably should have stopped. At that point, we should have known the Penguins were in trouble. In the long history of Penguins-Canadiens, the team that went up by two goals at any point in a game was 11-0, according to Penguins historian Bob Grove.</p>
<p>“We liked the way we were playing,” Mike Sullivan said. “We could have been up a couple of goals in the first period. It didn’t happen that way. But that’s hockey. We just have to stay with it.”</p>
<p>The Penguins also lost the game in the third period after goals by Sidney Crosby and Bryan Rust had tied the game, 2-2, when they wasted glorious scoring chances. They managed just one shot on a 5-on-3 power play that lasted 1:32. They cringed when Conor Sheary failed to score on a penalty shot with 3:03 left in regulation when Sheary didn’t even get the shot on net. They also failed to score on the power play in overtime, making them 1-for-7 in the game with just 10 shots.</p>
<p>That ineptitude wasn’t what Sullivan had in mind when he started the game with Kris Letang and Jason Zucker on the top power-play unit instead of Justin Schultz and Patric Hornqvist.</p>
<p>“We understand that the power play has to be better,” Sullivan said. “Obviously, it had the opportunity to be the difference tonight. It wasn’t.”</p>
<p>So what is needed?</p>
<p>“Just more of a net-front presence,” Sullivan said of his team’s offense in general and the power play in particular.</p>
<p>“We generated a fair amount of scoring chances. It’s not that there wasn’t opportunity. There was lots. We can make it harder on Montreal if we get to the net more consistently and take the goalie’s sight lines away and make it harder on him to find the puck and maybe create some rebound opportunities. We had our moments when we were at the net, but we think we can get better at that.”</p>
<p>This was the Penguins’ seventh consecutive loss in the playoffs. They lost the final two games to Washington and were eliminated in the second round in 2018 and were swept by the New York Islanders in the first round last season. It is starting to seem like ancient history that the Penguins won their first nine postseason series under Sullivan on their way to the Cup in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>Murray started all seven of those losses but deserved better against the Canadiens. He was strong after giving up the Suzuki goal. He stopped Jonathan Drouin on a breakaway in overtime and then held his ground when Drouin couldn’t get off a shot on goal on the ensuing penalty shot.</p>
<p>“I thought he was solid,” Sullivan said of Murray.</p>
<p>There was much debate which Penguins goaltender should start Game 1 — Murray, who owns two Cup rings, or Tristan Jarry, who had a better regular season.</p>
<p>Sullivan picked the right man even if the result turned out all wrong.</p>
