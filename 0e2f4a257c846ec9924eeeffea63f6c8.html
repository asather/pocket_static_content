<h1>March ends peacefully after making its way from Market Square to South Side and back</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A demonstration on Tuesday that marched miles through several Downtown streets, crossed a river and included three sit-ins ended peacefully nearly 3½ hours later in the spot where it began.</p>
<p>The group Pittsburgh I Can’t Breathe organized the march, which began around 4:15 p.m., and its leader made it clear to participants that violence would not be tolerated.</p>
<p>“If you care for the movement, if you care for the message we’re trying to convey, [I ask] that you keep this peaceful,” said Dasia Clemons, the group’s&nbsp;founder. “We want our actions to speak louder than violence.”</p>
<p>It was the fourth consecutive day of demonstrations in Pittsburgh, one of many cities where large-scale protests have developed following the death of George Floyd while in police custody in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>The event began with roughly 150 activists, who met in Market Square in Downtown.</p>
<p>“I hope it’s the spark our children and their children need for a better future,” said Anthony N., 28, who declined to give his last name. “And if we take our foot off the pedal now, it would be a disservice to everyone that has been protesting all over the world.”</p>
<p>From Market Square, the group sang and chanted as it marched along Forbes Avenue to Cherry Way to the Boulevard of the Allies and to Second Avenue. Police officers in riot gear watched from a distance from First Avenue — in front of the Pittsburgh Municipal Court building —&nbsp;as protesters walked to the nearby Allegheny County Jail and staged a sit-in.</p>
<p>As the group sat peacefully on the street and sidewalk and shared stories, the scene stood in contrast to the previous day in East Liberty. On Monday, a march there ended in clashes with police, who shot tear gas and&nbsp;and less lethal rounds at protesters, who responded by hurling rocks and bottles. At another demonstration over the weekend in Downtown, protesters set a police SUV on fire, and police deployed tear gas and used horses for crowd control.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We don’t have those white anarchists here today first of all,” said a woman who identified herself as Sage N., 24, of Shadyside.&nbsp;“Second, I think everyone yesterday was on edge. You could feel the tension in the air. I think most of that has been released.”</p>
<p>Throughout Tuesday’s event, police gave marchers room to maneuver and provided traffic control at intersections. Neither police nor counter-protesters ever impeded the march.</p>
<p>During the sit-in, demonstrators shared personal experiences with discrimination and police brutality. John Bedortha of Lawrenceville carried an American flag upside down. On each stripe were the names of blacks killed while in police custody. Other protesters made shields out of cardboard boxes that they strapped onto their arms.</p>
<p>Inside the jail, inmates pounded on the windows in a show of support. The crowd cheered back.</p>
<p>As the sit-in ended, the group continued along Second Avenue and turned onto the 10th Street Bridge. After arriving on the South Side, the group stopped for a second sit-in at 10th and East Carson Street. By then, the crowd had swelled to roughly 300. More participants told the group about their own experiences with police brutality.</p>
<p>“I have a few friends and people I know that have been harassed by police, and as a person of color I feel responsible to be here and have my voice heard,” Sage said.</p>
<p>After a brief march down East Carson Street, the group turned around and headed back. There was no stop at the jail during the return trip, but a small group of protesters did ask a few Pennsylvania State Police troopers, who were watching from the sidewalk, if they wanted to join the march. They politely declined.</p>
<p>After returning to Market Square around 7 p.m., most of the protesters dispersed.</p>
<p>“Every protest has been beautiful — until the end,” said Anand Young, of Wilkinsburg. He&nbsp;said it was his third demonstration. “It seems like this one is going to have the ending it deserves.”</p>
<p>The event remained peaceful throughout. No broken windows. No injuries. No tear gas.</p>
<p>A smaller group that stayed behind continued to sit in protest for another 45 minutes or so. There, a police officer with the city’s Civil Affairs unit spoke to the group, which then questioned the officer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When one protester asked Officer Jon Bradford how he felt about police using tear gas and less lethal projectiles during Monday’s demonstration, the officer said he was not inclined to talk about that and referred questions to the public information officer.</p>
<p>Another one of the protesters asked if Officer Bradford’s speech was just a publicity stunt.</p>
<p>“How do we know that this isn’t just a publicity stunt because all around America [police] have been doing this,” the protester said. “You’ll kneel, you’ll quote-unquote stand in solidarity for 15 minutes for a photo opp, but then 10 minutes later you will be ordered to tear gas, you will be ordered to shoot rubber bullets at us.”</p>
<p>“What are you actually doing to make sure that the relations between the police and the black community are what it should be?” the protester asked.</p>
<p>Officer Bradford explained that he was a neighborhood resource officer, and his role is to build relationships with community members. He said he goes into schools and tries to guide the youth.</p>
<p>The officer told the group that he would be willing to kneel with them, and he would ask other officers to do the same thing.</p>
<p>But when a protester asked if he could get police to stop using military equipment and other forceful techniques on protesters, the officer said the request was “understandable,” but he again referred further comment to the public information officer.</p>
<p>When the protesters asked Officer Bradford how he felt about Mayor Bill Peduto and Pittsburgh police Chief Scott Schubert lying about using tear gas on protesters Monday night, the officer said he was not inclined to speak about it.</p>
<p>“We want the real representative out here,” one protester said. “If you can’t speak, then who can speak?”</p>
<p>Despite the effort, protesters say demonstrations are likely to continue.</p>
<p>“Definitely,” Sage said. “There’ll be more in the days and weeks to come until our voices are heard. We’re not stopping anytime soon.”</p>
