<h1>Penn State's Keaton Ellis: 'Everything isn’t going to be normal'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State athletes’ phased return to campus began this week, and perhaps&nbsp;nobody had a shorter commute than State College Area High School alum and Nittany Lion cornerback Keaton Ellis.</p>
<p>“It’s the first step to getting back to playing the sport that we love,” Ellis said Wednesday via Zoom. “This week is about making sure that everyone is healthy. I’m really excited to be back and happy to be moving forward.”</p>
<p>On Monday, dozens of athletes made their way back to Holuba Hall to start preparing for the 2020 football season. The school announced last week the return to campus would begin with 75 football players, with plans for other programs being announced at a later date.</p>
<p>Those players were tested for COVID-19 and went through a prescribed quarantine before they came back to campus, according to the school. They’ll also undergo another period of isolation before they’re allowed to participate in group workouts starting next Monday.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 test took 15 seconds, according to Ellis. He also noted that the test wasn’t overly invasive, but it’s the new normal not only for Penn State but for college athletes across the county.</p>
<p>Remember all those fun videos of players setting records on the bench press or squat rack, the ones where teammates and coaches surround the player? That likely won’t be a thing for a while as workouts will be limited in size to groups of less than 20.</p>
<p>Penn State team meetings will still be via Zoom for the foreseeable future. Players won’t be able to gather in the lounge at Lasch building. There won’t be a traditional training table. Each player will receive a pre-packaged meal before and after workouts.</p>
<p>Ellis acknowledged all those changes will take some adjusting.</p>
<p>“It’ll be different. It’s going to be weird when a guy does something great, and you can’t dap him up,” said Ellis, who forced three fumbles last season as a freshman. “Everything isn’t going to be normal. We are all going to have to make sacrifices. But there will still be ways to encourage a teammate. We’ll have to get creative and vocal.”</p>
<p>Several schools, including Auburn and Alabama, have said they’ve had players test positive for COVID-19&nbsp;upon returning to campus. It’s unclear whether the Nittany Lions have seen similar results.</p>
<p>“We are very confident in our plan and will continue to keep the health, safety and well-being of our students, coaches, staff, and community as our top priority,” athletic director Sandy Barbour said last week in a statement announcing athletes’ returns. “Our outstanding sports performance group worked with medical experts at both the University, conference, and national level, as well as University leadership in developing an extensive return to campus plan for our student-athletes, staff and facilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Camps go virtual</strong></p>
<p>Penn State on Tuesday announced a virtual combine will replace canceled summer camps for high school prospects.</p>
<p>“The best way for college coaches to evaluate prospective student-athletes is to see them perform live and in-person, but frequently this is not an option,” the school said in a statement to athletes and coaches. “Our goal here is to provide prospects with detailed instructions on how to best showcase their talents to college coaches when in-person evaluation opportunities are not available.”</p>
<p>Summer camps are crucial for football programs to show off their campus to recruits while evaluating them. Players will have the opportunity to submit film of themselves running the 40-yard-dash, agility drills, position drills and other measurables. It won’t fully replace the imperative summer camps, but it will assist the kids and the school in the evaluation process.</p>
<p>Back in March, defensive coordinator Brent Pry hinted that the program would try to be innovative in replacing the invaluable summer camps.</p>
<p>“Everybody’s dealing with it, but we’ve got a strong pool, a lot of prospects out there interested in Penn State and what we’re doing,” Pry said. “We are trying not to make hasty decisions and still be diligent and trust our process.</p>
<p>“It’s just like anything; a little bit of adversity is an opportunity to grow and be challenged in some different areas. I trust that we’ll work through it the right way.”</p>
