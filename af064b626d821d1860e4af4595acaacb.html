<h1>Pro Football Focus: Steelers should spend money on TE Hunter Henry instead of Bud Dupree</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the Steelers’ biggest offseason questions is whether they will sign linebacker Bud Dupree to a new contract or let him enter free agency. If Pro Football Focus had its way, Dupree would be in another uniform next season.</p>
<p>The analytics-heavy site released its <a href="https://www.pff.com/news/nfl-2020-free-agency-preview-players-to-target-plans-of-action-potential-cuts-32-teams" target="_blank">2020 free agency preview</a> Monday, and they seem to have a better idea of how they feel the Steelers should spend their money.</p>
<p>Their main argument against bringing back Dupree — who <a href="https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/D/DuprAl00.htm" target="_blank">had a career year</a> in 2019 with 11.5 sacks and four forced fumbles — was his inability to consistently pressure opposing quarterbacks. He came in at 65th among 102 edge rushers who pressured QBs at least 200 times last season, according to PFF data.</p>
<p>“That’s not someone you want to pay $14 million a year for when you are already in a bad spot with your cap space,” wrote PFF, referring to the meager $1.4 million in projected cap space the Steelers will probably be working with this offseason.</p>
<p>A more useful application of that Dupree money, according to PFF, is targeting Chargers tight end Hunter Henry. The Steelers’ tight end duo of Vance McDonald and Nick Vannett underperformed last year, and PFF thinks bringing in the <a href="https://sportsinjurypredictor.com/player/hunter-henry/7470" target="_blank">oft-injured Henry</a> on a “sub-$10 million contract” would be a better value than paying Dupree.</p>
<p>“Henry has had some bad injuries the past couple of seasons, but when he was healthy in 2016-17, he was behind only Rob Gronkowski and Travis Kelce in two-year receiving grade,” PFF wrote. “It’s hard telling how good [Ben Roethlisberger’s] arm will be coming back from his elbow surgery, so he’ll need all the weapons he can get.”</p>
<p>However they choose to spend their money, the Steelers are at an immense free-agency disadvantage in terms of available cap space among their AFC North rivals. PFF projected that the Ravens will have $27.8 million of cap space in their war chest this offseason, the Bengals $44.7 million and the Browns a whopping $49.6 million.</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that PFF has Henry as a prime target for the Bengals, as well, who might need insurance at the tight end position for injury-prone incumbent Tyler Eifert.</p>
<p>The football world will see if the Steelers agree with PFF’s assessments of Dupree and Henry in a little over a month when NFL free agency kicks off on March 18.</p>
