<h1>Butler man arrested, charged with assault and riot during protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police on Thursday arrested a Butler man and charged him with committing multiple crimes during a protest last month.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, officers have evidence of Jordan Erdos, 20, attacking a KDKA-TV cameraman, throwing water bottles at police officers and breaking into stores during a May 30 protest in Pittsburgh against police brutality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Security cameras and other footage shows Mr. Erdos damaging a marked police car in front of PPG Paints Arena, the complaint reads. Afterwards, he allegedly kicked <a href="https://twitter.com/ismithkdka/status/1266843839890952193?lang=en" target="_blank">KDKA-TV cameraman Ian Smith</a> in the head after Mr. Smith fell to the ground after being punched in the face.</p>
<p>Later, cameras spotted Mr. Erdos breaking a window at a Wine and Spirits store on Fifth Avenue, the complaint says. Footage later showed him throwing water bottles at police officers on Smithfield Street, police allege.</p>
<p>Officials received a tip that identified Mr. Erdos and on Tuesday, a Pittsburgh detective and an FBI agent went to his grandparents’ home in Butler. “Erdos was gracious and wanted to speak” with investigators to “give his account of the events,” Detective Francesco Rosato wrote in the complaint. He went downtown to join the protest but got&nbsp;“caught up in the emotions,” he told police.</p>
<p>When investigators asked Mr. Erdos if he broke windows, he told them no, police said. When they asked Mr. Erdos if he threw things at police, he said no. When they asked about the cameraman who was attacked, Mr. Erdos said he tried to help Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>After authorities told Mr. Erdos that lying to the FBI is a federal offense, he walked back those statements, according to the complaint. Mr. Erdos then told investigators that he had kicked the marked police car, stating that he bruised his knuckles in a failed attempt to punch and break the headlight.</p>
<p>He said he saw people go after the cameraman because Mr. Smith was filming people damaging the car, and Mr. Erdos ran up and tried to kick him but missed, the complaint says. When asked why he would kick the cameraman, Mr. Erdos again told the investigators that Mr. Smith was filming people damaging the car. He did not respond when they told him there was video of him kicking Mr. Smith.</p>
<p>The complaint says Mr. Erdos also admitted to throwing&nbsp;“five to ten” water bottles at the police to&nbsp;“push them back.’ He also admitted to smashing the window of the Wine and Spirits store.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Mr. Erdos is set for July 13. He is facing charges of aggravated assault, riot, recklessly endangering another person and disorderly conduct.</p>
