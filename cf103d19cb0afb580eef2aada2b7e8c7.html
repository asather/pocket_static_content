<h1>Community and health care groups announce plans for 'breathtaking' homeless shelter in Downtown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong><em>This story will be updated.</em></strong></p>
<p>Various community coalitions and medical giants in Pittsburgh announced plans Tuesday for a 45,000-square-foot facility near Downtown that would provide shelter and other services for homeless individuals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the first time the groups have come together for such a project, which was researched for more than nine months, city officials said Tuesday. The building will be located on Second Avenue, adjacent to the Liberty Bridge, and will serve as a year-round, low-barrier shelter for adults and their pets. Partners include Action Housing,&nbsp;Allegheny Conference,&nbsp;Allegheny County,&nbsp;Allegheny Health Network, Mayor Bill&nbsp;Peduto’s office,&nbsp;DLA+ Architects,&nbsp;Hillman Family Foundation,&nbsp;Pittsburgh Mercy and Operation Safety Net,&nbsp;PJ Dick and PNC.</p>
<p>Longtime health care rivals UPMC and Highmark also are members of the joint effort. City leaders on Tuesday described the project as&nbsp;“breathtaking,” and an&nbsp;“incredible show of compassion and generosity.” Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the five-story establishment is designed for walk-ins, and will be a short- and long-term facility that will provide stable housing and resources to manage addictions.</p>
<p>“We have seen an increase in homelessness, especially Downtown, because that's where [most] services are,” Mr. Peduto said during a press conference Tuesday. “We see this happening in cities throughout the country, but what we don't see is the same level of collaboration. We all recognize that the safest place for a person who is struggling is not under a bridge ... .”</p>
<p>He added, “Policing is not how you solve these types of issues, building a facility like this is.”</p>
<p>But the idea is not entirely new. Nearly three years ago, Allegheny County human service officials issued a request for proposals seeking an agency to operate a “low-barrier” shelter that would reach people not being served at existing shelters.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Design and construction plans for the new building are expected to proceed imminently.&nbsp;Work is projected to be completed in January 2022. The facility will feature the following:</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Client services, including care for shelter, drop-in and single-room occupancy populations. The case management team will assess the needs and navigate to appropriate resources and supportive services, including a small clinic for physical and behavioral health services as well as alcohol and other drug treatment programs;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Drop-in Center with personal hygiene facilities, laundry, snacks and client services for individuals experiencing homelessness, but who are not necessarily staying at the facility;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;95 beds with room for 42 overflow beds in group sleeping rooms with dedicated personal hygiene facilities, living room and locker storage;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Mail services, important to those without a permanent address;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;A singular area to include lounges, a library and computer room, kitchen, dining and outdoor plaza space and seating;</p>
<p>●&nbsp;42 single-room occupancy units to facilitate transition to independent housing; and</p>
<p>●&nbsp;Adequate quiet room and support space, workstations and kitchenette for the staff serving this facility.</p>
<p>Progress will be tracked and measured toward outcomes that reduce chronic homelessness in the city, officials said.</p>
