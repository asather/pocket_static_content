<h1>Pitt comes up short in 59-56 loss to Virginia</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even in what could fairly and understandably be categorized as a down year for the program, playing against Virginia can feel like trying to run an offense in quicksand.</p>
<p>For much of its game Saturday against the Cavaliers, it looked as though Pitt would be swallowed by it. But even when the Panthers mustered the strength and resolve to rise up from it, they fell just short of ever truly escaping.</p>
<p>Xavier Johnson and Au’Diese Toney scored 16 and 13 points, respectively, to help Pitt nearly erase a 13-point deficit in the final four minutes, but an anemic offense for much of the afternoon was ultimately too much to overcome in a 59-56 loss at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>It was the Panthers’ fourth-consecutive loss, dropping them to 15-13 on the season only 10 days after it entered its Feb. 12 matchup against Clemson with a 15-9 record. It was also their fifth-consecutive loss against Virginia, which has won those contests by a combined margin of 93.</p>
<p>Though it wasn’t ignominious in the way previous setbacks against the Cavaliers have been in recent years -- a 66-37 loss in 2018 in what would be Kevin Stallings’ final home game as Pitt’s coach, a game in which his team had just seven points at halftime, stands out -- it was unsightly at times. At least for much of the afternoon, little came easy against a defense designed to do just that.</p>
<p>Against the No. 4 team nationally in defensive efficiency, the Panthers (15-13, 6-11 ACC) shot just 38.6% from the field and 20% from 3-point range, with their late charge making those numbers far more presentable. Pitt was able to make a sluggish Cavaliers (19-7, 11-5) offense uncomfortable, forcing 16 turnovers, six of them from point guard Kihei Clark, and getting 18 points off of those.</p>
<p>At halftime, the Panthers trailed by two and had scored 29 points on 30 possessions against a team of Virginia’s excellence defensively, a feat that was relatively astonishing given Pitt’s recent offensive ineptitude.</p>
<p>In those opening 20 minutes, it fared significantly better with Johnson on the court, which was far from a given. The sophomore point guard picked up his second foul with 12:09 remaining, at a point in the contest in which he already had five points and an assist, and sat for the next nine minutes. With him in the game, the Panthers had 20 points on 17 possessions, made six of their 13 shots and outscored Virginia, 20-17. Without him, they had nine points on 13 possessions, missed eight of their 12 shots and were outscored, 14-9.</p>
<p>Whatever traction or momentum Pitt gained in the first half disappeared as the second began -- even with Johnson on the court.</p>
<p>The Panthers missed 12 of their first 13 shots of the period, even going 6:05 without a point. As their opponent languished, the Cavaliers turned their narrow advantage into something significantly more comfortable, opening up a 13-point lead, 44-31, after a layup from Braxton Key with 12:18 remaining.</p>
<p>Right when the game appeared as though it had been lost -- and after some of the fans in attendance had already left the arena -- the Panthers showed they still had some life.</p>
<p>Pitt made a late push, getting a three-point play from Terrell Brown and a 3 from Trey McGowens in a span of just 14 seconds to get within seven, 54-47, with 3:12 left to play. That sequence of plays ignited a run in which the Panthers outscored Virginia, 15-5, to get within one shot of tying, or potentially even winning, the game.</p>
<p>Johnson was fouled on a made layup with 52 seconds remaining, but missed the ensuing free throw. Nonetheless, his team trailed by just two, 58-56, and forced a shot clock violation on the other end. With a chance to tie the game or take the lead, McGowens missed a step-back 3 with five seconds remaining.</p>
<p>Key made only one of two free throws after being fouled, giving Pitt another crack at an improbable win (or overtime period). However, the Panthers were unable to even get a shot off, as Johnson handed the ball off to teammate Ryan Murphy, who was unable to get a 3 off in time before the final horn sounded.</p>
<p>The Panthers return to action Wednesday against Syracuse, which will be the final home game of the regular season.</p>
