<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 04.27.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Happy Monday, folks. The NFL draft is over, which is one fewer thing to look forward to but now one more thing to talk about. How do you think the Steelers made out? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: And yes, I intentionally avoided having you all "grade" the draft. What's wrong with a good ol' rating every once in a while??</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Good morning BB. We passed on Cam Akers in the 2nd and Grabbed McFarland in the 4th. He seems like a change of pace guy similar to what we already have.....any thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Didn't love the pick. I could've understood using No. 49 on someone like Jonathan Taylor, but failing that, I would've been just fine steering clear of using any draft capital on a new RB. Not saying Anthony McFarland and Kerrith Whyte are the same player, but to me, they're fairly similar. Similar enough to do what I think the Steelers will want to use McFarland for, anyway.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: How many RB will be on the 2020 team? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good question, Gene! This is now such a crowded position. Last year they carried anywhere from 4-6. Only three halfbacks made it out of camp (James Conner, Benny Snell, Jaylen Samuels) and one fullback. But then throughout the year due to injuries, you saw the likes of Trey Edmunds and Kerrith Whyte on the 53. At this point, I'll say 4, plus fullback Derek Watt. And with a fourth-round pick used on McFarland, hard to see a roster spot for Whyte or Edmunds.</p>
<p><strong>AK</strong>: Was Reagor the Steelers first choice for WRs? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: We'll probably never know. But based on the <span style="font-style: italic;">type</span> of receiver they drafted, a bigger-bodied guy in Claypool, I'm guessing no. Otherwise, they could've reached for someone like Devin Duvernay or Lynn Bowden at 49, or tried to trade back.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: I look at this draft as a "we'll see how they produce" draft. Was very surprised they passed on Dobbins. Given how the draft broke down, what changes would you have made had you been drafting? (looking at who was available at the time) <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Aren't they all, seferg? At the top, I might've gone Denzel Mims over Claypool, but pretty much a coin flip. In the third, I probably would've addressed ILB over edge, but I like Alex Highsmith just fine and that's gonna become a theme in my answer here. Because at 124, I definitely take an inside linebacker over a running back. Basically, I just think they should've done more to shore up that position than just taking a potential hybrid safety type.</p>
<p><strong>JerseySteel</strong>: Hi Brian - what ILB's are on the roster besides Vince Williams, Devin Bush, and Ulysees Gilbert? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Robert Spillane, a special teams demon. And, uh, that's it, JerseySteel. They didn't even sign one from the XFL. But they did add John Houston from USC and Leo Lewis from Mississippi State as undrafted free agents, both of whom were productive backers in college.</p>
<p><strong>I Ride</strong>: Hey, great chats,you're far from a homer! Will Our Beloved Steelers bring in a FA Safety and ILB, seems to me they are still positions of need. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Thanks, friend. Yeah, those are the two biggest needs I see, as well. You might see quite a few more free-agent moves around the league now because after 4 pm today, any signings won't hurt teams in the compensatory draft pick formula. I do think the Steelers could use another experienced option at linebacker. What happens if Vince Williams gets hurt, let alone Devin Bush?</p>
<p><strong>Titan in Charlotte</strong>: Brian (and Ray) great coverage on draft day(s), do you know of any reasons why the Steelers didn’t pick up undrafted FA Thaddeus Moss? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Appreciate that, my Shaler brethren. But probably the same reason as he didn't get drafted, just not a lot of teams in love with his skill set at that size. Plus they're fairly well stocked at TE, with Vance McDonald, Eric Ebron and then Zach Gentry competing with practice squadders Kevin Rader/Christian Scotland-Williamson for the No. 3 spot. And even that might become more expendable if Derek Watt and/or Chase Claypool can do some TE things.</p>
<p><strong>JerManDu</strong>: What do you think the plan is for the middle of the DL. Lots of Ends, no NG of any note. My prediction is Tuitt moves to the middle. Ever meet him in person? He is gigantic, and moving to the middle might preserve his health and help the Stillers. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I have met Stephon Tuitt in-person, in interviews on the South Side while working my beat, the Pittsburgh Steelers. Even saw him at First Watch once while having breakfast. He's a large man. I didn't think nose tackle was a huge need going into this draft, and the Steelers seemingly agreed with me by waiting until the 7th round to take a DL. They aren't gonna play much base defense anyway, and when they do, sure, you could put him in the middle and Chris Wormley at end if those are your three best. But don't forget about Tyson Alualu either.</p>
<p><strong>Babe Parelli</strong>: Will the Steelers coaches finally use the FB position? Idk who was more over looked Nix or McCullers. What do you have to loose? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Oh yeah, paying Derek Watt more than $3 million a year tells me they're definitely going to use him more than Rosie Nix. Sure, part of that salary is for Watt's special team ability too, but they'll get him involved as a blocker. I think he might even be a better one than Nix, but we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>steelmann58</strong>: hey Brian do you think the steelers can look at veteran safety now that they don't apply to the compensation formula <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sure. If I were them, I'd be a little worried about bringing in another safety who can cover. Jordan Dangerfield, Marcus Allen and now Antoine Brooks are solid backups for playing strong safety, and even the XFL guy they brought in is thought to be more of a banger. If Minkah Fitzpatrick goes down, not sure who you're putting deep. Kam Kelly ain't walking through that door.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Hi Brian. What player drafted are you most excited a about? I know the popular choice will be Claypool but to me it's Dotson- really needed that infusion of old school nasty run blocking. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Certainly have to go with Chase Claypool as the most "exciting," the one who will be most fun to watch develop, but I do love the Kevin Dotson pick. Seems like a very high-floor player at a position where the Steelers have either neglected or just not been very good at drafting in the middle rounds recently.</p>
<p><strong>JohnnyD</strong>: Any chance they bring Barron back? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Doesn't sound like it, but you never say never. He'd still be an upgrade in terms of experience at that spot.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Maybe it's because we didn't have that big name, exciting first rounder to gush over, but why am I most excited about drafting a guard in the 4th? Rest of the draft.... meh! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Because he's the man! Kevin Dotson was by far the most engaging prospect we spoke with on Day 4, a guy the diehard Steelers fans will really like. Small school rep makes him easy to root for to begin with, and then he happens to be a fun quote, too. It's not hard at all to see why Kevin Colbert was completely comfortable with drafting him just off of game tape, a homemade workout video and FaceTime interviews.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Solid move to draft Claypool. Big, fast athletic vertical threat, just what the receiving corps needed. Glad he was available there. Plus all the good RB's were taken and Dobbins doesn't really give you much more than what we already have at RB. Your thoughts on the value of the Claypool pick compared to other options at 49? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah I thought it was great value. Was a bit surprised that WRs started flying off the board the way they did. Thought more teams would figure the class was so deep that they could get a bargain on a wideout later, but then I think the Bengals and Colts opening Round 2 with back-to-back WR picks probably changed the flow.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Brian I thought you asked Mr Tomlin &amp; Colbert a great question at the post draft conference call regarding Chuks. Mike responded with a resounding "yes" <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Check is in the mail, Paul. I should've phrased it better to not give Tomlin an alley for the one-word answer, but Colbert swooped in and saved the day a bit. Gotta be better now that I'm no longer a rookie.</p>
<p><strong>This Guy</strong>: Good draft but I was hoping they would find a long snapper who could also start at quarterback eventually in the 7th. But you don't always get what you want. Who did you want that the Steelers didn't pull the trigger on? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Great point, they missed the mark there. I think there were a few candidates. As far as WHO I thought they should've taken, I'll say Akeem Davis-Gaither, linebacker from Appalachian State. Was just surprised to see him still around when the Steelers made their comp pick, and would've been good value (based on projections) at a position of need.</p>
<p><strong>Alan F</strong>: Please clear up rumor mill making the rounds yesterday: did Pittsburgh offer (higher incentive) contract to Winston before he selected New Orleans? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I did see that on Twitter. Don't know if it's accurate or not, but keep in mind, like the JuJu-49ers rumor from last week that somehow caught fire, this didn't come from an Adam Schefter type or even established NFL beat reporter. I'm taking it with a very large grain of salt, put it that way.</p>
<p><strong>Jakester</strong>: Thanks for all of you draft coverage Brian. Appreciate all of the hard work. Looks like the Steelers are going to roll w Conner - how do you project the RB depth chart, and what happens if he gets injured (again)? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No problem, Jakester. They are going to roll with Conner, yes, but clearly putting at least a little bit of pressure on him with the McFarland pick. For what it's worth, Benny Snell was drafted exactly two spots ahead of McFarland the year before, so almost identical draft resources spent on each guy. At this point, I think Snell is the backup and would be the guy if Conner gets hurt, but I do think McFarland will get plenty of chances to prove his worth.</p>
<p><strong>JohnnyD</strong>: Where does Cam Newton end up? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Wish I knew. If you believe the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">report</span> tweet about the Steelers and Jameis Winston, maybe here! But in all seriousness, if I were a betting man, why not Denver? Seems like they're gonna give Drew Lock a go, but I wouldn't feel comfortable with him as my starter.</p>
<p><strong>The Ham</strong>: BB, I think Claypol would be a much more valuable WR to the Steelers if he could turn that 4.45 speed into being a legit deep threat. Current crop of WRs aren't really burners. Is Claypol a legit deep threat or more of the same type of WR as Juju, Dionte and James Washington. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Time will tell, but I think he will be a deep threat. And hey, maybe he doesn't play as fast as his 4.42 40 would indicate, but guess what? That's why you coach him up. Get him playing faster. As Colbert said Friday night, they know he ran that time. That number doesn't lie.</p>
<p><strong>Tbear</strong>: Disappointed in top draft choice. Mims was still available &amp; I thought he was a WR with separation ability. Also did not take a RB who could be a #1 back. What am I missing? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I'll stipulate that I did like Mims a little better, didn't expect him to be there at 49, so I do wonder why he fell so far? From watching both him and Claypool, plus reading scouting reports on them, they're similar prospects, from their height to their separation skills, or lack thereof. As for RB, I think Conner is still a #1 back. I know you can't count on his health, but hey, it's not like he tore his ACL or something. Get what you can out of him in 2020 and draft your next #1 back in 2021 when there's another good class coming out. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: By the way, I know you're all wondering, so that's my 2021 mock draft prediction for the Steelers: Clemson RB Travis Etienne.</p>
<p><strong>James</strong>: Hey Brian, now that the draft is over, it appears the Steelers feel Conner will be healthy as they didn’t take Dobbins or Akers. I would trade a 2021 fifth round pick for Fournette in case Conner gets injured again. What say you? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Ehh not sure I'm doing that deal now. McFarland can be a home run threat just as well. And I'm not ready to give up on Snell or even Samuels in his pass-catching role. It seems pretty clear by now that the Steelers weren't interested in dealing for Fournette.</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: Hello Brian: with the draft over, what’s the chance we take a shot at Shady McCoy? I would like to see that signing for the right price. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hello Michael. Same answer, if the Steelers wanted to go the veteran RB route, they wouldn't have used a fourth-rounder on McFarland. At least that's how I view it.</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: Everyone is jumping down the Steelers throat for not getting Lenoard Fournette. Supposedly the Bucs tried to trade him on Saturday but didn’t have any takers. If no team will trade a low pick for a good running back, there has to be more to it. Maybe locker room issues? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: He wasn't a model citizen in Jacksonville, no. Has tweeted a few questionable things, as well. Not saying that's all reason to not want him or any other guy on your team, just pointing out that there would've been some potentially unwanted headlines with him.</p>
<p><strong>ASIANGOLFERMAN</strong>: How can the ravens get 6 picks in rounds 1-3 for a total of 10 picks! They are lapping the Steelers! You need to stay young and cheap in this league! We have to stop making stupid picks like the 5th round for Vannett last year- one and done year with no production! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don't disagree, ASIANGOLFERMAN. The Vannett trade was curious at the time and has not aged well.</p>
<p><strong>JaySki</strong>: Does the new RB we drafted have any relation to Booger? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No. I actually asked him about that at the combine in Indy. He said he gets mistaken for being his son all the time. Kinda makes me wonder why you'd go by Anthony McFarland Jr., but hey, that's cool.</p>
<p><strong>Marnie</strong>: Of the draft picks, the one i don't get is RB McFarland with the first pick in the 4th. seems like Dri Archer 2.0 including the maturity concerns. Considering under Tomlin, he famously likes to use a RB "until the wheels fall off", are the Steelers philosophy changing to a RB by committee? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They already began introducing a committee a bit more last year. I think that'll continue even more, though you could see McFarland used in some more interesting ways, especially with his old college OC Matt Canada on the Steelers' offensive coaching staff now.</p>
<p><strong>BatonRouge Steeler</strong>: With Ben back at the helm, wouldn't you think Chase Claypool will assume the 4th WR spot in those 4 and 5 WR sets?? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hey, he might challenge James Washington for an outside role sooner than later. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK comrades, that's time. As always, we had an abundance of questions left over. My apologies, but you might see some of them pop up in my weekly mailbag Thursday, especially if you used a real name. Have a great week.</p>
