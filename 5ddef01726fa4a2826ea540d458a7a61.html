<p>WASHINGTON — As Pennsylvania this week begins to allow some businesses to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, customers could confront long lines as social distancing restrictions limit the number of patrons allowed to shop at any given time.</p>
<p>At Walmart and other essential retail outlets, those lines are already a reality and can put at risk seniors and people with disabilities, Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., wrote on Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, the top Democrat on the Senate Special Committee on Aging, led <a href="https://www.aging.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/4.27.20%20Letter%20to%20Walmart%20CEO%20re%20Disability%20Accomodations.pdf" target="_blank">a Senate letter sent to Walmart</a>&nbsp;that called for the nation’s largest retailer to&nbsp;provide&nbsp;priority access to those vulnerable customers&nbsp;and to install appropriately spaced chairs or benches as an outside waiting area.</p>
<p>“During these unprecedented times, unprecedented measures must be taken,” Mr. Casey wrote, joined by seven other senators, including Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio. “Walmart must consider the needs of seniors and people with disabilities and do its part to protect&nbsp;the health and safety of customers.”</p>
<p>The letter noted that many people cannot physically stand for a lengthy period of time — yet they face risks in repeated trips to the store.</p>
<p>“This&nbsp;leaves them with the unthinkable decision to leave the line and attempt to return to the store at a&nbsp;different time when the line may be shorter, which would increase their potential exposure to&nbsp;COVID-19,” the senators wrote.</p>
<p>Walmart did not immediately respond to a request for comment Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey also has called for <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/16/food-stamps-SNAP-Congress-USDA-groceries-online-purchasing/stories/202004140010?cid=search" target="_blank">an increase food stamp benefits</a> and greater investment in online grocery delivery for food stamp recipients. Walmart is the only retailer with physical locations in Western Pennsylvania that allows online ordering for food stamp recipients. Amazon and ShopRite, a New Jersey-based grocer with locations only in southeastern Pennsylvania, also allow it.</p>
<p>In Monday’s letter, Mr. Casey praised Walmart for taking steps providing dedicated store hours and contact-less pick-up options.</p>
