<h1>Trump: Aid talks, campaign events back on track </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House boosted its offer in up-and-down COVID-19 aid talks Friday in hopes of an agreement before Election Day, even as President Donald Trump’s most powerful GOP ally in the Senate said Congress is unlikely to deliver relief by then.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump on Friday tweeted: “Covid Relief Negotiations are moving along. Go Big!” </p>
<p>The president and his team then laid out an aggressive return to political activities, including a big White House event Saturday and a rally in Florida on Monday, a week after his hospitalization for the coronavirus that has killed more than 210,000 Americans.</p>
<p>As questions linger about his health — and Democratic opponent Joe Biden steps up his own campaigning — Mr. Trump planned to leave Washington for the first time since he was hospitalized. He is also increasing his radio and TV appearances with conservative interviewers, hoping to make up for lost time with just over three weeks until Election Day and millions already voting.</p>
<p>The president has not been seen in public — other than in White House-produced videos — since his return days ago from the military hospital where he received experimental treatments for the virus.</p>
<p>Two weeks after his Rose Garden event that has been labeled a “super-spreader” for the virus, Mr. Trump is planning to convene another large crowd outside the White House Saturday on a law-and-order theme. Mr. Trump will address the group, expected to be at least several hundred supporters, from the White House balcony. All attendees are to be required to bring masks or will be provided with them, and also will be given temperature checks and asked to fill out a brief questionnaire. Following Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, including mask-wearing and social distancing, will be strongly encouraged.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s Monday rally in Sanford, Fla., was originally scheduled to be held on Oct. 2, the day after he tested positive.</p>
<p>Announcement of the new event came as Dr. Anthony Fauci, the government’s top infectious disease expert, cautioned the White House again to avoid large-scale gatherings of people without masks.</p>
<p>District of Columbia virus restrictions prohibit outdoor gatherings larger than 50 people, although that rule has not been strictly enforced. Masks are mandatory outdoors for most people, but the regulations don’t apply on federal land, and the Trump White House has flouted them for months.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a top economic adviser said the Trump team was upping its offer in advance of a Friday conversation between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The two spoke for more than 30 minutes Friday afternoon, said Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill.</p>
<p>A GOP aide familiar with the offer said it is about $1.8 trillion, with a key state and local fiscal relief component moving from $250 billion to at least $300 billion. The White House says its most recent prior offer was about $1.6 trillion. The aide requested anonymity because the negotiations are private.</p>
<p>“I would like to see a bigger stimulus package than either the Democrats or Republicans are offering,” Mr. Trump said on Rush Limbaugh’s radio show Friday. Earlier this week, Mr. Trump lambasted Democrats for their demands on an aid bill.</p>
<p>Ms. Pelosi’s most recent public offer was about $2.2 trillion, though that included a business tax increase that Republicans won’t go for.</p>
<p>But GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told an audience in Kentucky that he doesn’t see a deal coming together soon out of a “murky” situation in which the participants in the negotiations are elbowing for political advantage.</p>
<p>“I’d like to see us rise above that like we did in March and April, but I think it’s unlikely in the next three weeks,” Mr. McConnell said. He said later that “the first item of priority of the Senate is the Supreme Court,” suggesting there isn’t time to both process a COVID relief bill and the nomination of Judge Amy Coney Barrett before the election.</p>
<p>He spoke after Mr. Trump apparently performed an about-face, empowering Mr. Mnuchin to resume negotiations with Ms. Pelosi, D-Calif., on a larger, comprehensive coronavirus relief package despite calling off the talks just days before.</p>
<p>White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow told reporters Friday that “developments are positive” and that “the bid and the offer have narrowed” in advance of a the telephone conversation later Friday between Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Mnuchin.</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell remains a skeptic that a deal can happen— and he has issued private warnings that many Senate Republicans will oppose a deal in the range that Ms. Pelosi is seeking.</p>
<p>“We do need another rescue package,” Mr. McConnell said. “But the proximity to the election and the differences about what is need at this particular juncture are pretty vast.”</p>
<p>Later Friday, during an appearance in Tompkinsville, Ky., Mr. McConnell said, “I don’t know whether we’ll get another [virus relief] package or not.”</p>
<p>Mr. McConnell’s remarks capped a tumultuous week in which Mr. Trump sent conflicting signals and made unworkable demands. On Tuesday, he ordered an end to the weekslong talks after being told that few Republicans in Congress would end up voting for a possible Pelosi-Mnuchin deal.</p>
<p>After taking blowback for that decision, Mr. Trump sought to revive the negotiations Thursday. Yet even as Mr. Mnuchin was re-engaging with Ms. Pelosi, staffers in the White House — working under chief of staff Mark Meadows, a key negotiator — were issuing demands for a smaller package stuffed with Mr. Trump’s priorities.</p>
