<h1>Turzai endorses West Point grad, GOP conservative stalwart as his replacement  </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It took less than 24 hours for Republicans in Western Pennsylvania to decide on a front-runner for outgoing House Speaker Mike Turzai’s North Hills legislative seat.</p>
<p>They’ve assembled behind Rob Mercuri, a West Point graduate and Iraq War veteran who —&nbsp;like Mr. Turzai —&nbsp;talks glowingly of lowering taxes, removing regulations and allowing the economy to “flourish and grow.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mercuri, 38, of Pine, began his campaign for the 28th District this past week on a set of values and political positions he deems “very consistent” with Mr. Turzai’s.</p>
<p>It’s because of those principles that he won the immediate endorsement of Mr. Turzai, who announced on Thursday that he won’t be seeking re-election to a tenth term and instead will seek a job in the private sector.</p>
<p>Calling himself a “trained leader of character” who has a desire to serve, Mr. Mercuri, currently a vice president and financial risk manager for PNC, noted that he wants to focus on creating an atmosphere in which the private sector can thrive.</p>
<p>“[The 28th is] a district that has done extremely well. It has a lot of momentum going into this new decade,” Mr. Mercuri said. “I would like to continue that momentum and pro-growth, low-tax policies would be my priority.”</p>
<p>The race for the district, which includes the North Hills suburbs of Bradford Woods, Franklin Park, McCandless, Marshall and Pine, officially will begin on Tuesday when candidates can start circulating their nominating petitions.</p>
<p>The only other declared candidate is Emily Skopov, a television writer and nonprofit founder who is pursuing the Democratic nomination. Ms. Skopov lost to Mr. Turzai in 2018, but was the first of the incumbent’s many challengers to come within 10 points.</p>
<p>Democrats will need to flip nine Republican seats to take back the House majority, a prospect that Mr. Mercuri said would not change his goals.</p>
<p>“If I were to be elected, I would be part of building a coalition to represent strong conservative values in the House,” Mr. Mercuri said. “But we would also want to extend the hand of friendship and bipartisanship to work with our fellow legislators.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mercuri said he expects the 2020 presidential election cycle to help down-ballot Republicans, and that it will be his goal to fire up the GOP base, then extend the base from there.</p>
<p>Asked about Mr. Turzai not committing to finishing out the remainder of his term, Mr. Mercuri said it doesn’t change his strategy.</p>
<p>“If and when I become the nominee, I’ll be running hard,” Mr. Mercuri said. “If there’s a special election in between, it’ll be the same mindset.”</p>
