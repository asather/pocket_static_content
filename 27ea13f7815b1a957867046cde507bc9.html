<h1>Post-Gazette honored for coverage of Amish, Mennonites</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Post-Gazette has been honored with two national&nbsp;<a href="https://www.religioncommunicators.org/wilbur-awards" target="_blank">Wilbur Awards</a> — awarded by the Religion Communicators Council for faith-related reporting&nbsp;— for its 2019&nbsp;<a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coverings/mennonite-amish-sexual-abuse-forgiveness-in-their-communities/" target="_blank">“Coverings”</a>&nbsp;series&nbsp;about sexual abuse among Amish and Mennonites.</p>
<p>The contest jurors awarded Wilburs to the Post-Gazette in the digital category for multimedia and in the newspaper category for publications outside of the top 15 metro markets.</p>
<p>In “Coverings” — a six-part series by photographer Stephanie Strasburg, religion writer Peter Smith and public-safety reporter Shelly Bradbury&nbsp; — the Post-Gazette reported on its findings from a multistate investigation into sexual abuse among one of America’s most reclusive religious movements.</p>
<p>Current and former members of conservative Mennonite and Amish communities told of their experiences in a separatist, patriarchal culture in which victims of sexual abuse have been pressured to reconcile with their predators, placing them at further risk. The Post-Gazette also interviewed leaders of the self-described Plain churches who acknowledged past failings and said they have begun to cooperate with law enforcement and child protective services.</p>
<p>The Religion Communicators Council will be presenting Wilbur Awards in 23 categories at its awards banquet on March 20 in Arlington, Va. Other winners include The Associated Press, Los Angeles Times, CBS News and Al Jazeera English.</p>
<p>The council has presented the awards annually since 1949.</p>
<p>The award is named for the late Marvin C. Wilbur, a pioneer in religious public relations, longtime council leader and former Presbyterian Church executive.</p>
