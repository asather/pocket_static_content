<h1>Heinz Endowments approves $7 million to address racial inequity, criminal justice reform </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Heinz Endowments has approved nearly $7 million in grants focused on equity issues including criminal justice reform and a range of initiatives that support blacks and other minorities.</p>
<p>The endowments, which is Pittsburgh’s second-largest philanthropy and generates about $70 million in grants annually, said the new round of equity awards are separate from the millions of dollars it has channeled recently into COVID-19 relief.</p>
<p>But Grant Oliphant, the endowments president, acknowledged the pandemic is “exacerbating issues of poverty and racial inequality in our community.”</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Allegheny County Council passed a motion designating racism as a public health crisis and two members of Pittsburgh City Council proposed a task force to monitor how race and equity factor into the local response to the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We will never be able to create the resilient community of the future that we strive for unless we address directly the deep issues of inequity that afflict our community and our nation,” said Mr. Oliphant.</p>
<p>A total $6.77 million in grants approved by the endowments’ board Tuesday includes $2.3 million in funding for criminal justice reform.</p>
<p>Those grants are part of the Restoration Project -- a three-year, $10-million initiative launched in 2018.</p>
<p>The largest of those grants is $400,000 to Penn State University for Project Giving Adolescents Meaningful Experiences, an initiative that supports students leaving a court-ordered, juvenile probation who want to transition to jobs or college.</p>
<p>A grant of $350,000 to the University of Pittsburgh is for research about disparities in the Allegheny County criminal justice system.</p>
<p>The county’s Court of Common Pleas-Family Division will receive $350,000 for redesign, upgraded technology and other improvements; and the county’s Office of the Public Defender will receive $250,000 for advocacy in indigent defense, juvenile justice and public policy.</p>
<p>Carmen Anderson, chief equity officer for the endowments, said the Restoration Project grants target issues such as legal representation, jail diversion and research into root causes of racial disparities.</p>
<p>“We believe that addressing reform on multiple fronts can leverage momentum in the county and increase opportunities for changing the system, ultimately making it fairer,” she said.</p>
<p>The balance of the equity grants, $4.4 million, focuses on support for nonprofits addressing equity issues.</p>
<p>The largest, $500,000, will go to the Forbes Funds for its efforts to help nonprofits focus on equity and inclusion.</p>
<p>Other large grants include $400,000 to Locally Grown for a business accelerator and community center in Wilkinsburg; $250,000 to the Poise Foundation for the Advanced Leadership Initiative -- a program that trains and mentors black leaders for executive roles; and $200,000 to the Borealis Philanthropy for the Disability Inclusion Fund.</p>
