<h1>Pirates mailbag: Will Pirates ever make a move to excite fans?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to the the first Pirates mailbag of 2020. We've decided that Jason Mackey will handle the weekly chats and yours truly will man the mailbag. Please send your questions to nwilborn@post-gazette.com or Twitter @nwilborn19</em></p>
<p><em>While the Pirates have been busy hiring a new manager, coaching staff, general manager, and other front office personnel, they've been mostly quiet when it comes to signing players. Fans are concerned, and that leads us to our first question.</em></p>
<p><strong>Justin Dunio:</strong> Do the Pirates have a plan to win back the fans? With one of the lowest payrolls in baseball last season, they clearly showed holes on the roster they neglected to address. To this point, they don't seem committed to a total rebuild, yet they aren't spending money to contend. What should we expect this season?</p>
<p><strong>Nubyjas Wilborn:</strong> First, they needed to realize how severe the problem was. Owner Bob Nutting and team president Travis Williams both expressed a commitment to being accountable to fans. Some fans will be willing to give them an opportunity. A lot of fans are tired of talk. They're making some improvements to the ballpark, which will make the fan experience better. They did a great job in hiring talented people. However, at some point, they need to sign more talent on the field. I don't expect a total rebuild. They'll likely try to trade Starling Marte. They'll possibly move Adam Frazier. As far as what to expect this season? It appears that they're going into the season with most of the roster that won 69 games in 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Harold Meyer:</strong> What do you think about the Astros and Red Sox scandals?</p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> Where do I start? It's an embarrassment for the teams involved and for Major League Baseball. I think the punishment was the best that Rob Manfred could do. A lot of people believe that the Astros should get stripped of their 2017 championship, but I don't see what good it would do. We still know the Astros won. But they'll have to live with the stink of cheating. The next question is what will happen to Carlos Beltran? If you're the Mets, it's going to be hard to justify keeping him.</p>
<p><strong>Madison Thomas:</strong> We've talked a lot about the rough moments of 2018. What did you enjoy about covering the team last year?</p>
<p><strong>Wilborn:</strong> There were a lot of good moments, starting with Garth Brooks coming to spring training for two weeks. He was so kind and generous with his time, and it was fun to see him interact with fans and the team. Josh Bell's first half, especially the month of May, was entertaining to cover. It felt like Bell hit a home run every day the whole month. The rise of Bryan Reynolds was high on the list, as well. Reynolds went from an unknown by most Pirates fans to having one of the best rookie seasons in baseball. Kevin Newman became a solid player after many people soured on him. Lastly, getting to know Steve Blass was a treat. My first season covering the Pirates was his 60th as a member of the organization. My second story on the beat was writing off his press conference that announced his retirement, and he was very gracious to me as I was learning the ropes. I'll miss seeing him at the ballpark.</p>
