<p>A student staying in a West Virginia University residence hall has tested positive for COVID-19, the university announced Sunday.</p>
<p>The student is staying at the <a href="https://housing.wvu.edu/conference/housing/evansdale-residential-complex" target="_blank">Evansdale Residential Complex</a>. All of the residents in that hall have been ordered to remain in self-quarantine until they receive test results.</p>
<p>Residents living in the hall and employees who work there will begin testing Monday morning, the university said. The cafe, community restrooms and gathering areas at the complex are undergoing a deep clean.</p>
<p>“In addition, a care package with a mask, gloves and cleaning supplies will be delivered to each resident’s room later this evening,” a statement from the university said. Meals will be delivered to residents beginning Monday.</p>
<p>It is not clear how many students currently reside in the 1,800-capacity complex.</p>
<p>The Monongalia County Health Department is beginning contact tracing and alerting people who have recently been in contact with the student.</p>
