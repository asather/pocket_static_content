<h1>Allegheny County faces legal threats, audits over voting rolls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>By design, Allegheny County's system of maintaining its voter rolls must strike a delicate balance between preventing fraud and protecting the right to vote. But less than four months out from the 2020 primary elections, it finds itself at the center of a complex universe of audits, legal threats and misinformation.</p>
<p>According to one conservative group's review of federal data, flaws in the county's voter registration list risk dirtying the electoral process —&nbsp;though its interpretation of facts are under dispute. Meanwhile, an audit by the auditor general in Pennsylvania claimed the county’s records hold a lion's share of registered active voters who should have been deemed inactive.</p>
<p>But the truth is more nuanced, and although the extent of the county’s record-keeping accuracy is facing scrutiny, all sides agree there’s room for improvement in the way Pennsylvania’s 67 counties collaborate with the state —&nbsp;a system that currently involves the counties feeding registration lists into an outdated system that’s in the process of being overhauled.</p>
<p>“The Department of State takes the accuracy of Pennsylvania voter rolls very seriously,” Pennsylvania Department of State spokeswoman Wanda Murren said. “We have made and continue to make improvements in the processes that keep the rolls up to date. Our monitoring shows that county election staff are diligent in their efforts to carry out voter list procedures according to state and federal law.”</p>
<p>Under state and federal law, Allegheny County is required to maintain its voter rolls by cancelling registrations upon written request, or if it’s notified that a voter has died or moved out of state.</p>
<p>If a voter hasn’t cast a ballot in five years, the county is supposed to send them a notice, and if the voter fails to respond by mailing, they’re marked inactive —&nbsp;a status in which they’ll remain until they vote or update their info. After two consecutive general election cycles under the inactive status, their registration should be cancelled by the county.</p>
<p>Allegheny County owns its own registration records, but federal law requires Pennsylvania to ensure that the data —&nbsp;entered into the state-run Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors system (SURE) —&nbsp;is accurate and secure, and that the county is making a “reasonable effort to remove registrants who are ineligible to vote,” according to federal law.</p>
<p><strong>The state audit</strong></p>
<p>The state’s oversight was the topic of an audit conducted by Auditor General Eugene DePasquale in December that found more than 50,000 purported cases of potentially inaccurate voter records statewide, among more than 8.5 million registered voters as of Oct. 9, 2018.</p>
<p>The records in question, which Mr. DePasquale deemed at the time “too many instances of potentially bad data and sloppy recordkeeping,” included 24,000 where the same driver’s license number was listed in multiple voter records, 14,000 that shared other unique information including names and dates-of-birth and 3,000 of potentially deceased voters matching health department files.</p>
<p>“We have millions of voters in Pennsylvania, and we found instances of potential data problems that are less than 1 percent. That is a very small percentage of potential bad information,” Mr. DePasquale said in a December press conference, acknowledging in his report that the potential failures could stem from simple state oversight issues to counties not being able to complete list maintenance due to special elections.</p>
<p>But, Mr. DePasquale added, “Hillary Clinton lost Pennsylvania to Donald Trump by about 44,000 votes, which means even less than 1 percent is still a big number in our state.”</p>
<p>In its official response to the audit, the Pennsylvania Department of State noted that it began discussions with Mr. DePasquale in November 2017 with the stated objective to prepare to transition to a new voter registration system. The current system, the state department wrote, is “reaching the end of its useable life,” and the need to replace it was one of the reasons it requested the audit in the first place —&nbsp;something that the auditor general’s report acknowledged as well.</p>
<p>But the state department took issue with some of the auditor general’s specific findings, alleging that the audit incorrectly flagged thousands of records and didn’t allow them the time to verify them for accuracy, which they said they’re working on now.</p>
<p>The new system, though, will “require data validation measures to reduce the likelihood of data entry errors,” the state’s response continued. A spokeswoman for the state said the “rough timeline” is to have counties begin using the new system in late 2021 or early 2022.</p>
<p>In response to Mr. DePasquale calling for the state to work better with the counties to improve accuracy and oversight, the department wrote that it provides counties with “multiple tools” for maintaining the lists, including access to a national system that tracks address changes.</p>
<p>Beyond its analysis of statewide numbers, the auditor general’s report also claimed there are about 96,000 active registered voters in Pennsylvania who haven’t voted, changed addresses or changed parties in the last five years, records that it said “likely should have been placed into inactive status.”</p>
<p>Almost 44% of those —&nbsp;about 42,000 records in total —&nbsp;were in Allegheny County, according to the audit.</p>
<p>Dave Voye, manager of elections for Allegheny County, said the auditor general’s figures are “probably correct” and based on data from 2018, a year in which there were five elections in the county that resulted in some list maintenance processes being “pushed back.” Under state and federal law, voter records cannot be altered —&nbsp;and mailings cannot be sent —&nbsp;within 90 days of an election.</p>
<p>“These voters would have been made inactive in 2019, if they did not respond to the five-year notification mailing,” Mr. Voye said.</p>
<p><strong>Threatened lawsuit</strong></p>
<p>Allegheny County’s records also have faced scrutiny from the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which has threatened a lawsuit over its allegedly inaccurate voter rolls.</p>
<p>In a warning letter to the county, the group’s lawyer wrote that Allegheny has likely violated the National Voter Registration Act by “removing only 72 voter registrations in the last two-year reporting period[s] on the grounds that the registrants failed to respond to an address confirmation notice and failed to vote in two consecutive federal elections” —&nbsp;which the group deemed an “absurdly low figure for a county of this size” and likely symbolic of its noncompliance with federal law.</p>
<p>Data from the federal Election Assistance Commission, which Judicial Watch says it assessed to reach its conclusions, shows that between the 2016 and 2018 general elections, Allegheny County indeed reported removing 72 voters for their failure to respond to five-year notices and vote in two subsequent federal elections.</p>
<p>But the data also shows that the county removed about 30,000 voters from the rolls total in that time frame, including nearly 9,000 who moved outside the jurisdiction and more than 20,000 who died.</p>
<p>Robert D. Popper, an attorney for Judicial Watch who signed the warning letter to the county, said the group isn’t disputing that Allegheny County removed 30,000 total, but that the removal of 72 voters for failure to respond “doesn’t cut it” for a county that big.</p>
<p>Judicial Watch also is claiming in its threatened legal action that the county has an “implausibly high registration rate of 98%,” which suggests it’s not effectively removing voters who have died or moved.</p>
<p>David Becker, executive director and founder of the Center for Election Innovation &amp; Research, said Judicial Watch’s math is flawed because it’s adding active voters to the total number of inactive records already flagged by the county as potentially ineligible. Then it claims that because the number exceeds the number of citizens, it’s not removing records fast enough.</p>
<p>The inactive list, in most cases, contains “legacy records” of people who aren’t likely to show up to vote, Mr. Becker said. Under federal law, states are required to keep inactive records over two federal election cycles, a “buffer period” to prevent disenfranchising voters, he added.</p>
<p>“What [Judicial Watch is] trying to say is, you’ve got 101 percent of your eligible voting population registered, and that can’t be right so there must be fraud,” Mr. Becker said. “What I’m saying is: everything about that statement is wrong. You don’t have 101 percent. These are records reflecting people who have almost certainly moved away and will not show up to vote.”</p>
<p>In its report delivered to Congress last year, the commission specifically stated that “some states appear to have registration rates that exceed 100 percent of the state’s [citizen voting age population] because of the long time-period involved in removing ineligible voting records required by [federal law.]”</p>
<p>“It is inevitable that registration rolls will contain some number of voter records for individuals who are no longer eligible,” the commission’s report reads.</p>
<p>Mr. Popper said active and inactive registrations both have to be considered and counted, because those inactive voters can still cast ballots on Election Day.</p>
<p>“By our take, by what I think is the common sense take, if you have a voter registration which allows someone to go into a polling place and cast a vote at an address, that’s the registration number you count when you’re looking at the total registrations in a county,” Mr. Popper said. “if you believe Dave Becker’s argument, you ignore that.”</p>
<p>But if an inactive voter does try to vote, there are precautions in place to ensure their eligibility. In Allegheny County, voters who have been marked “inactive” —&nbsp;who show up on Election Day to vote —&nbsp;must sign an affirmation notice under the penalty of perjury confirming their address.</p>
<p>Mr. Voye added that the large student population in the county, “which is highly transient,” leads to higher numbers, and, like Mr. Becker, pointed to about 69,000 inactive voters on the list “in advance of them being removed.”</p>
<p>“We expect those registrations to be canceled in the very near future,” Mr. Voye said. “It’s not as simple as just looking at the number.”</p>
<p>The group is asking the county to take steps to comply with the NVRA and remove ineligible voter registrations within 90 days, noting that the NVRA requires jurisdictions to “take reasonable efforts” to remove ineligible registrations.</p>
<p>Allegheny County officials said their law department is looking into Judicial Watch’s letter and considering if action needs to be taken.</p>
<p>Ms. Murren said the state, too, is reviewing Judicial Watch’s information and checking it against their own data.</p>
<p>“Claims that there are widespread problems with the voter records are just wrong,” Ms. Murren said. “We are currently carrying out a review of the specific claims made by Judicial Watch. Our initial look indicates there is absolutely no basis for their claims.”</p>
