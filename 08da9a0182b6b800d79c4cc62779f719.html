<p>NEW YORK — “Good Morning America” host George Stephanopoulos announced Monday morning on his show that he has tested positive for coronavirus, more than a week after his wife was diagnosed.</p>
<p>“I’ve never had a fever, never had chills, never had a headache, never had a cough, never had shortness of breath,” he said on “GMA.” “I’m feeling great.”</p>
<p>He said the only potential symptoms he has felt were a lower back ache that he had attributed to a hard workout, and a briefly diminished sense of smell.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos, 59, said it came as “no surprise” that he got coronavirus after his wife, actress Ali Wentworth, tested positive.</p>
<p>The couple, along with their two daughters, 14-year-old Harper and 17-year-old Elliott, had been self-isolating at home in New York, with Wentworth quarantined to her own room.</p>
<p>“We are basically acting to the outside world as if we have it,” Stephanopoulos, a former White House communications director under President Bill Clinton, said on “GMA” last Thursday. “We are staying inside the house. I am the only one who goes in and out. Somebody does have to take care of her. That’s me. But so far I feel fine and I am not showing any symptons.”</p>
<p>Wentworth, 55, described her symptoms when she revealed her diagnosis, including a “high fever, horrific body aches and heavy chest.”</p>
<p>The vast majority of TV personalities who have live programs are now working out of their homes to protect employees and slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>CNN host Chris Cuomo has been undergoing a public battle with the disease, continuing his show despite a rough case. But Stephanopoulos provides a new example for the television viewing public of a relatively asymptomatic case.</p>
<p>New York has become the epicenter of the pandemic. The state's death toll since the outbreak began reached 9,385 on Saturday.</p>
<p>Stephanopoulos’ diagnosis comes nearly a week after ABC News suffered a coronavirus-related fatality as longtime "Good Morning America" camera operator Tony Greer died from complications related to COVID-19 on April 7.</p>
