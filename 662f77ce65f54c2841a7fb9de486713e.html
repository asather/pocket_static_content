<h1> U.S. bars foreigners coming from China for now over virus fear </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday declared a public health emergency and took drastic steps to significantly restrict entry into the country because of a new virus that hit China and has spread to other nations.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has signed an order that will temporarily bar foreign nationals, other than immediate family of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, who have traveled in China within the last 14 days. The new restrictions, which take effect at 5 p.m. on Sunday, were announced by Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, who is coordinating the U.S. response.</p>
<p>“It is likely that we will continue to see more cases in the United States in the coming days and weeks, including some limited person-to-person transmissions,” Mr. Azar said. “The American public can be assured the full weight of the U.S. government is working to safeguard the health and safety of the American people.”</p>
<p>Americans returning from China will be allowed into the country, but they will face screening at select ports of entry and be required to undertake 14 days of self-screening to ensure they don’t pose a health risk. Those returning from Hubei province, the center of the outbreak, will be subject to up to 14 days of mandatory quarantine.</p>
<p>Beginning Sunday, the U.S. will also begin funneling all flights to the U.S. from China to seven major airports where passengers can be screened for illness.</p>
<p>The virus has infected almost 10,000 people globally in just two months, a troublesome sign that prompted the World Health Organization to declare the outbreak a global emergency. The death toll stood at 213, including 43 new fatalities, all in China.</p>
<p>A public health emergency in the U.S. allows the government to tap additional resources to send to states, such as emergency funding and if necessary drugs or equipment from the national stockpile, and to suspend certain legal requirements.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said that while the risk in the U.S. is low, “I want to emphasize that this is a significant global situation and it continues to evolve.”</p>
<p>There are seven cases of this virus in the U.S.; all were travelers, except for a Chicago man who caught it from his wife, who had been in China.</p>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci, infectious diseases chief at the National Institutes of Health, said one reason the U.S. stepped up its quarantine measures was an alarming report from Germany that a traveler from China had spread the virus despite showing no symptoms. Dr. Fauci contrasted it with the response to recent outbreaks of Ebola, which can’t be spread unless someone is very ill.</p>
<p>At the same time, federal health authorities were recognizing that the test they’re using to detect the virus isn’t always dependable. Dr. Redfield said when it was used on some of the people in isolation, they’d test positive one day and negative another.</p>
<p>Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown University public health law expert, said putting a large number of people under quarantine “is virtually unprecedented in modern American history.”</p>
<p>The last time the U.S. government ordered a quarantine was in 1963, when a woman named Ellen Siegel was held in quarantine for up to 14 days because she did not present a valid certificate of vaccination against smallpox. Siegel had visited Sweden when it still had a case of smallpox and, although she had been revaccinated about two months earlier, the vaccination was said to be unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Declaring a public health emergency “gives HHS added powers and is warranted. Quarantine of those returning from Hubei is also reasonable given the high risk of exposure to coronavirus in that province,” Mr. Gostin said.</p>
<p>Deputy Secretary of State Steve Biegun offered America’s “deepest compassion” to the Chinese, noting that the deadly outbreak came during the peak of their holiday season, when everyone would ordinarily be celebrating and not living in fear of contracting the virus.</p>
<p>The announcement came hours after the State Department issued a level 4 “Do Not Travel” advisory, the highest grade of warning, and told Americans in China to consider departing using commercial means. “Travelers should be prepared for travel restrictions to be put into effect with little or no advance notice,” the advisory said.</p>
<p>Hours later, Delta Air Lines and American Airlines announced they were suspending all flights between the U.S. and China, joining several international carriers that have stopped flying to China as the virus outbreak continues to spread.</p>
<p>China counted 9,692 confirmed cases Friday, the vast majority in Hubei province.</p>
<p>The National Health Commission reported 171 cases of people who have been “cured and discharged from hospital.” WHO has said most people who got the illness had milder cases, though 20% experienced severe symptoms. Symptoms include fever and cough, and in severe cases, shortness of breath and pneumonia.</p>
<p>China has placed more than 50 million people in the region under virtual quarantine.</p>
<p>American Airlines said it was halting all flights starting Friday and running through March 27. Delta plans to wait until Feb. 6 to suspend China operations to help travelers in China leave the country. It said the stoppage will continue through April 30. United Airlines announced that it will suspend flights to Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu but continue flights to Hong Kong.</p>
<p>The U.S. screening airports are John F. Kennedy International in New York, San Francisco International, Seattle-Tacoma International, O’Hare International in Chicago, Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International in Georgia, and Daniel K. Inouye International in Hawaii.</p>
<p>The Dow Jones Industrial Average skidded more than 600 points Friday as the outbreak continued to widen, stoking fears that the travel restrictions and other uncertainties could dent global growth.</p>
<p>Since China informed WHO about the new virus in late December, at least 23 countries have reported cases, as scientists race to understand how exactly the virus is spreading and how severe it is.</p>
<p>Experts say there is significant evidence the virus is spreading among people in China, and WHO noted with its emergency declaration Thursday it was especially concerned that some cases abroad also involved human-to-human transmission. It defines an international emergency as an “extraordinary event” that poses a risk to other countries and requires a coordinated international response.</p>
<p>A declaration of a global emergency typically brings greater money and resources, but may also prompt nervous governments to restrict travel and trade to affected countries. The announcement also imposes more disease reporting requirements on countries.</p>
