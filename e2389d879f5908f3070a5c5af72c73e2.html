<h1>Council sends Burgess' 'hateful activities' bill for legal opinion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A proposed ordinance that aims to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/14/Pittsburgh-City-Council-hateful-activities-recycling-bins-blue-bags-Ricky-Burgess/stories/202001140100" target="_blank">ban city of Pittsburgh employees who engage in&nbsp;“hateful activities”</a>&nbsp;is headed to the Law Department for review after some city council members expressed concern over definitions and motive for the bill.</p>
<p>The eight present members Wednesday motioned to get a legal opinion of the bill sponsored by Councilman Ricky Burgess, who introduced it on Jan. 14.</p>
<p>The bill — in two short sections -— proposed that no public official or city employee should&nbsp;“engage in ... encourage nor organize” such activity&nbsp;“in person or in writing and/or across various media platforms including but not limited to email, Facebook or Twitter.”</p>
<p>If the bill passes, a “hateful activity” would be defined in the city’s Code of Conduct as actions&nbsp;“that incite or engage in violence, intimidation, harassment, threats, or defamation,” targeting a person or group based on 10 protected categories, including race, religion and sexual orientation.</p>
<p>A violation could land an employee or official in front of the city’s Ethics Hearing Board where they could face disciplinary action or a fine.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Commission on Human Relations already provides an avenue for any city resident to submit complaints of discrimination in employment, housing or accommodations based on 13 protected classes, so long as the discrimination occurred within city limits.</p>
<p>Specifically, city code already grants the commission powers to&nbsp;“study and investigate by means of public hearings or otherwise any conditions having an adverse effect on intergroup relations in the city, and study the problems of prejudice, intolerance, bigotry and discrimination as it affects the public safety and general welfare of the city.”</p>
<p>In a 17-slide presentation at council’s committee meeting Wednesday, Rev. Burgess laid out his argument that racism is&nbsp;“killing African Americans in Pittsburgh,” citing <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/09/17/Pittsburgh-black-population-better-life-quality-comparable-city-gender-equity-commission-race/stories/201909170114" target="_blank">findings by the city’s recent Gender and Equity Committee study</a>, and that&nbsp;“one of the ways to reduce racism in Pittsburgh is by banning&nbsp;‘hateful activities.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Several council members, including Deb Gross, Anthony Coghill, Daniel Lavelle and President Theresa Kail-Smith weighed in with questions on definitions, concern about racism in Pittsburgh and concern about the timing of the bill, which Rev. Burgess introduced after failing to secure enough votes to win the council presidency.</p>
<p>“Hate speech and hate crimes have very specific federal definitions. ... Can you speak to that in the legislation? Are they consistent with the federal definitions?” Ms. Gross asked.</p>
<p>Mr. Coghill expressed concern over “infringement on free speech.”</p>
<p>“This is narrowly tailored on purpose. There’s a difference between a hate crime and hateful activities,” Rev. Burgess answered. “... This is not a crime, this is a morally reprehensible act. ... The city often times must show the way.”</p>
<p>He continued by saying that during elections he has been the subject of “vicious, hateful campaigns.”</p>
<p>“After the election is over, to have a campaign waged against a city employee or public official after the votes were over and for that campaign to be fueled by people who work in the same government, even work on the same floor. For that kind of ugly, nasty racist activity to occur to me is distasteful, to me is immoral, and to me is blatantly racist. And so I think that should never occur,” Rev. Burgess said.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith took the floor to say that she watched the&nbsp;“hurtful” process of electing a council president. She won in a compromise on Jan. 6 after Rev. Burgess and Councilman Corey O’Connor failed to secure a majority.</p>
<p>“It was really hurtful to watch things being said about our colleagues and reading things and hearing things on all sides,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Kail-Smith would not provide details about what was said or by whom but did confirm during a post-meeting interview that her office received numerous phone calls from constituents regarding the council presidency vote.</p>
<p>“It’s all hearsay ... but we know that it should’ve been stopped and we should’ve handled this internally,” she said.&nbsp;“We have to work together, and we have to respect one another.”</p>
<p>She said she has already started meeting council members to discuss the issue.</p>
<p>She said she’ll wait to hear from the Law Department to make a decision on the bill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Obviously there’s some federal rules that already govern this,” Ms. Kail-Smith said. “If people think there’s a real need, then we do need to address it. We do need to have a real conversation about race in this city.”</p>
<p>Rev. Burgess would not comment on the contentious contest for council president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’ve been very clear about where this [proposed ordinance] comes from. It comes from my belief that racism in our city is institutional and structural, it’s come from my belief that people who have talked to me over the 12 years I’ve been on council they’ve been the subject of hateful activities, and this is the next step.”</p>
<p>Councilman Bruce Kraus was absent.</p>
<p>The timeline for the Law Department review is unknown.</p>
