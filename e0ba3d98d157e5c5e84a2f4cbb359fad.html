<p>WASHINGTON — The top Navy officer has recommended the reinstatement of the aircraft carrier captain fired for sending a fraught email to commanders pleading for faster action to protect his crew from a COVID-19 outbreak, officials familiar with the investigation said Friday.</p>
<p>Adm. Mike Gilday recommended that Navy Capt. Brett Crozier be returned to his ship, said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the results of an investigation that have not yet been made public.</p>
<p>If approved, his recommendation would end a drama that has rocked the Navy leadership, sent thousands of USS Theodore Roosevelt crew members ashore in Guam for quarantine, and impacted the fleet across the Pacific, a region critical to America’s national security interests.</p>
<p>Adm. Gilday met with Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, on Tuesday and with Defense Secretary Mark Esper on Friday morning to lay out his recommendations. An official said Mr. Esper has asked for a delay in any public announcement while he considers the recommendation.</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, Mr. Esper’s chief spokesman Jonathan Hoffman had suggested that Mr. Esper was going into the matter with an open mind, and said “he is generally inclined to support Navy leadership in their decision.” In a written statement released after the news of Adm. Gilday’s recommendation broke, Mr. Hoffman said Mr. Esper got a “verbal update” from Adm. Gilday and wants to read the written report and then meet with the Navy to “discuss next steps.”</p>
<p>While other details of Adm. Gilday’s recommendations were not clear, they are expected to address the broader communications and leadership issues on the ship and within the fleet, including how the ship dealt with the growing outbreak, and how that information traveled through the chain of command. There have been ongoing questions about whether Navy leaders took too long to acknowledge the ship’s problems and if other commanders share blame for not being responsive to Capt. Crozier’s concerns.</p>
<p>One senior defense official said the investigation covered a complex timeline of communications that spanned multiple time zones and military commands. The official said Mr. Esper wants to make sure the report is thorough and stands up to scrutiny.</p>
<p>Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington state Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, urged Mr. Esper to restore Capt. Crozier to command.</p>
<p>“While Captain Crozier’s actions at the outset of the health crisis aboard the TR were drastic and imperfect, it is clear he only took such steps to protect his crew,” Mr. Smith said in a statement.</p>
<p>The extraordinary episode has captivated a public already overwhelmed by the pandemic. And it has played out as the military copes with COVID-19 by reducing training, scaling back recruiting and halting troop movements even as it deploys tens of thousands of National Guard and other troops to help civilian agencies deal with virus outbreaks across the country.</p>
<p>Capt. Crozier was abruptly removed earlier this month by acting Navy Secretary Thomas Modly, who resigned days later. His return to the ship would reunite him with crew members so upset about his firing that many crowded together on the deck and applauded and chanted his name as he strode off the ship.</p>
<p>As of Friday, 856 sailors on the USS Theodore Roosevelt have tested positive for the virus and four are hospitalized. One sailor, who was from Arkansas, has died, and more than 4,200 of the ship’s nearly 5,000 crew members have been moved onto the island for quarantine.</p>
