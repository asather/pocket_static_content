<h1>Mt. Lebanon football postpones opener, cancels scrimmage after positive COVID-19 test</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon High School football team has shut down until Sept. 2 because a player tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The shutdown means Mt. Lebanon must postpone its season opener against Baldwin Sept. 11, and the team also canceled a scrimmage against Upper St. Clair on Sept. 4.&nbsp;Under PIAA rules, football teams must have 15 practices (including five heat acclimatization practices) before it can play a game. Heat acclimatization practices for football teams started Monday in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon athletic director John Grogan said it is believed the player did not contract the COVID-19 virus from Mt. Lebanon’s campus.</p>
<p>“We’re still ready to go. We just have to follow the protocols,” Mt. Lebanon coach Bob Palko said. “But we’re in this business for the kids, so we just have to be a model. Kids watch how you handle things. We’ve got to handle it and be positive. There’s nothing we can do. These are the rules.</p>
<p>“Have plans changed because of what’s going on these days? Yes. They changed drastically. But they changed in March, also. ... I don’t think this is the last you’re going to hear of something like this.”</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see what happens with the Baldwin game because it is a WPIAL Quad County Conference game. Conference games determine playoff spots. It hasn’t been determined if the game will be made up in the future.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon’s first game is now Sept. 18 against Canon-McMillan.</p>
<p>“Our school district continues to follow the health and safety protocols that are set up,” Grogan said. “We’ll continue to coordinate and take directives from the Allegheny County Health Department and follow their guidance.”</p>
