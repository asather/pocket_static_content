<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Four new COVID-19 deaths were reported in Western Pennsylvania, according to the figures released Tuesday by the state Department of Health.</p>
<p>A new death was reported in each of the following counties: Allegheny, Armstrong, Beaver and Washington.</p>
<p>There were 612 new deaths reported throughout the state, a figure nearly double what was reported the previous day (356), but still well below 1,000 — the 23rd straight day that has happened.&nbsp; In total, the state has reported 72,894 positive cases of the viral disease. It also has reported 5,667 deaths, an increase of 100 deaths over the previous day.&nbsp;Fifty-five of the state’s 67 counties have recorded at least one death.</p>
<p>Allegheny County has nine new cases of COVID-19. Both the county and the state reported a new death in Allegheny. The county health department lists the total at 152, while the state credits Allegheny with 165 deaths.&nbsp;Of the deaths, the county said 141 are confirmed and 11 are probable.</p>
<p>Since the first case in Allegheny County was reported on March 14, it has had 1,928 total cases — 1,807 are confirmed and 121 are probable.</p>
<p>Allegheny continues to have the highest figures in Western Pennsylvania and is followed by Beaver and Westmoreland counties. Based on the state’s data through Monday, Beaver has had 590 cases and 73 deaths and Westmoreland has had 449 cases and 38 deaths.</p>
<p>On Monday, the state Department of Health reported 12 new COVID-19 deaths and 356 new positive cases of the disease, making it the 22nd straight day the state has reported fewer than 1,000 new cases.&nbsp;Monday’s new figures bring the state’s total to 72,282 positive cases of COVID-19. The health department’s report of 12 new deaths brings the statewide total to 5,567.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, state Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine warned that the anti-police brutality protests that shook cities across the country over the weekend could lead to increases in cases going forward.</p>
<p>“Public health authorities across the country have been concerned about the impact of these protests if social distancing is not practiced and masks are not worn,” Dr. Levine said. “We will do everything we can to mitigate that.”</p>
<p>The secretary said that the protests would not impact any counties moving to new stages of reopening at this time, but that the department will continue to monitor closely for outbreaks.</p>
<p>“We’ll be watching for specific increases in the places that had protests,” Dr. Levine said, naming Philadelphia, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh in particular.</p>
<p>Statewide, there are 1,302 COVID-19 patients currently hospitalized, 267 of whom require ventilators. Dr. Levine said the state is estimating that 67% of Pennsylvanians infected with COVID-19 have since recovered.</p>
