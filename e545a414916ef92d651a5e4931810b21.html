<p>The city of Pittsburgh will offer fertility coverage to its employees beginning in 2021.</p>
<p>This will include two cycles of in vitro fertilization for employees covered under its health plans, bumping up the city’s health care costs roughly $170,000, a drop in the bucket of its annual budget. None of that cost will be passed to employees.</p>
<p>At upward of $20,000 depending on the couple’s needs, the process can be expensive, time-consuming and invasive. It is generally a last resort for those looking to start families.</p>
<p>For those who need it, however, the new coverage will be life-changing and life-affirming. Providing employees the ability to have a child isn’t confirmation of some sort of right, but it is a kindness.</p>
<p>Some might be disgruntled about the increased expense of the coverage coming from taxpayers. But the move isn’t unusual — infertility coverage has been on the rise in recent years. Major corporations ranging from Tesla to Starbucks to Spotify offer varying degrees of infertility coverage. Other cities including Baltimore, Chicago, Houston and San Francisco provide such coverage as well.</p>
<p>City employees have been requesting the move, but there isn’t an estimate on how many might seek the treatment at this time.</p>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto’s decision is perhaps not the most cost-effective, but it is poignantly humanitarian for a frankly minimal price tag.</p>
<p>It’s another step along the path of enhancing Pittsburgh’s growing status as a destination city in which to live and work.</p>
<p>Wendy Bell has been taken off the air at KDKA Radio after comments she made on her show surfaced this week suggesting that park rangers should&nbsp;“shoot on sight” people vandalizing public monuments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The station’s owner, Entercom, announced the move Friday <a href="https://kdkaradio.radio.com/articles/wendy-bell-taken-off-the-air-at-kdka-radio-1020-am" target="_blank">on its website</a> in a statement attributed to&nbsp;Entercom Pittsburgh Senior Vice President Michael Spacciapolli that reads:&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Entercom is the home to thousands of voices representing Americans of all races, ethnicities, gender identity, sexual orientation, beliefs and ability.&nbsp;We take very seriously our responsibility to provide a platform for our communities to engage in diverse and meaningful dialogue, debate and the right to freedom of speech, we do not condone the incitement of violence on any of our platforms.</p>
<p>“Members of our community have recently brought to our attention comments made by Wendy Bell that do not align with Entercom’s values. Wendy has been taken off air until further notice.&nbsp;Entercom Pittsburgh remains steadfast in our commitment to inclusive conversations that engage everyone in Pittsburgh while excluding any form of violence."</p>
<p>The statement did not specify which comments it was referring to.</p>
<p>But in a video of a segment from her live show, posted to her “Wendy Bell Radio” Facebook page on June 26 and recently widely shared on social media, Ms. Bell said: “My easy solution for the park rangers and hopefully snipers who are going to be watching for this is to shoot on sight. Shoot, done. No more messing with monuments. You want to mess with a monument? Done, get out.”</p>
<p>The video, as well as other recent and widely shared posts from Ms. Bell, have drawn backlash on social media and toward KDKA-TV despite the fact that KDKA-TV and KDKA Radio are owned by separate companies.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The confusion compelled KDKA-TV to issue a statement on its social media pages and website on Tuesday clarifying that Ms. Bell does not work for KDKA-TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A journalist for 18 years at WTAE-TV, Ms. Bell was fired from the station in 2016 when she made a controversial post on her official Facebook page following the mass shooting in Wilkinsburg, in which five adults and one unborn child were killed during a backyard cookout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Breadworks, a North Side-based bakery that advertised on Ms. Bell’s show on KDKA Radio, also announced on Friday via their Facebook page that it would be pulling its ads from Bell’s show due to her June 26 video, saying&nbsp;“we were shocked and saddened by her comments. Breadworks does not condone violence. This is why we will not be advertising on her show any longer.”</p>
<p>Ms. Bell could not be immediately reached for comment.&nbsp;</p>
