<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State Rep. Austin Davis resigned as vice chairman of the Allegheny County Democratic Committee on Monday, citing his disapproval of where the party is heading under chairwoman Eileen Kelly's leadership.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis, who had joined the chorus of elected officials decrying the committee's recent controversial endorsements and Ms. Kelly's handling of the fallout, said he's long "struggled" to stay in his position since the chairwoman was elected.</p>
<p>"I understood then, as I understand now, how essential it is for historically underrepresented voices to be in a position of power in order to create systemic change that is needed within our system," Mr. Davis said in a statement. "However, it has long been clear that there is no seat for any voice different from Chair Kelly."</p>
<p>In his resignation letter sent Monday, Mr. Davis, D-McKeesport, said he's "committed to the values of the Democratic Party," but can't remain under the current leadership.</p>
<p>"The events of the recent days have crystallized that we do not share the same values and hold vastly different views in the direction this party should be moving," Mr. Davis wrote to Ms. Kelly.</p>
<p>In the past week, there have been numerous calls from elected Democrats for Ms. Kelly to step down, with several citing her comments at a press conference last week defending the committee's endorsement process and casting blame on other Democratic officials for dividing the party.</p>
<p>Mr. Davis said last week that Ms. Kelly "doesn't share our values and should not be leading our party."</p>
