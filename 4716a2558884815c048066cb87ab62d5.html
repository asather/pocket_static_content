<h1>Tom Brady — 'the general' — rose to unforeseen heights with Patriots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not only does Tom Brady appear to be out of the AFC, he figures to be out of the Steelers’ lives forever.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brady is widely expected to sign with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers after the NFL year officially begins at 4 p.m. Wednesday, the next step for the league’s winningest quarterback of all time to relinquish his role as the face of the New England Patriots. Just picture where you were and what your life was like in 2001, then think of how much has changed as Brady’s job title never did.</p>
<p>“I don’t know what my football future holds but it is time for me to open a new stage for my life and career,” Brady, 42, posted Tuesday morning on Twitter, about a year after he signed up for the platform.</p>
<p>Brady ascended from sixth-round draft pick out of Michigan in 2000 and was little more than a name on a roster as a rookie. But when New England’s $100 million veteran passer Drew Bledsoe sustained an injury in Week 2 of the 2001 campaign, it ended the regular season for the No. 1 overall pick in 1993 and began perhaps the greatest run in NFL history for Brady.</p>
<p>He didn’t just take over for Bledsoe and start the final 14 games. Brady also guided the Patriots to a 20-17 upset of the St. Louis Rams — “The Greatest Show on Turf” — for the first Super Bowl victory in franchise history. Bledsoe was traded in the offseason, while Brady went on to make eight more Super Bowl appearances and hoist five more Lombardi trophies, both NFL records.</p>
<p>“I had hoped this day would never come, but rather that Tom would end his remarkable career in a Patriots uniform after yet another Super Bowl championship,” Patriots owner Robert Kraft said in a statement Tuesday. “Unfortunately, the two sides were unable to reach an agreement to allow that dream to become a reality. While sad today, the overwhelming feeling I have is appreciation for his countless contributions to our team and community.”</p>
<p>No shortage of Steelers unflinchingly called Brady “the G.O.A.T.” — greatest of all time, and a term you should familiarize yourself with if you plan on following any discussions about Brady’s legacy — before and after they were routed by his Patriots to open last season, 33-3, at New England. It just might be the most recent and final time the Steelers face him. They aren’t due to play Tampa Bay again until 2022, and even with his maniacal dedication to maintaining football shape, Brady would have to show up at Heinz Field at the age of 45 to make that meeting happen.</p>
<p>More than likely, Brady will retire with a 9-3 record against the Steelers in the regular season, but more notable, 3-0 in the playoffs. That’s a trio of times he ended their chances at winning another Super Bowl — when he was 24, 27 and 37 — and both the first and the last were in the AFC championship. Brady has thrown 34 touchdowns to just five interceptions against the Steelers, and they’ve still yet to pick him off in the postseason.</p>
<p>“That’s what Tom does,” said Pittsburgh’s own franchise quarterback, Ben Roethlisberger, after that most recent title game loss in 2017. “He sits back there and picks you apart. He’s the general.”</p>
<p>Brady will continue to command the NFL’s attention now more than ever. For once, it won’t be in direct competition with the Steelers — unless they meet in the Super Bowl.</p>
