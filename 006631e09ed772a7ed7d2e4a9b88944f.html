<h1>McConnells Mill State Park manager emphasizes safety after fourth person injured </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A woman was airlifted to a hospital after receiving head and leg injuries from falling into Slippery Rock Creek in McConnells Mill State Park on Monday, marking at least the fourth time a person has been injured or searched for in the park since the start of this year.</p>
<p>A Slippery Rock student was hospitalized after falling 80 feet over a cliff near Breakneck Bridge in February, a woman was rescued after becoming disoriented in the park in April, and earlier this month a man fell into the creek and disappeared, all within the same area.</p>
<p>“We re-evaluate the safety of certain areas on a regular basis, especially after incidents like this,” McConnells Mill State Park Manager Dustin Drew said. “But much of it comes back to people heeding the trail warnings.”</p>
<p>Mr. Drew said that State Park officials built a new trail along Breakneck Falls as a safer alternative to the one at the top of the falls last year and have numerous signs warning hikers of the dangerous areas.</p>
<p>Although he doesn’t want to put the onus of safety squarely on the shoulders of hikers, Mr. Drew reiterated that people need to consider their own abilities and safety before attempting a trail, especially when they are isolated.</p>
<p>“We can always put up new signs, but what it really boils down to is awareness of the difficulty of areas, and being mindful of your surroundings,” Mr. Drew said. “The last thing we want to see is more people get hurt.”</p>
