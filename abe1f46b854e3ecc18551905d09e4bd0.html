<p>Four months out from the 2020 presidential election, the president’s re-election campaign and that of his presumptive Democratic challenger are putting the finishing touches on their strategies in Pennsylvania, mobilizing field staff and adapting to COVID-19’s impacts on in-person voter contact.</p>
<p>Donald Trump’s campaign, in partnership with the Republican National Committee, emerged from several months of digital-only organizing recently to hit the doors again, resuming their face-to-face efforts in accordance with social distancing guidelines and mask-wearing recommendations.</p>
<p>The door-to-door mobilization began again on June 8 for Mr. Trump’s campaign, and for one-on-one meetings or public events of any type, the campaign is urging volunteers and attendees to keep six-foot spacing and wear face-coverings. Virtual meetings, a staple of the campaign’s strategy while COVID-19 limited interpersonal gatherings, are suggested for those who are unwilling to meet in person, or for contacts in counties still in the red phase in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Trump campaign and national committee’s offices will operate at a capacity of less than 50% — with staffers encouraged to work remotely and hold virtual meetings and in cases where in-person contact is necessary, volunteers are urged to make appointments before visiting. All volunteers and staff are required to wear masks, according to an RNC memo.</p>
<p>As of this past week, the joint effort between the campaign and RNC had more than 100 staffers across all 67 counties, part of an effort that since March 13, made more than 2.6 million contacts in a virtual-only campaign that included hundreds of&nbsp;“MAGA [Make America Great Again] Meet-Ups” and online training.</p>
<p>“This past week, the RNC and Trump Campaign in Pennsylvania resumed in-person volunteer activities and campaigning as stay at home orders were lifted,” Trump Victory spokeswoman Melissa Reed said in a statement. “Just like we were able to seamlessly transition to virtual campaigning in March, our teams across the country once again adapted efficiently getting back into the field.”</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania campaign of former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee, also has seen results from a virtual blitz.</p>
<p>According to a campaign official, Mr. Biden’s team — in a ramp-up for the June 2 primary — hosted more than 1,400 participants in online seminars on how to vote by mail, including 11 days of action dedicated to contacting voters and urging them to apply. The campaign texted and called more than 2.7 million voters ahead of the primary, in total.</p>
<p>Facing a quick turnaround between primary and general election season, the Democratic National Committee wanted to make sure that Mr. Biden and down-ballot Democrats could jump in quickly, and made Pennsylvania part of its first wave of battleground investments to give them a&nbsp;“nuts-and-bolts infrastructure to scale their organizations quickly,” according to the campaign.</p>
<p>The goal of the DNC’s investment was roughly to double the number of on-the-ground field organizers in the state, and increase the presence of data and operations staff — as well as fund additional offices. They also put into place a rural organizing and constituency outreach team, dedicated to mobilizing&nbsp;“critical communities,” according to material shared by the Biden official.</p>
<p>More than 110 organizers have been trained for the DNC’s Pennsylvania effort so far through a different investment, intended to recruit young people for work on the general election cycle.</p>
<p>Young people also are the target of the prominent mobilization group NextGen, which endorsed Mr. Biden in late May and have been mobilizing the youth vote in Pennsylvania for several cycles now.</p>
<p>NextGen, too, is trying to learn from the obstacles it faced during the primary, deeming the&nbsp;“sudden displacement” of students from college campuses and&nbsp;“complex election law changes” as impediments to their original strategy ahead of June, according to a release.</p>
<p>While they registered more than 9,400 voters, sent more than 200,000 pieces of direct mail and spent $96,000 on digital ads ahead of the primary, NextGen’s goal is to increase youth turnout in November.</p>
<p>“Commitment to turning out during a global pandemic and through national protests against police brutality is the sort of grit and dedication to progress that we will need to carry us to a Democratic victory in November,” NextGen Pennsylvania State Director Larissa Sweitzer said in a statement. “This week was a testament to the youth vote’s power in 2020 -- both at the ballot box and as outspoken activists on the defining civil rights issues of our time.”</p>
<p>A survey of 18-34 year olds — conducted by NextGen from May 21 to June 3 — found that Mr. Biden starts the general election campaign with a 51-to-29% lead over Mr. Trump, a number that includes third-party and undecided voters.</p>
