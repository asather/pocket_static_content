<h1>Swinburne Street in South Oakland reopens after landslide, paving</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Swinburne Street in Pittsburghâ€™s South Oakland neighborhood is completely reopened after the street was paved following seven months of work to correct a landslide between Greenfield Avenue and Edgehill Street, the city announced Wednesday.</p>
<p>The $710,000 project included stabilizing the slope under the road and installing&nbsp;a modular concrete block wall. The street had been closed to traffic from November through March, and before that traffic had been limited to one lane due to the slide.</p>
