<h1>Arlington man found guilty of 2015 murder will have double jeopardy hearing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pennsylvania appeals court has decided an Arlington man <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2018/05/21/Homicide-Allegheny-County-Carlos-Harris-firearms-gun-Daren-Scott/stories/201805210117" target="_blank">convicted</a> in connection to a 2015 Homewood shooting will have a double jeopardy hearing.</p>
<p>The Superior Court ruled on Thursday the trial court was too quick to deny the man’s double-jeopardy claim and they must look at it again.</p>
<p>Carlos Harris, 26, was convicted two years ago of third degree murder and two counts of attempted murder&nbsp;in a non-jury trial before&nbsp;Judge Thomas E. Flaherty.</p>
<p>He was accused of killing 25-year-old Daren Scott of Munhall on August 24, 2015.</p>
<p>Mr. Scott was killed while driving his car in the 300 block of East 12th Avenue just before noon. As Mr. Scott pulled the vehicle over to allow passengers to exit, shots rang out, court records state. Mr. Scott was struck as he ran from the scene, causing him to collapse on the street and die.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators discovered Harris' DNA on the murder weapon, which was found dismantled and strewn about an apartment where Harris stayed, with some of the pieces hidden in a T shirt and towel.</p>
<p>He was sentenced to 17 to 34 years in prison.</p>
<p>It was the second time Harris was tried in the case. The first time ended in a mistrial after a number of discovery violations by the prosecution. Now, Harris argues those violations should have stopped the second trial from ever happening in order to protect him from double jeopardy.</p>
<p>Specifically, Harris alleged that the prosecution deliberately made the discovery violations in order to provoke a mistrial, giving investigators more time to obtain evidence and prepare a case against Harris.</p>
<p>The discovery violations included revealing 869 pages of cell phone records during the second day of trial (both parties agreed those records were inadmissible) and additional testing of gun residue and DNA evidence following cross-examination of the prosecution’s witnesses.</p>
<p>The trial court denied Harris’ claim, saying “it is clear” that the prosecution’s actions were not meant to provoke a mistrial nor were they done in bad faith.</p>
<p>The prosecution slowly providing the materials was arguably intended to delay, “but it did not rise to the level of prosecutorial misconduct,” the court found.</p>
<p>But the appellate court took issue with the judge’s “cursory analysis” of Harris’ claim, and said the record provided by the lower court made them unable to assess whether or not there was any merit to the argument.</p>
<p>“To the extent&nbsp;that the trial court implies that the record clearly supports its conclusion that&nbsp;the prosecutor did not intend to provoke a mistrial or deprive [Harris] of a&nbsp;fair trial, we disagree. The record is not clear either way,’&nbsp;Judge John T. Bender wrote in the opinion.</p>
<p>The trial court did not make any factual findings on the alleged discovery violations, and they also did not hear any testimony relevant to the double-jeopardy claim.</p>
<p>“It is in this regard that the prosecutor’s testimony, subject&nbsp;to cross-examination, would be particularly valuable in determining whether&nbsp;a double-jeopardy violation occurred in this case,” Judge Bender wrote.</p>
<p>Instead, the court simply took the prosecutor’s statements, which claimed that the evidence was not intentionally withheld and the evidence produced during the alleged violations&nbsp;“had much less of an&nbsp;impact on the strength of the Commonwealth’s case than&nbsp;[Harris] insists.”</p>
<p>“The most [Harris] is entitled to is a second trial,” prosecutors argued. “He has&nbsp;already gotten this. There is nothing further for this court to do.”</p>
<p>But the Superior Court points out that these “arguments of counsel are not evidence, and those&nbsp;statements were not subject to rigors of cross-examination.”</p>
<p>Furthermore, the court stated, the prosecutor’s claim that the second trial fixed the problem of double jeopardy misunderstands the issue. The second trial assured Harris’ right to a fair trial, but it did not&nbsp;“cure the harm of multiple prosecutions for the same offense,” which is what double-jeopardy protections are for.</p>
<p>The Superior Court found that the lower court&nbsp;“abused its discretion” by denying Harris’ motion.</p>
