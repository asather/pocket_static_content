The vodka earned a Chairman's Trophy, Tried &amp; True and Great Value awards and a spot among 2020’s Top 100 Spirits.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Its Bly rum also collected those awards as the top-rated white/silver rum.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board has a new executive director, effective Saturday. Michael Demko has been the PLCB’s chief operating officer since December 2019, before which time he was its director of finance following various leadership roles in business. He lives in Mountaintop, Luzerne County.</p>
<p>Charlie Mooney is retiring as executive director after 39 years.&nbsp;PLCB Chairman Tim Holden credited Mr. Mooney for leadership following the passage of Act 39, 2016 legislation that provided for the most comprehensive reform to Pennsylvania’s beverage alcohol landscape since Prohibition.</p>
<p>“We’re grateful to Charlie for his distinguished service to the PLCB, and we thank him for his passion, advocacy and friendship over the years,” Mr. Holden said in a news release. “While Charlie leaves big shoes to fill, Michael brings tremendous experience and business acumen to his new role, and we believe his outside perspective, integrity, and leadership will be key to the next chapter of PLCB growth and transformation.”</p>
