<h1>Local Scene: Eternal Boy livestream, Miss Freddye single and news on Rob Keller, Bindley Hardware Co. and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh pop-punk trio Eternal Boy will do the Live at 25 - 25 Carrick Ave series Friday night, jumping online to perform the 2017 album “Awkward Phase” in its entirety, along with other favorites.</p>
<p>“Awkward Phase” marked the transition for the group formerly known as The Spacepimps, which titled their 2013 album “Eternal Boy.”</p>
<p>The website Punkrocktheory said of the album, “Yes, this is a throwback album. But that’s okay. As a matter of fact, in a time where every other band claims to have an original sound called experimental post-pop-indie-prog-punk or whatever the hell ‘active rock’ is supposed to be, it is actually kinda refreshing to listen to an album that takes you right back to your high school days.”</p>

<p>“We are doing it at HEAR Corps headquarters in Carrick, which is an old church with pro lighting and sound,” Bahl says. “We aren't really a band that brings politics into our performance (though I am personally very politically vocal), but we are taking donations that will all go to the ACLU and also will be doing a short interview before it all and try to raise some awareness on what’s happening around us with the black community.”</p>
<p>It begins at 7:30 p.m. on the band’s Facebook and YouTube. It’s free but they will be accepting donations to benefit the ACLU via Paypal and Venmo.</p>
<p><strong>Shiners guitarist injured</strong></p>
<p>Rob Keller, singer-guitarist for the local country-rock band The Shiners, was injured last weekend while riding the Hoka Hey Motorcycle Challenge, 10,000-mile, cross-country trek that tests a biker’s skill and endurance.</p>
<p>Keller, who is also a construction worker, was struck by a truck that lost control while he was descending a mountain in Cullowhee, N.C., according to a gofundme post. He sustained multiple fractures and internal injuries.</p>
<p>There is a gofundme goal of $20,000 to cover medical costs and aid his family.</p>
<p><strong>Miss Freddye’s soul</strong></p>
<p>Blues Music Award nominee Miss Freddye takes fans to church in the most soulful manner with her new single, “Wade in the Water,” a spiritual from 1901 that The Staples Singers sang as part of the Civil Rights movement in the ‘60s.</p>

<p>You can hear her sing it live on Sept. 12 when she performs a benefit concert for Band Together Pittsburgh and Autism Society of Pittsburgh at the Pittsburgh Syria Shrine Center in Cheswick.</p>
<p>Miss Freddye’s Blues Band will be joined The Neid’s Hotel Band and Pittsburgh Women of the Blues, with special appearances by the Band Together Pittsburgh open mic performers.</p>
<p>Tickets are $20 donation in advance; $25 at the door; www.bandtogetherpgh.org.</p>
<p><strong>Bindley Hardware doc</strong></p>
<p>Pittsburgh roots band Bindley Hardware Co. will interweave its story with that of its namesake -- the turn-of-the-century store -- in “Ever Satisfactory,” a documentary that will premiere on WQED-TV on Oct. 22.</p>
<p>According to the description, frontman Jon Bindley, one of the family's few surviving ancestors, “weaves his music into the company's long-lost timeline, with recovered artifacts, historian interviews, and Pittsburgh imagery — all culminating on a fact-finding mission to South Florida. Along the way, Jon comes to understand what it means to be a son of the rust belt.”</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Haynes album ready</strong></p>
<p>Ryan Haynes, aka the world-traveling DJ Afterthought, announced this week that his second album under his own name is complete.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh artist, who released the neosoul record “The Island of Broken Dreams” in December, posted on social media that he and Garrett Hunter, a producer/engineer from Tyrone, Pa., who recently moved to LA after working with Wiz Khalifa and others at the local ID Labs, “created the ENTIRE thing from scratch. No samples, no loops, no vocal features, no presets, no nothing. Just all MUSIC. Is the culmination of my entire musical being and I left it all out there for this.”</p>
<p>He added that there is no release yet for the project.</p>
<p><strong>The original Zombo</strong></p>
<p>Fans of Zombo — the WRCT DJ, musician, RANT founder and all-around quirky Pittsburgh character — are encouraged to tune in to the Carnegie Mellon station at 88.3 FM on Friday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m.</p>
<p>Zombo will present “The Origin of Zombo on Radio,” a show that will dig out clips of his early shows from five different radio stations, dating back to 1992. It can also be streamed at www.wrct.org</p>
