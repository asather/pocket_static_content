<h1>Pirates president Travis Williams tests positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates president Travis Williams has tested positive for the coronavirus, the team announced on Thursday.</p>
<p>In a statement, Williams said he felt the onset of symptoms Monday evening. After that, Williams said he began isolating himself and preventing further contact with others.</p>
<p>The Pirates said they’ve performed contact tracing and have no reason to believe anyone else has been affected.</p>
<p>“I followed the critical health and safety protocols that we have put in place, including wearing a mask as required, maintaining safe social distance and, upon the onset of&nbsp;symptoms, immediately isolating myself and getting tested, which has prevented further impact to others,” Williams said in a statement.</p>
<p>“We have also conducted a thorough contact tracing procedure to identify anyone who I may have possibly been in contact with, which does not include any of our players, members of our coaching staff, or our baseball operations support staff as the team had been on the road,” Williams said. “At this time, we have no known additional positive tests within our organization.”</p>
<p>The Pirates were in Cincinnati late last week through Sunday evening and had a trip to St. Louis canceled earlier that week because of the Cardinals’ previous COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>Williams is the first member of the first office to test positive for COVID-19. Player-wise, the Pirates have had five positive tests, though none since the season started.</p>
<p>“I am on the road to recovery,” Williams said. “In the meantime, I wanted to use my diagnosis as another reminder that we are all susceptible. It is critical we all follow CDC guidelines and state mandates and have a heightened sense of self awareness in order to protect each other. We all must do our part to get through this pandemic together.”</p>
