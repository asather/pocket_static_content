<h1>Brooks &amp; Dunn coming to S&amp;T Music Park in August</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Brooks &amp; Dunn will hit the road this summer with their first national tour in 10 years, stopping at S&amp;T Music Park on Aug. 29.</p>
<p>Tickets will be available first as part of the Live Nation Country Megaticket, which has yet to be announced. More information will be available at brooks-dunn.com in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The tour was prompted by the successful duo’s “REBOOT” album going to No. 1.</p>
<p>“So much for 'we quit,' huh?” Ronnie Dunn said, announcing the tour. "That horse that we were afraid of riding into the ground apparently didn't share our sentiment…he got a fire in his belly raring to go another round or two. I like the ring of it...'Brooks &amp; Dunn ride again!’”</p>
<p>“The memories of playing live are what have kept the fire burning for us,” Kix Brooks added. “Performers who have had the kind of nights like we’ve had with our fans, can never really let that go. Live is where we’re most at home, and it's gonna feel good to be back in the saddle, let’s rodeo! We’ll see y'all out there on the trail.”</p>
