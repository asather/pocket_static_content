<h1>Some WPIAL coaching legends believe high school football should be moved to the spring</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The informal lunch of champions was finished and as this group of legendary WPIAL football coaches munched on some cookies, the subject came up of whether Pennsylvania high school football should be played this fall, despite the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The long, rectangle table at Grand View Golf Club in North Braddock then suddenly turned into a roundtable discussion among 10 men — two active and eight retired football coaches with 52 WPIAL titles, 12 state championships and 2,699 wins on their plates. Not that this group has a direct line to the PIAA hierarchy in Mechanicsburg. But if they did, these legends would have one message:</p>
<p>Move Pennsylvania high school football to the spring of next year.</p>
<p>Nine of the 10 coaches at the luncheon believe high school football should be moved to the spring, and some other non-contact sports played in the fall, possibly baseball and softball. Considering the ilk of these coaches, their opinion is certainly interesting.</p>
<p>“It’s a no brainer,” said Jim Render, the retired Upper St. Clair coach and the all-time winningest coach in WPIAL history. “It’s such a simple solution given the hand we are dealt today.”</p>
<p>Render was one of the 10 coaches who attended the luncheon July 22. This is the fifth year of the event, an informal gathering put together by Bill Priatko, a Steeler from ages ago, longtime athletic director in the WPIAL and friend of WPIAL sports. Priatko stages the luncheon just because he wants to and coaches come by invite only. These guys, ranging in age from the 50s to the 80s, offer opinions and laugh a lot.</p>
<p>This year’s luncheon included seven of the 11 winningest coaches in WPIAL history. The only four not present have passed away. The group also included active coaches Bill Cherpak of Thomas Jefferson and Bob Palko of Mt. Lebanon, who are tied for the most championships in WPIAL history with eight. Besides Render, Palko and Cherpak, the other seven coaches present are all retired and have at least three WPIAL titles — Woodland Hills’ George Novak, Clairton’s Tom Nola, North Hills’ Jack McCurry, Aliquippa’s Don Yannessa, Blackhawk’s Joe Hamilton, Beaver’s Pat Tarquinio and Jeannette’s Joe Mucci.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this about trying to get kids reps and let them have a season? Nothing is going to be normal,” Palko said. “The smart thing to do is buy time. That’s what everyone is trying to do. How do you buy time? The smartest thing to do is move sports around. Is it hard to do? Yeah, it’s hard. But these are unprecedented times.</p>
<p>“Why wouldn’t it be the best option? Why do you think colleges are thinking about moving football to the spring? Because they’re trying to buy time.”</p>
<p>A handful of states around the country have decided to move football and other fall sports to the spring. Other states have pushed back the start date of fall sports. Virginia’s governing body of high school sports voted Monday to move fall sports to the spring, having a season that lasts from Feb. 15 to May 1. Spring sports in Virginia will be pushed back and last from April 12 to June 26.</p>
<p>The PIAA is going forward with a plan to start fall sports on time. The PIAA has a meeting Wednesday when it is expected to release protocols for the start of fall sports. A shortened fall sports season is a possibility, with all sports concluding by Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>At the coaches luncheon last week, Render was the first to bring up the idea of moving football to the spring. The other coaches in attendance then backed the idea.</p>
<p>“The first time I heard the governor of Michigan say something about switching seasons a while ago, I really thought it was a no brainer,” Render said. “The non-contact sports should go first in the fall.”</p>
<p>Cherpak, who has 274 wins in 25 years, agreed that spring football might be the best option.</p>
<p>“I think it depends on what the forecast is. Is the spring going to be any better with this virus?” Cherpak said. “I don’t think the PIAA wants to be the one to make the decision. They want the governor to do it.”</p>
<p>Bob Lombardi, executive director of the PIAA, has said in the past that the PIAA board of directors is against pushing football and other fall sports to the spring. Lombardi has said the sports medicine committee of the National Federation of High School Associations is against spring football because it will not give athletes enough time to recover for the 2021 season that would begin next August.</p>
<p>“But what would be wrong with having state football playoffs in June?” Render said.</p>
<p>While the coaches at the luncheon suggested having baseball, softball and track in the fall, they also believe they could still play those sports in the spring after football. A few coaches suggested playing baseball and softball into July.</p>
<p>Novak said, “The thing you have to think about is what if you play now and a team comes down with 10 kids who get [COVID-19]? What do you do? Do you cancel their season then? It’s a tough choice.”</p>
<p>Cherpak said one of his players tested positive for the coronavirus a few weeks ago. Thomas Jefferson’s team workouts were not shut down.</p>
<p>“There was all the contact tracing and the ‘close contacts,’” Cherpak said. “There were really only three kids who had to quarantine.”</p>
<p>Nola said, “Moving football to the spring is a good idea. Whoever the influencers are in the state legislature need to get in [Governor] Tom Wolf’s ear because he’s the one who’s going to make the ultimate decision.”</p>
<p>Tim O’Malley, who recently retired as executive director of the WPIAL, also attended the luncheon. He was neither for nor against moving football to the spring. He brought up the schools who might have students in attendance part time this fall.</p>
<p>“How are you going to sell to the mother of a kid that it’s OK for her son to go to football five days a week, but not school,” O’Malley said. “The reality is that you’re going to have to come to grips with school first before you have athletics.”</p>
<p>One coach at the luncheon was against moving football to the spring and that was Tarquinio, who won 269 career games.</p>
<p>“I say leave football where it is in the fall and try to start it on time,” Tarquinio said. “Moving it to the spring just creates too many other problems.”</p>
