<h1>Increase in car rental charge to help pay for Pittsburgh airport modernization</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Travelers or others who rent cars at Pittsburgh International Airport are facing a 9% increase in a fee that will be used to help pay for part of a planned $1.1 billion terminal modernization.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Airport Authority board members voted unanimously Friday to increase the customer facility charge at Pittsburgh International by 50 cents from $5.50 to $6.</p>
<p>The fee hike will take effect Feb. 1. The customer facility charge is tacked on to the cost of the car rental itself. It is levied daily for up to seven days.</p>
<p>Christina Cassotis, CEO of the airport authority that oversees Pittsburgh International, said revenue generated from the $6 charge will be used to pay for new car rental facilities in the 3,000-space parking garage being built as part of the $1.1 billion airport modernization.</p>
<p>It also will help pay for new roads to be used by the rental companies for their cars and a quick turnaround facility where vehicles are washed and vacuumed.</p>
<p>“The rental car companies are paying for part of the garage because they’re going to be using it and the [customer facility charges] are a way of charging them for that,” Ms. Cassotis said. “Basically anything they use on the airport, we’re charging them for.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis said customer facility charges are levied by most U.S. airports. A survey done by the airport authority found the median charge is $6 for medium-sized airports like Pittsburgh International, she said.</p>
<p>She did not know how long Pittsburgh International has been imposing the charge.</p>
<p>Only those who rent cars at the airport pay the fee. Ms. Cassotis said most of those who do so are from out of town.</p>
<p>“This is how garages and rental car facilities are funded throughout the country. This is absolutely standard,” she said.</p>
<p>In addition to the parking garage and new roads, the $1.1 billion modernization will include a new landside building to be used for ticketing, security and baggage claim. The new facility will be built between the C and D concourses of the existing airside building, where travelers get on and off planes.</p>
<p>Ms. Cassotis has said she expects the cost of the modernization to increase, although she has yet to provide a firm estimate. The airport authority hopes to start construction on the new landside building this year and have it completed in 2023.</p>
<p>Separately, the authority announced that passenger traffic for 2019 increased 1.2%. That’s far less than the 7.5% jump in 2018.&nbsp;Ms. Cassotis attributed the slower growth to the grounding of the 737 Max jets in March, affecting the airport’s two largest carriers, Southwest and American.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh International’s 2019 growth fell in the middle of the pack for medium-sized airports, with some producing larger gains while others experienced losses, she said.</p>
