<h1>Former Steeler Rod Woodson reflects on 1987 NFL Scouting combine</h1>

<p>INDIANAPOLIS – Here’s how different it was for Rod Woodson when he came to the NFL Scouting combine in 1987: He drove here from Purdue, did the medical exam and interviews one day, did the workout drills the next day, and went back to school.</p>
<p>That has completely changed, and Woodson, a Hall of Fame cornerback with the Steelers who played with three other NFL teams, is seeing it first-hand. He spent a week at the combine that ended Sunday serving as a mentor for all the defensive backs working out at Lucas Oil Stadium and interviewing with NFL coaches and general managers.</p>
<p>Woodson witnessed the way the 61 defensive backs train to get ready for the combine, including getting prepped on how they should interview. And he had some advice for them:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Train for the 40-yard dash by running the 100-yard dash.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Don’t lie in the interviews.</p>
<p>No drill can be more influential at the combine than the 40-yard dash.</p>
<p>“This is what I told them, I said, listen, I know you guys are training to run 40s, but you should be running not just 40s, you should be running 100s,” said Woodson, who was also an accomplished track star at Purdue who held the NCAA 60-meter hurdles record and qualified for the 1984 Olympic trials in the 110-meter hurdles. “Most of you guys are running 40s, and when you get to 30 to 35 yards, you want to be hitting a higher gear. When you’re running 100s, you kind of start slowing down when you hit 50 (yards).</p>
<p>“If you’re only running 40s, when you get to about 30, you’re slowing down and now you’re not going to run your faster time. But if you’re running 100s getting ready for the 40, your legs are stronger, you have more wind and you have more confidence in the run itself. And none of the guys do it. They all train the same way. It blows my mind.”</p>
<p>Woodson blew everyone’s mind – and stopwatch – when he came to the combine and posted times of 4.28 and 4.30 in the 40-yard dash, just slightly behind the fastest time turned in this year by Alabama receiver Henry Ruggs III (4.27). His speed immediately cost him any chance of playing safety in the NFL. He was quickly viewed by coaches and GMs as a cornerback, despite Woodson’s desire to play safety. And that’s how the Steelers viewed him when they selected Woodson with the 10th overall pick in the 1987 draft, although they never thought they would even have a chance to get him.</p>
<p>The Steelers were so convinced Woodson would be gone before it was their turn to draft that Coach Chuck Noll told secondary coach Tony Dungy to not even bother providing a scouting report on him.</p>
<p>“I wanted to play safety my whole career,” Woodson was saying the other day during a break in his schedule. “I played with my eyes. I was a formation-driven player. I looked at the game through playing as a safety. And if you look in the backfield as a corner you’re going to get double-moved.</p>
<p>“It took me 3 ½ years to get really comfortable because I didn’t understand the game out there. Playing out there on the side, where everybody was away from me was completely foreign to me. I played like five or six games (at cornerback) at Purdue but that’s not anything. It took me awhile to understand what I should and shouldn’t do. I was jumping everything. They were running by me like crazy. I thought I was fast and those guys were fast, too. I didn’t know they were that fast in the NFL. Those guys can run.”</p>
<p>Woodson played 12 years at cornerback in the NFL – 10 with the Steelers, one with the San Francisco 49ers and one with the Baltimore Ravens – before he was moved to safety in his second year with the Ravens in 1999. Woodson played five years at safety, the final two with the Oakland Raiders, and finished his career with 71 interceptions, third most in the league history. He had 47 interceptions at cornerback, 24 at safety.</p>
<p>Dick LeBeau, his former position coach with the Steelers, would always tease Woodson about the 62 career interceptions he had as a cornerback with the Detroit Lions in 1959-72. So, when Woodson had his 63rd career interception in 2002 as a member of the Raiders, one of the first things he did was call LeBeau.</p>
<p>“I called him and said, ‘I got 63,’” Woodson said. “And he was like, ‘Yeah, but I got all mine at corner.’ I was like, ‘OK, touche.’”</p>
<p>Woodson said he talked to most of the defensive backs here about what happens after the combine, how most of them will either be drafted or end in a training camp somewhere. “We talk about that process,” he said.</p>
<p>But he did want his players to understand the most important part of the interview process with the coaches and general managers, even though most of the prospects are trained what to say by professionals.</p>
<p>“Some of the guys need to train for the interview because they do get nervous in front of others,” Woodson said. “My suggestion to the guys is, when they ask you a question, they already know the answer, don’t lie to them. If you’re forthcoming, honest, be a man; if you made a mistake, say you made a mistake, you learned from it and move on. That’s what they want to see. If you lie and throw it under the rug, that red flag they already know about, they’re like, ‘We can’t trust him.’”</p>
<p>The Steelers and three other teams trusted Woodson for 17 years in the league. It would be a good idea if today’s prospects trusted him, too.</p>
