<p>TORONTO — Sidney Crosby, Jason Zucker and Jake Guentzel scored for the Penguins in a 3-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens on Monday night, tying the best-of-five qualifying series at one game apiece.</p>
<p>Crosby beat Montreal’s Carey Price early in the first period, and Zucker scored with about five minutes left in the third. Guentzel sealed the win with an empty-net goal.</p>
<p>Jesperi Kotkaniemi ended Matt Murray’s shutout bid with 2:09 left.</p>
<p>The Canadiens opened the series with a 3-2 overtime win on Saturday but were flat from the start in Game 2 and never recovered. Game 3 is Wednesday night.</p>
<p>The Penguins controlled the early offensive play and Price had to be sharp right away, denying Zucker after he was sent in alone a few minutes into the game.</p>
<p>The Penguins kept the pressure on and was rewarded when Guentzel’s cross-ice pass found Crosby streaking down the left wing. The Penguins’ captain snapped the puck between Price’s legs at 4:25.</p>
<p>It was the 188th playoff point of Crosby’s NHL career, moving him into an eighth-place tie with Joe Sakic and Doug Gilmour.</p>

<p>The Canadiens, who were outshot 14-7 in the first period, nearly scored on a Brett Kulak wrap-around attempt midway through the stanza.</p>
<p>Jared McCann dislodged the net just before Kulak flipped the puck over Murray’s shoulder. After a review, the officials decided it was not a goal.</p>
<p>Montreal came out with more pace in the second period but could only manage a few decent chances. The best chance came when Jonathan Drouin found Joel Armia for a goalmouth redirect, but Murray made a brilliant glove save.</p>
<p>Price was steady throughout. He stoned Kris Letang twice on a scramble midway through the second period and was Montreal’s best player.</p>
<p>Play opened up in the third period but neither team was able to muster many opportunities. As Montreal pressed for the equalizer, Kulak got caught at the blue line to give Pittsburgh a 2-on-1 break, allowing Conor Sheary to find Zucker in front at 14:41.</p>
<p>Guentzel iced the victory with 9.1 seconds left. Pittsburgh outshot Montreal 38-27.</p>
