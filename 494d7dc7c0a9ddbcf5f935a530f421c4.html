<h1>City Theatre, Pittsburgh Playhouse partner to develop new works by 5 local playwrights</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Homegrown Stories,” a new collaboration of two Pittsburgh theaters, challenges five local playwrights to each write a 10-minute play, with an up-to-the-moment theme.</p>
<p>They have had quite a lot to choose from in the first half of 2020.</p>
<p>Point Park University’s Pittsburgh Playhouse and City Theatre are partnering on the project commissions, with the potential to develop five new works.</p>
<p>The playwrights — all are Pittsburghers, have Point Park ties or both — are writer-performers Ngozi Anyanwu (“Good Grief” off-Broadway) and Marcus Stevens (most recently, “Game On” at CLO Cabaret), TV, film and stage writer Matt Pelfrey, Pittsburgh Playwrights Theatre founder and leader Mark Clayton Southers and Tammy Ryan, who is among Pittsburgh’s most published playwrights.</p>
<p>Ryan also is part of a new-work project that is a collaboration of <a href="https://www.playpenn.org/" target="_blank">PlayPenn</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;Theatre Philadelphia. Her play&nbsp;“Take My Hand and Wave Goodbye” will have a reading on July 25. Her play&nbsp;“The Wake” was performed last month by Pittsburgh Public Theater’s ongoing PlayTIme series.</p>
<p>City Theatre on the South Side comes to the partnership steeped in a history of new-play development, including its own commissions and the annual Momentum and Young Playwrights festivals.</p>
<p>For the Playhouse, the collaboration is part of a reimagining under new leadership and in its new Downtown home.</p>
<p>“The roots of ‘Homegrown Stories’ are in the Pittsburgh Playhouse’s new play initiative that was to begin in the fall. But with the pandemic effectively shuttering arts organizations across the world, we felt a responsibility to give voice to artists at a time when their voices aren’t being heard,” said Steven Breese, who last summer came to Pittsburgh as the Playhouse artistic director and dean of&nbsp;Point Park’s Conservatory of Performing Arts.</p>
<p>He added that City and the Playhouse “were perfectly matched to move this forward quickly,” during a pandemic that has shut down theaters and schools, and while the Black Lives Matter and Trans Rights movements are forging new paths of the present and future.”</p>
<p>Each of the new plays will have online readings and at least three will have productions. Performances are TBA.</p>
<p>Clare Drobot, City Theatre’s associate artistic director, said, “So often the timeline for producing theater doesn’t allow for immediate artistic response. We were inspired by the possibility of allowing artists to share impulses in real time.”</p>
