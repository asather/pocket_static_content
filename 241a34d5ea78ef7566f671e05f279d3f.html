<h1>WPIAL basketball finals: School closing makes this Vincentian's last run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Vincentian boys basketball team has made it to a WPIAL championship game for the eighth time, but this march to the title game is unlike any other.</p>
<p>It will be Vincentian’s last run.</p>
<p>Vincentian, a small Catholic school in McCandless, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/02/25/Vincentian-Academy-closing-end-of-school-year-2020-catholic-sisters-charity-nazareth/stories/202002250111" target="_blank">announced Tuesday that it will close </a>at the end of the 2019-20 school year because of finances. Students were given the news at a school assembly, only two days before the Royals will play for a WPIAL championship.</p>
<p>Vincentian will meet Cornell for the Class 1A title, 7 p.m. Thursday at Petersen Events Center. Winning the WPIAL was already important for Vincentian after losing in the title game a year ago. Tuesday’s news adds more significance for the Royals.</p>
<p>“It really does,” Vincentian coach Tim Tyree said. “You always want to get a chance to be part of history, but this one is different. It’s really forever now.”</p>
<p>Tyree said said his players were shaken by the closure announcement. He called the timing of it “terrible.”</p>
<p>“This is completely devastating,” Tyree said. “We were riding high, getting back to the WPIAL championship was accomplishing one of our goals. Now it takes a totally different twist and we have to try and get everybody focused, not only on the game, but their futures.</p>
<p>“The future always has so many unknowns. But to put this on these kids at this time is tough.”</p>
<p>Vincentian has a talented team, losing in the PIAA final a year ago. Three of the five starters are non-seniors – 6-foot-6 junior forward Angelo Reeves, 6-1 sophomore guard Matt McDonough and 6-1 junior guard Alex Griggs. Priest Ryan is a talented 6-5 sophomore off the bench.</p>
<p>According to PIAA rules, athletes are eligible immediately if they transfer schools because their school closed. Vincentian’s players will be eligible even if they transfer to a private, parochial or charter school.</p>
<p>But Tyree will try to get his players to concentrate just on the immediate future — and the title game. If familiarity breeds contempt, then Vincentian and Cornell shouldn’t care for one another too much. This is their third meeting this year and they also met three times in the past two seasons.</p>
<p>While the school closure might add more meaning to this game for Vincentian, winning a title would mean the world to Cornell. The only public schools smaller than Cornell in the WPIAL are Mapletown and Avella. This Cornell senior class has had a tremendous athletic run. All five starters are seniors and four of them were on the Cornell football team that won a WPIAL playoff game for the first time in school history.</p>
<p>“This is big for us,” Cornell coach Bill Sacco said. “We’re battling for every public school out there right now. Most of us public schools in Class 1A and 2A don’t have the opportunity to be at the top because these other schools can load up their teams. We’ll go and play and see if we can do it. If we can, that would be great. If we can’t, we still battled through all these teams to get this far.”</p>
<p>The two teams split two regular-season meetings.</p>
<p>“The matchups, I feel like I have my guys, my teammates all over their guys because we’re bigger, more athletic and we work harder,” Vincentian senior Ethan Embleton said. “We just have to be able to close out to shooters and rebound.”</p>
<p><strong>Class 3A boys</strong></p>
<p>For the third time in four years, North Catholic and Lincoln Park will play in the WPIAL Class 3A title game. Lincoln Park won last year and North Catholic in 2017.</p>
<p>Could there be a little rivalry developing between the two teams?</p>
<p>“I don’t feel that way,” North Catholic coach Dave DeGregorio said. “I don’t know what the kids think, but I had (Lincoln Park’s) Andre Wilder and Isaiah Smith playing AAU with me all spring and summer. We were in probably 10 tournaments together. They stayed in our hotel room a lot of nights.”</p>
<p>A year ago, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2019/02/28/WPIAL-basketball-championships-Lincoln-Park-boys-breeze-to-WPIAL-title-over-north-catholic/stories/201902280232" target="_blank">Lincoln Park defeated North Catholic, 62-50, </a>in the title game. North Catholic’s Isaac DeGregorio came into the game averaging 21, but scored 14 — and only four in the final three quarters.</p>
<p>This year, DeGregorio is averaging 17.</p>
<p>“If you want to win against good teams and have a chance to play in the championship, you can’t only have one guy,” Dave DeGregorio said. “Last year, we sort of had one guy. This year, other guys are better. Other guys are taking more shots.”</p>
<p>It seems Lincoln Park has noticed some pundits picking North Catholic to win, and Lincoln Park seems a little irked by it.</p>
<p>“I’m ready for it because everyone is doubting us right now,” Smith said. “Everyone has North Catholic over us. Everyone is talking, so we just have something to prove.”</p>
<p>This is the fifth consecutive year that Lincoln Park has made it to a championship game. Only four other schools in WPIAL history have been in five consecutive championships.</p>
<p><strong>Class 2A girls</strong></p>
<p>It will be the new vs. the old power in the Class 2A girls championship when Laurel meets Bishop Canevin on Thursday at 5 p.m. Laurel is playing in a title game for the first time, and the Spartans start three freshmen – Regan Atkins, Danielle Pontius and Reese Bintrim. You can bet not many teams starting three freshmen have made it to a title game over the years.</p>
<p>Bishop Canevin, meanwhile, has won four championships since 2013 and been in a title game six times in the past eight years.</p>
<p>“It’s just remarkable,” Laurel coach Matt Stebbins said of the championship appearance. “We’ve been resilient all year. People have been doubting us all year. They had a chip on their shoulder and wanted to prove something. And now we’re at The Pete.”</p>
