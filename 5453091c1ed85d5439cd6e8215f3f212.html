<h1>Pirates spring training: Slow start continues with loss to Orioles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Spring training results don’t count. They might matter, but this we know for sure: What the Pirates have done thus far hasn’t been particularly pretty.</p>
<p>The Pirates lost, 11-4, to the Baltimore Orioles on Friday at LECOM Park, dropping them to 0-7-1 so far this spring. They’re currently Major League Baseball’s only winless team, and they have the worst run differential (minus-33) by a wide margin.</p>
<p>“We’ve given up some runs with guys who haven’t been in our camp, so I think you have to back that off,” manager Derek Shelton said. “The runs will come. We’ve squared up some balls that have been caught. We hit a couple balls in the gap. It’s something we have to continue to be aware of, but yeah, it’s not anything that’s overly concerning right now.”</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Trevor Williams hit 95 mph on the radar gun — “wind was blowing in,” he joked — and controlled his fastball well but struggled to get a feel for his breaking ball.</p>
<p>The right-hander allowed four earned runs in one-plus innings on four hits and two walks. Of the nine batters he faced, he went to a three-ball count on five of them.</p>
<p>“You can throw as many bullpens as you want, but once you get out there in the games, the juices flow a little differently,” Williams said. “It’s going to be better next time out. ... I feel like my fastball is there. Now we’re just focusing on execution of the off-speed stuff.”</p>
<p>It has less of an impact on the game, but it made for a great story nonetheless: Chad Kuhl pitched in a game for the first time in 20 months, the result of Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>Kuhl allowed two runs in 2/3 of an inning, although they both scored on a triple allowed by Sammy Reyes. Kuhl mixed his pitches well and threw a lot of curveballs and sliders — an encouraging sign for someone coming off Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>“It was awesome,” Kuhl said. “Just kind of wanted to get it out of the way. It’s really cool after 20 months coming back and being able to pitch and be healthy. But I’m just looking forward to when all the questions go away and I can just pitch, play and be normal again.”</p>
<p>Blake Cederlind stranded a pair of inherited runners by notching a pair of strikeouts. Steven Brault gave up a pair of runs in 1 1/3 innings.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates mustered just six hits and scored all of their runs on John Ryan Murphy’s grand slam in the fourth inning. Murphy, a light-hitting catcher the Pirates signed to a minor-league deal in January, has their only two home runs this spring.</p>
<p>“It feels good, but if anything, it gives me confidence with the work that I did in the offseason,” Murphy said. “Seeing some results is obviously a positive thing.”</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco went 1-for-3 with a double and scored a run. Playing his first game of the spring, Jarrod Dyson was 0-for-2 with a walk, while Bryan Reynolds singled and walked twice. As a team, the Pirates walked nine times.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t a great one for the Pirates. Reynolds lost a ball in the sun, which contributed to a run. He also made a throw home that was off-line, allowing Orioles catcher Chance Sisco to score easily and shortstop Richie Martin to take second and eventually score.</p>
<p>The Orioles successfully stole three times against Murphy and the Pirates — one a double steal — while Pittsburgh’s pitchers accounted for three wild pitches. Cole Tucker made an error at shortstop to lead off the fourth inning, although the run didn’t score.</p>
