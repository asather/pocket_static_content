<h1>More than 300 turn out for Freedom Corner prayer and protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>About 300 Pittsburgh clergy members and others are gathered Monday at&nbsp;the historic Freedom Corner in the Hill District for a "prayer and protest" in the wake of George Floyd’s death while in police custody and then marched to the City-County Building in Downtown.</p>
<p>The event, meant to show solidarity against racial injustice,&nbsp;started at noon and included nine speakers to signify the nearly nine minutes a white Minneapolis police officer had his knee on Floyd's neck. The African American man was pleading with police that he could not breathe during the Memorial Day incident.</p>
<p>"We are living between the tension of risking our individual health ...and the seeking of national justice," said the&nbsp;Rev.&nbsp;B. De Neice Welch,&nbsp;of Bidwell Presbyterian Church in Manchester, referring also to the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>The participants then began marching down Centre Avenue toward Downtown.</p>
<p>A Pittsburgh police SUV escorted the marchers while police motorcycles blocked traffic at different intersections.</p>
<p>As they marched, they chanted,&nbsp;“Say his name,”&nbsp;“We can’t breathe,” and&nbsp;“Say her name.”</p>
<p>When they arrived on Grant Street, they walked over messages painted by protesters on Sunday.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 10pt;">Marchers walk over protest messages painted yesterday </span><a style="font-size: 10pt;" href="https://t.co/rJJyjr4TJb">pic.twitter.com/rJJyjr4TJb</a></p>
<p>At least one man, wearing a pro-Donald Trump “Make America Great Again” hat, got out of his car to denounce the group and its message.</p>
