<h1>Why Pat Freiermuth passed on 'next chapter' to stay at Penn State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Anyone who’s followed the Penn State program since 2018 knows the exploits of All-American tight-end Pat Freiermuth.</p>
<p>The stats are incredible. Freiermuth had 11.8 yards per catch for 508 yards with seven touchdowns in 2019. If the Nittany Lions fulfill their title dreams, they’ll largely rest on the shoulders of the 6-foot-5 260-pound junior, who refuted rumors that he would opt out of the season around the same time the Big Ten announced its return to fall sports after a short postponement.</p>
<p>“It’s great that he wants to play for us,” Penn State coach James Franklin told reporters. “He embodies everything that we want in a football player.”</p>
<p>Stats tell part of the story of Freiermuth, but an accurate tale is told when the lights aren’t on. The gleam in the eye of tight ends coach Tyler Bowen is palpable whenever Freiermuth is a topic. Bowen has high standards for his star pupil. The coach also knows his elevated criteria won’t match what Freiermuth sets for himself.</p>
<p>“It comes down to his emotional maturity,” Bowen said Wednesday via Zoom. “He thrives in big moments in the game because he loves to practice as much he loves playing in a game. He’s one of those rare guys who loves the offseason and the training as much as he loves the game.</p>
<p>“He loves the work because he knows that it prepares for any scenario that can happen in a game.”</p>
<p>Freiermuth could’ve joined Micah Parsons in opting out. He strongly considered leaving, and why wouldn’t he? Nearly every NFL draft board has Freiermuth as the top tight end in the upcoming draft. He decided to stay once the Big Ten released its third and hopefully final revision of the schedule.</p>
<p>“There was definitely some serious talk about me leaving, and I was thinking about it,” Freiermuth said. “But at the end of the day, when I talked to my mother and my father, they said I should consider if there was a season and how I would feel if I didn’t play.</p>
<p>“There was a point in time when I was kind of like — I don’t care. I just want to move on to the next chapter. That’s kind of what my mentality was with just kind of being strung along, but when the Big Ten decided to come back, I knew that, right then and there, that I was excited to play.”</p>
<p>Freiermuth carries a lot of responsibility on his young but broad shoulders. He works with younger tight ends such as Theo Johnson and encourages classmate Zack Kuntz. He sets the example that recruits such as Jerry Cross, a four-star commit from Milwaukee, want to follow at Penn State.</p>
<p>“I’ve seen him take an extra level of accountability with our younger players during the pandemic,” Bowen said. “It’s his attention to detail. He’s always taking notes. He’s starting to see the game the way a coach would. He knows what everyone on the field is supposed to be doing. His film study and work ethic pay off.”</p>
<p>Freiermuth deciding to play makes the Nittany Lions offense dynamic. He gives them a chance to make the College Football Playoff. It won’t be comfortable with a Week 2 game against Ohio State looming after what might be a challenging opener against Indiana. But Freiermuth is doing it all for the love of competition, and it might be enough.</p>
<p>“I’m so thankful for the game of football,” Friermuth said. “Everyone on this team loves football. I think everyone in the whole country of America loves football. I’m fortunate to play. It’s great to have the game of football back and some normalcy and stuff like that. I’m very excited to play.”</p>
<p><strong>WR Dunmore opts out</strong></p>
<p>The Nittany Lions will be without redshirt freshman John Dunmore in 2020.</p>
<p>Dunmore withdrew from Penn State and is back home in Florida training on his own, according to 247 Sports.&nbsp;The school confirmed the report with a statement.</p>
<p>“John Dunmore has withdrawn from Penn State for personal reasons,” the statement said.</p>
<p>Dunmore entered Penn State as part of the 2019 class and was a four-star recruit. He only played in one game last season and didn’t record a stat. But he was projected to get more playing time in 2020.</p>
<p>Franklin said it would be “day-to-day” on when or if Dunmore would return to the program. The coach wouldn’t give any more detail on Dunmore.</p>
