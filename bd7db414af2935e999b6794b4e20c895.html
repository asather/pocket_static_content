<h1>Sportsbook apps are finding ways to keep players engaged during shutdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sports gamblers in Pennsylvania got to live in their dream world for roughly seven months before the COVID-19 pandemic hit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Legal app-based sports books exploded in popularity following launches beginning last summer. Their convenience for players — who could finally place wagers with a few simple taps on their smartphone — helped operators generate hundreds of millions of dollars in handle, including&nbsp;$329.8 million as recently as February, according to PlayPennsylvania.com.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sports shutdown aimed at helping slow the spread of the virus caused a lot of that action and revenue to evaporate overnight, though. So now what?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most books remain open for business to the extent they can be. No, you can’t lay a few sheckles on the Pirates to win their home opener. Or on the Penguins to beat the Philadelphia Flyers as they jockey for playoff position. But some obscure options do remain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re actually doing ping pong, which is actually one of our top events,” said Johnny Avello, director of operations for the DraftKings sportsbook, which partners with the Meadows Racetrack and Casino in Washington, Pa.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’re also doing esports, and some of the states are allowed to do even some of the 2K stuff,” he added, referring to the popular sports video game franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The availability of some of those offerings varies by state. The esports, for example, do not yet have widespread approval in Pennsylvania, so you’re mostly looking at the aforementioned table tennis, Chinese basketball and a few functioning leagues in Belarus to whet your appetite for wagering on live events.</p>
<p>It’s a bleak scene, indeed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Futures markets, however, remain open and insured against season cancellations. For example, if you bet on the Penguins to win the Stanley Cup now, and the season is canceled later, DraftKings will refund your wager.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avello’s shop is also trying to keep players engaged through daily fantasy games and free pools in which players can win money by nailing the most propositions in a given set related to events like NFL free agency or the Democratic Party debate last month.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Other sportsbooks including FanDuel and Fox Bet are offering access to their state-approved online casinos through their app, if traditional table games are more your jam and you’re missing them with most physical casinos across the state closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On the charitable front, DraftKings has pledged a half-million dollars to the United Way’s coronavirus relief efforts and has started a social media campaign that could double that donation. The company will donate an additional dollar each time someone tweets a photo of themselves wearing their favorite rally cap to the hashtag #DKrally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Avello said that DraftKings has not yet seen any layoffs related to the coronavirus pandemic and he does not expect any, despite the slump in action.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rather, the company is gearing up in hopes that sports return somewhat soon and players return to the book in droves.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m preparing that this thing is going to go gangbusters,” he said.&nbsp;“This is tough times right now. We’ll get through it. Couldn’t give you a date when that is. Possibly June, July. But once we’re out of this, sports players will return, because I’m in touch with them every day.”</p>
