<h1>Teaching online: When a classroom discussion of race goes public, it highlights growing issues</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Recording some or all of a professor's lecture — and the controversy that can ensue — is hardly a new campus phenomenon, stretching back to when students in bellbottom jeans lugged bulky cassette recorders to class.&nbsp;Nor is it a fresh idea to hold online classes — at least for a subset of colleges.</p>
<p>But the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting universal push by colleges to shift in-person classes to remote format this spring and fall means many more instructors are adapting to a format that some have little experience with. And they may not have fully pondered the ramifications.</p>
<p>Intellectual property rights of professors versus universities is just one issue raised by recorded classes. There are student privacy concerns: When is it legal and appropriate to record a student’s name or image?</p>
<p>At Duquesne University, yet another issue arose last week, after professor Gary Shank took to Zoom to deliver an educational psychology class and repeatedly used the "N" word for, as he described it, pedagogical reasons.</p>
<p>A student captured the sound and images, shared it with a campus peer who posted the clip to Twitter. By Friday afternoon, Mr. Shank was placed on paid leave, and his web page removed from the university’s website.</p>
<p>Now, a battle has ensued.</p>
<p>“I believe that there is never a time, pedagogically or otherwise, for a professor to create a hostile learning environment.” said Givens Generett, interim dean of Duquesne’s School of Education. “Using the ‘N word’ or seemingly encouraging students to use that word is not in keeping with the mission of the university, the School of Education, or the Pennsylvania Department of Education.</p>
<p>“As an educator, you should always be mindful of the impact of your actions on the students you are obligated by the profession to teach,” she added.&nbsp; “Your intentions are of no consequence when a student’s learning is disrupted by what you believe to be okay. Your actions are what students will remember.”</p>
<p>The professor, who has been unavailable for comment, apparently sees it differently, and others supporting him are rallying to his defense.</p>
<p>The Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education (FIRE) says nothing short of academic freedom at Duquesne is at stake. It urged university President Ken Gormley to reverse course, in a letter sent Wednesday to the school and shared with the Post-Gazette by Mr. Shank’s attorney Warner Mariani.</p>
<p>“While we appreciate the university’s interest in confronting the painful legacy of racism, it&nbsp;cannot do so by dictating, through censorship, how its faculty members and students grapple&nbsp;with that legacy in the classroom,” wrote Alexandria Morey, program officer with the Individual Rights Defense Program at FIRE.</p>
<p>“The university is certainly free to criticize the manner in&nbsp;which faculty members confront racism, but Duquesne’s suspension of Shank is a clear&nbsp;erosion of the academic freedom to which the university is committed,” she said.</p>
<p>Nationally, college classrooms long have been a battlefront in the culture wars, with students leaning left or right politically pushing back against opposing points of view. Political organizations on both sides are often eager to amplify their resistance.</p>
<p>In March, as campuses switched to remote instruction and sent students home because of the pandemic, the Chronicle of Higher Education reported that Charlie Kirk and the conservative political-action group he founded, Turning Point USA, headquartered in Phoenix, Arizona, asked students whose professors had switched to online classes to share evidence of what the group called “blatant indoctrination.”</p>
<p>“Now is the time to document &amp; expose the radicalism that has been infecting our schools,” he tweeted. “Transparency!” he tweeted.</p>
<p>One national expert spoke with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Wednesday about the realities professors now face given the ease with which matters litigated in the classroom can be spread far and wide on social media.</p>
<p>The Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), which is intended to safeguard privacy of a student’s educational records, doesn’t apply if only the instructor is recorded, said LeRoy Rooker, a senior fellow with the American Association of Collegiate Regisratrars and Admisssions Officers, who once oversaw the federal office that administers the act.</p>
<p>But state laws pertaining to when it is legal to record someone still can apply. For example, Pennsylvania is a two-party state, meaning both participants must consent to being recorded.</p>
<p>Because of society and academia’s shift toward online discourse, accelerated by the pandemic, Mr. Rooker said professors must adapt to a sharply changed landscape as they contemplate what is said in class and how it may be memorialized.</p>
<p>He suggested professors might even want to create a placard and place it in a highly visible spot to remind themselves by posing this question: “Am I being recorded?”</p>
<p>“I would suggest that&nbsp;they think about, obviously, what they are going to do in their classroom and assume that somebody is going to record them,” he said.</p>
<p>He said the issue of recorded classrooms has been of heightened interest in recent months, and that he and his association have fielded questions from a number of universities.</p>
<p>According to his LinkedIn page, Mr. Shank has taught at Duquesne since 1997. It says he holds a 1971 bachelor’s degree in psychology and psychologistics from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y., and a master’s in educational psychology from Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana.</p>
<p>He was seen and heard in a pair of videos posted to Twitter, each under a minute long, interacting with at least one student during a remote session. In it, the professor brings up the N-word. A student posted&nbsp; to Twitter what he said was a recording from last Wednesday’s session of Mr. Shank’s class.</p>
<p>In one video, Mr. Shank says, “I’m giving you permission to use the word, OK? Because we’re using the word in a pedagogical sense. What’s the one word about race that we’re not allowed to use?”</p>
<p>After being greeted with silence, he adds, “I’ll give you a hint. It starts with ‘N.’ ... It’s even hard to say, OK? But, I’ll tell you the word, and again, I’m not using it any way other than to demonstrate a point. Fair enough?”</p>
<p>In a separate video clip, Mr. Shank says, “When I was a young man, all right, that was a very commonly used word.” He offers an example of how the word was used in his youth and asks his student, “Could we do that nowadays?” After a voice on the video says “no,” the professor offers another example and repeats the question.</p>
<p>A Duquesne spokesman was not immediately available Thursday to discuss Mr. Shank’s employment status and the university’s reaction to the letter sent to Mr. Gormley from FIRE.</p>
