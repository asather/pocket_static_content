<h1>Pirates assistant GM Steve Sanders discusses draft, minor leagues and finding victories ‘other places’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Steve Sanders was hired by the Pirates as an assistant to general manager Ben Cherington back in early December, he figured this would probably be a frantic process for the first-year regime.</p>
<p>It’s safe to say that neither Sanders nor Cherington (or anyone else) expected this: baseball paused because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, while appearing on <a href="https://937thefan.radio.com/sports-team/pittsburgh-pirates" target="_blank">93.7 The Fan</a> with host Dan Zangrilli on Saturday morning, Sanders talked a little about what the Pirates front office is trying to accomplish during this current time period, as well as what a condensed draft and contracted minor league system might mean for small-market teams like the Pirates.</p>
<p>“I don’t think any of us expected this is what we’d be doing,” Sanders said. “This is certainly not how I expected to be spending my first April with the ball club, but I think we’ve been able to find victories in some other places.</p>
<p>“Communication with other front-office members, our scouts and our coaches has been great. I do feel like I’ve gotten to know a lot of the people I work with maybe in a different way.</p>
<p>“It’s different, and we’re going to have to continue to adapt. … But we’re excited about the things that lie ahead for this group.”</p>
<p>While a definitive draft plan has not yet been finalized — it could be in June or July and five rounds or 10 — we do know it will be different.</p>
<p>For small market teams like the Pirates, ones who should be building through the draft, that’s … well, not great.</p>
<p>Sanders wasn’t singing any sort of sad song with Zangrilli, but he does believe the Pirates will be able to adjust.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to prioritize doing whatever we need to to make sure that in the amateur acquisition space, both internationally and domestically in the draft, that we’re prepared to do what we need to to maintain that talent pipeline,” Sanders said. “Because it’s incredibly important to the long-term success of our team on the major league field.”</p>
<p>Few people know that better than Sanders, who’s highly regarded around the industry for the draft-related success that he had with the Toronto Blue Jays.</p>
<p>Sanders demurred when Zangrilli pressed him on whether a shortened draft would truly crush a team like the Pirates, saying it would be tough to have any sort of opinion when they’re still searching for clarity. But Sanders, again, did profess confidence that things would be OK.</p>
<p>“I think we trust that Major League Baseball will come to a resolution that works best for the game and hopefully all 30 teams,” Sanders said. “I’m confident the Pirates will be in a great spot regardless.”</p>
<p>Another area where Sanders will have an impact is also changing — the minor leagues. It’s possible, if not likely, that soon 42 teams will be removed from the system’s structure, almost all of them at the lower levels. Based on the most current list, the Pirates would lose a rookie-level affiliate in Bristol, Va.</p>
<p>Sanders played that one pretty straight, too, talking up how the Pirates prioritize developing young talent (Is there an organization that doesn’t?) and saying more specifics are required before anyone can truly have an option.</p>
<p>But Zangrilli and Sanders did together raise an interesting point: Is it better to stay status quo and develop players en masse, or does it make more sense to streamline, pouring more time, money and people into a smaller group of prospects? This is obviously something that would apply to both the draft and the minor leagues.</p>
<p>“It’s probably a balance,” Sanders said. “There are obviously benefits to both sides. If we’re looking to produce impact major leaguers, the more players with that type of potential that we can bring into the system and expose to our culture and our resources, that will help.</p>
<p>“At the same time, it’s a lot like being in school — with class size and the availability of resources and accessibility of coaches, the amount of one-on-one instruction. All of those things can be a little bit easier to capture in smaller groups.</p>
<p>“It’s not just about hoarding those players and hoping they get better. It’s about actively working to make them better. Obviously to do that, we need to have the resources at the development level.”</p>
