<h1>Ben Roethlisberger on Steelers-Titans postponement: 'We got the short end of the stick'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Steelers defensive end Cam Heyward isn’t busy being one of the NFL’s top defensive tackles, he’s involved in daily duties as the Steelers’ player rep for the NFLPA.</p>
<p>On Wednesday morning, news broke that more players around the league tested positive for COVID-19 after playing in games Sunday. Patriots cornerback Stephon Gilmore is one of them.</p>
<p>New England was allowed to travel to Kansas City and play the Chiefs despite the fact that its quarterback, Cam Newton, tested positive for the virus last week. A player from the Las Vegas Raiders also tested positive, joining the long list of players from the Tennessee Titans, who also had two more positive results Wednesday, putting their game against the Bills this weekend in jeopardy.</p>
<p>“I think the thing we have to realize is we’re not shunned form the world,” Heyward said. “As a country and as a world, we’re still dealing with this pandemic. To think we weren’t going to have positive tests is ludicrous.</p>
<p>“At the same time, what you’re trying to eliminate is to have it widespread throughout a community. We’re trying to wear masks. We’re trying to social distance. Everything keeps changing. You don’t know if it’s airborne or what. You’re trying to adhere to the protocols and just follow them. I can only preach it to the younger guys and the older guys as well. When you leave this facility it can have a lasting effect on this team. Everyone has to do their job.</p>
<p>“I don’t know how it transpired in Tennessee or anywhere else. There will be more positives. It’s our job to minimize how much it takes over a team. The things we’ve done to change that are adding to our practice squad because we understand there will be positives. If not, then it’s not a true pandemic. With those you have think if one or two guys get it, we’re able to respond accordingly. When it spreads throughout an entire team or coaching staff it’s going to be hard to deal with the effects of that.”</p>
<p>The Steelers had their game against the Titans postponed and rescheduled for Week 7. After more positive tests results came in late last week and over the weekend, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/10/05/roger-goodell-nfl-forfeits-covid-19-protocol-violations/stories/202010050115" target="_blank">sent a memo to teams</a> letting them know he will consider having teams forfeit games if they are found to have been careless in enforcing COVID-19 protocols.</p>
<p>That didn’t sit well with Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, who does not believe the league will consider a retroactive forfeit win against the Titans if they must forfeit their game Sunday against the Bills.</p>
<p>“Of course, we got the short end of the stick,” said Roethlisberger, who said he was just starting to get back into a rhythm before the league decided to postpone the Titans game.</p>
<p>How does Roethlisberger make sure the league’s decision doesn’t adversely affect his play?</p>
<p>“The league already tried to slow it down, so I guess I’ll start over from scratch and hope this week I didn’t take too many steps backward,” he said. “I guess we’ll just see how it goes this week.”</p>
<p>It’s clear Steelers players were not fans of the unexpected off week and now stare down the possibility of playing 13 consecutive games to end the regular season. But Heyward also said the players bear some responsibility in how the rest of the season unfolds as well.</p>
<p>“It was just a whirlwind,” Heyward said of last week.” You come in like a regular week, focused on your opponent. That’s the selfish part of me. I have to be a little more flexible in adjusting to this. A lot of things happened on the fly. We’re just trying to adapt to the situation.</p>
<p>“Things are going to change every minute now, and we have to be willing to adjust. I know the NFL and the NFLPA are trying to do right by the players and the coaches, but there’s only so much they can do. It’s going to take discipline for each player and each team to help accommodate that.”</p>
