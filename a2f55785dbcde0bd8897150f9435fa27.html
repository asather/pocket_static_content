<h1>Ordinance to ban ‘less lethal’ weapons fails in County Council committee</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Council’s Health and Human Services committee voted Wednesday to not recommend to the full council a bill to ban the use of “less lethal” crowd control weapons.</p>
<p>Despite the addition of two amendments, the bill failed in committee by a vote of 5-2.</p>
<p>The bill, co-sponsored by Olivia Bennett, D-Northview Heights, and Bethany Hallam, D-at large, came before council after police fired tear gas, pepper spray and “sponge” rounds during a protest in East Liberty on June 1.</p>
<p>The committee considered three amendments to the bill proposed by Councilman Tom Duerr, D-Bethel Park, in an attempt to reach a compromise among its members. The first amendment changed the language of the bill to move all of the “less lethal” devices, including rubber bullets, beanbag rounds and sponge grenades, under the description of “kinetic devices.”</p>
<p>The second amendment specified the ordinance will only apply to county police. Both amendments were approved by a 4-3 vote.</p>
<p>The third amendment, defeated 4-3, was intended to change the wording of the bill from an outright ban of the “less lethal” devices to allow them only in the case of “possible loss of life or serious bodily harm.”</p>
<p>“It was made very clear to us that outright banning these devices across the board would hinder our law enforcement agencies ... to operate in the most dangerous of circumstances,” Mr. Duerr said. “The example was given during one of our committee meetings about these devices being used during the Tree of Life shooting.”</p>
<p>Through discussions with bill co-sponsor Ms. Bennett, Mr. Duerr said he thought the “initial intent of this bill was not to hinder law enforcement … in viewing and protecting our constituents in those types of situations but to make sure these things are not being used pre-emptively in nonviolent protest situations.”</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam responded by stating that the original intention of the legislation was for an outright ban and that she is concerned the amendment leaves it up to the police officers to decide if there is a threat to use the weapons.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen many instances of folks losing their lives at the hands of police officers when they were unarmed and not threatening,” Ms. Hallam said. “So, I’m just worried that if we leave the interpretation of whether or not the person poses … a serious threat to the police officers who we are attempting to regulate, that the full intention of this ban will be misconstrued and abused.”</p>
<p>Committee chairperson Cindy Kirk, R-McCandless, said she would want police to stay equipped with the “less lethal” weapons defined in the bill.</p>
<p>“I would like, in my mind, to keep all the tools in their pocket,” Ms. Kirk said. “[I]f we add this amendment, I don’t see how it changes anything to what we have now.</p>
<p>Councilman Sam DeMarco, R-at large, said he’s also against banning the weapons.</p>
<p>“I just believe the more tools we can give the police to do their job, the less we have to [worry] about the use of deadly force being used,” he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Hallam said police have other “tools in their toolbox” to arrest people who are breaking the law.</p>
<p>“We could not be giving permission to anybody, police officers or citizens, who harm folks who are doing nothing but exercising their First Amendment rights to protest,” Ms. Hallam said.&nbsp;</p>
