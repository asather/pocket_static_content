<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Forget the Kardashians or the Bradys — the Bradshaws are coming to E!</p>
<p>The pop-culture focused TV network has greenlit "The Bradshaw Bunch," which will follow former Steeler Terry Bradshaw and his family in their "real-life hijinks to juggling football, fame and farm life," according to a news release from E! The series will debut this summer.</p>
<p>Aside from the football-player-turned-broadcaster, the docuseries will feature Bradshaw's wife, Tammy, daughters Rachel, Lacey and Erin, as well as grandchildren. The family lives in Oklahoma, although Bradshaw's ranch near the Texas border was put up for sale in November 2019, according to FOX Business.</p>
<p>Since his retirement from pro-football at the end of the 1983 Steelers season, Bradshaw has forayed into sports analysis, acting and horse-breeding.</p>
<p>“On the field, Terry is known to be a touchdown titan, but in reality, he spends most of his time surrounded by and supporting so many strong women in his family," E! executive vice president Rod Aissa said in a statement. "He’s the glue that holds that family together, and we’re excited that viewers will really get to see a side of him that they’ve never seen before."</p>
