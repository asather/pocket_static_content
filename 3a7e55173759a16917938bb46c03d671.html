<h1>Shiloh Grill on Mount Washington to close</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Shiloh Grill, the Mount Washington sister establishment to quirky and beloved Shadyside institution Harris Grill, will close permanently after the end of service Tuesday, according to a post on the restaurant’s social media platforms.</p>
<p>Known for a fun and funky atmosphere, an expansive outdoor patio, boozy drinks, a cheekily-written menu and their regular Tuesday “Bacon Night” promotion, Shiloh Grill opened on Shiloh Street in 2010.</p>
<p>The statement read:</p>
<p>“With heavy hearts, today we announce that Shiloh Grill will be closing after one more bacon night, Tuesday, July 28.</p>
<p>“We hope to see you all on the Mount one more time 'til then, as we're stocked and swinging Frozen Cosmos, brunch FroMosas, and Cosmos-a-GoGos til the very end.</p>
<p>“Thank you all for ten wonderful years of patronage, friendship, and memories.”</p>
<p>The original Harris Grill in Shadyside, which opened in the early 1960’s at 5747 Ellsworth Ave., has been closed since Feb. 2019 when an electrical fire tore through and gutted the interior. A Downtown location at 245 Fourth Ave. has been shuttered since the Covid-19 pandemic hit Pittsburgh.</p>
