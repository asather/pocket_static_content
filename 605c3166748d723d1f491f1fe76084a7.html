<h1>Prisons and jails in Pennsylvania halt visits in light of virus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prisons and jails statewide have restricted visitors in an attempt to halt the spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>As of Monday, there are 76 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/03/16/allegheny-county-covid-19-cases-coronavirus-pa-hotline/stories/202003160089" target="_blank">six confirmed cases in Allegheny County</a>.</p>
<p>Inmate visits at all state correctional institutions are canceled for all of this week and next week; the measures began statewide on Friday and are in effect for at least 14 days.</p>
<p>“This is a decision based on the Governor’s declaration of emergency. It is imperative for our system to mitigate the risks of COVID-19 entering and spreading within our facilities. This decision is to protect staff, inmates, family and friends by controlling who enters our facilities,” a department spokeswoman wrote in an email.</p>
<p>Prisons are conducting “enhanced screening” of staff, vendors and contracted providers, including chaplains, according to a statement from the Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>The screening includes taking people's temperatures and asking a series of questions. No one will be allowed in with flu-like symptoms or a temperature of 100.4 degrees or more, according to the Department of Corrections.</p>
<p>There are more than 40,000 inmates in state prisons.</p>
<p>At the Allegheny County Jail, no visits are allowed as of Monday, other than legal visits.</p>
<p>The only exceptions are “instances of end-of-life or when an inmate’s heath becomes severely critical and visitation from immediate family members, friends and religious leaders becomes necessary,” according to a statement on the county's website.</p>
<p>Marion Damick, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2016/07/17/Marion-Damick-a-tireless-advocate-for-the-incarcerated-to-be-honored/stories/201606160146" target="_blank">a longtime inmate advocate</a> and Pennsylvania Prison Society volunteer, said it is hard for prisoners to be without visits from loved ones, but also understands why officials would make the decision to close institutions to visitors to try to keep the disease out.</p>
<p>“They're doing the right thing, I think, by closing it,” she said of the Allegheny County Jail. “If someone developed a case, it would be pretty serious in there.”</p>
