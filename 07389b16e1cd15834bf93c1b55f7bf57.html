<p>With health officials regulating large gatherings due to the coronavirus outbreak, all theaters in Western Pennsylvania have been effectively shut down.</p>
<p>In addition to the virtual performance, the world premiere of Isaac Gomez’s “PerkUp PerKup,” which was due to open April 17, has been canceled, but will be presented&nbsp;as a podcast recording. The season-closing “#F***7thGrade,” by singer/songwriter Jill Sobule and Liza Birkenmeier, has been postponed.</p>
<p>The virtual performance of “Cry It Out,” the Molly Smith Metzler play about the hardships and joy of first-time motherhood, is made possible in partnership with Human Habits, artist unions, as well as the playwright. Tickets are $10-$40 at <a href="https://citytheatre.culturaldistrict.org/production/62853/cry-it-out." target="_blank">https://citytheatre.culturaldistrict.org/production/62853/cry-it-out. </a></p>
<p>Previous ticket buyers already have access to the video at CityTheatreCompany.org, and the link will be sent to them. Tickets for the canceled show may be refunded or donated to City Theatre, Pittsburgh’s theater for new plays on the South Side. More information is available by emailing&nbsp;boxoffice@citytheatrecompany.org.</p>
