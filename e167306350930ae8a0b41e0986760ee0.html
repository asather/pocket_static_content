<h1>Democratic candidates say they will fight to balance courts; protect reproductive rights</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CONCORD, N.H. —&nbsp;Blaming their own party’s lack of focus as the reason Republicans have been able to fill so many judicial seats the last three years, Democratic presidential candidates assured an audience of social justice advocates here Saturday that they’ll fight hard in the White House to balance the courts and protect women’s reproductive rights.</p>
<p>One after the other, the eight Democrats at the “Our Rights, Our Courts” forum at Concord Community College agreed in principle that the government should stay out of dictating what a woman does with her own health care, and that to protect that right, they’d have to reform the federal judiciary —&nbsp;including the Supreme Court —&nbsp;against the wishes of a Republican party that has dominated that battleground for years.</p>
<p>While they conceded there’s nothing they can do about the 187 judicial nominees confirmed to the federal bench during Donald Trump’s tenure so far, the candidates offered proposals that they said would protect Roe v. Wade, fund Planned Parenthood and put judges of their own on the bench.</p>
<p>Starting with former South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, several Democrats deemed it necessary to codify Roe v. Wade —&nbsp;which established a woman’s constitutional right to have an abortion —&nbsp;into federal law, so that “we’re not so much at the mercy of state legislatures when it comes to these fundamental rights,” as Mr. Buttigieg described.</p>
<p>“Individual Americans may have different views on where to draw the line, but we should be able to respect who gets to draw the line, and I trust women to make the best decisions for themselves,” Mr. Buttigieg said.</p>
<p>The candidates also found consensus in promising to end the “gag rule” on Title X funding that the Trump administration instituted to prevent clinics in the program from giving abortion provider referrals —&nbsp;a decision that led Planned Parenthood, the largest grant recipient of the funding, to withdraw from the program in August, according to an NBC News report at the time.</p>
<p>But to continue to protect women’s reproductive rights, it’ll require federal judicial appointees that put the rule of law over political ideology, they said.</p>
<p>“We need a court system that is independent of our political system,” Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said. “We need a court system that is not part of the tilt toward the right, enhancing the views and experiences of big corporations and rich people at the expense of everyone else.”</p>
<p>Part of that, Ms. Warren said, is nominating judges who are not “ideologically off to the far right.” But she also proposed, among other things, subjecting Supreme Court justices to ethics rules and instituting a procedure for individuals to file complaints against the justices, which they can do against federal judges.</p>
<p>Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who also mentioned the ethics of Supreme Court justices, said she’d be ready on the first day of her presidency to nominate judges backed by the American Bar Association to fill vacancies.</p>
<p>Also pledging to enter the White House prepared with a list of potential judges is Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said he thinks Democrats should do the same thing as Republicans and work to nurture and nominate young legal minds into federal court roles.</p>
<p>“The Republicans have been very effective in a way Democrats were not,” Mr. Sanders said. “I have said many times that as president of the United States, our administration will be different.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders disagreed with opponents who proposed expanding the Supreme Court, saying that it’d be a cycle of parties adding justices until “you have 87” on the bench.</p>
<p>One of the proponents of adding justices, Mr. Buttigieg, said one idea would be putting 15 members on the bench, 10 of whom are confirmed normally and another five promoted by the lower courts with unanimous buy-in from the original ten.</p>
<p>Pressed on how that could be accomplished in the current political climate, Mr. Buttigieg said that although structural reform is a long journey, the best solution is to make sure Mitch McConnell is no longer Senate Majority Leader.</p>
<p>If that doesn’t happen, Mr. Buttigieg said, it’ll take uniting Americans and making sure Senate Republicans face political consequences.</p>
<p>“This is our only chance to defeat Donald Trump, yes, but we’ve also gotta do it with a big enough margin to send Trumpism into the history books, and part of that is making sure his enablers in Congress are rejected too,” Mr. Buttigieg said.</p>
