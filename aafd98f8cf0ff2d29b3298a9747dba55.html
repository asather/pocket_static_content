<h1>Mike Tomlin still mum on right tackle and the status of David DeCastro</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Six days before the Steelers open the season against the Giants on “Monday Night Football,” coach Mike Tomlin didn’t provide many answers on Tuesday about who will be lining up as the starting five on his offensive line.</p>
<p>The center and left side of his line are set with Maurkice Pouncey at center and Matt Feiler and Alejandro Villanueva at left guard and tackle. It remains to be seen if right guard Dave DeCastro will be ready, and Tomlin still has not named a starter at right tackle.</p>
<p>DeCastro, who is dealing with a lower-body injury, did not practice Monday, referred to as a bonus day by Tomlin because the Steelers have a couple of extra days to prepare this week. All Tomlin would say Tuesday is that DeCastro is “excited about getting out there with his teammates as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>Stefen Wisniewski, who was signed in March as a free agent, would start in place of DeCastro if he is unable to play. DeCastro started all 16 games last season and has only missed four games since 2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Zach Banner and Chukwuma Okorafor continue to compete for the job at right tackle. When the Steelers revealed their first official depth chart of the season Monday, it listed Banner <em>OR</em> Okorafor as the starter.</p>
<p>“I’m comfortable with the prospects at right tackle,” Tomlin said Tuesday during a Zoom call. “It’s been a tough decision because I feel like we have two starter-capable guys. We’ll quickly sort that out this week.”</p>
<p>It was the first time Tomlin addressed the media since last week, and he believes the depth added over the weekend will help. The Steelers signed Josh Dobbs, whom they selected in the fourth round of the 2017 draft, to be the No. 3 quarterback, Sean Davis to be the top reserve at safety and Dustin Colquitt to handle the punting duties.</p>
<p>Tomlin specifically mentioned Dobbs’ running ability that he believes will be an asset. Dobbs played for the Steelers for two seasons before being traded to the Jaguars last summer for a fifth-round pick. He was released by the Jaguars on Saturday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe it will add depth and competition on our roster,” Tomlin said. “We’re excited to have Josh Dobbs back in the fold. He’s intelligent and he has mobility. When you’re a No. 3 quarterbacks it’s good to have a trait like that gives you a winning edge. That’s one of the reasons we reacquired him.”</p>
<p>Tomlin said Davis, a former starter at safety from 2016 until he was injured in the second game of last season, will immediately regain his role as a core special-teams player. He said Colquitt’s experience was a big factor in choosing him over Jordan Berry, who had been the team’s punter since 2015.</p>
<p>“We have a great deal of comfort that he can deliver in a variety of circumstances,” Tomlin said.</p>
