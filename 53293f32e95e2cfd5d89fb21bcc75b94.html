<h1>Jason Momoa's visit makes it a super(hero) morning at Children's Hospital</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Actor Jason Momoa appeared to make a big impression on patients at UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh Monday morning.</p>
<p>How could he not? The&nbsp;“Aquaman” star, in town to shoot a Netflix feature film thriller, casts a large, cheerful shadow. He posted pictures from the event on his Instagram page (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B7i8nO4A6l4/" target="_blank">@prideofgypsies</a>) not long after, writing&nbsp;“the greatest part of being aquaman is making children happy spreading aloha had a little time before work to stop by UPMC children’s hospital of pittsburgh met so many brave strong babies all my aloha to the families. me an joshua bet that if he beat me in arm wrestling he gets to have my trident. See u on set of aquaman 2 joshua. stay strong.”</p>
<p>In the post, he embedded a video of arm wrestling with a boy named Joshua. He invites the kid to visit him on set of the&nbsp;“Aquaman” sequel.</p>
<p>“If you win,&nbsp; you’re coming. If I win, you’re still coming,” he says. Joshua takes him down easily.</p>
<p>Momoa has been all over the city since the shoot began late last year. His social media account also features taking in a Steelers game, standing with Ben Roethlisberger on the sidelines and hanging out at a Penguins game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The shoot for&nbsp;“Sweet Girl,” which also stars Marisa Tomei, has had locations around the North Shore stadiums and one memorable night when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/12/Helicopter-traffic-north-side-filming-of-Sweet-Girl/stories/202001120146" target="_blank">helicopters</a> took to the skies and closed roads below.</p>
