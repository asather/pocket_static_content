<h1>Washington County man charged with attempting to set girlfriend on fire, holding her hostage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Washington County man is being held in jail without bond after police say he abused his girlfriend for nearly three days by repeatedly beating her and attempting to set her on fire at his residence in Canonsburg.</p>
<p>Police said they were made aware of the abuse Tuesday by a third party and went to explore it. While there, officials learned the assaults had endured for two to three days beginning April 19 at Douglas J. Schrecengost’s apartment in the 300 block of Hunting Creek Road, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>His girlfriend of three years, Marisa McCaffrey, told police in an interview Tuesday that over the course of a couple days, Schrecengost, 37, had stepped on her chest and cut off her breathing, pushed her, broken her eye glasses and bit her while inside the home. She said he broke apart a wooden door jam and struck her with the pieces, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>He poured rubbing alcohol on the bed while she was in it and tried to set her on fire, the complaint said. Schrecengost also recorded his actions via cellphone and texted it to Ms. McCaffrey, she told authorities. Police reviewed the footage and said he could be heard saying&nbsp;“... she really is burning” in the video.</p>
<p>At some point, Schrecengost prevented her from calling for help by taking her phone, police said in the complaint. It was later found in&nbsp;Schrecengost’s pocket when they arrested him Tuesday after their interview with the woman.</p>
<p>Police said in the complaint Ms. McCaffrey had “numerous” injuries that appeared recent and some partially healed. The severity of her injuries was not made clear.</p>
<p>Her&nbsp;testimony of the incident was corroborated by the video and her injuries, police said.</p>
<p>Authorities said they found a near-empty bottle of rubbing alcohol, liquid marks on the bed, broken door frames and broken glass as they searched the apartment.</p>
<p>He is charged with felony counts of aggravated assault and arson, as well as simple assault, reckless endangerment and other drug charges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for May 4 before Washington County District Judge Michael L. Manfredi.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schrecengost is being held at the Washington County jail without bail due to safety concerns for the victim and pending charges from previous assaults against her, court records show.</p>
<p>A trial is set for July in Allegheny on charges of strangulation, simple assault, harassment and drug charges from an incident in November 2019. Police said in the complaint that Schrecengost assaulted the same woman in that case.</p>
<p>Court records show he has unrelated charges dating as far back as 2011, including DUI, accidents involving damage, careless driving, attempting to flee officers, and other drug charges.</p>
