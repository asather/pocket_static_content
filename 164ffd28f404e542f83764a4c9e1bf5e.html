<h1>With playoffs on horizon, Riverhounds ride late header to 2-1 win</h1>

<p>As he saw it, Albert Dikwa had to make things right.</p>
<p>In three different instances in the previous 15 minutes, the Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC striker had a chance to break a 1-1 deadlock with Philadelphia Union II late in the second half. Each time, he had failed to convert. It was understandable -- soccer is a sport in which scoring is often at a premium, meaning such opportunities successfully materialize only so frequently -- but with his team desperately seeking three points in its regular season finale in a heated fight for playoff positioning, he needed to come through.</p>
<p>So as the second minute of stoppage time rolled along and Dikwa watched as Kenardo Forbes’ corner kick made its way to him over a sea of bodies in a crowded box, only one thing ran through his mind.</p>
<p>“I was telling myself ‘Dikwa, you have to make this one. You have to make it,’” Dikwa said.</p>
<p>He didn’t let himself or his team down.</p>
<p>A header from Dikwa with only about three minutes remaining in the match snuck inside the far post and past the goalkeeper’s reach, giving the Riverhounds a 2-1 victory Saturday night at Highmark Stadium. With the win, the club finishes the regular season 11-4-1 and temporarily takes over first place in their group standings as the USL Championship playoffs loom.</p>
<p>That standing was thanks to Dikwa, who was brought in the match in the 69th minute and provided a spark for a team that had been on its heels a bit in the second half after largely controlling the first.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds had dictated the flow of the game with a goal in the 15th minute from defender Ray Lee, who found the back of the net off a cheeky, well-crafted play in which midfielder Robbie Mertz cut across the box and drew the attention of the Philadelphia defense before rolling it behind him to an open Lee without so much as looking at his teammate.</p>
<p>In the 61st minute, however, one of the many long, arcing lobs from Philadelphia that failed to find an attacker’s feet in the first half got behind the Riverhounds’ back line. As defender Skylar Thomas tried to prevent a Union II striker from getting to the ball, he brought his opponent down in the box, giving it a penalty kick Jack McGlynn converted two minutes later.</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a PK we should give up,” Riverhounds coach Bob Lilley said. “They had hit long balls all night. On the back side, Skylar and Ryan have to be able to see the runners. We’re jogging back on the back side. They’re sprinting and we’re ball-watching.”</p>
<p>Whatever agony the Riverhounds felt only lasted for so long, though it took until the game’s final minutes to be relieved. Dikwa’s fourth chance at a goal proved to be his best one, with 6-foot-4 striker Steevan Dos Santos drawing much of the defense’s attention with a run to the near post that created space for Dikwa to have a clear enough look at goal at the back post.</p>
<p>“I know there are a lot of big guys in there, so I just tried to put it in a dangerous area and let them go get it,” Forbes said.</p>
<p>Now, with the desired three points secured, the waiting game begins for the Riverhounds.</p>
<p>Two points behind them is Hartford Athletic, which wraps up its regular season tomorrow night against New York Red Bulls II, which Hartford is 3-0 against this season, though two of those victories came by just a single goal each. Should Hartford win, the Riverhounds will finish second in the group and head on the road for the first round of the playoffs against Louisville City FC. A loss or a tie will give them a home match against Saint Louis FC.</p>
<p>The win was one Lilley said wasn’t his team’s best performance, but it was an important one. Most of all, with the playoffs now awaiting the Riverhounds, it was a potentially instructive one.</p>
<p>“With the way the game happened and the way the result was achieved reminds us anything can happen,” Lilley said. “We’re not all doom and gloom from last week. If we stick to it, we can find ways. I think that’s a good message going into the playoffs.”</p>
