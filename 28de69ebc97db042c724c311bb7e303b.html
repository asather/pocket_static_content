<h1>Chrism Mass will be held Aug. 4, Pittsburgh diocese announces after months of delay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh announced Monday the Diocese Chrism Mass will be celebrated on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The Chrism Mass, which is normally held on Holy Thursday, is when priests renew the vows they made on their ordination day.</p>
<p>“What an appropriate day it is for us to renew our priestly promises, inspired as we must be by the Curé of Ars,” Bishop David Zubik said.</p>
<p>During the Mass, Bishop Zubik also will consecrate the holy chrism and bless the oil of the sick and the oil of the catechumens, which is used for baptisms.</p>
<p>The Mass will be held on the Feast Day of St. John Vianney, the patron saint of parish priests.</p>
<p>St. John Vianney is often referred to as the “Curé of Ars” due to his pastoral work in Ars, France, in the mid-18th century.</p>
<p>The Chrism Mass is usually held at St. Paul’s Cathedral on Holy Thursday, with all priests in the diocese invited. The diocese said in its announcement, however, that due to the increase of COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County and with the safety of attendees in mind, it had decided to limit participation to a select number of priests, deacons and seminarians.</p>
<p>Despite the attendance restrictions, the announcement said the event will be live-streamed on the diocese website.</p>
<p>“While I am clearly disappointed that not all of you will be able to attend the Chrism Mass, I trust that you can appreciate the measures taken for the protection of all,” Bishop Zubik said.</p>
