<h1>Obituary: Rosemarie E. Cibik | Educator who broke barriers in state</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rosemarie Cibik didn’t just break glass ceilings. She shattered them.</p>
<p>At age 26, she was the youngest public high school principal in the state.</p>
<p>Nearly 30 years later, she was named the first female school superintendent in Allegheny County —&nbsp;and just the second statewide —&nbsp;at Baldwin-Whitehall School District.</p>
<p>In 1988, she became the first layperson to serve as superintendent of schools in the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“She was a brilliant woman and she was masterful at what she did,” said her former colleague Archabbot Douglas Nowicki of the St. Vincent Archabbey. “I think she was probably the first laywoman in the country to hold the position that she did in a diocesan structure.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cibik, 96, of East Washington, died Feb. 28 after a series of recent health setbacks.</p>
<p>Becoming an educator was more a product of the times than a childhood dream for Ms. Cibik, who grew up in an era when most women became nurses, teachers or stay-at-home mothers.</p>
<p>“She wanted to be an attorney,” said her daughter Dr. Lisa Cibik, an East Washington ophthalmologist.</p>
<p>Instead, Ms. Cibik inspired her other daughter, Melanie S. Cibik and her granddaughter Alexandra M. Good, to pursue careers in the law.</p>
<p>Ms. Cibik graduated as valedictorian of her 1941 class at McKeesport High School and excelled as a member of its elite debate team.</p>
<p>“They were a championship debate team and she was the best extemporaneous speaker east of the Mississippi,” said Ms. Good, of Mount Washington.</p>
<p>“She really prided herself on her oratory abilities,” Dr. Cibik agreed.</p>
<p>Her talent earned Ms. Cibik a debate scholarship to the University of Pittsburgh, where she graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor’s and master's degree in education.</p>
<p>It was during her years pursuing a doctorate degree at Pitt that Ms. Cibik, nee Scavariel, met fellow grad student Edward P. Cibik Jr.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The couple married June 15, 1955. Mr. Cibik, who also was an educator and administrator, died in 2011.</p>
<p>“My dad said he married my mom because she was the smartest person in the class,&nbsp;and she married him because he was the most handsome,” her daughter said. “They were consummate educators and a great team.”</p>
<p>Ms. Cibik taught briefly in Ohio before 1949, when she was appointed principal of the former Robinson Township High School.</p>
<p>“Many of the pupils were older than she was because they were returning GIs,” Ms. Good said.</p>
<p>By 1956, Ms. Cibik left the job market to raise her daughters, returning in 1960 to Point Park University, a junior college at that time.</p>
<p>She served as a professor and chair of the school’s education department.</p>
<p>Helping the then-small college achieve success was important to her, said her daughter.</p>
<p>“She even worked for a year without pay,” she said.</p>
<p>An adventuress who yearned to explore foreign shores, Ms. Cibik and her husband visited all seven continents over the years and even once decided to forego a new car to take their daughters to Europe.</p>
<p>“We had this broken-down Chevy station wagon and instead of trading it in, they took us to Europe for a month,” her daughter recalled.</p>
<p>By 1976, Ms. Cibik began working as a supervisor of elementary curriculum and instruction at Baldwin-Whitehall. Two years later, she was named superintendent.</p>
<p>In 1980, she was recognized by the National School Boards Association as one of the top 100 school executives in North America.</p>
<p>She retired as superintendent in 1986 but quickly found herself once again in the fray.</p>
<p>“Initially, I’d asked her if she would chair a committee to oversee ways to improve libraries in our school system and she readily agreed,” Archabbot Nowicki said.</p>
<p>Stepping out on a limb, he inquired whether she might be interested in helping to lead the Catholic school system as its superintendent.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘If you think I have the qualifications, I’d be happy to do that,’” he recalled, laughing. “Well, she had the most sterling qualifications —&nbsp;there was no question about that.”</p>
<p>Under her leadership, all of the schools in the district received national accreditation for the first time, Archabbot Nowicki said.</p>
<p>“It built confidence in the Catholic schools, especially those in Pittsburgh,” he said. “She turned out to be a dynamic leader and inspiration to all of us. It was really a pleasure to work with her.”</p>
<p>When Archabbot Nowicki left in 1991 for St. Vincent, Ms. Cibik took over his role as secretary of education for the district. She retired in 1994.</p>
<p>Ms. Cibik was “a quintessential teacher at heart and an exemplary woman of the Church,” Bishop David Zubik said.</p>
<p>“She combined both qualities to guide the direction of our Catholic schools first as superintendent and then as the secretary of education with a vision that enhanced the academic and faith formation of our students,” he said.</p>
<p>Petite and fashionable, Ms. Cibik always took pride in her appearance, her family said.</p>
<p>“She never lost her femininity,” her daughter said. “She was a strong, feminine woman in what was predominantly a man’s world.”</p>
<p>“She was 4-11 and always had on at least 5 pounds of jewelry with high heels and some shade of Chanel lipstick,” her granddaughter recalled. “She always thought you should look your best.”</p>
<p>Along with her daughters and granddaughter, Dr. Cibik was survived by her grandson Edward Domenico.</p>
<p>Her funeral was Monday.</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial donations to Point Park University.</p>
