<h1>PIAA sets sites for second-round basketball playoff games</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Butler and Upper St. Clair played a memorable WPIAL boys basketball semifinal game almost two weeks ago that went to overtime before Butler pulled out a win. The rematch will take place in a few days.</p>
<p>Butler will play Upper St. Clair in a PIAA Class 6A second-round game Wednesday, 7 p.m. at North Allegheny High School. On Sunday, the PIAA announced sites and starting times for all second-round games and Butler vs. Upper St. Clair is one of the most anticipated contests. It will be the only game played at North Allegheny Wednesday.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/02/26/WPIAL-6A-semifinals-Butler-Upper-St-Clair-overtime-Mt-Lebanon-Central-Catholic/stories/202002260227" target="_blank">Butler beat Upper St. Clair, 83-78, in the WPIAL semifinals</a>, it was the second game of a Class 6A doubleheader at Robert Morris University’s UPMC Events Center. The two games drew 3,500 fans. For whatever reason, the PIAA is holding the Butler-Upper St. Clair rematch at a high school.</p>
<p>North Allegheny has one of the bigger gyms in the WPIAL, holding a little more than 2,200 fans. The Butler-Upper St. Clair game figures to be a hot ticket. Tickets (adults and students) will be sold Monday, starting at 10 a.m. at Upper St. Clair, and 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at Butler. Prices are $8 for adults and $4 for students.</p>
<p>North Allegheny athletic director Bob Bozzuto said tickets will not be available at North Allegheny until the night of the game and ticket windows will not open until 6 p.m. Student tickets will not be sold the night of the game. No one will be allowed to enter the gym until 6 p.m. Butler fans should enter the building at the gym entrance while Upper St. Clair fans should enter at the front of the school.</p>
