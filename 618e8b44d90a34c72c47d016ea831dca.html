<h1>How Police drummer Stewart Copeland picked Pittsburgh for world premiere of 'Satan's Fall'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the drummer for The Police, Stewart Copeland was never much into opera or choral music, unless you count Sting braying “Rawwx-anne!” somewhere in that category.</p>
<p>In fact, we might not be talking about him doing a world premiere with the Mendelssohn Choir this weekend had he not made an offhand remark on “Entertainment Tonight” back in the mid-’80s.</p>
<p>The setup is that while The Police were still in business, Francis Ford Coppola asked him to write a score for the 1983 film “Rumble Fish.” It sent him back to the music books, because although Copeland had been a music major at the San Diego College of Performing Arts, sheet music had become a foreign language to him&nbsp;while he was playing drums for The Police. He earned a Golden Globe nomination for “Rumble Fish,” and then, in 1986, just before The Police went into a studio session for what could have led to a follow-up to “Synchronicity,” Copeland broke his collarbone falling from a horse in a polo match.</p>
<p>Sting moved on with the solo career he started in ’85 with “The Dream of Blue Turtles” — to big success.&nbsp;The Police broke up, and Copeland, rather than jumping into another band, delved deeper into movie scores, working on such films as “Wall Street” and “Talk Radio.”</p>

<p>It led to him scoring the San Francisco Ballet’s 1986 production of “King Lear,” and while doing press for that, “Entertainment Tonight” asked him if he’d do another ballet, to which he responded, “After I write my opera.”</p>
<p>That was purely a joke.</p>
<p>But not to the 15-year-old son of Cleveland Opera director David Bamberger. He talked his dad into connecting with Copeland, who was game for anything and delivered the operatic adventure “Holy Blood and Crescent Moon” in 1989. It opened the door to more choral and orchestral projects, including “The Tyrant’s Crush,” his concerto for drum set and percussion with the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra in 2016.</p>
<p>Cut to the Mendelssohn, which had great success with Steve Hackman’s Bob Dylan oratorio in 2017 and was looking for another potential pop-culture crossover.</p>
<p>Robert Moir, a former PSO administrator, put the Mendelssohn in touch with Copeland, who happened to have something lying around with the intriguing title of “Satan’s Fall.”</p>
<p>“I actually had an oratorio hibernating — not so much hibernating but just gestating — that was originally commissioned years ago [around 2004] for the Melbourne Conservatory,” Copeland said in an interview last week. “But then the commissioning guy there left or got fired and, for whatever reason, mission incomplete. Then I was going to do it with my good buddy Julian Wachner at the Trinity Church [in New York], and I pulled it off the shelf, dusted it off again and worked on it more, but, oh darn, they’ve got to renovate the church, so it went back on the shelf, and then Bob Moir called. I will be doing it with Trinity Church in Manhattan, but while they were snoozing, Pittsburgh and the Mendelssohn Choir got in there for the world premiere.”</p>
<p>His Cleveland opera was derived from “The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail,” a book set during the Crusades. That interested the Virginia native in part because of his early years living in Egypt and Cairo, while his father was with the CIA.</p>
<p>“Paradise Lost” factored into his boarding school years as a teenager in the late ’60s, after the family settled in England.</p>
<p>“I was in an English boarding school,” Copeland said, “and I’m finding out that they do this to American kids as well: They ram Milton’s ‘Paradise Lost’ down the kids’ throats as a work of great literature. None of them would probably read it voluntarily, and nor would I have, except that the purple language stuck with me, this powerful language — every adjective is the absolute limit of description.”</p>
<p>Milton — blind, suffering from gout and grieving over the loss of his wife and infant daughter — began the 10-book, 10,000-line epic poem in 1658 and completed it in 1662, composing it entirely through dictation.</p>
<p>“The larger work is about Adam and Eve losing paradise, getting kicked out of Eden,” Copeland said. “Within it is a story of Satan getting kicked out of heaven. And it asked the question of ‘How can an almighty creator of the universe have an adversary?’ If he’s the boss, he’s the boss. Why would he have an adversary? I was intrigued by this. What is Satan’s problem? There he is an archangel: What’s his problem? And you find out in book’s V and VI of ‘Paradise Lost.’”</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: Satan wants the same powers that God possesses and forms his own army in heaven.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it’s a metal band’s dream, which is why bands like Symphony X and Cradle of Filth have turned it into concept albums. Before that, “Paradise Lost” served as text for Joseph Haydn’s 18th-century oratorio “Die Schöpfung” and Krzysztof Penderecki’s 20th-century opera “Paradise Lost.” Copeland says he didn’t seek out those or any other prior adaptations when he sat down to write “Satan’s Fall.”</p>
<p>It uses Milton’s language, but “I carved it up,” he said. “I reduced 15,000 words to 3,000 words. The overall thing is 100,000 words, but books V and VI are 15,000 words. He qualifies every adjective with a paragraph of simile.</p>
<p>“Once I unwound the syntax and stripped it down to the actual action, the language just called out for many voices. And I did a little jiggery, pokery,” he said. “The actual action in the Milton version, archangel Gabriel comes down to warn Adam and Eve about this character called Satan, and as he warns them, he tells them the story of what’s up with Satan. And that’s the story within the story we have in this oratorio.”</p>
<p>He took some liberties with the archangel.</p>
<p>“I split Gabriel into Gabriel and Gabriela so that we could have more variety of vocal sound. And the chorus, they do sound effects They amplify Gabriel and Gabriela. Sometimes they’re the demon army, sometimes they’re the army of righteousness, but they are always pumped. Actually, that’s not true. As relief from these raging battle scenes, there is some pretty, some pretty s—t.”</p>
<p>In the press notes, Matthew Mehaffey, music director of the Mendelssohn Choir, describes “Satan’s Fall” as “part ‘Carmina Burana,’ part musical theater, part hard rock, and very intense rhythmically. It’s almost like an extended 1970s rock opera.”</p>
<p>Asked about that, Copeland said, “A rock opera makes me think of ‘Tommy.’ This is not ‘Tommy.’ This would be a metal opera. It just doesn’t come from guitar. It’s 80 voices raised in anger, and the subject matter is extremely gothic.”</p>
<p>Joining the Mendelssohn to perform the 35-minute piece will be a 14-piece ensemble of strings, winds and percussion, along with guest soloists Nathan Granner (a founding member of the American Tenors) and Jamie Chamberlin, a soprano who sang in Copeland’s fifth opera, “The Invention of Morel,” in 2018.</p>
<p>Copeland will be at the Roxian in McKees Rocks for both nights of the oratorio, which was commissioned by the Mendelssohn, along with Huddersfield Choral Society in the U.K., Pepperdine University, Trinity Church Wall Street, Montclair State University and VocalEssence.</p>
<p>The first half of the evening will find Copeland conducting “O Fortuna” from Carl Orff’s “Carmina Burana” and talking about “Satan’s Fall.” The Mendelssohn will round out the first half with its take on The Rolling Stones’ “Sympathy for the Devil.”</p>
<p>The following weekend, Copeland will be back on drums, launching a tour with Oysterhead, the experimental fusion trio he formed in 2000 with Trey Anastasio of Phish and Les Claypool of Primus. The timing isn’t great, because he has three operas in production this year and only two are written, but he couldn’t say no.</p>
<p>“We’d been intending to do this forever, but those two other guys have got thriving careers on stage, and suddenly all three of our itineraries have an opening,” he said. “Actually, mine didn’t because I have to write all this stuff, but since I’m at my desk I can move things around more easily than the other two guys.</p>
<p>“When you’re in the rock ’n’ roll business, you make an album, you release it, you tour it — the whole schedule, it eats your life. That’s why I don’t make records anymore. I produce scores. I create documents instead. If you want to hear my album, you have to hire 12 singers and an orchestra and a theater. In the case of ‘Satan,’ you have to hire 80 singers. By some miracle, there are choirs around the country, and in England, too, who are doing that.”</p>
