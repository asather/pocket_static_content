<h1>Senior-care facilities, Washington Health System respond to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Several senior living facilities around Southwestern Pennsylvania — home to thousands of Pennsylvanians —&nbsp;such as Concordia Lutheran Ministries, St. Barnabas Health System and Presbyterian SeniorCare Network say they are all taking precautionary measures to protect their residents from the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>All three facilities say they are following CDC guidelines and recommendations from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Many of the guidelines established by the individual facilities — such as limiting visitation and increasing sanitary measures — are similar to the CDC’s.</p>
<p>Among the few exceptions the facilities are making will be allowing families to visit those who are in hospice or end of life care. All three senior care facilities say their guidelines are subject to change as more updates on the virus arrive.</p>
<p>Frank Skrip, the director of public relations for Concordia, said the company is allowing but discouraging visitors. For those who do decide to visit a resident, Mr. Skrip said faculty members will screen visitors and ask them to limit physical contact and limit where they travel within the facility.</p>
<p>Mr. Skrip said Concordia’s guidelines have been changing day-to-day and may be subject to change.</p>
<p>He said Concordia is encouraging families to contact the activities department at its various facilities to discuss alternative methods of visitation such as a video chat.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the safety and well-being of our residents is our top priority,” Mr. Skrip said.</p>
<p>In terms of precautionary measures inside the facilities, Mr. Skrip said they have increased staff education on the virus, posted informative signs around the facility, increased the amount of hand sanitizer stations and are paying closer attention to public areas such as handrails and sinks.</p>
<p>Group activities also will be restricted, Mr. Skrip said.</p>
<p>“It’s like walking a tightrope,” he said. “You want to make sure you’re keeping your people safe while still maintaining the quality of life that they are used to. So it’s a difficult rope to walk.”</p>
<p>Natalie McKay, a nursing administrator for Concordia, said the changing guidelines have generally been met with understanding.</p>
<p>“We’re doing our best to alleviate any fears. For the most part, we’ve heard very positive feedback,” Ms. McKay said. “We’re trying to put (plans) in place without being overly restrictive, without being overly reactive. Because there’s a balance between protecting residents and protecting their quality of life.”</p>
<p>Presbyterian SeniorCare Network said they are implementing a&nbsp;“no visitation policy” on Friday until further notice for its skilled nursing and rehabilitation centers, personal care and assisted living communities, according to a statement.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“With a spirit of love for those in our care, we have made the difficult decision to restrict visitation in our care communities,” Paul Winkler the CEO and president of the organization said.&nbsp;“We have taken this action to provide the highest level of protection possible to our patients and residents.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Presbyterian said it is “implementing a variety of screening measures” for visitors in addition to limiting in-person meetings, canceling large group meetings and providing education on social distancing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kristin Hambleton, vice president of sales and marketing at Presbyterian, said finding a way to keep residents safe without causing social isolation is a concern.</p>
<p>That was echoed by Alicia Fenstermacher, Presbyterian’s corporate director of community life. “[W]ithout social interaction, there is an increased risk for depression and anxiety,” she said in a statement. “Purposeful programming is part of our everyday life in our communities. We need to provide people with a reason to engage despite what is going on with COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Similar measures have been taken at St. Barnabas. At their multiple living assistant and skilled nursing facilities in Allegheny and Butler County, visitors will be restricted employees and a limited number of family members for hospice patients.</p>
<p>Jim Lauteri, the marketing director at St. Barnabas, said they have increased informative flyers, hand sanitizers, sanitary housekeeping and postponed large social events. Residents feeling ill will have in-home access to doctors and nurse practitioners.</p>
<p>“That’s a big benefit because residents don’t have to worry about how to get to their doctors,” Mr. Lauteri said.</p>
<p>“We’ve been caring for this community for 120 years so we go the extra mile to make sure our residents are safe,” Mr. Lauteri said.</p>
<p><strong>How to help support older adults</strong></p>
<p>According to the CDC, family members and caregivers can help older adults who are at risk by:</p>
<p>● Knowing what medications they are taking and help them;</p>
<p>● Monitor and create a back-up plan on necessary food and medical supplies (oxygen, incontinence, dialysis, wound care);</p>
<p>● Stock up on non-perishable food items to minimize trips to the store;</p>
<p>● If they are living in a care facility, monitor the situation and ask about the health of other residents frequently and know the protocol if there is an outbreak.</p>
<p><strong>Other visitation restrictions</strong></p>
<p>Washington Health System also will be restricting visitors.</p>
<p>Starting Friday at noon, Washington and WHS-Greene hospitals will limit visiting hours to noon to 7 p.m. daily, except for the emergency room. Visitors will be screened for fever, cough or flu-like symptoms by hospital staff and asked to leave if illness is suspected.</p>
<p>WHS is limiting visitors to no more than one per adult patient; visitors under age 18 will not be allowed in the system’s hospitals in Washington and Greene counties.</p>
