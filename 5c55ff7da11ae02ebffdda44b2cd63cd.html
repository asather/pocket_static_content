<h1>Should booze be restricted? It's putting world at greater risk of COVID-19, WHO says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The World Health Organization rattled booze lovers Wednesday with an alert in Europe calling for governments there to set an example and restrict access to alcohol during coronavirus lockdowns.</p>
<p>Alcoholic drinks compromise the immune system, the WHO warned, and intoxicated people take unnecessary risks that can put them in danger of contracting a virus blamed for about 140,000 deaths worldwide as of Thursday.</p>
<p>Then there's this: "Fear and misinformation have generated a dangerous myth that consuming high-strength alcohol can kill the COVID-19 virus. It does not," the WHO said in the same press release.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>In fact, it can be deadly. In Iran, for example, 44 people died after drinking bootleg alcohol that was too strong. The alcohol was concocted after rumors spread it would kill the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Americans reacted to the idea of restrictions the way Americans typically react when things get personal.</p>
<p>"Alcohol being restricted during the coronavirus pandemic should be viewed as an act of war against people who love freedom," Daily Caller editor-in-chief David Hookstead wrote Thursday. "Even though I am a peace loving man, I will go Clint Eastwood in a heartbeat in order to save our alcohol supply."</p>
<p>Broad restrictions on alcohol sales in the United States have not been proposed, though Pennsylvania famously closed all state-owned liquor stores early in the pandemic. Some hard-hit cities and counties have also limited convenience store alcohol sales, including multiple communities in New Mexico.</p>
<p>Sales of alcoholic beverages in the nation rose drastically in March as the virus prompted stay-at-home orders, including a 55% rise during the third week of March, reports MarketWatch.com.</p>
<p>Industry experts refer to that period as "Week 12," when panicked shoppers rushed stores and bought all the toilet paper, hand sanitizer and frozen pizzas they could hold.</p>
<p>Beer flew off grocery store shelves, too, and there is anecdotal evidence people went for their old favorites -- "comfort beers" -- rather than experimenting with something new.</p>
<p>"If they were going to be stuck at home, they wanted to be stuck with something they knew and liked," Lester Jones of the National Beer Wholesalers Association told McClatchy News.</p>
<p>Bars were closed across the nation for safety reasons, but governors in many states "deemed liquor stores, wineries, distilleries and other providers of alcoholic beverages as essential businesses," Axios.com reports.</p>
<p>So why is the World Health Organization in Europe suggesting limits on alcohol consumption?</p>
<p>For starters, Europe "is the region with the highest alcohol intake and the highest prevalence of drinkers in the population," the WHO said in a release.</p>
<p>If limiting alcohol works there, it might work elsewhere, experts guess.</p>
<p>"Alcohol consumption is associated with a range of communicable and noncommunicable diseases and mental health disorders, which can make a person more vulnerable to COVID-19," the WHO reported Wednesday.</p>
<p>"In particular, alcohol compromises the body's immune system and increases the risk of adverse health outcomes. Therefore, people should minimize their alcohol consumption at any time, and particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic."</p>
<p>Alcohol is responsible for 3 million deaths a year worldwide, according to the WHO.</p>
