<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Is the Steelers' offensive line good enough?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em><br><br><strong>Franklin:</strong> What are your thoughts on the Steelers offensive line? Do you think the loss of David DeCastro will be a major factor Monday?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> They have a veteran guard in Stefan Wisniewski who is ready to step in. He started the last two Super Bowls, so I’m fairly certain he is going to be able to play at a competent level. He will be fine. I don’t see that being a factor at all. The only question we have about the offensive line is at right tackle. It sounds like Zach Banner has won that position. He hasn’t played extensively yet, so we don’t know what to expect. If he can play at a reasonably high level, the offensive line will be fine.</p>
<p><strong>Peter:</strong> Why don’t you do some research before you write stupid articles. What is you basis for predicting the Steelers to be only 9-7? They will win 11 games minimum and anyone who knows the team understands that.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I have been in this business 20-plus years and will never understand why predictions get fans so upset. I just don’t get it. I made a prediction based on what I see the Steelers to be. I could be wrong, but I assure you what I predicted has no affect on the season. People who are in the prediction business for a living — the guys who are in Vegas that set lines — are the most well-read and researched people on the planet, and even they are wrong from time to time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Joe:</strong> I read your article about the Steelers season. Why are you so negative all the time?&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> If saying the Steelers are a .500 team or maybe a 9-7 team is negative, I’m not sure what to say. I think they have some depth issues and I am not sure their skill position players are difference makers. That isn’t negative; it is me trying to be realistic. I don’t know why this is so hard for people to understand.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> When Ben Roethlisberger wins the MVP, the Steelers offense is ranked in the top five and the Steelers finish 12-4, will you eat your crow like a man? You Fan guys are the worst, if you hate our teams so much go work in a different market.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Yes, it it will make your day better and all of that stuff happens, I will say I was wrong and move on. Will you email me an apology if the Steelers go 8-8 or 9-7? As for Fan guys hating the local teams, you know what Colin Dunlap, Chris Mack, Ron Cook, Chris Mueller and I all have in common? Yep, we grew up here in Western Pa., and grew up fans of all the local teams.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff:&nbsp;</strong>You do realize that the players don't get to decide if these protests continue for the foreseeable future, especially if ratings and revenue crater? It's up to their employers if they are still allowed.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There is a fine line. People say that but also fail to acknowledge that the players are the product. I’m sure if it were going to cause mass defections of sponsors it would change. That hasn’t happened at all. And I think the players are in a situation where they know they have a platform and are using it.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong> It took Neal Huntington 6 years to make the Pirates into a playoff team, how long do you think it will take Ben Cherington?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I think it will take six or seven years, as well. I don’t think there are nearly as many building chips for Ben Cherington, so it will take him some time. But I do think he has a good plan and he knows how to build a winning organization. Pirates fans need patience. This won’t be an easy or short process.</p>
<p><strong>Sam:</strong> Why is it so hard to find Pitt football games on TV? Are they on ACC Network again this year? I can watch almost every WVU and Penn State game but can’t see every Pitt game and I live in Pittsburgh!</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> That is a great question. The short answer is cable systems have not valued the ACC Network enough to pick it up and make it part of the package. There just aren’t enough ACC fans and hardcore Pitt fans in this region to justify it. And Pitt hasn’t been good enough and hasn’t played in enough important games recently to warrant the national TV appearances. If Pitt wins more, it will begin to get more chances to be on national TV.</p>
