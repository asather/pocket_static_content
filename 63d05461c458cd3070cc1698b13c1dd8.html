<h1>Baldwin defensive lineman Dorien Ford commits to Pitt</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After already securing commitments from two highly regarded WPIAL defensive linemen, Pitt added a Ford to its garage of talent Thursday.</p>
<p>Baldwin defensive tackle Dorien Ford announced on Twitter that he, too, will become a Panther, picking Pitt over a list of schools that included Penn State, West Virginia and Michigan.</p>
<p>Ford, who is 6-feet-4, 295 pounds, is the 20th commitment in Pitt’s 2021 class and fourth from the WPIAL, joining West Mifflin defensive end Nahki Johnson, Central Catholic defensive tackle Elliot Donald and Central Valley safety Stephon Hall.</p>
<p>Rivals ranks Ford the No. 12 senior in the state and No. 25 among defensive tackles nationally. Donald (4) and Johnson (7) are both ranked among the top-10 seniors in the state. Ford is good friends with both Donald and Johnson — they share the same trainer, DeWayne Brown of 2/10th’s Speed &amp; Agility — and it has been rumored for some time that Ford would join them as Pitt commits, particularly since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/07/24/football-recruiting-central-catholic-elliot-donald-pitt-commit-aaron-donald/stories/202007240029" target="_blank">Donald committed July 24</a>.</p>
<p>Pitt’s defensive line, which is considered one of the best in the ACC, if not the country, will feature a lot of homegrown talent in the upcoming years. In addition to Ford, Donald and Johnson, Westinghouse graduate Dayon Hayes was a key member of the 2020 recruiting class. Hayes, a defensive end, had two sacks and a forced fumble in Pitt’s season opener.</p>
<p>Ford is also an offensive lineman at Baldwin, and some project him to possibly play guard in college. He’s the most highly recruited Baldwin player since 2006 graduate Jason Pinkston, also a defensive tackle who chose Pitt and then moved to guard. A four-year starter, Ford has grown considerably since he was a 215-pound fullback his freshman season. He was one of five juniors on last year’s <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/fab22/2019/" target="_blank">Post-Gazette Fabulous 22 team</a>.</p>
<p>Baldwin won its season opener last Friday, but it will be a few weeks before the Highlanders play again. The school announced Thursday that it will <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-football/2020/09/17/Baldwin-shuts-down-football-girls-soccer-because-of-COVID-19-cases/stories/202009170175" target="_blank">shut down all football activities</a> for 14 days after a coach tested positive for COVID-19. It has canceled its Week 2 game against North Allegheny and Week 3 game against Canon-McMillan.</p>
