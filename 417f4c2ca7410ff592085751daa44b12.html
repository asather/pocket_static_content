<h1>Muslims prepare to worship from home this Ramadan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>During a typical Ramadan, the Islamic holy month marked by daytime fasting, Muslims often gather at mosques to share a fast-breaking evening meal followed by prayers, study and recitations from the Quran.</p>
<p>Observances are expected to start Thursday evening (following the sighting of the new moon), but Pittsburgh-area mosques have canceled public gatherings at least during the current stay-at-home orders, implemented to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. Even if the restrictions are eased, mosque officials say they’ll probably still need to cancel large gatherings, particularly the&nbsp;Eid al-Fitr festival at the end of the month.</p>
<p>“It’s hard, because everyone looks forward to Ramadan,” said Mishaal Paniwala, outreach coordinator of the Muslim Association of Greater Pittsburgh, located in Richland.&nbsp;“It’s when we all get together and break our fast. Children get to meet their friends.”</p>
<p>But, she added: “It won’t stop us from worshiping. It’s just that the focus will be for each of us to connect to God from our home.”</p>
<p>That’s what&nbsp;Salah Almoukamal plans for a spot set aside in the home with prayer rugs for Ramadan devotions.</p>
<p>“We’ll pray like a family,” he said.&nbsp;“God’s wherever you are. You don’t have to be in a specific place to pray to God.”</p>
<p>Hamza Perez, imam at the Light of the Age Mosque in Central Northside, said such home-based observances are actually in keeping with the devotions of the prophet Muhammad.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s actually going to be beautiful, because people are going to be spending more time with their family,” Imam Perez said&nbsp;“It’s kind of going to go back to that old-school, original Ramadan tradition.”</p>
<p>Ramadan is the latest major event on the religious calendar to face dilemmas of how to worship when houses of worship are shut down. Christians just completed their Holy Week and Easter Sunday, with most conducting services online or in some cases via socially distant drive-in settings. Jews recently commemorated Passover, some celebrating the ritual seder meal with relatives via Zoom and others in smaller, technology-free gatherings.</p>
<p>Saad Ali, who regularly speaks at Imamia Organization of Pittsburgh, a mosque in Monroeville, said he is open to doing livestream talks. The center, like others, stopped meeting in mid-March when public gatherings were shut down, and he doesn’t expect any change before the Eid, so members mostly will be observing from home.</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;" data-mce-mark="1">He’s&nbsp;</span>encouraging<span style="font-size: small;" data-mce-mark="1">&nbsp;members to “take this opportunity during this month of worship to try to help people around you. Many people are in need.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: small;">Among Muslims, technological uses will vary both by access to streaming technology and by tradition. Imam Perez, who is also on the staff at the Islamic Center of Pittsburgh, notes that Islamic legal opinions vary on whether Friday’s jumah prayers and sermon can be on livestream, but most are doing Zoom study sessions or other online activities.&nbsp;“We believe there’s mercy in the differences of opinion,” he said.</span></p>
<p>He said he’s looking forward to the home-based observances.</p>
<p>“Ramadan is so much more than food,” he said. “Ramadan is to really take a look at yourself. This is going to give us time to take a look at ourselves as parents and spouses and children.”</p>
<p>The cancellations pose other challenges, too. Muslim charities and mosques often hold fundraisers during Ramadan, with its emphasis on almsgiving. Instead of fundraising at mosque events, they’ll have to rely on phone calls, email and other means.</p>
<p>Still, people are responding, said Ms.&nbsp;Paniwala. Members of her congregation are providing “overwhelming support” in response to requests for donations to food pantries and to local police and health care providers.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to help the helpers right now and do as much as we can for others,” she said.</p>
