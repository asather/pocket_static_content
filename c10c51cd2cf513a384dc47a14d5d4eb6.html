<p>The Northeast Conference announced Wednesday that it decided to postpone all fall sports athletics competitions and championships. The conference presidents will reconvene by Oct. 1 to evaluate options.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The decision impacts men’s and women’s cross country, field hockey, football, men’s and women’s soccer and women’s volleyball. Duquesne is an associate conference member in football.</p>
<p>“While this decision was exceedingly difficult and will be incredibly heartbreaking for our NEC student-athletes, coaches, and administrators, the NEC Council of Presidents focused on the importance of the health and safety and well-being of our entire campus communities,” NEC Commissioner Noreen Morris said in a press release. “This pandemic has challenged us all in ways we could never have imagined, and I applaud our student-athletes and coaches for handling this difficult time with grace and courage.</p>
<p>“We are committed to providing all of our student-athletes with meaningful practice and training activities this fall and look forward to reconvening our Presidents by October 1 to discuss future competitive opportunities.”</p>
<p>The conference will allow schools to practice at the discretion of each school in adherence to NCAA rules and campus, local and state health and safety guidelines.</p>
