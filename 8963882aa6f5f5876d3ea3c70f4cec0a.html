<h1>Stargazing: Antares is watcher and 'rival of Mars'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Late night stargazers looking to the southern sky will be captivated by a fiery colored and rapidly twinkling ball of light that has sparked the imaginations of stargazers throughout history. To the Persians, this star was known as Satevis, one of four royal guardians in the night sky and the “Watcher of the West.” The Egyptians aligned their temples with the light from the star, believing it to be the representation of Selkit, the scorpion goddess. To the Polynesians, it was the handle of Ka Makau Nui o Maui or “the big fishhook of Maui.”</p>
<p>Today we know this star by its Greek name, Antares, or “rival of Mars.” Due to its location and appearance in the night sky, this star is often mistaken for the red planet Mars. Antares is found within the constellation of Scorpius the Scorpion, earning it the nickname “the heart of the scorpion.”</p>
<p>While Antares is easily spotted with the unaided eye, stargazers who look upon this star with a pair of binoculars note what appears to be a faint star located to the right of Antares. This faint light is not one star but a cluster of thousands known as Messier 4 or M4.</p>
