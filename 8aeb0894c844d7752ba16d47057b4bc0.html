<h1>Review: At the Pittsburgh Symphony, polish doesn't always equal passion</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Technical perfection is almost a given for classical soloists these days, but impressive as this can be it doesn’t guarantee success. At Friday’s Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra concert, pianist Seong-Jin Cho delivered a polished yet cold account of Liszt’s second piano concerto.</p>
<p>Music director Manfred Honeck led the concert, which also featured Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra and Ravel’s marathon-like&nbsp;“Bolero.” The theme for the evening seemed to be instrumental showcases, as each of the three works showed off the soloistic capabilities of individual instrumentalists to full effect, from jocular bassoon burbles in the Bartok to slinky, strapless trombone solos in the Ravel and soulful cello melodies in the Liszt.</p>
<p>Mr. Cho’s pedigree is impressive, as he’s already racked up several major international competition wins and major orchestral debuts. Friday’s was his first Pittsburgh appearance, and while his rapport with the orchestra was excellent his overall demeanor seemed stiff and one-dimensional. Liszt’s Concerto No. 2 in A begins with a wistful tune in the woodwinds (a bit out of tune on Friday) that is transformed repeatedly to a variety of moods and affects. Mr. Cho’s sense of timing and dynamic expression were remarkable, and he began with a yearning, even foreboding character that perfectly complimented the music.</p>
<p>But as the tune transformed he never moved away from that initial sense of high drama — some sections could have been more lighthearted and carefree rather than so doggedly earnest. Mr. Cho’s encore, Chopin’s breezy&nbsp;“Minute Waltz,” evidenced that he was more than capable of loosening up.</p>
<p>Ravel’s Bolero belies a similar structure in that it passes a single tune around the orchestra, but rather than transforming in character different instrumentalists provide their own spin on that well-known, sinuous melody. The progression is linear, as more instruments join in over the 13 or so minutes of the piece, getting steadily louder and more vigorous until the crashing finale. Kudos here must go to percussionist Andrew Reamer, who plays essentially the same snare rhythm over and over and over for the entire piece (4,062 notes, at least according to Google) without pause, driving the momentum ever forward. Something rare in the orchestra world — harp seemed a touch loud during its entrance.</p>
<p>Mr. Honeck’s gestures alone in the third movement of Bartok’s Concerto for Orchestra elicited chuckles from the audience, as there’s a particularly quirky march that interrupts the movement. Here was one of Friday’s standout moments, utterly charming in character. Trumpets in the second movement during a staccato (light, short notes) muted passage were also especially strong. Otherwise, as different instruments moved to the fore, the Pittsburgh Symphony demonstrated impeccable balance and timing, some rhythmic muddiness at the outset of the finale aside. A fine return from winter break for the orchestra.</p>
<p><em>This concert repeats Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Tickets are $20-$98 at <a href="https://pittsburghsymphony.org/production/62259/list_performances" target="_blank">pittsburghsymphony.org</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Around town&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>On Jan. 16, five of the orchestra’s musicians set upon the lobby of the Andy Warhol Museum to deliver a short, programmatic tour of Beethoven’s life and music in honor of what would have been the composer’s 250th birthday in December. Marty Bates, vice chair of the Jack Heinz Society at the PSO, gave a lighthearted synopsis of the composer’s three compositional periods, nodding to Pittsburgh’s own history throughout to remind attendees that classical music didn’t develop in a bubble.</p>
<p>The event was small but completely sold out — keep an eye for future&nbsp;“Discovery and Drinks” programs in the future if you’re interested in such lecture-concerts.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
