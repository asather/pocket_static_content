<h1>Penguins on pause: Conor Sheary's second stint in Pittsburgh could already be over</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>When the Penguins reacquired Conor Sheary and immediately dropped him on Sidney Crosby’s right wing, it said something about how they felt about him.</p>
<p>It also said something about the team’s other options for that spot.</p>
<p>Dominik Simon still wasn’t scoring and was no longer doing the little things that led coach Mike Sullivan to give him top-line minutes. Patric Hornqvist had a nice rebound season but was better off down in the lineup. Dominik Kahun, before going the other way in the Sheary trade, left the Penguins wanting more.</p>
<p>So on deadline day, Feb. 24, general manager Jim Rutherford traded Kahun to the Buffalo Sabres for Sheary and fellow forward Evan Rodrigues. Afterward, the GM said he never wanted to trade Sheary in the first place and that sending him to the Sabres two summers ago was strictly for cap-compliance purposes.</p>
<p>The Penguins hoped he would do some of the same things Bryan Rust was doing on the second line — flummoxing on the forecheck, providing energy all over the ice and burying some of the opportunities created by a superstar center.</p>
<p>Just when it looked as if Sheary was settling into a groove with Crosby and left winger Jason Zucker, the season suddenly came to a halt. He had four points in his last five games after not registering a point in his first three games back.</p>
<p>Sheary, a member of the 2016 and 2017 teams, was gearing up for another Cup run with Crosby and company. Now, it is unclear if he has played his last game with the Penguins. He’ll be a free agent whenever the offseason occurs. And if this season is indeed over, the grade for the Sheary trade is “incomplete.”</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> Sheary received a warm welcome March 3 before his first game back at PPG Paints Arena. He then scored his only goal in eight games when his back-door pass toward Crosby hit a Senators blue-liner and went in. It wasn’t pretty. But, hey, we don’t have many moments to choose from here.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> Sheary averaged 14:27 of ice time with the Penguins. That’s 92 seconds more per game than he had with a lottery-bound Sabres team. He had nine goals, 19 points and a minus-4 rating in Buffalo this season.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> The Penguins should be healthier, giving Sullivan more options. But Zucker and Jake Guentzel are both better off on the left wing. So Sheary would remain a top candidate to skate with Crosby, though that spot could remain a revolving door based on performance and playoff matchups.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Sheary, who is earning $3,000,000 in the final year of his three-year deal, will be an unrestricted free agent this offseason. Presumably, the door is open for him to return. It would just depend on his price. If he is looking to make more than he made this season, it may be hard to fit him in.</p>
