<h1>'Maker &amp; Muse' jewelry inspires poets in virtual reading</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Six Pittsburgh poets, each inspired by an exquisite piece of handmade jewelry, will read their poetry on Thursday.</p>
<p>The virtual reading starts at 7 p.m. Thursday via Zoom and was organized by&nbsp;Lisa Viscusi, manager of adult learning for The Frick Pittsburgh.&nbsp;The event is free but you must register at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Event-Ekphrasis-Poetry-Meets-Art." target="_blank">www.thefrickpittsburgh.org/Event-Ekphrasis-Poetry-Meets-Art.</a></p>
<p>The program, which marks the end of National Poetry Month, is connected to the Frick show&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2020/02/14/Makers-and-Muse-women-Frick-Pittsburgh-art-jewelry-show-Lalique-Tiffany-suffragist-Newman-Kalo/stories/201911130001" target="_blank">Maker &amp; Muse: Women and Early Twentieth Century Art Jewelry</a>.” The exhibition features Arts &amp; Crafts and French Art Nouveau jewelry and works by American designer Louis Comfort Tiffany.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Viscusi is a former English teacher who led poetry and writing&nbsp;workshops with high school students and adults in Chicago.</p>
<p>“We were immediately taken with the word ‘maker,’” she said. “What a great way for poets to respond to these intimate pieces. We commissioned them to write a piece based on an object in the exhibition that they chose.”</p>
<p>Jamie Agnello, an actor, voiceover artist and puppeteer, wrote a poem about a ring designed by Tiffany.&nbsp;Veronica Corpuz, a creative writing teacher, drew inspiration from a ship pendant made of silver-gilt, copper alloy, abalone and pearl. It was made around 1915 by British designer Henry Charles Barker.</p>
<p>A silver and enamel cigarette case that shows a woman smoking was the muse for Jim Daniels, an English professor at Carnegie Mellon University. The cigarette case was designed by Alphonse Mucha, a Czech-born painter best known for his stylized posters of actress Sarah Bernhardt.</p>
<p>Karen Howard, coordinator of the Western Pennsylvania Writing Project, wrote about a brooch that features a winged sylph made of freshwater pearls and created in 1945 by French designer Rene Lalique.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ellen McGrath Smith, a senior lecturer at the University of Pittsburgh, founded the Writers’ Cafe Program at Pitt’s Writing Center. Her poem responds to a leather wallet adorned with silver and made around 1900 by an unknown German craftsman.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Valerie Bacharach’s poem will focus on a pendant that features the three graces — joy, charm and beauty. The pendant is made of gold, enamel, diamonds and pearls.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Responding to a visual artwork with writing dates to ancient Greece, where it was called ekphrasis.</p>
<p>“Poetry is a salve for grief and sorrow and a meditation, but now especially.&nbsp;I think people turn to music, poetry and art in times of uncertainty,” Ms. Viscusi said.</p>
