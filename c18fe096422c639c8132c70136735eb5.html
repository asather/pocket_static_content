<h1>Robert Morris cancels study abroad programs over coronavirus travel concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Morris University is canceling study abroad programs for the remainder of the semester, citing heightened concerns about the novel coronavirus and what travel complications it could create depending on the virus's spread.</p>
<p>Students and faculty were notified Thursday morning of the decision jointly by Provost Mary Ann Rafoth and John Michalenko, the vice president for student life.</p>
<p>"Out of an abundance of caution, and especially in light of the most recent statements from the Centers for Disease Control, we decided to cancel all programs regardless of destination," Robert Morris spokesman Jonathan Potts said.</p>
<p>The school previously canceled some individual programs but decided to broaden the cancellation.</p>
<p>"Certainly, the urging by federal and local authorities to prepare for an outbreak in the U.S." contributed, Mr. Potts said.</p>
<p>Campus officials weighed not only the potential for students to become ill but travel complications that could develop and quarantine procedures that might be introduced on short notice, interfering with efforts to return home, he said.</p>
<p>“Anyone currently abroad is not being asked to come home, but we are in communication with them and advising them on appropriate precautions,” Mr. Potts said.</p>
<p>Colleges and universities have issued various travel restrictions, focused mostly on China, where the outbreak began. It has since spread to about four dozen countries, including parts of Europe.</p>
<p>At Robert Morris, nine trips including 84 students are affected, Mr Potts said. The campus of 4,500 students has not altered any summer study abroad plans, he said.</p>
<p>No cases of the virus have been reported in Pennsylvania. The CDC said the individual health risk remains low but recommended preparations for an outbreak be made.</p>
<p>More than 80,000 cases and nearly 3,000 deaths have been reported, mostly in China.</p>
