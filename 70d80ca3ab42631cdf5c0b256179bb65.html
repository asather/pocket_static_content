<h1>The Little Wretches reunite on Super Bowl eve</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Super Bowl eve holds a special meaning for Robert Wagner — and not because he’s that much of a football fan.</p>
<p>It was the day before the Steelers’ third Super Bowl win in 1979 that he formed his first band, No Shelter, and entered the Pittsburgh underground punk scene.</p>
<p>In short order, No Shelter would become The Little Wretches, who, on the eve of the 2020 Super Bowl, will reunite at Moondog’s, Blawnox, for a show with Devilish Merry, a band that factored somewhat in their early life.</p>
<p>Wagner was undergoing an experimental regimen of chemotherapy for a rare form of cancer in the late ’70s when he formed No Shelter with his roommate John Creighton. They debuted with the single “Brooks Robinson’s Camp”/“Soldier Boy.”</p>
<p>“John and I were deeply involved in radical politics and saw our songs as part of ‘the revolution,’ ” Wagner says in an email. “One of the culture centers for lefty musicians at that time was Wobblie Joe’s on the South Side. Devilish Merry played there all the time.&nbsp;A friend, neighbor and bartender at Wobblie Joe’s tried to persuade the owners that punk rock was the new music of the working class, and No Shelter was invited to audition for a gig at Wobblie Joe’s by playing a set at Anne Feeney’s open stage.”</p>
<p>Despite Wagner working in the tradition of the rock-poet, it didn’t fare as well as they hoped — kind of like their own Dylan at Newport Folk Festival moment —&nbsp;but that wasn’t surprising for punk-inspired bands in Pittsburgh at the time.</p>
<p>“Anne said she liked us,” Wagner notes, “but the owners apparently did not. The sarcastic message that was relayed to us was, ‘How much would they pay us to let them play here?’ Bluegrass was the true music of the working class, we were told.”</p>
<p>Bluegrass being out of the question, they ventured into a more avant-garde direction, briefly, with ICU and then in the early ’80s, Wagner launched The Little Wretches, a band that drew comparisons to The Velvet Underground, and Creighton formed the rhythmic punk collective Stick Against Stone. Both bands went on to become regular attractions at the Electric Banana and other spaces conducive to punk acts. (When Creighton died in the early ’80s, a memorial show was held for him at Wild Sisters Coffeehouse, the former Wobblie Joe’s.)</p>
<p>The connection between The Little Wretches and Devilish Merry was a little different.</p>
<p>“Before I was old enough to get into bars,” Wagner notes, “I'd walk past Frankie Gustine's in Oakland and see the name Devilish Merry. Their name seemed to be everywhere, and I was jealous. I assumed Devilish Merry had been around forever. It never occurred to me that they were just a few steps ahead of us, still new, still finding their way.”</p>
<p>Despite Devilish Merry and The Little Wretches being in different genres, there was a folk/storytelling element to the Wretches and they did cross paths in the late ’90s for a gig via Calliope: The Pittsburgh Folk Music Society.</p>
<p>The Little Wretches, while weathering various personnel changes, lasted until about 2003. In 2009 Wagner moved to the Philadelphia area, where he teaches at a school for at-risk kids.</p>
<p>He still plays solo shows, occasionally pulling out the Wretches banner for shows with other musicians.&nbsp;Saturday’s show, a reunion with some of the Pittsburgh Wretches and friends, will feature Wager with Ellen Hildenbrand, Dave Losi, Johnny Guitar, Mike Madden and Steve Sciulli (of Carsickness/Ploughman’s Lunch).</p>
<p>Wagner will open with a short set of songs he did with Creighton in No Shelter, followed by Devilish Merry and the Wretches.</p>
<p>“Devilish Merry is still going strong, and the labor history songs Sue Powers has been working are an inspiration,” he says. “I want to write songs that tell stories that need to be told, too. I, too, want to be surrounded by sympathetic warriors for peace and beauty.”</p>
