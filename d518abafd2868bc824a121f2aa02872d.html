<h1>Sewickley Hotel closes, but a Tavern is on the way</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Sewickley Hotel, an institution in one of Pittsburgh’s toniest communities has closed, but the Sewickley Tavern is set to open later this month.</p>
<p>The phone has been disconnected at the the Hotel, which according to its website was built in the 1890s first as a respite for those traveling along the Ohio River and later as a gathering spot for Pittsburgh’s industrial titans who kept summer homes in Sewickley.</p>
<p>Since the 1950s the spot at 509 Beaver St. was the place for Sewickley residents to see and be seen and was known for, among other things, its turtle soup.</p>
<p>However, Sewickley denizens won’t wait very long for a neighborhood haunt for victuals and spirits: the Sewickley Tavern is set to open a block away at 409 Beaver St. on St. Patrick’s Day in the former home of Bruneaux. Owner Courtney Yates and chef Dave DeVoss were the duo behind the former Cocothe restaurant, also in Sewickley.</p>
<p>The Sewickley Tavern will feature hearty but upscale fare such as Scotch Duck Eggs, Honey Andouille Sausages, Tavern Baked Oysters, Beef Tartare with quail egg, Jambalaya, and New York Strip steak.</p>
<p>Sewickley-based Studio St.Germain led the extensive renovation, which included a design for RESET Air certification, the highest internationally-recognized standard for indoor air quality, as well as sustainable elements like solar panels.</p>
<p>The restaurant will be open for dinner Tuesday through Saturday and closed Sunday and Monday and seats 46 indoors plus an additional 62 on the outdoor patio when weather permits.</p>
