<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Carrick man who in June pleaded guilty but mentally ill in the killing of a longtime Point Park University vocal instructor will serve 14-28 years in prison.</p>
<p>Joseph Martin, 37, was sentenced Tuesday by Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Alex Bicket. The plea allows Martin to serve his sentence in a facility with mental health treatment.</p>
<p>Martin in June&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/09/Joseph-Martin-pleads-killing-Point-Park-University-voice-instructor-Ricardo-Tobia/stories/202006090083" target="_blank">admitted</a> to killing his longtime roommate, 71-year-old vocal instructor Ricardo Tobia, two summers ago.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, police on July 7, 2018 arrived at Mr. Tobia’s home in the 500 block of Kirk Avenue after receiving a request from&nbsp;Martin’s sister to check on Mr. Tobia.</p>
<p>When officers arrived on the porch, they noted a foul stench and saw the front door was open. When they entered the home, they found Mr. Tobia in a bedroom, deceased and partially decapitated. His dog was also found dead with its throat cut and a gunshot wound in its head.</p>
<p>Investigators said there was blood on the walls and ceiling and bloody prints throughout the house. A sword and a knife were found near Mr. Tobia’s body, which had stab wounds in the torso and neck.</p>
<p>Martin’s mother, Margaret Martin, arrived at her home on July 5 and found her son shirtless, wearing dirty pants, sweating and breathing heavily. He was admitted to a psychiatric unit after she called 911.</p>
<p>Ms. Martin spoke to her son the next day, and he said he’d been having nightmares and that&nbsp;“demons took over, and he thinks he hurt Rick,” she told police. She then called her daughter, who alerted 911 to check Mr. Tobia’s home.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>On July 9, she called police after she found a gun and bullets in her son’s vehicle, along with a box of ammunition and shoes that both seemed to be smeared with blood.</p>
<p>The next day, police interviewed Joseph Martin. He told them,&nbsp;“The only thing I remember is Rick was acting funny and the neighbors across the street were screaming, ‘Kill the zombie, kill the zombie.’ I said, ‘I can’t stand it, I’m going down to sleep.’</p>
<p>“I went downstairs and went to sleep and woke up, all three cats were downstairs with me, and I just grabbed them and I said, ‘I’m getting the [expletive] out of here.’”</p>
<p>He was then arrested.&nbsp;</p>
