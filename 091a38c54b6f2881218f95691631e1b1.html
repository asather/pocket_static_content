<h1> Trump official: Vaccine expected starting in Jan. </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Trump administration official leading the response to the coronavirus pandemic says the U.S. can expect delivery of a vaccine starting in January 2021.</p>
<p>And a growing, bipartisan chorus of lawmakers, experts and public health officials says the country is ill prepared for a projected winter surge of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Kadlec said in an email Friday the administration “is accelerating production of safe and effective vaccines ... to ensure delivery starting January 2021.” </p>
<p>Dr. Kadlec is the Department of Health and Human Services’ assistant secretary of preparedness and response. HHS says a vaccine could be approved before the end of the year but will take time to distribute.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has said at rallies, debates and news conferences a vaccine could arrive within weeks. “We think we can start sometime in October,” Mr. Trump said at a White House press briefing last month.</p>
<p>Dr. Kadlec wasn’t the first health official to counter the president’s optimistic timeline. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said Thursday there could be 100 million vaccine doses available by the end of the year “pending FDA authorizations.” And Dr. Moncef Slaoui, who is leading the government’s vaccine effort, told Marketwatch on Friday researchers could know “by late October, or November, or in December” whether one of the vaccines in development is effective, but it would then take weeks to get emergency authorization to administer it.</p>
<p>When asked about the disparity, the White House was not specific on a date but said Mr. Trump’s priority is to distribute a vaccine “as soon as possible.” Dr. Kadlec said, without elaborating, it wasn’t correct to conclude this meant the country couldn’t see a vaccine sooner than January.</p>
<p>Dr. Kadlec was responding to a series of questions about the administration’s response to the pandemic and, in particular, about shortages of critical medical supplies.</p>
<p>Experts say those shortages could now extend to the syringes, needles and glass vials that are vital to a future nationwide vaccination program.</p>
<p>Dr. Kadlec agrees supply chain disruptions led to shortages. He said the administration needs more, consistent, flexible funding from Congress to shore up the Strategic National Stockpile of medical supplies and drugs and expand domestic manufacturing.</p>
