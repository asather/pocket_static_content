<h1>Election officials propose additional office dates to drop off ballots ahead of Nov. 3 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny County's Elections Division will present a plan to the Board of Elections next week proposing that additional offices will open on specific dates and times leading up to the Nov. 3 Presidential election.</p>
<p>The Board of Elections will conduct a virtual meeting at 2 p.m. Sept. 17 to review the plans.</p>
<p>Although President Trump has resisted drop boxes for mail-in votes, the county said in a release Friday that the recommendation is being made because of concerns related to the pandemic and to ensure voters have additional safe and accessible to vote over-the-counter or return their voted ballots.</p>
<p>"Since the June election, we have focused on improving our processes, confirming polling locations, recruiting, assigning and training poll workers, and taking additional measures to further strengthen the integrity of our election system," Dave Voye, Elections Division Manager, said in a statement. "We have also heard clearly that voters remain concerned about COVID and their own health and welfare. With that in mind, we have worked on this proposed plan, consistent with guidance from the Pennsylvania Department of State, that will provide additional options for voters to engage in the democratic process."</p>
<p>These are the proposed board offices and hours:</p>
<p>■ Oct. 10, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 11, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.:&nbsp;County office building, North Park ice rink, South Park ice rink, Department of Public Works garage No. 2 in Carnegie, CCAC Homewood</p>
<p>■ Oct. 17, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 18, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.:&nbsp;County office building, South Park ice rink, CCAC South, Boyce Park ski lodge, Shop 'n Save Hill District</p>
<p>■ Oct. 24, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Oct. 25, 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.:&nbsp;County office building, Boyce Park ski lodge, CCAC South, CCAC Allegheny, North Park ice rink</p>
<p>Each office will have access to the Statewide Uniform Registry of Electors system and will be staffed by county employees. The offices will be able to accommodate over-the-counter voting and ballot return and will serve voters regardless of where they live. As a result, the county said, voting will likely take longer than going to a typical polling place. Voters are encouraged to apply now for mail-in and absentee ballots at <a href="https://www.pavoterservices.pa.gov/OnlineAbsenteeApplication/#/OnlineAbsenteeBegin" target="_blank">https://votespa.com/ApplyMailBallot</a>.</p>
