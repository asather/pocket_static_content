<h1>Joe Starkey: Replace ‘stick to sports’ with real conversations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you’re part of a family — and like it or not, we here in the Divided States of America are just that — you need to listen when a fellow member desperately wants to tell you something.</p>
<p>Isn’t that the least you can do?</p>
<p>The time is ripe. Sports distractions have ceased, somewhat, for a day or two. Even the NHL is on board. The sports world has startlingly stopped in its tracks again, just like on March 11. Only that time it was on account of COVID-19.</p>
<p>This time it’s because a policeman shot a Black man named Jacob Blake seven times in the back in Kenosha, Wis., and it was captured on video, and it led to protests and two killings, and the Milwaukee Bucks decided they weren’t going to be anybody’s distraction for a night.</p>
<p>The Bucks’ boycott is what sparked a series of cancellations and individual opt-outs that spilled into Thursday’s sports activities.</p>
<p>For some, the first reaction to all this is to recite a torrent of what-abouts …</p>
<p>What about the NBA’s hypocritical stance on China?</p>
<p>What about all the good cops?</p>
<p>What about Black-on-Black crime?</p>
<p>What about reports that Blake had a knife in the car?</p>
<p>What about … what about … what about.</p>
<p>What about this: Listen. Just for a minute. Stop, the way the sports world has, and listen for a minute to a Black parent tell you what it’s like to watch that video — or the ones depicting the deaths of Ahmaud Arbery and George Floyd — with their children.</p>
<p>“Stick to sports” is gone, people, if it ever existed. May it be replaced with uncomfortable conversations — and may they begin with listening.</p>
<p>I’m a 55-year-old white man who spent my childhood in mostly white suburbs, went to mostly white colleges, live in a mostly white neighborhood and work in the mostly white sports media world. I’m not apologizing for that. It’s simply my story. As such, I obviously have no idea what it’s like to navigate this land as a person of color.</p>
<p>“It’s like being a Steelers fan at a Cleveland game (or vice versa) all the time,” says former Pitt basketball Julius Page.</p>
<p>Not that Page is complaining. In fact, his perspective is different from some of what you might be hearing this week, as Black athletes and their white colleagues speak out — and act out — against police brutality. Page is with them, adamantly, on that topic.</p>
<p>But he also says this: “I’m more afraid that a Black dude is going to shoot me. I’d rather not play the victim. You have to take care of in-house issues first. Focus on our families first. We should be looking inward. That doesn’t mean overlook police brutality. It means we need to be looking at our own actions first.”</p>
<p>Getting uncomfortable yet?</p>
<p>OK, then listen to ex-NBA star Robert Horry. See him reduced to tears as he describes watching the Blake video with his kids.</p>
<p>Horry told Spectrum SporstNet of his advice to his children in case of a confrontation with police: “Don’t take it upon yourself to let the rage you have against the cop come out, because he has the gun. He can end you, and I don’t want him to end you, because if he ends you, that means I’m going to end him. ... I don’t think people understand, especially white people, how hard it is for Black people to watch that (video).”</p>
<p>Horry’s words made me think of Steelers legend Mel Blount, and what he told colleague Ron Cook and myself in a recent radio interview. Blount spoke of growing up in rural Georgia, where his parents refused to take their children into town for fear of precisely what Horry was talking about.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget my dad saying he did not want to be put in a situation where he had to kill somebody because they did something to his kids,” Blount said. “He was basically talking about people spitting on you, abusing you in some way. That’s why he always kept us home.”</p>
<p>Something big is happening here. The sports world stopped, voluntarily. Opportunity knocks.</p>
<p>We need to talk.</p>
<p>We need to listen.</p>
