<h1>Paul Zeise: We are facing a long, bumpy stretch run to get to the games</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It sure seems like we are closing in on the day when team sports here in the United States open up for business again. Every league — well, except Major League Baseball — has a plan and a rough date for when the game will begin.</p>
<p>I believe we will have sports back by the end of summer. At least I want to believe that but, man, it makes me wonder if we are all just wishing on a star. There seems to be so many obstacles still standing in the way and so many hoops that need to be jumped through before the games actually do begin.</p>
<p>At the very least, we are headed for a bumpy six or seven weeks before we get to the games. It won’t shock me if at least once every sport stares at the possibility of not getting started or further delays. This is the year 2020, and that just seems to fit the way we’ve done things.</p>
<p>In just the past week we have had all of this happen:</p>
<p>• Major League Baseball and its Players Association weren’t able to come to anything close to an agreement. And now there is a very real chance there will be no season at all. Rob Manfred might be a great lawyer, but his incompetence as a league commissioner is on full display here and everyone sees it.</p>
<p>• The NHL seems to have the best plan. And by that, I mean it seems like the owners and players are well on their way toward harmony. That is so important in all these things. There are still these issues, like which cities the teams will play in and how that will be pulled off, but it seems like there is a good chance we will see hockey.</p>
<p>(But, like every sport, hockey is basically a really bad spike in COVID-19 cases nationwide away from being canceled, and there is likely going to be at least one of those.)</p>
<p>• The NBA is looking like a league destined to take the route of baseball. Forget about the owners and players being divided; in this league, the players are divided on whether to play or continue to focus on social justice efforts. And their chosen “bubble city” is in Orlando, which is in Florida, one of the hottest spots for new COVID-19 cases in the country. I’m not sure how you can play in the middle of a state where cases are exploding unless it is a true bubble, which the players have resisted.</p>
<p>• College football players are working out but there are already myriad legal and legislative issues that could hold it back. And of course there is the issue of fans in the stands and the fact that athletic directors don’t want to play without them.</p>
<p>• The NFL is a long way away and I feel good about the chances of playing. But again, everything can change in a bad week of COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>I’m not a pessimist, so I think most of this stuff will get worked out. I think the medical and support people are among the best in the world and they will navigate through the choppy waters to get to the games. I don’t think, though, it is a certainty.</p>
<p>I also think we are in for a long wild ride over the next two months until the games begin. It will become much like covering an election from this point forward — watch the polls every day and react to whatever comes our way. The main issue is still the pandemic, but there are clearly a lot of other things hanging around, as well.</p>
<p>The NBA is the one to watch because unlike MLB there is a plan and dates in place. And all of the league issues are not related to or dependent on COVID-19. If the NBA plays, I think that is great news for the rest of the leagues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We are certainly in the stretch run now. It is all in plain sight ahead of us, but there are plenty of hurdles that are still standing in our way. Let’s hope the leagues can all figure it out because the games are what we as sports fans have missed the most.</p>
