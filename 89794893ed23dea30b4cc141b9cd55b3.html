<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cranberry native David Testa won a Television Academy Foundation award Saturday for co-writing a short film,&nbsp;“Balloon.” The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/03/17/College-Television-Awards-Emmys-Pittsburgh-David-Testa-Penn-State-Maddie-Biertempfel/stories/202003170004" target="_blank">Seneca Valley High School graduate</a>, who also attended Duquesne University, was a winner with co-author/director Jeremy Merrifield and Christina Cha.</p>
<p>“Balloon,” which tells the story of a bullied teenager, won its Emmy in the Drama Series category. The three filmmakers submitted it as a senior thesis at the American Film Institute.</p>
<p>In addition, the Seymour Bricker Humanitarian Award, a $4,000 cash prize given to a College Television Award-winning project that best highlights a humanitarian concern, was awarded to Testa, Cha and Merrifield for “Balloon.” This award was created over two decades ago by the late entertainment attorney Seymour Bricker.</p>
<p>The awards were originally to be presented by celebrities in a red carpet gala, but were postponed until June due to COVID-19. It was then apparent the awards would be held virtually for the first time in the Academy’s 40-year history.</p>
<p>Jimmy Fallon, Reese Witherspoon, Andre Holland and Amy Poehler were among those involved in the presentation.</p>
