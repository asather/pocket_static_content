<p>Two Greater Latrobe Junior High School wrestling coaches and four students are facing charges in connection with an alleged hazing incident that was caught on surveillance video back in January.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania State Police charged former head coach Cary Lydic, 29, of Greensburg and former assistant coach David Galando, 44, of Youngstown, Pa., with child endangerment and failure to report after video showed wrestling team members holding some teammates down and poking them in the back with an object, according to Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four 15-year-old boys are facing hazing charges and two of those four are also facing charges of stalking, authorities said.</p>
<p>“Specifically, the two kids that were the more aggressive children that were a part of what you consider ‘hazing’ where they were taking the other students or other wrestlers and they would be holding the children down and using what would be the equivalent of a shorter broomstick and using that to put pressure on the children’s backsides,” said Pennsylvania State Trooper Stephen Limani.</p>
<p>The remainder of the wrestling team’s season was canceled in January due to the investigation.&nbsp;</p>
