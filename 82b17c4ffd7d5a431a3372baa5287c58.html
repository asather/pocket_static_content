<h1>Fed offering at least $1.5 trillion worth of short-term loans to banks amid virus jitters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Federal Reserve responded on Thursday to increasingly fraught market conditions by announcing that it would offer at least $1.5 trillion worth of short-term loans to banks today and tomorrow and change the structure of its ongoing asset purchase program.</p>
<p>The moves came as the markets for a variety of bonds — including usually easy-to-trade Treasuries — turned messier Wednesday. Traders and strategists reported that markets were thin, and the gap between the prices buyers offered and those that sellers asked for was widening. At the same time, tremors had developed in funding markets, the plumbing of financial markets in which cash flows between banks, as fears over the coronavirus’ economic caused gyrations across Wall Street.</p>
<p>“The New York Fed fired its bazooka,” said Paul Ashworth, an economist at Capital Economics.</p>
<p>Stocks continued their plunge on Thursday, as President Donald Trump’s latest effort to address the coronavirus outbreak — a ban on the entry from most European countries to the United States — disappointed investors who have been waiting for Washington to take steps to bolster the economy.</p>
<p>Trading was turbulent, with stocks staging a brief comeback as investors reacted to the decision —&nbsp;being led by the New York Fed — to help smooth out the functioning of the financial markets. But the selling picked up again by midafternoon.</p>
<p>“These changes are being made to address highly unusual disruptions in Treasury financing markets associated with the coronavirus outbreak,” the New York Fed said in a statement.</p>
<p>Specifically, the central bank announced that it would offer $500 billion in a three-month repurchase operation Thursday afternoon. It also said that it would begin to buy government debt “across a range of maturities.” In recent months, it has been buying $60 billion a month only in short-term Treasury bills.</p>
<p>Analysts viewed the moves as warranted given funding constraints on Wall Street.</p>
<p>“This is a full-blown crisis response operation, intended to make it abundantly clear that the Fed will not allow liquidity to dry up,” Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a note.</p>
<p>The coronavirus has infected around 128,000 people worldwide and killed over 4,700. The death toll in the U.S. climbed to 39, with over 1,300 infections. For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illnesses, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover from the virus in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>For the stock market’s part, the S&amp;P 500 closed down about 9.5%, its biggest daily drop since the stock market crashed in 1987, on what came to be known as Black Monday. The decline has left stocks in the United States firmly in a bear market — a term that signifies a decline of 20% from the most recent highs.</p>
<p>For the Dow Jones industrial average, the drop of 10% was also its worst since the 1987 stock market crash.</p>
<p>The reaction in the markets suggested little faith that the Fed’s moves would do much to restore the confidence of investors and consumers in the face of travel disruptions, event cancellations and business closures.</p>
<p>Thursday’s central bank action, being led by the New York Fed, is intended to keep credit markets functioning and ensure that banks can continue to provide loans to businesses and other borrowers across the economy.</p>
<p>In a note to investors, analysts at Bank of America said that the U.S. bond market has “materially deteriorated over recent days” and now “requires a rapid and large near-term policy response from the U.S. treasury or Federal Reserve.”</p>
<p>“What markets are waiting for are efforts to contain the virus in a very aggressive way, ways we’ve seen in other countries,” said Nela Richardson, investment strategist at Edward Jones. “Short of that, nibbling around the edges, maybe doing something that can help a firm with a very short-term impact or help an employee, doesn’t hurt, but it’s not the bull’s-eye, and it’s not as targeted as the markets would like to see.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere earlier in the day, the European Central Bank said Thursday it would step up its purchases of government and corporate bonds to hold down market interest rates, while expanding lending to commercial banks at very favorable terms as it tries to prevent the coronavirus from crippling the already vulnerable eurozone economy.</p>
<p>But the bank disappointed expectations that it would cut a key interest rate.</p>
<p>The ECB said it would buy an additional 120 billion euros, or $135 billion, of government and corporate bonds it buys every month as part of an effort to increase demand, drive down market interest rates and make the cost of borrowing cheaper. Currently, the central bank is buying bonds at a rate of 20 billion euros a month.</p>
