<h1>Mayor Bill Peduto names 17-member task force on police reform</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mayor Bill Peduto on Wednesday announced the formation of a community police reform task force that will review policing in the city and deliver recommendations by the fall.</p>
<p>“This task force is made up of representatives from diverse stakeholder communities and will put our neighbors’ voices at the center of the conversation of police reform since that is the key to making real and sustained change. I’m confident that they will develop people-oriented solutions that make Pittsburgh a better place for all, especially in our black communities,” Mr. Peduto said in a press release.</p>
<p>The group will be tasked with reviewing current police practices, police-community relations and the&nbsp;“state of safety in our communities,” according to the release.</p>
<p>The 17-member task force will comprise nonprofit, university and advocacy leaders, including Brandi Fisher, head of the Alliance for Police Accountability. Ms. Fisher joined a group of activists Monday in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/15/Pittsburgh-groups-demands-police-reform/stories/202006150065" target="_blank">delivering 12 police reform demands to Mr. Peduto</a>.</p>
<p>The group criticized Mr. Peduto for not consulting local black activists before <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/04/Pittsburgh-mayor-police-use-of-force-reforms-policy-george-floyd/stories/202006040132" target="_blank">announcing his endorsement of the national&nbsp;“8 Can’t Wait” campaign</a>, a list of eight standards aimed at reducing use of force. Advocates criticize the campaign for not being bold enough.</p>
<p>The task force members are:</p>
<p>• Dr. Quintin Bullock, president of CCAC, co-chair</p>
<p>• Valerie McDonald Roberts, former elected official and chief of Pittsburgh Bureau of Neighborhood Empowerment, co-chair</p>
<p>• Tony Beltran, president and CEO, Pittsburgh Mercy</p>
<p>• Alexander Cash, community advocate</p>
<p>• Sylvia Fields, executive director, Eden Hall Foundation</p>

<p>• Bobbi Watt Geer, CEO, United Way of Southwestern Pennsylvania</p>
<p>• David Harris, professor at Pitt’s School of Law, focused on police behavior, law enforcement and race</p>

<p>• Camille Redman, community advocate</p>
<p>• Dr. Angela Reynolds, CEO, YWCA of Greater Pittsburgh</p>
<p>• Monica Ruiz, executive director, Casa San Jose</p>

They aim to:&nbsp;prohibit the city’s acquisition of military equipment and weaponry;&nbsp;require a “duty to intervene” on behalf of police employees who witness “inappropriate force”;&nbsp;move $250,000 from police salaries to a gun violence prevention fund; and&nbsp;require a budgetary obligation to that fund.</p>
<p>Council is holding the bills for a public hearing and special fact-finding meeting.</p>
<p>“I want to make it clear. It is in my mind’s eyesight that everyone must participate in this conversation,” Mr. Burgess said during council’s Wednesday standing committee meeting. “It must be the activists. It must be the mayor, the mayor’s office. It must be council. It must be ordinary citizens. It must be the police. It must be social services. It must be all of us working together to talk about re-imagining our police.</p>
<p>“My hope is that this is the beginning of that conversation. Lastly I do want to acknowledge that I think the mayor has been listening to both the activists and certainly to some of my comments,” he said.</p>
