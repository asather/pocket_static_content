<h1>COVID-19 update: Statewide deaths increase by 124, Western Pa. reports 4 more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state's death toll from COVID-19 jumped by 124, with four new deaths reported in Western Pennsylvania, according to figures released Friday.</p>
<p>State health officials said there were 986 new cases of the novel coronavirus reported across Pennsylvania in the previous 24 hours. Statewide, there have been a total of 4,342 deaths and 60,622 cases — confirmed and probable, according to the latest figures.</p>
<p>Of the four new deaths in the Pittsburgh region, two were in Allegheny County (one at a nursing home), and one each in Beaver County and Indiana County, according to the state data. The individual who died in Beaver County was also a nursing home resident, the state said.</p>
<p>The new figures bring Allegheny’s total deaths to 141 —&nbsp;130 confirmed and 11 probable. Of the 1,582 total cases, 1,502 were confirmed and 80 probable, representing a 31-case jump. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>
<p>Since the first case was confirmed on March 14, Allegheny County has administered 23,114 tests. County health department Director Dr. Debra Bogen said that the county has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>
<p>As of Friday, 290 people have required hospitalization in Allegheny, with 117 of those requiring admission to the Intensive Care Unit and 67 needing mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Today many state pandemic restrictions were lifted for businesses in Allegheny and several surrounding counties that entered the “yellow” reopening phase. And Gov. Tom Wolf <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/05/15/Beaver-County-yellow-phase-next-week-pennsylvania-wolf-bernstine-pandemic/stories/202005150100" target="_blank">announced today that 12 more counties</a>, including Beaver County, will move to the yellow phase on May 22.</p>
