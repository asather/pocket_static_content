<h1>Port Authority CEO Kelleman gets $22,287 performance bonus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman will receive a second-year bonus of $22,287 because of her “stellar” work with the transit agency.</p>
<p>Board chairman Jeffrey Letwin presented the recommendation for the bonus during the board’s regular monthly meeting Friday and it was approved unanimously.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman began working for the agency in January 2018 under a five-year contract that calls for a $230,000 salary but no annual raise. She is eligible for an annual bonus of up to 10% each year based on reaching performance targets and this year’s bonus is just under the maximum.</p>
<p>“She’s as close to perfect as we can get,” Mr. Letwin said in an interview after the meeting.</p>
<p>After her first year, Ms. Kelleman received $21,511, $11,500 as a contractually required retention bonus and nearly the maximum 5% performance. Future years only have the performance bonus.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman came to the Port Authority from the Hillsborough Area Regional Transit Authority in Tampa, Fla., with a mission to improve service, modernize systems such as fare collection and do a better job of engaging with the public and planning for the future. The agency is in the midst of its first extensive community meetings in more than a decade and items such as developing a long-range plan and mobile payment app are works in progress.</p>
<p>Ms. Kelleman said she preferred the service bonus in her contract over a set raise because it’s an indication of whether she’s doing what she considers the most important part of her job: improving service to the public. “They own the system,” she said, a phrase that is her mantra.</p>
<p>Board member John Tague Jr., chairman of the planning and stakeholder relations committee, praised Ms. Kelleman for the community meetings, which had been eliminated when the agency had severe financial problems. The meetings, scheduled at nine location across the county, seek public comments on authority issues ranging from service, long-range planning and bus stop consolidation to locations to obtain prepaid ConnectCards.</p>
<p>“This is exactly what we wanted when we hired Katharine,” he said.</p>
