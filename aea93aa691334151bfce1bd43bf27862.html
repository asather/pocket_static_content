<h1>Windgap man arrested after attacking EMTs responding to call</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man fought with police officers and was taken into custody after punching two paramedics who responded to a medical call at a home in Pittsburgh’s Windgap neighborhood Saturday.</p>
<p>The city’s SWAT team was called to the scene in the 3700 block of Windgap Avenue after the man barricaded himself and his mother in the home.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police said the man became&nbsp;“extremely violent” as he was removed from the house after a 2½-hour standoff, and one SWAT officer suffered a minor injury when a&nbsp;large object was thrown at him during the scuffle.</p>
<p>Emergency crews initially arrived at the house just after 3:30 p.m for the medical call, city police spokeswoman Cara Cruz said. The man had called to request help for his mother, but it was unclear to 911 operators what the issue was.</p>
<p>Two EMTs dispatched to the house went into a bedroom where the woman was, but she refused treatment, according to Ms. Cruz.&nbsp;As they were leaving the house, the man punched the EMTs from behind. The paramedics were transported to the hospital for treatment.&nbsp;Both were tested for concussion-like symptoms; one of them was released from the hospital Saturday night.</p>
<p>The man then locked himself and his mother in the house, and law enforcement officers, including the SWAT team, tried to negotiate with the man.&nbsp;Police eventually used a flash bang to divert the man’s attention and then entered the home.</p>
<p>Both the man and his mother were taken to the hospital for evaluation. The male suspect’s name has not been released, but police say he will face charges once he is cleared by medical personnel.</p>
<p>Another SWAT officer received a minor injury when he was bitten by a small dog as the man was being taken into custody. Animal Control removed the dog from the home.</p>
<p>Police continue to investigate.</p>
