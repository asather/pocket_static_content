<h1>National Safety Council: Open roads led to dangerous driving</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic seems to have led to another unexpected consequence: dangerous driving.</p>
<p>A report and panel discussion by the National Safety Council last week shows the number of traffic deaths per 100 million miles driven is up since the start of the pandemic in March. Pennsylvania State Police say they have issued more citations for driving above 100 miles an hour in two of the three months compared to the same time period a year earlier despite substantially lower numbers of vehicles on the road.</p>

<p>“It's clear that our open roads have created somewhat of an open season for reckless driving,” Lorraine Martin, president and CEO of the National Safety Council, said at an online discussion Tuesday.</p>
<p>The council released figures for March, April and May — the worst of the pandemic restrictions keeping drivers off the roads —&nbsp;showing that despite lower traffic the death rate per million miles driven was up each month. In March, the death rate was 1.2 (1.07 in 2019), in April 1.45 (1.08) and in May 1.47 (1.19).</p>
<p>Those death rate numbers increased despite the number of miles driven being down substantially,&nbsp; including a high of 40% in April.&nbsp;Ms. Martin called the numbers “grim.”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, the pandemic has actually exposed our national road safety culture for what it really is — deeply flawed and unfortunately in need of some immediate action,” Ms. Martin said.&nbsp;“We took cars off the roads, but we did not reap the safety benefits we should have experienced.&nbsp;Instead, for every mile driven our roads became deadlier even though they were much emptier.”</p>
<p>Panelists said they want to see a complete study of why the death rates are up, but they believe one factor is motorists feeling free to push the speed limit when there is little traffic on the road.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Speed has been a forgotten factor,” said Jonathan Adkins, executive director of the Governors Highway Safety Association.&nbsp;“It’s a big issue that no one addresses. The best thing we can do is enforce the laws.”</p>
<p>Jake Nelson, director of traffic safety and research at AAA, said a primary factor is&nbsp;“people like to drive fast,” but finding a solution for that is difficult. Different approaches should be taken in different parts of the country rather than pushing a&nbsp;“one size fits all” solution, he said.</p>
<p>Federal officials are so concerned about the high death rate that they have developed a summer national ad campaign, said Nanda Srinivasan, associate administrator for research and program development at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.&nbsp;Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao is narrating ads pushing the usual issues of encouraging drivers to slow down, buckle up, avoid drinking and distractions, and make sure children and pets aren’t left in hot cars.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is among six states where road deaths are down through the first five months of the year, but that doesn’t mean drivers are following the rules.</p>
<p>Statistics provided by the Pennsylvania State Police show citations were down by more than 50% for March through May as troopers tried to practice social distancing and pull over the most serious violators.</p>
<p>But despite substantially reduced traffic, citations issued to motorists driving more than 100 miles an hour were only down to 423 for the three-month period, compared to 471 in 2019. Troopers cited more extreme speeders in March 2020 (131 to 123) and May 2020 (199 to 184).</p>
<p>“I think the word on the street was that we weren’t pulling people over,” said Trooper Steve Limani, a spokesman for troopers who patrol counties around Allegheny.&nbsp;“We definitely were using our discretion to maintain social distance with minor things, but we were definitely not ignoring extreme violators.”&nbsp;</p>
