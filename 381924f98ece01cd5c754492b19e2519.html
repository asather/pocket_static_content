<h1>Burgess introduces November ballot referendum on expanding powers of Citizen Police Review Board</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilman Ricky Burgess wants to add a question to the November ballot asking voters if they support strengthening the city’s Citizen Police Review Board, including requiring officers to participate in investigations.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess on Tuesday introduced the ordinance directing the Allegheny County Board of Elections to place the referendum on the ballot. He will need the support of council and Mayor Bill Peduto.</p>
<p>“It's primarily designed to make participation in the CPRB review mandatory and to have the chief of police at least review the recommendations prior to making a final decision," Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>According to the proposal language, neither the mayor nor the police chief could issue a disciplinary decision until reviewing the board’s findings on police misconduct.</p>
<p>Those are changes that Beth Pittinger, the board’s executive director, said she supports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The board would be very happy if we could just receive everything the city code [already] says we're entitled to when we need it, including voluntary officer participation," she said.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess is holding the bill for a public hearing. Whether or not he has Mr. Peduto’s support was unclear Tuesday.</p>
<p>The bill comes at a time of increased protest and scrutiny over race and policing after the death of George Floyd on Memorial Day at the hands of Minneapolis police</p>
<p>The Citizen Police Review Board is investigating a local violent clash between police and protesters that occurred on June 1 in East Liberty.</p>
<p>In the days following, Mr.&nbsp;Burgess introduced four police reform bills, including a “duty to intervene” bill and one prohibiting the city from acquiring certain equipment and weaponry. Those bills are scheduled for a public hearing on July 15.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess also on Tuesday introduced a resolution declaring Black Lives Matter and Black Communities Matter and that outlines five&nbsp;“strategic investment principles” specifically for the city’s Black communities in the following areas:</p>
<p>“It's to affirm the principles of Black Lives Matter movement nationally, that we stand against police violence against African Americans, and in addition we also affirm in investing in black communities. You want black communities built for black people, by black people with allies and partners,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>Council is expected to discuss the measure Wednesday.</p>
