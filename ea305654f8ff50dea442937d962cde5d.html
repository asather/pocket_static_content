<h1>Steelers players tweet through their COVID-19 anxieties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s been an extremely rough 24 hours for the sports world.</p>
<p>The NBA, NHL and MLS <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/03/12/coronavirus-pandemic-nba-mls-big-ten-sec-nhl-mlb/stories/202003120125" target="_blank">all suspended</a> their seasons; Major League Baseball <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/12/Pirates-face-uncertainty-as-COVID-19-reaction-around-sports-intensifies/stories/202003120118" target="_blank">suspended spring training</a> and pushed the start of its regular season back two weeks; the NCAA on Thursday afternoon officially cancelled both the men’s and women’s NCAA tournaments; and outside sports, mass-scale events and institutions that generally involve large gatherings — like Broadway — shut down due to widespread fears about the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>This is a serious issue that is affecting the country and world in unprecedented ways. Stay informed about the <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus/" target="_blank">latest COVID-19-related developments</a> and continue taking the necessary precautions to avoid catching it yourself.</p>
<p>Anxieties are high, and if it makes you feel better, not even multimillionaire professional athletes are immune from the stress this virus is inducing in seemingly everyone. A few Steelers have been tweeting through their anxieties brought on by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Multiple Steelers expressed their surprise last night when the NBA announced that their season would be suspended after Utah Jazz center Rudy Gobert was diagnosed with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Cornerback Steven Nelson appeared to have a minor (and public) existential crisis processing everything that was happening in a very short period of time.</p>
<p>He seemed to regain a more positive outlook earlier Thursday though.</p>
<p>Linebacker Vince Williams has had a lot of thoughts running through his head regarding COVID-19 that he proceeded to share with the world.</p>
<p>Nose tackle Javon Hargrave felt the financial affects of the pandemic before also asking the hard questions regarding this outbreak.</p>
<p>Receiver Diontae Johnson invoked a higher power in his bid to make himself feel better.</p>
<p>Finally, cornerback Mike Hilton summed up how most people are feeling about 2020 less than three months in so far.</p>
<p>So far, COVID-19 has only forced the NFL to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/12/NFL-cancels-owner-s-meetings-offseason-schedule-for-now-remains-in-place/stories/202003120149" target="_blank">cancel its annual owner’s meeting</a> that was set to be held March 29-April 1. Otherwise, the offseason schedule has remained intact.</p>
<p>Whether you’re a professional athlete or a regular Joe, stay safe out there and know that you’re not the only one wondering what the heck will happen next.</p>
