<h1>Gov. Wolf outlines color-coded plan to begin reopening </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The governor’s administration will use Pennsylvania Department of Health metrics, plus a data tool being developed by Carnegie Mellon University, to determine when regions are ready to move into a new phase.</p>
<p>Those metrics involve requiring regions to have&nbsp;an average of less than 50 cases per 100,000 individuals over a 14-day period.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>The entire state is currently in the red phase, which includes only opening life-sustaining businesses, closing schools and restricting visits to congregate care settings and prisons.</p>
<p>The yellow phase involves opening in-person businesses and child-care facilities, provided those sites follow safety orders and social distancing measures to minimize the virus’s spread. Mr. Wolf said the north-central and northwest regions of the state are targeted to begin this phase on May 8.</p>
<p>The green phase will lift the state’s “aggressive mitigation orders,” but will still require individuals and businesses to follow health department guidelines on social distancing.</p>
<p>Even when regions or counties hit the green phase, there still may be requirements for all individuals to wear masks in public if the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends it, Mr. Wolf said. The state hasn’t yet established a criteria to move into the green phase.</p>
<p>Regions will be selected to move forward into the yellow or green phase when the testing has proven that there is not widespread community transmission, health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said.</p>
<p>CMU and other higher education institutions have partnered with the Wolf administration to develop a data dashboard that will act as an arbiter of sorts for when certain counties or regions are ready to move from one phase of reopening to the next.</p>
<p>These benchmarks will be assigned based on conditions in a county, multiple counties or an entire region.&nbsp;The governor cautioned that spikes in new cases may cause regions to push back target dates to progress through phases, or regress to a yellow or red phase.</p>
<p>“I am attempting to provide as much certainty as I can, even though the virus controls the calendar for each and every one of us,” Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County, the hardest hit in southwestern Pennsylvania, would need to have less than 625 cases in 14 days to meet the state’s threshold. In the past 14 days, the county reported 396 positive cases out of 4,746 people tested. But county officials on Wednesday noted there needs to be more testing to have a better estimate of the case rate, and the county’s estimate does not address other counties in the region that the state will be considering.</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Wolf’s new tiered plan for reopening will require a much greater capacity for testing and monitoring than what the state currently has in place. The administration on Wednesday did not provide specifics on how rigorous those standards will be, other than to note that it envisions community and mass testing sites, and testing through county health departments, private health systems, commercial pharmacies and other providers.</p>
<p>Monitoring and tracking cases will involve a vast network of health professionals, including epidemiologists, community health nurses and county and municipal health departments. But it is not clear how close the state is to reaching the staffing levels it needs to successfully trace the spread of the virus in communities.</p>
<p>Those data, Mr. Wolf’s administration said, will help state officials prioritize reopening business sectors with the most potential for bolstering the state’s battered economy, while also minimizing the public health risk for workers.</p>
<p>“The model will help to predict and understand what types of individuals, businesses, and industries will be more at risk, most vulnerable, and impacted by COVID-19," the administration said in a news release. “The model will apply what-if scenarios that will allow the state to understand the impact of potential re-opening decisions."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the governor announced he was extending the statewide stay-at-home order until at least May 8.</p>
<p>In March, Mr. Wolf began issuing stay-at-home orders for residents in the hardest hit counties, directing them to only leave the house for necessities such as groceries and medicine. He expanded that order statewide April 1. The governor also ordered all but “life-sustaining” businesses to shut down operations in March. Although his administration opened a waiver process for companies, it has been criticized as unfair and secretive.</p>
<p>“I understand that not having definite dates for each of these pieces to fall into place is difficult,” Mr. Wolf said.&nbsp;“But we will continue to provide updates as regions move from phase to phase.”</p>
