<h1>Once deemed too small for hockey, Penguins winger Brandon Tanev has become among the NHL's most physical hitmen </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL’s leading hitters are an intimidating bunch of bruisers whose physical dimensions alone elicit a painful response.</p>
<p>At the top of the list is Vegas Golden Knights forward Ryan Reaves, a 6-2, 225-pound aggressor who will lay a shoulder (or a fist) into an opponent and then smile about it. He’s followed by 6-4, 210-pound Ottawa Senators winger Brady Tkachuk, who looks like a basketball power forward on skates. And fourth is Washington Capitals instigator Tom Wilson, a 6-4 heat-seeking missile who plays on the edge of the rules – and occasionally on the wrong side of that line.</p>
<p>Then, in third place? Penguins forward Brandon Tanev, a somewhat unlikely hitman if you know his story.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At 15 years old, he stood just 4-foot-10 and weighed less than 100 pounds. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/10/02/brandon-tanev-penguins-contract-sidney-crosby-2019-20-nhl/stories/201910020127" target="_blank">Deemed too small for a physical game, he was cut and gave up ice hockey for about four seasons.</a> Even now, after a unique journey to the NHL, Tanev is listed generously at 6-foot and 181 pounds. Standing next to him, it’s easy to wonder if both the height and the weight might be at least a little artificially inflated.</p>
<p>Yet, despite that fact that he might not have the same hulking dimensions as some of the others, Tanev has become a physical force.</p>
<p>“It’s part of my game I try to bring every night,” Tanev said. “I try to bring some energy. It gets me going in that sense.”</p>
<p>During Friday’s 4-1 victory over the Montreal Canadiens at PPG Paints Arena, for example, Tanev tallied his 200th hit of the season … and hits No. 201, 202, 203, 204, 205, 206, 207, 208 and 209. By the end of the night, he had racked up a season-high 10 hits in one game.</p>
<p>“He must have a good relationship with the guy up top taking stats,” Tanev’s linemate Teddy Blueger said. “I don’t know. I feel like I don’t see him hit that often.”</p>
<p>Blueger was joking of course. Watch any Penguins game and it’s almost impossible not to notice the tightly coiled ball of energy in the No. 13 jersey. He’s fast. Physical. Grimy. Gritty. Like a non-stop Energizer Bunny after one too many cups of coffee.</p>
<p>“We call him ‘Turbo’ for a reason,” said forward Jared McCann, who sits next to Tanev in the dressing room. “He brings a level of energy to our team that not a lot of teams have. Whenever there’s one night when we’re not going, he’s usually a guy to say something and get us going.”</p>
<p>And he’s definitely not afraid to throw his weight around.</p>
<p>Since the NHL started tracking hits in 2005-06, Tanev is just the seventh Penguin in team history to record 200 or more. With 11 goals and 13 assists in 56 games, it’s just the fifth time in Penguins history that a player scored 10-plus goals and tallied 200-plus hits in a single season.</p>
<p>At this rate, Tanev is on pace for 306 hits, which puts him within range of breaking the franchise record set by Brooks Orpik (309) during the 2008-09 season.</p>
<p>“It’s a big part of his game,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “He’s abrasive. He’s hard to play against. When you combine that with his skating ability and his ability to get in on the forecheck and disrupt breakouts, I think the physical play is a big part of it.</p>
<p>“When defensemen go back and they know they’re going to get hit, sometimes they’re inclined to move the puck quicker. That forces turnovers, errant passes, and opportunity presents itself because of it.”</p>
<p>For the Penguins, what Tanev has been bringing this season is exactly what they were missing.</p>
<p>After an early postseason exit in 2018-19, general manager Jim Rutherford openly questioned whether drinking from the Stanley Cup had extinguished the flame that once burned in the players’ bellies. He stated his desire to improve the team in three ways, making them younger, faster and tougher to play against.</p>
<p>Tanev is all three.</p>
<p>In addition to dishing out punishment, Tanev embraces it. He ranks fourth in the league in hits taken (142) and leads Penguins forwards in shots blocked (59). He also leads Pittsburgh in penalties drawn (17).</p>
<p>These attributes have made him, arguably, the Penguins’ best penalty killer and a critical piece of an under-appreciated line. Playing next to Blueger and left wing Zach Aston-Reese, Tanev is often asked to begin his shift in the defensive zone and to shut down opponents’ top line.</p>
<p>“It’s a tough line to play against,” Tanev said. “We want to play a full 200-foot game. That starts in our own zone. We want to be strong on pucks. Any opportunity we get to play in the offensive zone, especially against some of the other team’s top lines, they’re not comfortable in the sense they don’t want to be hemmed in there.”</p>
<p>The forechecking, physicality and speed were exactly what the Penguins anticipated when they signed the 28-year-old free agent to a six year deal that carries a $3.5 million average annual value.</p>
