<h1>Could Steelers group yield more NFL majority owners?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/15/Report-Wall-Street-financiers-purchase-a-stake-in-the-Steelers/stories/202006150050" target="_blank">sale of shares in the Steelers</a> does little to change the ownership structure of the franchise. If nothing else, it strengthens what is already a diverse and financially secure ownership group with the addition of two billionaire investors.</p>
<p>But if recent history is any indication, could it lead to another member of the Steelers ownership group eventually owning their own NFL franchise?</p>
<p>Private equity investors Josh Harris and David Blitzer, who already own two other professional sports franchises, are the latest additions — partners, they call them — of the Steelers investment group. They purchased 1.5% of the shares from a current investor who was looking to sell a portion of his stock, according to multiple sources. Harris and Blitzer, who own the NBA’s Philadelphia 76ers and NHL’s New Jersey Devils, are considered passive investors, which means they have no say in the operation of the team.</p>
<p>Bloomberg, which first reported the transaction, hinted the shares acquired by Harris and Blitzer were the ones vacated by David Tepper, a former investor, when he purchased the Carolina Panthers. But that is not true, according to sources. What’s more, the portion of the shares purchased by Harris and Blitzer was considerably smaller than the shares once owned by Tepper, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/12/pittsburgh-steelers-carolina-panthers-david-tepper-owner/stories/201912120154" target="_blank">divested his 5% interest in December</a>.</p>
<p>So why would two financiers who already are majority owners of two major professional sports teams want to have such a small share of an NFL franchise?</p>
<p>Who knows? Through a spokesman, Harris and Blitzer declined an interview request for the story. But maybe the reason could be rooted in recent history: Both Tepper and Cleveland Browns owner Jimmy Haslem each used the path of being a Steelers investor to purchase an NFL franchise.</p>
<p>It was the second time in seven months the Steelers have taken on new partners, though this time for a different reason.</p>
<p>In December, Steelers president Art Rooney II strengthened his position as majority owner by purchasing a portion of Tepper’s shares. Rooney purchased the shares as part of Pittsburgh Steelers Sports Inc., the company that operates the Steelers franchise for which he serves as president. By purchasing more shares for the franchise, each member of the ownership group increased the financial return on their investment.</p>
<p>The remaining portion of Tepper’s stock was purchased by Doug Lebda, a Pittsburgh native who founded Lending Tree and serves as CEO of the Charlotte-based financial services firm; and the NC Revocable Trust, a family-based trust in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Rooney has majority control of the team as the single largest shareholder but also because he is president of Pittsburgh Steelers Sports Inc. and executor of the family trust set up by his late father, Dan.</p>
<p>After that, the largest investors in the team are the Robert Paul family, longtime Pittsburgh steel owners; and hedge-fund manager Rob Citrone of Discovery Capital Management, each of whom own approximately 10%. Former Hollywood producer Thomas Tull, who lives in Pittsburgh, is also a significant shareholder.</p>
<p>The ability of the Steelers to add two more billionaire investors, even at a small share, further strengthens the financial portfolio of a franchise that is valued at $2.8 billion by Forbes and 12 years ago was actively selling shares to help resolve estate planning and NFL ownership issues. It was such that billionaire investor Stan Druckenmiller of Pittsburgh-based Duquesne Capital Management, an avid Steelers fan and season-ticket holder, was approached by the Rooneys and offered to buy majority stake in the team.</p>
<p>The situation is completely different now.</p>
<p><strong>Just a start?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/22/Brian-Batko-s-Steelers-chat-06-22-20/stories/202006220063" target="_blank">cancellation of the Pro Football Hall of Fame game</a> was not a surprise to the Steelers or really anyone else. They had been expecting it for a while.</p>
<p>And what might not come as a surprise, either, is if some of the other four preseason games, if not all of them, are canceled, too.</p>
<p>Mike Tomlin said the other day he “assumes” there will be preseason games this summer, and it’s possible there could be. If there is, one of the options being discussed is each team playing two preseason games — one home, one away — according to a source.</p>
<p>Because it is likely those games wouldn’t be played until the latest possible part of the preseason, the Steelers might be one of the teams that would have to adjust its schedule to get a home game and away game.</p>
<p>Right now, the Steelers are scheduled to play their first two preseason games at home — Aug. 14 against Tampa Bay and Aug. 23 against New Orleans. Their final two preseason games are on the road — Aug. 28 at the New York Jets and Sept. 3 in Carolina.</p>
<p>So, if games were played the final two weeks of the preseason and the idea to play one each home and away was implemented, the Steelers’ current schedule would preclude them from being able to do it.</p>
<p>Not only are the fate of all preseason games up in the air. But so, too, might be who they play and where.</p>
<p><strong>Subject to change</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin surprised a few members of the Pittsburgh-area members last week when he provided a little insight into the depth chart for the start of training-camp — something he rarely does.</p>
<p>But what will be more surprising is if what Tomlin said will still be the case at the end of training camp.</p>
<p>Tomlin said Matt Feiler, who has started 25 of the past 26 games and all but one of them at right tackle, will begin camp at left guard for retired Ramon Foster, leaving Zach Banner and Chukwuma Okorafor to battle for the starting spot at right tackle.</p>
<p>The reason he said he will begin that way is because, with no OTAs and minicamp, he wants to rely on players who have experience in the Steelers system. Newcomers such as guard Stefen Wisniewski, a 10-year league veteran, will not have had an opportunity to be on the field with his new teammates and coaches before camp.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean it will stay that way.</p>
<p>The Steelers prefer to have Feiler at right tackle, where he has been a surprising and reliable performer since replacing Marcus Gilbert, never missing a snap in the 25 games he has started. And, all things being equal, they would prefer to have Wisniewski, a two-time Super Bowl starter, at left guard, which is why they signed him in free agency in the first place. What’s more, they think they might have drafted their future starter at left guard in Kevin Dotson.</p>
<p>What it will ultimately come down to for Tomlin is deciding if either Okorafor or Banner is better at right tackle than Wisniewski is at left guard. If not, the way the depth chart looks at the end of camp will not be the same as when it started.</p>
