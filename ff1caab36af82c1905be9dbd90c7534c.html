<h1>Pirates' Joe Musgrove encouraged by MLB's proposal for baseball in Arizona</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Major League Baseball’s proposal to play the beginning of its season in Arizona, with every team quarantined and maintaining a six-foot distance from one another when at all possible, has at least one supporter in the league.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirates pitcher Joe Musgrove said in an appearance with 93.7 The Fan on Thursday that he liked the idea.</p>
<p>Musgrove did provide an important caveat, though, saying that, as a single person without a wife and kids, his opinion may be different than other players’.</p>
<p>“The sooner we can get back, I think the better it is for everybody,” Musgrove said. “But with that format and that layout, it seems like there’s a lot of things that have to go right in order for that to work out, and should it work out, it’s a lot easier for me to say, ‘Yeah, let’s get it rolling,’ than guys that have families and children and are going to be expected to stay away from them for four to five months. Especially, I’m sure there are plenty of guys in the league right now that are pregnant and have babies on the way. So it’s easy for me to say I’m ready to roll whenever, man.”</p>
<p>One of the aspects that has been brought up in the current debate over when or where the MLB season should begin amid the COVID-19 pandemic is how much time pitchers would need to prepare for the season.</p>
<p>Musgrove, for his part, said he hopes the league would give around three weeks to get ready for the season. He did hint, however, that he feels fairly prepared thanks to the Pirates’ throwing program and his ability to work out at home while the season is delayed.</p>
<p>“No one really knows what to do and how to gauge themselves right now,” Musgrove said. “I’m trying to keep myself at a 35-45 pitch range right now and stay around that three-inning mark at the most. And I hope that MLB would give us at least two, two-and-a-half,&nbsp; three weeks to build us up a little bit. I think that we’re probably going to need three or four starts to get us up to six innings, and then be ready to go.</p>
<p>“But most of the starters are built up to their five- or six-inning outing already in spring, so our arms are plenty conditioned right now, we’ve just got to keep them in shape and keep them sharp, because you walk a fine line of not doing too little and losing the ground that you made up in spring and not doing too much and wearing yourself out.”</p>
<p>Part of Musgrove’s support for some sort of plan to start baseball in unusual circumstances stems from his willingness to play with no fans in the park.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Musgrove said he does, obviously, love fans, as they add excitement to the game, but he also feels that playing without fans is still perfectly possible given the natural, competitive environment that’s already present in any baseball game.</p>
<p>So, basically, Musgrove seems to be game for whatever. He recognizes the importance of due diligence in these situations, considering that public safety should be prioritized above baseball. In the end, though, Musgrove says he feels baseball can play a part in helping keep people sane during their time at home.</p>
<p>As far as the MLB’s Arizona proposal, Musgrove feels it’s a positive sign that the league is coming up with creative proposals to try to get the season rolling in the safest way possible.</p>
<p>“I think they’re going to do everything they can, whether it’s playing in front of no fans for a little while, playing in Arizona, whatever the situation is, I think they’re going to do everything they can to at least get some games in this year,” Musgrove said. “I know it’s not at the top of the priority list right now. There’s a lot more important things to worry about than baseball, but we can provide a lot of joy for people that are stuck in their homes and not able to get out. We can get baseball back on TV, some live action, and get some people back to work.”</p>
