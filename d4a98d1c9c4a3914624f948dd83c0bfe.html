<h1>Virtual Memorial Day ceremony got entire Pittsburgh region involved</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Theresa Price normally spends Memorial Day with her family at Pittsburgh’s parade Downtown, followed by a solemn service at the VFW Post near her home in Morningside, where she and her family collectively remember her big brother, Albert Colletto, who was just 20 when he died serving in the Army in Vietnam in 1969.</p>
<p>But Mrs. Price and other families of those who gave their lives serving in the military in defense of their country knew this year would be different.</p>
<p>With the COVID-19 pandemic still keeping the state largely on lockdown and social distancing still in effect, despite some recent reopenings, most Memorial Day gatherings were canceled weeks — if not months — ago, and she was not sure how she would honor her brother this year.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“We knew we wouldn’t be going to a service,” she said.</p>
<p>Then she got a call a couple weeks ago from the Gold Star Mothers — an organization with which her late mother, <a href="https://archive.triblive.com/news/obituaries/gold-star-mother-drew-strength-from-group/?printerfriendly=true" target="_blank">Frances Colletto, was involved</a>&nbsp;— asking her to make a video tribute to her brother. It would be used in Monday’s virtual Memorial Day commemoration put on by Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall, the Veterans Breakfast Club and 14 other organizations and governments, which was telecast online.</p>
<p>“At first I was like, ‘What do they want us to do?’” said Mrs. Price, 68, who was 16 when her brother died. “‘How am I going to make a video?’”</p>
<p>But working with her older sister, Carol Stewart, they came up with an idea to post a picture of their brother in uniform, while Mrs. Price read from a poem her brother wrote just two months before he died called “In Memory of Hamburger Hill,” after a battle he barely survived.</p>
<p>She tried to make the poem that much more poignant by recording her reading of it while sitting in a spot in Highland Park where she and her brother had played as kids — “even though no one who heard it would know that,” she said.</p>
<p>The honor by her and her sister was part of a near-hourlong, powerful montage of short tours of sections of the hall, interspersed with about 60 personal honors — like for Colletto — and visuals from area memorials from around the Pittsburgh region, some of them simple segments of past memorials or parades, others direct appeals to keep up the fallens’ memory, including a song by a local musician.</p>
<p>Seven local politicians, including Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto and Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald, provided short commentary.</p>
<p>In his short comments, state Rep. Dan Miller, D-Mt. Lebanon, noted it was “a little bit different this year.”</p>
<p>“We won’t be at our parade. We won’t be at our memorials,” he said. “But that’s OK. It’s still very important for us that we talk and that we remember together.”</p>
<p>The prepared remarks and tributes followed a short, live ceremony inside Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall in Oakland that would normally be packed with up to 2,000 people, but had just a couple-dozen people there for the brief reading of honors, a benediction, Pledge of Allegiance and singing of the National Anthem followed by a color guard’s salute.</p>
<p>The live ceremony — with all the participants standing socially distant apart and wearing masks unless they were speaking — was in stark contrast to the snippets of past memorial services and parades from around the region where masks were absent and people stood shoulder-to-shoulder.</p>
<p>“We knew about mid-March we couldn’t have our regular event,” John McCabe, CEO of Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall, said Monday afternoon after the event. “So we thought, ‘Let’s try to do something virtually.’”</p>
<p>The hall handled organizing the live portion of the event, and teamed up with the Veterans Breakfast Club in early May to plan the pretaped portions of the memorial, which can still be viewed on the club’s website at <a href="https://vbcpgh.org/" target="_blank">https://vbcpgh.org/</a>.</p>

<p>There were some technical difficulties — as might be expected for a first-ever virtual ceremony of its kind — that delayed the start of the event for about 20 minutes.</p>
<p>Though it was essentially a fallback option, Mr. McCabe said those involved seemed to enjoy the way the memorial came together, so much so that the hall intends to keep some of the aspects of the virtual ceremony as part of future in-person ceremonies.</p>
<p>“It truly was a better way to recognize and honor the day,” he said of the montage that involved more than 30 communities and their local memorials. “We got the entire region involved.”</p>
<p>Dan McPoyle, a Navy veteran who sent in a personal tribute to his father, Harry, who served in the Army during World War II, thought the prepared video ended up being “amazingly positive.”</p>
<p>In fact, he said, “I think this is one of the best Memorial Days in my 71 years of my life in this world,” he said. “But I’ve always liked to make something positive out of a negative.”</p>
<p>Mrs. Price agreed.</p>
<p>Rather than detracting from Memorial Day, she said, “I think it actually gave people more of a chance to express themselves individually.”</p>
<p>“I think [doing it virtually with personal tributes] makes it a little bit better for other people to understand how it affected you,” she said.</p>
<p>That was why, once she thought about how she wanted to honor her brother, she immediately thought of the five-stanza poem he sent home before he died, because it said not only so much about the dire circumstances in which he found himself, but just as much about who he was.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.iwvpa.net/colletto_av/index.php" target="_blank">The poem is grim and direct</a>, and laments that the men who died around him on Hamburger Hill would die in vain, with no one remembering any of them. But it ends with a plea for peace:</p>
<p><em>“Peace is golden and maybe achieved.</em></p>
<p><em>If men would learn to love</em></p>
<p><em>The burden of war would be relieved.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a true story, it is no lie.</em></p>
<p><em>Give credit to the dead,</em></p>
<p><em>Because of the hill, they died.”</em></p>
