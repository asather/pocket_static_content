<h1>Robert Morris’ Jaycee Gebhard is 1st player ever drafted by Toronto NWHL franchise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s an honor to be selected in the first round of any sports draft, but it’s even more special to be the first player ever taken by a new franchise.</p>
<p>Jaycee Gebhard found herself in that rare situation Tuesday night when she was picked sixth overall in the 2020 NWHL draft by the new (and still unnamed) expansion franchise in Toronto, becoming that team’s first-ever draft pick in the process.</p>
<p>Gebhard is the all-time leading scorer in Robert Morris women hockey’s history. She’s one of three Colonials to be a first-round NWHL selection over the last four drafts, the other two being Brittany Howard No. 10 overall in 2017 and Maggie LaGue No. 22 overall in 2018.</p>
<p>The historic draft pick was announced via Twitter by Meghan Chayka, co-founder of hockey analytics company Stathletes.</p>
<p>Her team, the university and Robert Morris women’s hockey coach Paul Colontino all offered words of congratulations for Gebhard on draft night.</p>
<p>Like the NHL, the NWHL’s 2019-20 campaign was halted by the COVID-19 pandemic, though the NWHL was much closer to finishing its season. The Boston Pride and Minnesota Whitecaps were set to face each other on March 13 in the Isobel Cup Final — the NWHL equivalent of the Stanley Cup — but <a href="https://www.nwhl.zone/news/nwhl-postpones-2020-isobel-cup-final" target="_blank">that matchup was postponed</a> until “the appropriate time,” according to a league press release.</p>
