<h1>Just the trick for safely trick or treating </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the mists rise from the Allegheny River and seep through the neighborhoods to the north, witches and zombies can happily don masks under the full moon on Saturday, Oct. 31. Halloween is happening!</p>
<p>Boo to You is O’Hara’s Halloween program. Homeowners handing out treats will display signs that assure parents of little ghosts and goblins they are following recommendations for safe celebrations. The signs and program details can be found on the township website, ohara.pa.us. Residents can print signs from the site or grab one from the folder outside the township building on Fox Chapel Road.</p>
<p>As is traditional, those who do not wish to participate should turn off their porch lights during trick-or-treat hours from 6 to 8 p.m. Because COVID-19 is a fluid situation, the township will announce any changes made by federal, state or county officials.</p>
<p>The Centers for Disease Control Halloween guidelines recommend avoiding indoor parties, haunted houses and sitting close to others on the back of a hay wagon. Outdoor movies and pumpkin patches are OK.</p>
<p>The Sharpsburg Borough council decided to embrace O’Hara’s rules to provide a safe and healthy Halloween. The Sharpsburg Volunteer Fire Department at 1611 Main St. could be a good place to start. The firefighters are continuing their tradition of handing out treat bags in front of the station. For the rest of the trick trek, Halloweeners can stop at homes with the lights on to collect more goodies. Details can be found at sharpsburgborough.com.</p>
<p>Etna Borough Council agreed residents can let their little monsters collect treats from 6 to 8 p.m. on Halloween night. As in the other towns, Etnans must leave their lights on if they’re handing out candy. Etna’s flyer suggests trick or treaters avoid large groups, stay outside and bring an special potion — hand sanitizer! &nbsp; Treat-givers are advised to put candy out in front of their houses to avoid in-person contact, disinfect their doorbell regularly and wear a face covering.</p>
<p>In the other direction, Aspinwall Mayor Joe Noro and Council President, Tim McLaughlin are reviewing the plan for Halloween, according to Melissa Lang, borough manager. A decision should be made by next week, she said. Locals can check aspinwallpa.com for updates.</p>
<p>The Blawnox Fire Department will hand out treat bags to those who are social distancing and wearing CDC-recommended masks before trick or treating is held in the borough from 2 to 4 p.m. on Oct. 31. The customary parade has been canceled. Residents can pick up a flyer at the front door of the borough building or print one from blawnox.com to show they are participating.</p>
<p>Shaler officials say because Halloween and trick or treating is not a township-sponsored event, decisions regarding fun and games are up to families. Shaler families that want to hand out treats should turn on their porch lights on Halloween.</p>
<p>The township has canceled its annual Fall Festival. This decision was not made lightly, said a post on Shaler’s Facebook page. When taking the key components of Fall Fest into consideration: crowd size, bounce houses, s’more making, pumpkin decorating and the always popular hay maze, “we did not feel that we could safely and responsibly host this event,” the post said.</p>
<p>New, safer events have popped up to spook Shaler residents, said Judy Kording, assistant township manager. They can get an early start for Halloween at Kiwanis Park on Oct. 10 at 5 p.m. for Trunk or Treat, followed by the movie “Hocus Pocus.”</p>
<p>To participate, people must visit shaler.org to be among only 15 cars handing out treats from their trunks. Once they reach that goal, Ms. Kording said, treaters can register. “If a large number of people register, we will assign scheduled times for trick-or-treaters to avoid overcrowding.” Once the moon rises, the movie will start. Once again, to control crowding, registration is required.</p>
<p>In Hampton, the annual Halloween parade has been transformed into a drive-in movie night set for Oct. 24, the week before Halloween. Moviegoers must preregister at hampton-pa.org to see “Hocus Pocus” at Hampton Township Park in the lower level Community Center and pool parking lot at 7:15 p.m.</p>
<p>Those who can’t make either date can drive in to the Hartwood Acres Amphitheater on Oct. 23 to see the movie. Gates open at 5:30 p.m. and will close when 300 guests arrive or dusk sets.</p>
<p>McCandless is braving Halloween this year, too, with a warning that trick or treaters wait until they are safe at home and have washed their hands before eating candy.</p>
<p>Similar rules are in place in Cheswick Borough, Indiana Township, Fox Chapel Borough and beyond. Trick or treaters are welcome at homes with the light on.</p>
