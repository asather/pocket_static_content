<h1>Dan McCarthy shoots 66 in final round for another Frank B. Fuhrer Invitational win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It doesn’t matter to Dan McCarthy where the victories come and, sometimes, how much they pay.</p>
<p>But they are all the more satisfying when the winning score obliterates the tournament record and 38 of the 40 players in the field never get closer than 11 shots.</p>
<p>McCarthy’s final-round 66 on Wednesday was enough to catch Irwin native Dan Obremski and win the $200,000 Frank B. Fuhrer Invitational by one shot at the Pittsburgh Field Club. His record score of 14-under 266 earned him the $40,000 first prize and sent him in a good frame of mind back to the Korn Ferry Tour, where McCarthy is trying to earn his way to the PGA Tour after barely missing last year.</p>
<p>“I felt like my game was trending even last week in Utah when I finished 52nd,” McCarthy said. “If you can shoot 14-under out here for four days, you’re game is obviously in a good place. I’m just going to try to build on it going forward and hopefully turn it into a win out there.”</p>
<p>McCarthy needed only to two-putt the final hole from 22 feet for par to edge Obremski, who missed the green at the par-3 finishing hole and made bogey.</p>
<p>It was a disappointing ending for Obremski, who began the day with a three-shot lead on McCarthy and shot a final-round 70. He even birdied two of the final four holes at the Field Club.</p>
<p>It was the second time in three years McCarthy has won the invitational. Each time he came back from three shots down for the victory.</p>
<p>“I was just trying to keep up,” McCarthy said. “He may have just dragged me along. I was patient enough until I was able to put a little run on the back nine there. It turned out to just be enough.”</p>
<p>After making just three bogeys in the first 54 holes, Obremski made five in the final round, none more damaging than the one at the 72nd hole, the 220-yard par-3 when his 7-iron tee shot came up short left of the putting surface.</p>
<p>After forcing a final-hole showdown with a spectacular 3-foot birdie at No. 17 — he lofted a 54-degree wedge from 126 yards over a tree from the right rough — Obremski saw his chance at the $40,000 first prize disappear when he missed a 6-foot par putt that would have forced a playoff.</p>
<p>“He played really well,” Obremski said. “To shoot 4-under to win, that’s pretty solid. Me, having a three-shot lead and shooting even par, looking back, that’s pretty darn good and could be good enough to win. But it wasn’t.”</p>
<p>McCarthy and Obremski so outdistanced the rest of the field that the next closest player was defending champion and PGA Tour member Mike Gligic, who finished third at 3-under 277. Obremski’s bogey at the final hole kept him from joining McCarthy as the only players to post all four rounds in the 60s.</p>
<p>“Dan played tremendous golf,” McCarthy said. “I’ve been on the other side of those before. He played great. He certainly deserved to win, no question.”</p>
<p>Even during his post-round acceptance speech, McCarthy lauded Obremski’s performance, saying to him, “Keep doing what you’re doing.”</p>
<p>The high praise meant a lot to Obremski. At 33 and with no status on any tour of which to speak, he has been teetering about which way to go with his career. He spends a lot of time giving lessons at a learning center in West Palm Beach, Fla., and has been playing in some occasional one-day events in Florida. He won three times on the GPro Tour and a couple other mini-tour events, but those wins combined likely don’t equal the $20,000 he won — the largest paycheck of his career — for finishing second at the Field Club.</p>
<p>“Dan saying that to me is awesome,” said Obremski, whose previous biggest payday was $15,000 for finishing 56th at the PGA Tour’s Greenbrier Classic. “It’s encouraging. The past year, I’ve been like, man, should I just hang it up and not play? Sometimes you need a little faith and mustard seed to keep you going. I had lost hope for a while. This week was telling me I can do it, I can be on tour for sure. I know I can now.”</p>
<p>McCarthy’s only hiccup came when he bogeyed the uphill par-4 third hole that dropped him four shots from the lead. After that he was nearly flawless, making back-to-back birdies at Nos. 4 and 5, then again at Nos. 10 and 11.</p>
<p>The bending 15-foot birdie at the par-4 10th was big on several fronts, and not just because of its sloping difficulty. It came right after he missed a 3-foot birdie at No. 9 and allowed him to pull him within a shot of Obremski. When McCarthy birdied the par-5 11th after laying up in the fairway, he finally had battled back for a share of the lead.</p>
<p>When Obremski bogeyed the par-3 14th from the right fairway bunker, McCarthy had the lead for the first time since the end of the second round. And he didn’t let go.</p>
<p>“I hit a lot of really good shots when I needed to,” McCarthy said. “I did a good job today of hitting it in the right spots where I could at least be somewhat aggressive. It’s always tough to be aggressive at the Fuhrer.”</p>
