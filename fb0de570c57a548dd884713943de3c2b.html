<h1>Still a starter, Jameson Taillon talks return and the future of Pirates pitching</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>KANSAS CITY — Jameson Taillon has seen the speculation equating a second Tommy John surgery to a baseball death sentence, how it either ends careers or forces pitchers to convert from a starter into a reliever.</p>
<p>But as a cancer survivor and an eternal optimist, Taillon couldn’t disagree more with that assessment. The 2010 first-round draft pick (No. 2 overall) doesn’t plan on shifting to the bullpen and insisted he feels better than ever, an assertion involving the biomechanical changes he’s made to prolong his career.</p>
<p>While driving to PNC Park to join the Pirates for this current road trip — his first of the season — Taillon spoke with the Post-Gazette about facing hitters again, how he’s evolved and the excitement already bubbling for next year.</p>
<p>“I understand the people who have had two Tommy Johns and the history of it,” Taillon said. “There’s not a huge success rate. … But there’s also not a ton of data.</p>
<p>“I legitimately feel healthier than I’ve ever felt in pro ball right now. So, what if my problem is fixed, my mechanics are way better, and now I’m actually meant to be a starter? I guess we’ll see.”</p>
<p>There are a few more boxes for Taillon, 28, to check with his rehab this season. He faced hitters for the third time on Wednesday and plans to do so at least twice more in the coming weeks, building up to two or three innings.</p>
<p>From there, Taillon will try a new deceleration program — gradually eliminating throwing sessions instead of stopping all at once, though he still plans on using plyometric and weighted balls in the offseason to maintain those mechanical changes. Aside from that, it’ll be a normal offseason.</p>
<p>When Taillon does return, expect to see a different pitcher. The right-hander is using his legs more. His arm path was shortened to protect against injury.</p>
<p>It’s mostly routine, Taillon said, although his mechanics did get out of whack a couple weeks ago when he threw live at PNC Park for the first time since surgery.</p>
<p>“I got a little bit longer with my arm path,” Taillon said. “But thankfully I’ve been able to recognize it, make the adjustment and bring it back.”</p>
<p>Something Taillon has noticed is that his slider has changed. In the past, it was more like a cutter — thrown harder, prioritizing deception over movement. Now, Taillon said the spin on his slider has been much tighter, the pitcher slower with more snap.</p>
<p>“I love the way it’s spinning,” Taillon said. “It’s more of a true slider.”</p>
<p>The overall velocity has been a pleasant surprise, too. Taillon said he’s been around 94-95 mph, which tracks with his career average. It was also validating to see all of the work he’s put in translating to throwing live.</p>
<p>“It’s harder in bullpens than it was before surgery,” Taillon said. “Been really pleased with that. Plus, I’ve got a whole offseason to keep training, so I anticipate it will be right where it needs to be if not a tick above where it was before.”</p>
<p>Taillon has obviously watched plenty of Pirates games and likes what he’s seen from the starting rotation. He said he’s “all in on the [JT] Brubaker and [Mitch] Keller train.” Chad Kuhl is a good friend, and Taillon has been thrilled to see him back and healthy. Steven Brault, too. Even Cody Ponce has made an impression.</p>
<p>“He’s looked extremely confident,” Taillon said of Ponce. “Like he belongs in the big leagues.”</p>
<p>Add those guys to Joe Musgrove and Trevor Williams, and Taillon thinks the Pirates could actually have depth in 2021.</p>
<p>“There are eight or nine legitimate options if we’re all healthy,” Taillon said. “Spring training should be interesting.”</p>
<p>Taillon has spent much of this season alongside Keller. They’ve talked through situations, and Keller has regularly asked for advice.</p>
<p>But as Taillon offered pointers on pitch-sequencing or how to attack certain hitters, he also started to have a realization.</p>
<p>“We’ll be talking, I’ll try to give him some advice, and I’ll think, ‘How did I learn that?I learned that through experience,’” Taillon said.</p>
<p>“The best thing for Mitch is going to be to go out there — he’s a really smart kid — and let him pitch, let him experience success and let him experience failure. He’ll learn from that and become the best version of himself.”</p>
<p>The last part of the conversation involved new pitching coach Oscar Marin and bullpen coach Justin Meccage and what Taillon has observed while watching those two work with the Pirates’ active pitchers.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been hard to detect a difference, Taillon said, specifically with how he feels Pirates pitchers are now prepared. Marin and Meccage are accentuating strengths and using modern technology to gain any advantage possible.</p>
<p>“I don’t want this to come as a slight at the previous regime, but something that has really fired me up is the emphasis on development every single day,” Taillon said. “Oscar and [Meccage] don’t believe that anyone is a finished product.</p>
<p>“So, for me, being a curious guy and interested in learning, the conversations we’ve had about pitching have been amazing. They’re showing up every day doing drills with guys, really giving feedback on bullpens. I can’t wait to carry that over into next year.”</p>
