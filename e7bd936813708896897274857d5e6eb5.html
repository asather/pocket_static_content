<p>Like many in the Pittsburgh region concerned about COVID-19, Vanessa German was trying to do the right thing last week when she called to set up an appointment with her primary care physician.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/art-architecture/2018/01/16/United-States-Artists-USA-Fellowship-awards-Vanessa-German/stories/201801160009" target="_blank">famed Pittsburgh visual and performance artist</a> had returned from a trip to an art show in New York City, flying to and from there through Newark Airport on Sunday, March 1.</p>
<p>By Tuesday, March 3, she had a fever that grew into flu-like symptoms that got worse through the week. On Thursday, March 5, she called her doctor’s office and described her symptoms and where she had been the prior Sunday along with her concern that she should be tested for COVID-19, the disease caused by a new coronavirus.</p>
<p>The office made an appointment for 8:20 a.m. Monday, March 9.</p>
<p>At 7:30 a.m. the morning of the appointment, Ms. German’s doctor called and asked her a few questions about where she had flown through, where she had visited and how she was feeling — and then told her not to come in.</p>
<p>“I would not feel comfortable with you sitting in our waiting room with a [medically] vulnerable population,” Ms. German said the doctor told her.</p>
<p>“Can I get tested for COVID-19?” Ms. German said she asked her doctor, who works in a small, private clinic and could not be reached Thursday for comment.</p>
<p>“We do not have the capacity to test you because of the Pennsylvania Department of Health,” the doctor told her.</p>
<p>Ms. German, 43, of Homewood, never did get tested for COVID-19 and has continued to self-isolate.&nbsp;“I don’t want to get anyone else sick,” she said.</p>
<p>The scenario she describes is very similar to dozens of claims of interactions that people with similar fears —&nbsp;travel and then flu-like symptoms —&nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/zlorance14/status/1237121906546966535" target="_blank">have posted online in recent weeks</a>: A nurse or doctor said the individual would not be tested for COVID-19 either because the office could not do the test or because the person did not reach the high bar to qualify.</p>
<p><strong>‘No backlog of tests’</strong></p>
<p>There’s been <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/01/health/coronavirus-washington-spread.html" target="_blank">widespread concern for weeks </a>that the reason COVID-19 is spreading around the state and country is that there has been a strictly limited amount of testing —&nbsp;with too high a bar that may result in missing potential cases of community spread of the disease.</p>
<p>Hospital officials in Pittsburgh, as well as county and state public health officials continue to say that people who should be tested are being tested and that there has not been any rationing of the test, other than the requirement that people who are tested meet the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s guidelines.</p>
<p>“The state readily tests anyone” who meets the CDC’s guidelines, said Dr. Brian Parker, Allegheny Health Network’s chief quality officer.</p>
<p>The current guidelines include looking for a combination of symptoms —&nbsp;fever, cough, shortness of breath —&nbsp;with COVID-19 affected-travel or contact experience, or, alternatively, if there is no other proven cause for a respiratory illness.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said during a press conference on Wednesday that as a result: “We have no backlog of tests.”</p>
<p>As of Thursday morning, <a href="https://www.health.pa.gov/topics/disease/Pages/Coronavirus.aspx" target="_blank">the state reported that it had tested, or will shortly test, 196 people</a>&nbsp;since the state laboratory in Exton began testing on March 3, a pace of roughly 20 people a day.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine&nbsp;insists neither the state, nor local public health officials —&nbsp;either of whom must approve a COVID-19 test before it is done —&nbsp;have intentionally set too high a bar.</p>
<p><strong>Running short on tests?</strong></p>
<p>But Nate Wardle, spokesman for the state Department of Health, said in an email Thursday that the state’s ability to run COVID-19 tests could end soon if the CDC does not give it more&nbsp; kits soon.</p>
<p>“The state has the ability to continue to test with no backlog, but we will need additional kits to continue to do that,” he said in an email.</p>
<p>“We originally received one test kit, which gave us the ability to do around 700-800 tests, which equaled out at the time to around 250 individuals who could be tested,” he added. “Through the combining of swabs and other efforts, there may be the potential to test more individuals than that.”</p>
<p>Testing for COVID-19 includes trying to get swabs from a patient’s throat, nose, and, if possible, sputum, which is a mixture of saliva and mucus coughed up from the respiratory tract but not always available.</p>
<p>Originally, Mr. Wardle said, the CDC required that the state labs do three tests for each patient if it had all three swabs —&nbsp;throat, nose and sputum. On March 10, the CDC said the throat and nose swabs could be combined into one sample, while still doing the sputum sample as well.</p>
<p>That helped extend the life of the original test kits sent out.</p>
<p>The CDC did not respond to questions Thursday about when it expects to send new kits to the state.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said on Wednesday that she is confident they will arrive soon.</p>
<p>Mr. Wardle wrote Thursday: “We are working with the CDC to ensure we have the ability to continue to test, and we are optimistic that there will be no issues.”</p>
<p>At a minimum, even if the state lab only tested two samples for every one of the 196 people tested so far, that means the state lab is halfway, or just over halfway, through its supply of tests.</p>
<p>Based on the numbers, the state could have as few as&nbsp;100 tests left to use in its original supply or as many as 400. Mr. Wardle would not give a specific number.</p>
<p><strong>‘Am I OK?’</strong></p>
<p>Locally, Allegheny Health Network is the only hospital system that would say roughly how many tests it has requested.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Parker said that AHN has done 10 to 20 COVID-19 swabs and sent them to the state lab for testing so far, with no positive cases so far. As of Thursday afternoon, there still has not been any positive COVID-19 cases in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System, UPMC, Heritage Valley, Excela Health and St. Clair Hospital did not respond to questions about how many people they have tested for COVID-19. State data only provides statewide statistics on testing.</p>
<p>Though many people, like Ms. German, have said they tried to get tested because of travel and having symptoms, Dr. Parker said that has not been the experience with AHN.</p>
<p>“The vast majority of folks are not coming in looking to be tested just because they’re sick,” he said. “They’re calling to get a rundown of, ‘Hey, this is where I’ve been. Am I OK?’”</p>
<p>“We’re not getting people coming in saying, ‘I just want a test,” he said.</p>
<p>And there has been no surge of sick people in AHN emergency rooms or doctors offices recently, he said.&nbsp;It’s been “about the same amount as you’d see during a regular flu season.”</p>
<p>However, he warned: “What will change is a heightened interest [in testing] once a positive test has been confirmed in our area.”</p>
