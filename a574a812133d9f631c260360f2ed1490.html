<h1>'It got loud': Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa were Pittsburgh rock stars in 1998</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates didn’t give their fans a ton to get excited about in 1998. Sure, Kevin Young had a career year with 27 home runs and 108 RBIs. Jason Kendall also hit .327, Turner Ward literally ran through a wall, and Francisco Cordova pitched to a 3.31 ERA.</p>
<p>Not bad, any of it. Maybe better than expected.</p>
<p>But by late August, attention had shifted away from the Pirates and toward the magical home run chance at hand, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa together running down Roger Maris’ 37-year-old record.</p>
<p>McGwire and Sosa combined to hit five of their 136 home runs that summer against the Pirates. Two of them resulted in standing ovations that required the sluggers to make curtain calls at Three Rivers Stadium.</p>
<p>“You make a mistake,” Jason Kendall said by phone on Monday, “and it got loud.”</p>
<p>There are so many magical memories from that season, which became a talking point nationally with ESPN airing its “Long Gone Summer” documentary on Sunday night, but one of the biggest locally was the adoration the two sluggers received.</p>
<p>It was so much, apparently, that McGwire felt a little awkward when he was basically adopted by another city’s fans.</p>
<p>“With all due respect to the Pirates, I hope they didn’t mind it. That’s why I don’t feel comfortable doing it,” McGwire said after his curtain call on Aug. 23, 1998, which followed an eighth-inning homer (No. 53 of the season for him) off Ricardo Rincon. “But they kept clapping for me, and so I did it.”</p>
<p>“It’s a wonderful thing to see,” added Cardinals manager Tony La Russa. “It shows they appreciate what this guy is doing.”</p>
<p>McGwire appeared in 11 games against the Pirates in 1998 and hit .433 (13-for-30) with three home runs, three doubles, seven RBIs and 10 runs scored. The Pirates walked McGwire 15 times in 46 plate appearances.</p>
<p>They had more success against Sosa, who hit .250 (10-for-40) in 10 games against the Pirates. Although he hit 66 home runs (McGwire had 70), it’s easy to forget that Sosa led Major League Baseball with 171 strikeouts that summer.</p>
<p>Pirates pitchers were responsible for 15 of those, though Sosa did hit two home runs against them.</p>
<p>Things actually started slow for the two NL Central sluggers; McGwire was the first to homer against the Pirates, and that didn’t come until Aug. 22, 1998, off Francisco Cordova.</p>
<p>Fans at Three Rivers Stadium — more than 115,000 total, including the Pirates’ first back-to-back regular season sellouts — had an interesting experience over that three-game series, which took place on Saturday, Sunday and Monday.</p>
<p>The Cardinals arrived in Pittsburgh around 4 a.m. Saturday morning, prompting La Russa to cancel batting practice.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter much for McGwire, who smacked No. 52 in the top of the first inning to become the first player in major league history to homer that many times before Sept. 1. The ball traveled 477 feet, which would be the 14th-longest homer either of them hit that summer.</p>
<p>(No other home runs against the Pirates appeared in the top 20 of that list, though McGwire did hit a 527-foot shot off former Pirate Paul Wagner on May 12, 1998.)</p>
<p>After a 17-game lull, where McGwire homered just twice in 17 games, the shot off Cordova was McGwire’s fifth in a six-game stretch.</p>
<p>“It amazes me how everyone wants a piece of him," Kendall said at the time. "This game is hard enough as it is, and he has to block all the stuff he's going through out to go out and do his job. It's amazing what he has done for the game."</p>
<p>Penguins co-owner Mario Lemieux actually attended the second game of that series — when McGwire homered off Rincon in a 4-3 Pirates victory before 42,134 — and dropped in the visitors’ clubhouse to meet McGwire.</p>
<p>McGwire gave Lemieux a signed bat. Lemieux gave McGwire a signed hockey stick.</p>
<p>“That’s pretty cool,” McGwire told the Post-Gazette’s Bob Smizik, “because my son is a hockey fan.”</p>
<p>The accounts of that series are hilarious to read. Pirates pitchers — if they didn’t give McGwire something good to hit — were booed. So was John Mabry, who started at first base for the final game of the series, with La Russa resting McGwire.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">''I don't blame the fans,'' Mabry said. ''They wanted to see Mark hit. It's like paying to see Elvis and getting a garage band instead.''</span></p>
<p>McGwire’s third and final home run came on Sept. 15, 1998, when he cranked a 1-0 fastball from Jason Christiansen for No. 63 of the season. It was actually McGwire’s first home run since Sept. 8, 1998, the day he broke Maris’ record. It also snapped a stretch of 18 consecutive at-bats without a home run.</p>
<p>Although he didn’t experience as much success as McGwire against the Pirates, Sosa’s appearances were met with the same sort of excitement. From both sides, too.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Sosa kept a figurine of Robert Clemente in his locker that season, saying of the Pirates legend, “He’s a hero to me.”</span></p>
<p>The first Sosa bomb (No. 56) came off Jason Schmidt on Sept. 4, 1998, in a 5-2 Cubs win. Sosa drove a 2-0 fastball 401 feet to right-center field to pull within two home runs of McGwire at the time.</p>
<p>Fans showered Sosa with cheers.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I feel like I’m in my house right now,” Sosa said of the reception he received.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Three Rivers Stadium, however, was not completely slanted toward Sosa.</span></p>
<p>Knowing Sosa did not want to learn what McGwire had done until afterward, the in-game staff would show McGwire’s at-bats on the video board, reportedly annoying Sosa and the Cubs.</p>
<p>Gene Lamont, the Pirates manager at the time, insisted the Pirates wanted to be aggressive with both Sosa and McGwire, giving them a “legitimate chance to get the record.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">That seemed to track with Schmidt, who fell behind in the count.</span></p>
<p>“My game is to go right after guys,” Schmidt told the Post-Gazette’s Paul Meyer. “If he takes me deep, he takes me deep. On 2-0, he’s probably looking heater there. I figured I could power one by him.”</p>
<p>Yeah, good luck with that.</p>
<p>Sosa’s second home run against the Pirates came off rookie left-hander Sean Lawrence — who had just eight innings of major league experience — the next night, his ninth in 13 games, helping the Cubs to an 8-4 victory.</p>
<p>Even Pirates players became fans, Kendall said. It was hardly uncommon for a group of them to emerge from the home clubhouse and watch McGwire or Sosa take batting practice.</p>
<p>“I remember Three Rivers being packed for BP,” Kendall said. “Some of our players even went out. I’d say to them, ‘What are you gonna do? Watch to see how far they’re going to hit a ball off you later?’ ”</p>
<p><span>Kendall didn’t remember a ton about specific games or homers, although he did remember pitchers wanting to be aggressive — maybe sometimes even too aggressive (see: Schmidt).</span></p>
<p>He also remembered the state of baseball at the time and likened it to right now, when fans are upset over the ongoing labor dispute. Back then, baseball badly needed McGwire vs. Sosa and could require something similar again soon.</p>
<p>“People were [ticked],” Kendall said. “They weren’t going to watch baseball any more. Then all of a sudden something like Sosa-McGwire comes along, people are all locked in again, and those two are getting standing ovations at visitors’ parks.”</p>
