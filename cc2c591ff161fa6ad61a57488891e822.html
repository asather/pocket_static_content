<h1>State AG Shapiro: Grand jury report reveals Pa.'s systemic failure to regulate shale gas industry </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A statewide grand jury investigating the operations and regulation of the shale gas drilling industry has issued a scathing report detailing the systemic failure of the state environment and health departments in regulating the industry and protecting public health.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who released the <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FINAL-fracking-report-w.responses-with-page-number-V2.pdf" target="_blank">report on the grand jury’s two-year investigation</a> Thursday morning, said it uncovers the “initial failure” more than a dozen years ago of the state Department of Environmental Protection to respond to and regulate the shale gas industry and the impacts of hydraulic fracturing or “fracking.”</p>
<p>And, while the Wolf administration has made improvements at the agency, the grand jury said, there remains room for improvement.</p>
<p>“This report is about preventing the failures of our past from continuing into our future,” Mr. Shapiro said. “It’s about the big fights we must take on to protect Pennsylvanians — to ensure that their voices are not drowned out by those with bigger wallets and better connections. There remains a profound gap between our Constitutional mandate for clean air and pure water, and the realities facing Pennsylvanians who live in the shadow of fracking giants and their investors.”</p>
<p>In announcing the report’s findings at a Harrisburg news conference, Mr. Shapiro held up containers of brown water and clogged water filters while detailing testimony of residents who said the shale gas drilling industry has caused their well water to turn cloudy and become “black sludge,” and caused “problems with breathing whenever we were in the shower.”</p>
<p>He said Pennsylvania farmers testified that their horses, pets and other livestock would sometimes become “ill, infertile, and die” after drinking the same water as the farm families.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Shapiro, the grand jury report noted that other residents testified that their air became so badly polluted from the drilling pad emissions and stray methane gas that they could not leave windows open or let their children play outside. He said parents testified that their children would wake at night with severe nosebleeds.</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro noted that there have been recent improvements, particularly in the state Department of Health, but said the DEP has responded to the report by spouting industry positions and failing to acknowledge past regulatory and enforcement mistakes.</p>
<p>“More needs to be done and the grand jury’s recommendations are important to protect the public and earn back the public’s trust,” Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p>He said the grand jury took 287 hours of testimony from rural residents of the shale gas fields and government officials, and that “there is still more to come from the investigation over the coming weeks and months.”</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FINAL-fracking-report-w.responses-with-page-number-V2.pdf" target="_blank">grand jury report</a> makes eight recommendations:</p>
<p>● Expand the set back distance between homes and gas wells from 500 feet to 2,500 feet, and require an even bigger buffer between wells and schools and hospitals.</p>
<p>● Stop the “chemical coverup” by requiring drillers to make public to everyone, not just the DEP, all the chemicals used in drilling and fracking.</p>
<p>● Seek safer ways than using tanker trucks prone to spills to transport toxic wastes from wastewater ponds, called impoundments.</p>
<p>● Enact strict regulations on high pressure gas gathering lines running from well pads.</p>
<p>● Enact rules requiring the DEP to consider the aggregated air quality impacts of well sites, compressor stations and “pigging,” that is pipeline clean-out operations instead of looking at emissions from those facilities individually.</p>
<p>● Conduct a full and proper public health assessment of the impacts of shale gas drilling and fracking. The state Health Department is undertaking such a study.</p>
<p>● End the “revolving door” that allows DEP employees to go to work for the drilling industry because it erodes public trust.”</p>
<p>● End the “troubling pattern” of DEP addressing almost all drilling violations with civil penalties and make better use of the attorney general’s office to press criminal charges.</p>
<p>“DEP has told us that civil penalties are sufficient, but they are not,” Mr. Shapiro said.</p>
<p>He also announced the establishment of a phone and email “hot line” to alert his office to suspected shale gas industry violations. The phone hotline is 507-904-2643, or email at fracking@attorneygeneral.gov.</p>
<p>The findings announced Thursday morning were the latest revelations from the 43rd statewide grand jury. On June 12, Mr. Shapiro announced that as the result of the grand jury investigation, Range Resources, one of the largest shale gas drillers in the state, had pleaded no contest to criminal charges of negligent oversight of two well sites in Washington County.</p>
<p>According to the grand jury investigation, Range “knowingly covered up” leaking problems at a drilling waste pit and a 3 million-gallon hydraulic fracturing fluid flowback impoundment at its Yeager well pad in Amwell Township, Washington County. And a storage tank at its Brownlee drilling site in Buffalo Township, Washington County, leaked drilling wastewater onto neighboring property and into Buffalo Creek.</p>
<p>The driller paid fines totaling $150,000.</p>
<p>On June 15, Mr. Shapiro filed charges against Cabot Oil and Gas, a Texas-based company, for methane pollution that was found to have seeped from poorly constructed natural gas wells into the local water supply in Dimock, a rural township in northeastern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The contamination in Dimock has been the subject of investigations by state and federal environmental and health agencies. In addition to civil lawsuits, the problems in Dimock have been featured in the documentary “Gasland,” as well as several books.</p>
