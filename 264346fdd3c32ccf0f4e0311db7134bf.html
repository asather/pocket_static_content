<h1>Speaker sets March votes to fill 3 vacant state House seats</h1>

<p>HARRISBURG — Voters in three Pennsylvania House districts will choose new state representatives during special elections scheduled for March, the state House speaker announced Tuesday.</p>
<p>A top aide to Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, said the March 17 date was chosen to fill seats that became vacant because the incumbents were elected in November to other offices.</p>
<p>The seats were most recently held by Rep. Tedd Nesbit, R-Mercer, Rep. Gene DiGirolamo, R-Bucks, and Justin Walsh, R-Westmoreland.</p>
<p>Mr. Nesbit and Mr. Walsh were elected county judges, and Mr. DiGirolamo is now a county commissioner.</p>
<p>Rep. Tom Murt, R-Montgomery, will succeed Mr. DiGirolamo as chair of the Human Services Committee, and Rep. Gary Day, R-Lehigh, will chair Aging.</p>
<p>Turzai chief of staff Neal Lesher said the date reflects Mr. Turzai’s policy to move quickly on special elections.</p>
<p>“He has consistently called special elections as soon as possible, because he believes that every citizen deserves equal representation in the Legislature,” Mr. Lesher said.</p>
<p>Last month, Mr. Turzai scheduled a special election for Feb. 25 to fill the seat vacated by the resignation of Democratic Rep. Movita Johnson-Harrell of west Philadelphia. She faces criminal allegations she diverted money from a charity that serves people with mental illness, intellectual disabilities, substance abuse problems and other challenges.</p>
<p>Ms. Johnson-Harrell has said she disputes many of the allegations against her.</p>
