<p>Shell Chemical Appalachia will be announcing a&nbsp;“reset” on its&nbsp;sprawling petrochemical construction project in Potter Township, which has come under fire in recent days for not shutting down with as many as 8,000 workers at the site.</p>
<p>The details were not clear and haven’t been announced to most workers yet. One person briefed on the decision said it will involve suspending construction activities for a period that could last between few days to account for a major deep clean to several weeks.</p>
<p>The multi-billion dollar project has been the biggest fish for tradespeople in recent history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That concentration of employment has in recent days become a major concern. People in the area and some environmental groups have begun pressuring Shell Chemical Appalachia — and Pennsylvania’s governor and President Donald Trump — to halt work on the billion-dollar project which is so large it requires workers to park offsite and be bussed to work.</p>
<p>The job also requires daily meetings and cafeteria meals.</p>
<p>At a press conference on Wednesday, Beaver County officials called on the company to either suspend work or reduce it to prevent hundreds from crowding into tents.</p>

<p>Shell’s response has been evolving.</p>
<p>Late last week, the company told employees in a letter that it would “relax disciplinary action around attendance on a case-by-case basis” in light of the unfolding virus threat.</p>
<p>Two days later, after all state schools were ordered to close, Shell told employees to do what is best for their families’ well being without fear of discipline.</p>
<p>“In these times of uncertainty, please be assured that, as far as we can, we will work with you to support your personal situation.”</p>
<p>This week, it offered workers who wished to self-isolate the option to go on furlough and said they could file for unemployment benefits citing COVID-19.</p>
<p>Several workers reported that onsite they were told the project would remain open unless it was ordered to close by some external force. Some registered their displeasure on the company’s Pennsylvania project Facebook page, railing against dirty conditions and worried that if the company continues to leave it up to workers, it is forcing a choice between a paycheck and following public health guidelines. Mr. Trump this week asked that people avoid crowds of more than 10.</p>
<p>Shell spokesman Michael Marr said earlier this week that the company has stepped up deep cleaning, is encouraging workers to spread out, and changed how it handles meetings. As of Tuesday, he said, a “small percentage” of the workforce has elected to stay home, which amounts to a few hundred people.</p>
<p>Shell declined to comment on the&nbsp;“reset” at this time.</p>
<p>On Tuesday evening, the head of the American Chemistry Council, which represents chemical manufacturers, sent a letter to Mr. Trump and the governors of all 50 states urging them not order its members’ facilities shut.</p>
