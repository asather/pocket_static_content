<h1>County council shows little urgency in taking stand on Allegheny County Jail population</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nine Allegheny County Council members on Tuesday rejected the fast-tracking of an ordinance that could allow the release of nonviolent or juvenile offenders or those with health conditions from the jail and other facilities as the county continues to see a day-by-day increase in COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>The virus has not been identified in the Allegheny County Jail, but some elected officials and attorneys are raising concerns.&nbsp;County health officials on Tuesday announced the second death due to the virus and a new count of 58 active cases.</p>
<p>“I cannot stand idly by while we see a rise in COVID-19 cases, and it's only a matter of time before it's in the jail,” said at-large Councilwoman Bethany Hallam, the bill’s co-sponsor. “We don't want what happened in Riker's Island to happen here.”</p>
<p>Dozens — both inmates and employees — have tested positive for the virus in New York City’s jail system, according to local reports.</p>
<p>On Friday, Ms. Hallam and County Controller Chelsa Wagner, both on the board that's tasked with ensuring that the jail is managed properly, joined justice reform organizations to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/03/20/Allegheny-County-jail-board-members-Chelsa-Wagner-Bethany-Hallam-urge-non-violent-prisoner-release/stories/202003200127" target="_blank">urge county officials to</a>&nbsp;take action.</p>
<p>The county maintains that&nbsp;“the unilateral release of inmates from the jail is not something under the authority of the County Executive,” spokeswoman Amie Downs said Friday and reinforced Tuesday.</p>
<p>A pair of dueling legal opinions were issued Tuesday, one in which County Council solicitor John F. Cambest called the ordinance language&nbsp;“questionable at best” and the other penned by legal counsel for Ms. Wagner’s office, Brad Korinski, who countered that council would not have&nbsp;“overstepped its bounds” by passing the ordinance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the Allegheny County Courts are reviewing individual cases to determine which inmates are&nbsp;“appropriate for release,” according to a statement last week.</p>

<p>Wilhelmenia Nix, 34, of New Kensington waited Tuesday afternoon for her husband, Donnell Nix, to be released after his lawyer filed a successful motion on his behalf.</p>
<p>Mr. Nix, 48, who was serving a 60-day sentence for driving under a DUI suspended license, suffers from liver cirrhosis and kidney failure and was being refused an emergency room visit because of the novel coronavirus’ risk, Ms. Nix said.</p>
<p>"I have to take him to the hospital as soon as he gets out,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Nix contends that jail staff did not administer his medication appropriately; Ms. Downs said because of privacy laws, she could not comment on the case.</p>
<p>“I can't really speak to what the jail was doing ... or not with his medication. I do know that when it was brought to Judge Manning's attention by me he acted without hesitation,” Mr. Nix’s defense attorney Ken Haber said, referring to Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey Manning.</p>
<p>Mr. Haber said that he filed motions in recent days for up to a dozen clients who have health issues.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“My logic being as soon as one [COVID-19] case gets in that jail, everyone's going to get it. The less people in there the better,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Ms. Hallam said that&nbsp;“every moment we delay,&nbsp;whether it's waiting or the courts, the DA or county executive, the risk rises exponentially,” and&nbsp;further took issue that council did not act quickly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It is called emergency legislation for a reason,” she said, adding that the county code rules on emergency declarations bolster her argument.</p>
<p>Nine members, including Council President Pat Catena, who requested the legal opinion, voted against waiving the second reading of the bill, meaning it would have bypassed the committee process. Five members voted in favor; Councilman Walton DeWitt, D-Hill District, abstained.</p>
<p>“From the advice we were given from our solicitor, I believe [the vote] did follow county code,” Mr. Catena said. “It will go to committee, and we'll see what happens. The interesting thing is even if the second reading wasn't waived, it was still a far cry from passing. Obviously, a lot of work will need to be done in committee on it."</p>
<p>The proposal was sent to the Public Safety Committee, chaired by Councilwoman Liv Bennett, D-Downtown. Ms. Bennett, the bill’s other co-sponsor, called for a Thursday committee meeting. The councilwomen will then request an emergency regular council meeting for Tuesday next week, Ms. Hallam said.</p>
