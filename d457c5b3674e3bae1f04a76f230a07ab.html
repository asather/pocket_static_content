<h1>Part-time Verona cop charged with giving teen pot, alcohol, child porn</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A part-time Verona police officer has been charged with giving a 16-year-old boy alcohol and marijuana and exchanging child pornography with him.</p>
<p>Anthony Ogline, 34, of Verona was arrested and is being held in the Allegheny County Jail awaiting arraignment.</p>
<p>He is charged with unlawful contact with a minor, possession of child pornography, criminal use of a communications facility, corruption of minors, tampering with evidence and furnishing alcohol to a minor.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police said Wednesday that Whitehall police last Thursday launched a missing person investigation involving a 16-year-old boy who had&nbsp;“walked away from his school midday and got into a black sedan, which drove away.”</p>
<p>Whitehall police Chief Keith Henderson said the boy was a runaway and was not missing. He declined to say where the teen was from, but said he was not from Whitehall and the school in question was not in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The kid was missing from school of his own accord,” Chief Henderson said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police said school officials did not know if the teen was lured or trying to run away, but they eventually determined that Officer Ogline had picked up the boy.</p>
<p>By Friday morning, Whitehall police had tracked the youth to a Verona address and believed him to be with an off-duty Verona police officer.</p>
<p>Whitehall police went to the address but there was no answer. They asked for the county’s help.</p>
<p>County detectives responded, and a short time later Officer Ogline drove up with the teen, county police said.</p>
<p>“It has been determined that Anthony Ogline, a part time police officer, had communicated with the&nbsp;16-year-old and was the person who had picked him up from the school,” county police said. “It has also been determined that Ogline had provided the child with alcohol and marijuana and&nbsp;exchanged pornographic images with him.”</p>
<p>Officer Ogline’s status with the Verona police department was unclear.</p>
