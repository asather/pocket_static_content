<p>Two schools in the Gateway School District will continue with remote instruction for a second week after the discovery of nine new COVID-19 cases.</p>
<p>Superintendent William Short said Tuesday in a letter to parents that the Allegheny County Health Department confirmed seven new student cases at Gateway High School and two new staff cases at Moss Side Middle School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These cases come in addition to the two student cases at the high school and two staff cases at the middle school <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/27/Gateway-High-School-students-test-positive-COVID-19-football-game-canceled/stories/202009270227" target="_blank">over the previous two weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Classes, which had already been moved online this week, will now be held virtually through Oct. 9.&nbsp;The district had been following a blended instruction model in which groups of students had classes in person for part of the week and online classes on the other days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The letter said the state Department of Health encourages districts with multiple school buildings that have two to four positive cases within a&nbsp;14-day period to enact 14-day school closures, remote instruction, the deep cleaning of schools and quarantining as directed by public health officials.</p>
<p>“Contact tracing will occur, and individuals will be contacted if determined to be in close contact,” the letter said.</p>
<p>Mr. Short wrote that the district will continue working to safeguard its children.</p>
<p>“Through ongoing communication efforts, we will update you as new information is shared and&nbsp;provide instructional assistance to those who need it,” the letter said. “It is at these moments that we all must&nbsp;remember to adhere to social distancing guidelines. Gateway School District’s health and safety plan will be executed as we work together to resume in person instruction at Gateway High School and Moss Side Middle School.”</p>
