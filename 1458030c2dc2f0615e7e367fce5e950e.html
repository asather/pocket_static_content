<h1>Homewood company converts backpack operation to produce medical face shields</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With support from three local foundations and in partnership with Highmark Health, a Homewood company better known for making sustainable backpacks has converted its facility and is now producing medical-grade face shields for health care providers.</p>
<p>Ten employees at Day Owl will be involved in production of the shields, with the first shields going out the door Friday, said founder and CEO Ian Rosenberger. They expect to be able to produce 1,000 – 2,000 shields daily.</p>

<p>In a release, officials said Highmark already has ordered 30,000 shields for its physicians, nurses and other providers in the Allegheny Health Network but a company spokesperson said the shields costing $4.50 each will be available “to any hospital that needs them.”</p>
<p>The shields will be worn over N95 masks, allowing reuse of the masks while adding a second protective layer for patient care providers.</p>
<p>Personal protective equipment such as gowns, gloves and masks have become increasingly important, and increasingly scarce, as hospital clinicians treat patients with the highly-infectious COVID-19.</p>
<p>While Pittsburgh-area hospitals have not yet seen the overwhelming numbers of COVID-19 patients that centers in Seattle, New York and New Orleans have, federal infectious disease officials warn the outbreak could continue well into the summer.</p>
<p>In addition to the Henry L. Hillman Foundation, the project is being supported by the Richard King Mellon Foundation, whose $1.25 million award helped Day Owl parent Thread International create its facility in 2018, and The Heinz Endowments.</p>
<p>Day Owl, a division of Thread International, was launched in January.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>With many businesses shut down, Day Owl had to scramble to obtain raw material for the shields, including 30,000 square feet of plastic from California and 11 miles of elastic from North Carolina.</p>
<p>“That’s almost an elastic half marathon,” Mr. Rosenberger said. “I believe it was about to become underwear when we rescued it.”</p>
<p>The Wilkinsburg nonprofit Protohaven designed the shield with other local firms lending a hand for die-casting and other manufacturing components.</p>
