<p>A new decade brings another feature film to Pittsburgh: “Happiest Season” starring Kristen Stewart and Mackenzie Davis. The rom-com begins shooting in mid-January.</p>
<p>Directed by Clea DuVall (“Veep”),&nbsp;“Happiest Season” finds Stewart’s character, Abby, hoping to propose to her girlfriend, Harper, (played by Davis, “Tully”) at the holidays. But she discovers Harper has not yet come out to her conservative family.</p>
<p>DuVall co-wrote the script with Mary Holland.</p>
<p>“[It’s a] great way to start the new year with a new film providing jobs and new revenue to Southwestern Pennsylvania,” said Dawn Keezer, director of the Pittsburgh Film Office.</p>
<p>“Happiest Season” is a refreshingly modern comedy about the complexity of navigating romantic relationships and family dynamics,” Hannah Minghella, president of TriStar Pictures, told Variety.&nbsp;“Clea and Mary have written a hilarious and heart-warming movie full of emotional truth that is sure to become a holiday classic.”</p>
<p>Extras casting was recently announced at the <a href="http://www.movieextraspittsburgh.com/happiest-season---tristar-feature-film-.html" target="_blank">Movie Casting Extras</a> web site.</p>
<p>Another motion picture is currently shooting in Pittsburgh: Netflix’s “Sweet Girl” with Jason Momoa and Marisa Tomei.</p>
