<h1>Lawyer for Wilkinsburg shooting defendant says DA won't call key witness</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The lawyer for one of the two men facing trial in a 2016 mass shooting&nbsp;in Wilkinsburg revealed in a court filing Friday morning that&nbsp;prosecutors have decided not to call a key witness in the case.</p>
<p>Identified as either Witness No. 3 or W3, the jailhouse informant has&nbsp;been the subject of contentious debate between prosecutors and defense&nbsp;attorneys representing Cheron Shelton and Robert Thomas in the March&nbsp;9, 2016, slayings of five adults and an unborn child at a cookout in&nbsp;Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p>Casey White, one of Thomas’s attorneys, wrote in a petition Friday to&nbsp;dismiss the charges against his client that the Allegheny County&nbsp;District Attorney’s Office acknowledged Thursday that “ ‘W3’ is not&nbsp;credible.</p>
<p>“At 3:59 p.m. on Jan. 30, 2020, the Commonwealth agreed that ‘W3’ is&nbsp;not credible. They are no longer calling him as a witness,” Mr. White&nbsp;wrote.</p>
<p>The DA’s office declined comment, citing a gag order in the case.</p>
<p>Trial is supposed to begin Monday in the case. If Shelton and Thomas&nbsp;are found guilty of first-degree murder, prosecutors have indicated&nbsp;that they will seek the death penalty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If Mr. White’s account is accurate, the witness would become the third&nbsp;jailhouse informant to be prepared to testify against the defendants&nbsp;and then pulled back by the DA’s office.</p>
<p>“Thus,” Mr. White wrote, “the only evidence that will be presented&nbsp;against Mr. Thomas is very circumstantial at best.”</p>
<p>In fact, Mr. White argued in his petition, the evidence is so flimsy&nbsp;that it does not even meet the lowest standard to hold Thomas for&nbsp;trial.</p>
<p>“In short, the underlying crux of the Commonwealth’s case is that the&nbsp;defendant was at or near the scene when five individuals and an unborn&nbsp;child were killed,” the petition states. “To date, however, the&nbsp;Commonwealth has failed to produce any physical evidence or eyewitness&nbsp;testimony that the defendant committed the crimes charged.”</p>
<p>It is not clear what Witness No. 3 would have testified to, but&nbsp;another filing in the case Thursday by the defense attorneys indicates&nbsp;the testimony would have related to a conversation with Thomas.</p>
<p>The witness became a hot-button issue because of recent revelations that he had confessed to a killing a 15-month-old boy in 2013 but was&nbsp;not charged, and that he had information for law enforcement about&nbsp;eight violent crimes in which he was involved or knew about.</p>
<p>Testimony showed that the witness had been granted financial&nbsp;consideration and relocation services. Attorneys for Shelton and&nbsp;Thomas have complained that the DA’s office has been withholding&nbsp;important information about the witness, hampering their ability to&nbsp;mount an effective defense and properly prepare to cross-examine the&nbsp;witness.</p>
<p>In his petition, Mr. White address cell phone records that prosecutors&nbsp;“believe they have” showing telephone communication between Thomas and&nbsp;Shelton on the night of the shooting.</p>
<p>“The actual substance of the telephonic communication is&nbsp;non-existent,” the petition says. “There are neither recordings of the&nbsp;conversations nor copies of the text exchanges.”</p>
<p>Mr. White notes that the DA’s office also believes that Thomas entered a residence in Homewood about an hour after the killings. The filing&nbsp;does not make clear what the relevance is to the case, but Mr. White&nbsp;writes that the location is about two miles from the crime scene and&nbsp;that there were other people going in and out of the same home at the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>“That,” Mr. White declares, “is the summary of the Commonwealth’s case&nbsp;in chief.”</p>
<p>“To reiterate,” the petition says, “there is no direct evidence that&nbsp;puts Mr. Thomas at the scene of the crimes on March 9, 2016. There is&nbsp;no physical evidence; a cast of a ‘boot print’ found at the scene was&nbsp;found to not match Mr. Thomas’. There is no scientific evidence; the&nbsp;only DNA found at the scene excluded Mr. Thomas as a contributor, there are no eyewitnesses. Finally, there is no ‘confession.’ “</p>
<p>Defense attorneys for the two men accused of killing five people and&nbsp;an unborn child at a Wilkinsburg cookout nearly four years ago have&nbsp;asked the judge to throw out the case, bar the death penalty, or&nbsp;remove the entirety of the Allegheny County District Attorney's office&nbsp;from the prosecution, based on what they call "flagrant misconduct."</p>
<p>In a separate filing Thursday, Mr. White, his co-counsel, Michael&nbsp;Machen, and the lawyers for Shelton -- Wendy Williams and Randall&nbsp;McKinney -- have asked Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski to throw&nbsp;out the case, bar the death penalty, or remove the entirety of the&nbsp;Allegheny County District Attorney's office from the prosecution,&nbsp;based on what they call "flagrant misconduct."</p>
<p>The 26-page motion was filed in response to a slew of what the defense&nbsp;calls discovery violations with regard to the testimony of Witness No.&nbsp;3.</p>
<p>Discovery is evidence obtained by the prosecution that must be&nbsp;provided to the defense prior to trial. The defense filing said that&nbsp;the attorneys were still receiving information throughout this past&nbsp;week.</p>
<p>"The significance of the concealed evidence coupled with the capital&nbsp;nature of this prosecution aggravates the nature of the commonwealth's&nbsp;flagrant misconduct," the defense wrote.</p>
<p>Defense attorneys only learned last week that the man identified as&nbsp;Witness No. 3 had been made promises by law enforcement based on his&nbsp;cooperation. That information only came out, Mr. White said, when he&nbsp;came across a video-recorded interview of the witness in discovery for&nbsp;an unrelated case.</p>
<p>At a hearing on Jan. 24, ATF Agent Neil Carman revealed that the&nbsp;witness had been provided benefits by the Allegheny County police,&nbsp;which had never been disclosed to the defense, which they could then&nbsp;use to assail his credibility.</p>
<p>At that point, it was revealed that the witness was potentially&nbsp;cooperating in as many as eight cases.</p>
<p>However, following a hearing on Tuesday, that number went up to 13,&nbsp;and according to Thursday's motion, could be as high as 21.</p>
<p>In addition, the newly received discovery shows Witness No. 3&nbsp;confessing to police his involvement in the 2013 shooting death of the&nbsp;toddler, Marcus L. White Jr.</p>
<p>No charges have ever been filed against Witness No. 3 in that case.</p>
<p>"[T]he prosecution's intolerable handling of discovery in this case is&nbsp;made more grievous by the fact that law enforcement made financial and&nbsp;apparently other types of promises with a man involved in killing a&nbsp;mere infant," the defense attorneys wrote. "The commonwealth has so&nbsp;little regard for that tragic murder that it is willing to afford&nbsp;leniency in that case in order to obtain testimony in this case.</p>
<p>"So the commonwealth's misconduct is two-fold, putting on kid gloves&nbsp;in an investigation of a murder of a child, while at the same time,&nbsp;concealing critical evidence in the case at bar, necessary to flesh&nbsp;out the credibility and veracity of a key witness for the&nbsp;prosecution."</p>
<p>According to the motion, the initial video provided to the defense of&nbsp;Witness No. 3 confessing to the Marcus White homicide, was incomplete.&nbsp;"Conveniently for the commonwealth, the portion of the video where W3&nbsp;confesses is silent," they wrote. "It wasn't until defense counsel&nbsp;requested a court order for the commonwealth to provide the full video&nbsp;was it confirmed that a full confession was provided.</p>
<p>"What other material regarding this witness -- or any other witness --&nbsp;are they hiding?"</p>
<p>The defense wrote in the motion that there is little direct evidence&nbsp;of either Shelton's or Thomas' involvement in the Wilkinsburg&nbsp;shooting, and that two jailhouse informants -- who the prosecution&nbsp;said months ago they would not use -- were "the basis for their&nbsp;arrest."</p>
<p>"If this case involved eyewitnesses, or a confession, or other type of&nbsp;inculpatory statement, or incriminating physical evidence -- then the&nbsp;significance of W3 would be less," they wrote. "But in the absence of&nbsp;such evidence, this witness simply takes on a more critical role in&nbsp;the prosecutor's case, making the non-disclosure of impeachment&nbsp;evidence that much more problematic."</p>
<p>In the motion, the defense attorneys ask for a series of remedies,&nbsp;from outright dismissal of the charges, to barring the death penalty,&nbsp;to removing one of the prosecutors on the case, to removing the&nbsp;entirety of the Allegheny County DA's office for "profound&nbsp;misconduct," to postponement.</p>
<p>The defense filing alleges that Assistant District Attorney Lisa&nbsp;Pellegrini will be a witness called by them in the case "given the&nbsp;fact that she engaged in secret, undisclosed meetings and serious&nbsp;Brady violations that apply to the capital phase and also with W3 that&nbsp;were not disclosed to the defense."</p>
<p>The defense cited a recent opinion by the state Superior Court, which&nbsp;they said found a Brady violation -- exculpatory evidence being&nbsp;withheld by the prosecution -- involving the case of homicide&nbsp;defendant Freedom Bey by Ms. Pellegrini, alleging a continuing course&nbsp;of conduct.</p>
<p>The alleged misconduct, the defense wrote, included denying knowledge&nbsp;of existing security videos; failing to preserve such video and&nbsp;failing to preserve a knife in the victim's pocket.</p>
<p>"These serious allegations show that attorney Pellegrini has engaged&nbsp;in a pattern of behavior in murder trial[s] involving making false&nbsp;statements to the court and jury and mishandling evidence," they&nbsp;wrote. "The ADA's apparent practice of utilizing guileful techniques&nbsp;in an effort to secure a homicide conviction should not and cannot be&nbsp;tolerated."</p>
<p>Although dismissal is a harsh remedy, the attorneys wrote, it is&nbsp;required given the alleged misconduct.</p>
<p>"The prosecution's conduct in failing to exercise the minimal level of&nbsp;due diligence necessary to insure that its obligations were carried&nbsp;out, was so egregious; dismissal is the only appropriate remedy."</p>
<p>If other relief is denied, the defense attorneys wrote, then they&nbsp;should at least be granted a postponement.</p>
<p>"The commonwealth is seeking to execute the defendants; while a delay&nbsp;may be an inconvenience to all, to not try the case properly would&nbsp;certainly be more than an inconvenience to the defendants," they&nbsp;wrote.</p>
<p>A hearing on various matters in the case is scheduled for late Friday morning.</p>
