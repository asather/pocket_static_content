<h1>Despite Trump's positive test, COVID-19 deniers persist</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even as the president and the first lady announced they had tested positive for COVID-19, some of Pennsylvania’s most vocal skeptics of the virus continued to deny it posed a substantial risk.</p>
<p>Kimberly Waigand, owner of the Crack’d Egg restaurant, said she continues to believe the virus is not as deadly as experts say and face coverings are not effective.</p>
<p>“We’re not living in fear,” she said Friday morning.&nbsp;“We have faith in God and we’re not living in fear. We have our immune systems.”</p>
<p>Ms. Waigand’s restaurant&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/09/24/Brentwood-restaurant-sues-Allegheny-County-health-department-COVID-19-lawsuit-Crack-d-Egg/stories/202009240122" target="_blank">sued the Allegheny County Health Department</a> last week after the eatery was shut down for ignoring COVID-19 face-covering rules. She believes the mask mandate is&nbsp;“fear mongering” and&nbsp;“an agenda,” however she did not specify what the agenda is.</p>
<p>She also stated that she has not gotten a flu shot in several years, and instead takes supplements and practices diligent hand washing, even though she had a friend who died from the flu at age 43.</p>
<p>Asked why she doesn’t get her shot, she stated:&nbsp;“Because I don’t want it. I got it one time and I ended up getting sick.” The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states this is one of the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/flu/prevent/misconceptions.htm" target="_blank">misconceptions </a>about the seasonal flu; sometimes people become infected prior to vaccination or contracted a virus with similar symptoms to the flu. Research also shows vaccination reduces severity of illness in people with the flu.</p>
<p>Ms. Waigand said she had heard these things before. “I have a choice and I have free will,” she said.&nbsp;“We live in America.”</p>
<p>The Crack’d Egg has been supported by members of “E.A.T,” which stands for Entrepreneurs Against Tyranny, an anti-masking group with over 5,000 likes on Facebook. Matthew Foltz and Christine Wartluft, both members of E.A.T, said they feel the same as Ms. Waigand.</p>
<p>“The president got the flu,” Ms. Wartluft, the owner of Taste of Sicily in Lebanon County, said. “We know that this whole COVID thing is totally blown up.”</p>
<p>Neither of them had any new concerns following President Donald Trump’s positive test, and stated they were still going to focus on their mission of ending COVID-19 restrictions in Pennsylvania and opening businesses to 100% capacity.</p>
<p>“All our family and friends are pulling for our president,” Mr. Foltz said, adding he was praying for a quick recovery. Mr. Foltz, Ms. Wartluft and Ms. Waigand all said they are supporters of Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>Taste of Sicily is currently facing $10,000 in fines for ignoring COVID-19 mitigation protocols.</p>
<p>Ms. Wartluft and Mr. Foltz both repeated the claims that COVID-19 is essentially as bad as the flu, even as the virus has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/28/world/covid-1-million-deaths.html" target="_blank">killed more people</a>&nbsp;this year than malaria, influenza, cholera and measles combined. They also cited conspiracy theories that Gov. Tom Wolf attended a wedding in Hawaii for his daughter amid the pandemic.</p>
<p>The governor’s office confirmed that his daughters have been married for years and he has never been to Hawaii.</p>
<p>The two also suggested Pennsylvania has one of the lowest COVID-19 case counts in the country (it currently has the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/coronavirus-u-s-map-where-virus-has-been-confirmed-across-n1124546" target="_blank">12th highest</a>) and said the governor of South Dakota has done well mitigating the virus with minimal restrictions.</p>
<p>South Dakota, despite having a relatively low total case count of 23,136, now has the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html#states" target="_blank">second-largest</a>&nbsp;case count per 100,000 people and on Friday reported its highest death toll yet of 13 people, making the statewide total 236 deaths.</p>
<p>Mr. Foltz also stated that the CDC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2020/sep/10/facebook-posts/no-cdc-hasnt-stopped-calling-covid-19-pandemic/" target="_blank">stopped calling</a>&nbsp;COVID-19 a pandemic, another theory that has been proven to be false. His podcast, Subtle Beast, also&nbsp;focuses extensively on conspiracy theories.</p>
<p>“People just continue to live in fear, and the media has done a very fine job instilling fear,” Ms. Wartluft said. She also believes wearing masks is about&nbsp;“politics and control.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The E.A.T group still plans to have a rally Saturday on the steps of the Pennsylvania Capitol, Mr. Foltz said.</p>
<p>The Crack’d Egg was initially sued by Allegheny County for violating COVID-19 safety measures. However, the restaurant then sued the the county on alleged civil rights violations and removed the initial case from state court.</p>
<p>Both cases are now in the&nbsp;U.S District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania.</p>
