<p>Giant Eagle has announced it is implementing one-way aisles in its supermarkets and GetGo stores, beginning Monday, due to the COVID-19 epidemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One-way directional signage will be added on the floor in each aisle "to indicate the flow of traffic and help guests maintain social distance," the supermarket chain said.</p>

<p>The company also provided personal protective equipment – masks and gloves – to all of its employees.</p>
<p>The company operates more than 400 retail locations, ranging in size from 120,000 square-foot supermarkets to small neighborhood markets and fuel and convenience locations.</p>
