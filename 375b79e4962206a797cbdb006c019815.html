<h1>Ron Cook: Ben Roethlisberger throws a reason for hope to Steelers fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I had been waiting for the news since March 19 when I spoke at length to Ben Roethlisberger. He told me that day that he vowed to his wife in September — on his way to his elbow surgery to re-attach three flexor tendons — that he wasn’t going to trim his beard or cut his hair until he could throw an NFL-caliber pass. He knew he looked hideous at the time. Google the video of his public-service announcement a few days later about COVID-19. It will shock you how unkempt he was. He, too, must have been wondering what was living in that Keisel-like beard.</p>
<p>“She’s ready for it to come off,” Roethlisberger said of his wife, Ashley. Of course, Mrs. Ben is easily the most-thrilled about the new-look Ben, now with beard trimmed and hair cut.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>A lot of Steelers fans are right there with her.</p>
<p>The 38-second video the Steelers released Monday was the highlight of our sports spring. It started by showing Roethlisberger’s pledge to his wife on a jet on his way to California for his surgery. It ended with him in a stylist’s chair getting cleaned up. In between, there was footage of him throwing passes to teammates JuJu Smith-Schuster, James Conner and Ryan Switzer.</p>
<p>Not just throwing passes.</p>
<p>Zipping passes.</p>
<p>NFL-caliber passes.</p>
<p>“Feels good to be back with my guys!” Roethlisberger tweeted with the video.</p>
<p>“He’s baaaack!” a grinning Smith-Schuster said as the video ended. “Stay tuned.”</p>
<p>Of course, we’ll stay tuned.</p>
<p>I mean, really, what else is there to do right now?</p>
<p>There might not be an NFL season because of the coronavirus. All of us know that. But that doesn’t mean this brief video didn’t provide a palpable sense of optimism about the Steelers. If you can’t wait for the Sept. 14 opener on “Monday Night Football” against the New York Giants, you are not alone.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger had told me his rehab was going exceptionally well. “I have no doubts I’m going to be able to come back and play well — none. I’m throwing without pain for the first time in years. That’s a nice feeling. I know I’m not getting any younger, but I feel younger because I don’t have any pain.” But to actually see Roethlisberger gunning those passes? How do you not feel better about the Steelers’ chances?</p>
<p>I had examined the schedule closely when it came out and predicted the team would go 10-6, finish second in the AFC North behind the Baltimore Ravens and make the playoffs as a wild card. But now? Maybe an adjustment to that prediction is in order.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger’s teammates — current and former — reacted predictably on social media. Among them were Cam Heyward, Eric Ebron, Mike Hilton, T.J. Watt, Ramon Foster and Trai Essex. They were just as thrilled as Mrs. Ben to see the respectable-looking Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>Talk about a sports pick-me-up at a time all of us needed one.</p>
<p>“All the hard work and sacrifices are about to come to fruition,” Switzer tweeted.</p>
<p>Reached by email Monday afternoon, Roethlisberger said he did the video “just to let fans know how I was doing.” He declined further comment.</p>
<p>That was OK.</p>
<p>Nothing else needed to be said.</p>
<p>Thirty-eight seconds of footage said everything.</p>
