<h1>Volkswagen apologizes for racist ad showing black man being dragged away from new car</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Volkswagen pulled and apologized Thursday for a racist advertisement posted on its Instagram page that a company official called “an insult to every decent person.”</p>
<p>The 10-second clip depicted a pair of oversize white hands dragging a black man away from a new VW Golf 8 sedan, and flicking him violently into a restaurant called “Petit Colon,” a name with overtones of colonization.</p>
<p>Briefly as a spokeswoman reads the phrase “Der Neue Golf,” or “the new Golf,” as it appears on the screen, the letters materialize in an order that briefly spells the German n-word.</p>
<p>The company, which also produces the brands Audi, Skoda, Seat and Porsche, removed the video, but it was reposted by critics on social media.</p>
<p>Volkswagen board member Juergen Stackmann and the company’s head of diversity management, Elke Heitmueller, said in a joint statement that they were “horrified” by the ad, and that the company was “aware” of its “historical origins.”</p>
<p>Volkswagen was founded by the Nazi government in the 1930s to build the “people’s car,” and used slave labor from concentration camps in its manufacturing processes.</p>
<p>“That is precisely why we resolutely oppose all forms of hatred, slander/propaganda and discrimination,” the statement said.</p>
<p>“I sincerely apologize as an individual in my capacity as a board member at Volkswagen Sales &amp; Marketing,” Stackmann added in a tweet. “Hatred, racism and discrimination have no place at Volkswagen! In this case, I will personally ensure full transparency and consequences!”</p>
<p>The company, which is the world’s largest automaker, is still reeling from its 2016 emissions scandal. Volkswagen programmed “defeat devices” into two-liter diesel engines that were programmed to turn off emissions measurement data outside of laboratory settings. Those engines spewed 40 times the legal limit of harmful nitrogen oxides.</p>
<p>Settling the issue required a major consumer buyback program that put the company on the back foot and cut its stock price in half. Volkswagen still has not regained the lost share value.</p>
<p>News of the advertisement imbroglio did not affect its stock, which traded up modestly higher to close at $15.50.</p>
<p>But Volkswagen’s public image has not stayed out of the spotlight since. Audi in 2017 ran a commercial in China comparing women to used cars. Last year, Chief Executive Herbert Diess mimicked a Nazi slogan when discussing a metric of the company’s finances. The company apologized for both incidents.</p>
<p>Stackmann and Heitmueller said they “cannot explain” how this latest ad was released. They said the company would investigate and make public the “results and consequences.”</p>
