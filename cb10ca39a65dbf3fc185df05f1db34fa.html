<h1>Key questions to ask before PNC Park can become the Great White North Shore</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh could very well house two professional baseball teams this summer. The talks with Major League Baseball, the Pirates and the Blue Jays continue to progress, and a decision on whether Toronto will play some home games in Pittsburgh this season will likely come by Thursday, if not earlier.</p>
<p>This is not a small undertaking by any stretch. While the Pirates’ schedule will not be impacted, there’s a lengthy list of logistical concerns, all of which officials from all sides are sorting through at this very moment.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here are some fair questions to ask at this point, plus as much information as we’re able to share on them:</p>
<p><strong>• What must everyone figure out?</strong></p>
<p>A ton, honestly. The topics of conversation right now are seemingly endless, involving every part of team operations.</p>
<p>Where would the Blue Jays live? Where would they dress and shower? Where would they enter and exit the building?</p>
<p>Keep in mind, this would have to be two-fold, as they would theoretically be playing games at PNC Park, and another team would be present.</p>
<p>It will also be necessary that nothing disrupts the Pirates’ setup — their clubhouse, training facilities and where they work out, both for fairness and safety.</p>
<p><strong>• What about non-baseball stuff?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that as well. They must figure out who staffs the games and how/what those people are paid. What about such things as ball boys or other game operations workers?</p>
<p>The Blue Jays would likely want to broadcast their games, but it would make sense to avoid sharing space with their Pittsburgh counterparts.</p>
<p>There are corporate sponsors who were expecting signs at Rogers Centre to show up on TV. Those must be brought here and replicated, or the contracts will have to be adjusted.</p>
<p>It also stands to reason that there will be some type of scoreboard presentation, for which the Blue Jays employ their own people. Do they come to Pittsburgh, or do the Pirates handle that stuff?</p>
<p>At the root of all of this, of course, is COVID-19 and the idea that neither team — along with MLB — wants to jeopardize anyone’s safety.</p>
<p><strong>• How soon would this come together?</strong></p>
<p>Again, likely in the next 24-48 hours. There’s some wiggle room because the Blue Jays start the season on the road, but there’s a desire from both sides — in large part out of necessity — to figure this out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>There’s also a pretty good sense of optimism that this plan will work out.</p>
<p>Will this require the Pirates to adjust anything?</p>
<p>Simply put, no. Their schedule, in all likelihood, will stay the same, although the Blue Jays could adjust a couple dates.</p>
<p>The idea seems to have minimal impact on the Pirates, especially when it comes to their actual schedule of games.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;<strong>How did this come together?</strong></p>
<p>A couple ways. General manager Ben Cherington and manager Derek Shelton having spent time with the Blue Jays organization certainly didn’t hurt, but owner Bob Nutting has actually been a bigger driving force.</p>
<p>There’s no financial benefit whatsoever for Nutting, although he, new president Travis Williams and plenty of others have been nothing but eager to commit the energy and effort of the organization to help — provided, again, they can do it safely.</p>
<p>The logistics of this have involved plenty of important people — from Nutting to Blue Jays president &amp; CEO Mark Shapiro to MLB commissioner Rob Manfred — and there has not been a negative sound from any of them.</p>
<p>Toronto wants to play in an MLB park. Pittsburgh wants to help. The commissioner wants teams to play baseball safety and in as hospitable an environment as possible.</p>
<p>That means, although this task has and will not be easy — the Pirates thought doing this once would be hard enough; now they’re basically doubling up on tasks — it does seem like, barring some sort of sizable snag, the Blue Jays could be based out of Pittsburgh this summer for two-plus months.</p>
