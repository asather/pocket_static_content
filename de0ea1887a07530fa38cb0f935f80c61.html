<p>South Side-based teen clothing retailer American Eagle Outfitters announced Tuesday that it will close all of its more than 1,000 stores in the U.S. and Canada, in response to the growing effort to combat the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The company said the closures would go into effect at the end of day Tuesday.</p>
<p>“The safety and well-being of our associates, customers, and partners around the world remain our priority. I recognize the days ahead will be challenging, but we remain true to the very heart of our purpose — optimism,” said Jay Schottenstein, executive chairman of the board and CEO, in the official statement.</p>
<p>American Eagle also noted that it&nbsp;is withdrawing its projections for first quarter results, which were issued on March 4, saying the company expects the store closures and the impact of COVID-19 to have a “material adverse” impact on financial results.</p>
<p>The move to close stores follows similar actions by other retailers and orders from several governors, including Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf, that nonessential businesses close to help stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>The retailer said the store closures will be effective until at least March 27 and all store employees&nbsp;will be compensated for scheduled time during that period.</p>
<p>Online shopping will continue.&nbsp;“We will continue to serve our customers with an exceptional experience through our strong digital channel,” Mr. Schottenstein said.</p>
<p>American Eagle, which has its headquarters at the SouthSide Works, said it is also implementing&nbsp;working from home; staggered work schedules for in-office requirements to facilitate social distancing; and enhanced sanitization and deep cleaning of operated facilities.</p>
<p>Through its foundation, the company has set up a relief fund to offer additional help to workers affected by the novel coronavirus, the statement said.</p>
