<h1>South Side prepares for St. Patrick's Day crowd</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s City Councilman Bruce Kraus is asking St. Patrick’s Day revelers to leave their cars at home on March 14.</p>
<p>With about 20,000 people expected on the South Side that Saturday and well into Sunday morning, Mr. Kraus, who represents the neighborhood, is asking people to use alternative transportation.</p>
<p>The South Side will beef up transportation options on March 14, taking similar steps as last year’s St. Patrick’s Day weekend, which Mr. Kraus said went smoothly.</p>
<p>Two shuttles — the Nite Rider recognizable by its black and pink pattern, the other by its green shamrocks — will carry passengers free of charge to and from the South Side. The Nite Rider shuttle will run from 5 a.m. Saturday to 5 a.m. Sunday. The second will be added for reinforcement during the busiest hours, from 2 p.m. until 3 a.m., said Juan Hernandez, general manager at the Pittsburgh Transportation Group.</p>
<p>Authorities suggest revelers take the T to the First Avenue Station, Downtown, and use the shuttle from there to get to East Carson Street.</p>
<p>Should you choose to drive, parking will be available at the Second Avenue parking plaza, which holds about 800 cars at Second Avenue and the 10th Street Bridge. Party-goers can leave their cars in the lot until about noon Sunday, said Allison Harnden, nighttime economy manager at the Pittsburgh Department of Safety.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus, who discussed the preparations Thursday at the City-County Building, added that the majority of other parking spaces on the South Side have residential parking permits, which will still be enforced.</p>
<p>In addition to stops at First and Second avenues, the shuttles also will stop at Bedford Square on 12th Street in the South Side; South 18th Street at Sidney Street; and South 21st Street at East Carson.</p>
<p>Passengers can track the shuttle in real time at <a href="http://www.ssniterider.com/" target="_blank">ssniterider.com</a>.</p>
<p>Two-car trains will be in service to double the normal capacity of the T, said Port Authority spokesman Adam Brandolph. Additionally, extra buses will run on the P1 line, which stops throughout Downtown.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph cautions passengers to check bus and T schedules, however, as buses stop running around midnight and the light rail service stops running around 1:30 a.m.</p>
<p>Uber, Lyft and ZTrip cabs are another way to avoid getting behind the wheel, said representatives from all three companies. Uber will offer promotional code PGHParade2020 for first-time riders and ZTrip users can use code ZLuck.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus said the city will install about 40 portable disability-accessible toilets for the event in surface parking lots throughout the South Side. The bathrooms, he said, will be installed at 5 a.m. Saturday and removed at 5 a.m. Sunday.</p>
<p>The toilets will cost about $4,000, which will come from money collected in parking meters rather than taxpayer dollars.The shuttles are funded through a Highmark Foundation grant.</p>
<p>Mr. Kraus said the city will make sure everything is cleaned up by Sunday morning. The Clean Team will collect cups, cans, bottles and other waste along East Carson and side streets on Saturday night and Sunday, said Tracy Brindle, operations manager with the Clean and Safe Program.</p>
<p>“The last two years, we have received nothing but compliments. At 6 in the morning when people were heading out for a morning coffee, they would never have known that the St. Patrick’s Day celebration took place,” said Mr. Kraus.</p>
