<h1>East Liberty Valley Historical Society presents four speakers </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The literature written by Willa Cather and Pittsburgh native Malcolm Cowley, the reason industrialists built so many greenhouses during the late 1800s, and the story of a large but but short-lived municipality called Liberty Township are the topics of four free lectures presented on the first Friday of March, April, May and June by the East Liberty Valley Historical Society.</p>
<p>All lectures are free and start at 7 p.m. in the chapel of East Liberty Presbyterian Church, 116 S. Highland Ave., 15206.</p>
<p>Cather, who grew up in Nebraska, arrived in Pittsburgh in 1896. She was a drama critic and editor for The Pittsburgh Leader. Her famous novel,&nbsp;“My Antonia,” appeared in 1918, a dozen years after she left Pittsburgh in 1906 to be an editor at McClure’s Magazine, which published excellent investigative journalism.</p>
<p>“My Antonia” has many connections to Cather’s Pittsburgh years. James Jaap, a teaching professor of English at Penn State Greater Allegheny, will also discuss the relationship between Cather and Pittsburgh residents Alfred McClung and his wife, Mary Mellon McClung on Friday, March 6 &nbsp;at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Tom Powers and Jim Wudarczyk unfold the story of a large, short-lived Allegheny County municipality called Liberty Township, which was incorporated in December 1864. The city annexed Liberty Township in 1868. Prominent residents included industrialist Andrew Carnegie, U.S. Senator William Wilkins, William Frew of Standard Oil, and Robert Pitcairn, the Pennsylvania Railroad executive.&nbsp;Liberty Township included part or all of Bloomfield, Friendship, East Liberty, Point Breeze, Regent Square, Shadyside and Squirrel Hill.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Powers is president of the Lawrenceville Historical Society, and Mr. Wudarczyk serves on the society’s board. With his brother, Jude, Mr. Wudarczyk is the author of&nbsp;“Faith of Our Fathers: Religion in Lawrenceville,” published in December 2019. Mr. Powers and Mr. Wudarczyk speak on Friday, April 3.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sue Morris, a docent at The Frick Pittsburgh, has led tours of Clayton, the Frick family home in Point Breeze, since 2016. Her fascination with the family’s large greenhouse, which still stands, led her to learn more. She will outline the role Henry Phipps played in the City Beautiful movement. Other Pittsburgh residents, including A.W. Mellon, J.J. Vandergrift, H.J. Heinz and George Westinghouse all built conservatories on their estates. Since 2012, Ms. Morris has written a blog, The Historical Dilettante. She speaks on Friday, May 1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Malcolm Cowley and his boyhood friend, Kenneth Burke, read regularly at the Carnegie Library in Oakland, were top scholars at Peabody High School and became leading literary figures.</p>
<p>Burke was an influential literary theorist, poet, essayist and novelist. One of his students was the prolific author, Susan Sontag.</p>
<p>Cowley became an influential editor in American publishing and observer of the&nbsp;“Lost Generation” in 1920s Paris. Cowley is credited with rescuing William Faulkner’s work from obscurity. Bob Hoover, retired Post-Gazette book editor, will chronicle Cowley’s life and times, on Friday, June 5.&nbsp;</p>
