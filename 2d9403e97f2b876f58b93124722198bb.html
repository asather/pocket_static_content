<h1>Ruth Ann Dailey: Mayor Peduto has work to do </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It is a measure of how terrified our elected officials are of “progressive” Democrats that they would fall all over themselves to condemn the Pittsburgh police for last weekend’s arrest of a protester.</p>
<p>Either that, or they’re down with the revolution.</p>
<p>I use quote marks because the “progressive” agenda promises anything but progress. People whose thought leaders include such giants as Karl Marx, Woodrow Wilson and Margaret Sanger have no moral standing to decide which statues rise or fall. Or which mayor stays or goes.</p>
<p>But local protesters have called for Mayor Bill Peduto’s resignation following the arrest of one of theirs, 25-year-old Matthew Cartier, by plainclothes officers in an unmarked van.</p>
<p>Some called it an “abduction,” including Mr. Cartier’s attorney, Lisa Middleman, who lost the race for district attorney last fall.</p>
<p>Even the executive director of the city’s independent Citizen Police Review Board said “low-visibility” arrests are a “sneaky” tactic, “not to be used in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>This is patently false. Search the internet for “plainclothes police Pittsburgh arrest” and you’ll find numerous articles on such arrests through recent years.</p>
<p>A quick scan indicates the tactic is used largely in undercover drug operations. Apparently there are situations the police judge to be dangerous or volatile enough that keeping a low profile is the wiser course of action. It’s not hard to imagine how they arrived at that conclusion in the current uproar.</p>
<p>And in this prolonged uproar, police can take grim comfort in the near certainty that no matter how they went about it, they were going to be savaged by both the protesters and pandering politicos.</p>
<p>If they’d made an open arrest, with uniforms, helmets and holstered weapons, the marchers would have denounced them as fascists.</p>
<p>If they’d declined to intercede, allowing Mr. Cartier to (allegedly) continue behaving dangerously in traffic, to get hurt or cause injury to others, they would have been denounced.</p>
<p>All that said, the best way for police to interact with protesters is very, very openly. It’s healthier in the long run, for the officers and for us citizens who rely on their presence and effectiveness.</p>
<p>These days they provide an important buffer between groups with conflicting agendas. They are right to insist on appropriate permits, on knowing marchers’ routes, on enforcing public safety laws — for the well-being of all.</p>
<p>Some of the city’s 150 or so committed demonstrators don’t see it that way — the ones who’ve been occupying Mr. Peduto’s neighborhood, city streets and public parks late into the summer nights.</p>
<p>“You are not supposed to comply with your oppressor,” one leader proclaimed.</p>
<p>Oppressors? That is a vanishingly small opinion, and our elected officials urgently need to be reminded so.</p>
<p>Most of us value the critical role of police in maintaining civilized society. A Gallup poll released in early August showed that 86 percent of all Americans — 81% of Blacks — want the police to spend as much time, or more time, in their neighborhoods as the police currently do. More Blacks and Hispanics want more police presence (20% and 24%, respectively) than want less (19% and 17%).</p>
<p>In the same survey, however, Black Americans reported markedly less confidence they’d experience “courtesy and respect” in interactions with police. It will take years of tireless work by honorable cops to overcome the destruction wrought by their dishonorable and even violent colleagues.</p>
<p>More honesty and honor are needed all the way around, though. Leaders who call an arrest an “abduction” should be embarrassed for shoveling their propaganda on the taxpaying, law-abiding public.</p>
<p>A protest that is nonviolent is not necessarily “peaceful,” either, so let’s weigh that term carefully before using it. People who block traffic, blast sirens and chant obscenities into the night in a residential neighborhood are not peaceful people.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto, a gentle and conscientious man, hosted them on his porch Wednesday night. They left unsatisfied. He was generous to give them an hour and wise to let them go. He should stay — and mend fences with the police.</p>
