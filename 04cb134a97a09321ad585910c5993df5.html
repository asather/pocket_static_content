<h1>Bringing medical students to the country, a congressman hopes to solve rural physician shortage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Last year, Fulton County Medical Center saw the retirement of a family medicine doctor with 50 years of treating patients in&nbsp;a large rural region in south-central Pennsylvania — a “big void”&nbsp;health officials said they were still trying to fill.</p>
<p>This month could mark the start of a solution: a program that will bring nine medical students who will, over the next year, cycle through the medical center’s various departments, live in housing on the hospital’s campus and absorb all the intricacies and rewards of serving the Pennsylvania countryside.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the end, hospital officials hope, they will see the benefits of a career in Fulton County.</p>
<p>“There’s a whole other side of medicine other than working in large cities,” said Cornelius Strait, chief nursing officer for the medical center.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping this creates an opportunity for these students to come work at these facilities, with the close interaction with patients and other physicians, and then want to stay after they’re completed with school,” he said.</p>
<p>Illuminating that “other side” of health care is the central tenet of the workforce program, called the Homegrown Healthcare Initiative. It was the brainchild of Rep. John Joyce, R-Blair, who was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/insight/2020/05/17/John-Joyce-first-term-lawmaker-doctor-COVID-19-pandemic-Shuster-Altoona/stories/202005070021?cid=search" target="_blank">elected to Congress in 2018</a> after a quarter-century as a dermatologist in Altoona.</p>
<p>Dr. Joyce ran for office on an agenda focused on helping health care providers in Pennsylvania’s 13th District, a rugged 10-country region that sprawls along Pennsylvania’s southern tier. In an interview last week, Dr. Joyce recalled that, during a campaign meeting with a hospital board, someone handed him a job application.</p>
<p>It was a joking gesture, but it drove home a critical point for him. There was a disconnect — though separated by just a few hours’ drive — between Pennsylvania’s great supply of medical students and the places that needed them most.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvania has great medical schools, and quite a few of them,” Dr. Joyce said. “Yet in Pennsylvania-13, we have a true physician shortage, particularly in primary care.”</p>
<p>Shortly after taking office, he said, he sat down with his staff to map out an initiative.&nbsp;He enlisted the Lake Erie College of Osteopathic Medicine to&nbsp;encourage its students to do their clinical rotations, which occur in the third and fourth years of school, at three medical facilities in his district.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to the Fulton County hospital, the initiative will send students to the Conemaugh Memorial Medical Center in Johnstown and the VanZandt VA Medical Center in Altoona.</p>
<p><strong>Back to Altoona</strong></p>
<p>It’s a career path that Dr. Joyce has personally followed.</p>
<p>A native of Altoona, Dr. Joyce was a work-study student at Pennsylvania State University when he moved to Baltimore to study at Johns Hopkins University.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I made the decision to return to the area I grew up and work at the hospital ... and treat people I grew up with,” he said.</p>
<p>“Returning to their roots will allow them to practice cutting-edge&nbsp;medicine and work with individuals that they will have a strong impact for,” he said, but added, “it will take the right individual.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Michael P. Rowane, the associate dean of clinical education for LECOM, said rural health care is an area of rising focus for schools that assign their students to residencies for the second half of their curriculum.</p>
<p>“If you have someone who their early clinical exposure is in some community, it shapes them, it changes things,” Dr. Rowane, who previously worked on rural initiatives at University Hospitals in Cleveland. “In these areas, you’re one-to-one with the people. You’re hands-on. It’s a completely different learning environment.”</p>
<p>Sigrid Andrew, director of the Altoona VA, said opportunities in rural medicine extend far beyond what most people think. For example, students will get a hands-on experience working with the VA’s tele-health program, including the country’s first remote cancer care and chemotherapy treatment clinic.</p>
<p>“The oncologist is in Pittsburgh, but the hands-on care is provided here in Altoona,” Ms. Andrew said.&nbsp;“It is the future of medicine, and it is the way our nation is going.”</p>
<p>Ms. Andrew — who grew up in rural Maryland and worked in Baltimore before moving to Altoona in 2017 — said you see a small part of the technology in an urban area.&nbsp;“When you are in the rural part, at the end where the veteran is, you get to see all the different pieces.”</p>
<p><strong>Bigger issues</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Joyce acknowledged the homegrown initiative is just one part of the puzzle. In health care, there are much larger forces at play, including the fact that medical students often graduate with hundreds of thousands of dollars of student debt, which can be difficult to pay off even on an urban hospital salary.</p>
<p>Rural health providers, which serve a higher proportion of patients enrolled in Medicare and Medicaid, can struggle to pay their bills, let alone fund initiatives and pay salaries that can attract and retain employees.</p>
<p>The Fulton County Medical Center, in McConnellsburg,&nbsp;reported a $1.1 million operating loss in the 2019 fiscal year, well before the financial losses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, according <a href="/%20http:/media.dhweb.com/fcmcpa/fcmc-annual-report-2018-2019.pdf" target="_blank">to hospital documents</a>.&nbsp;Hospital officials blamed low reimbursement rates from the government health care programs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If you compare what we’ve put into paying for care per day and what Medicaid reimburses us, it’s a pretty huge deficit,” said&nbsp;Kim Slee, the chief operating officer, referring to a 67-bed nursing home run by the hospital. “If the federal government could look at those numbers, it would be helpful.”</p>
<p>At a House Small Business Committee hearing last June on medical student debt, Dr. Joyce agreed with a Democratic colleague that the low Medicare reimbursement rate for hospitals is “definitely something that needs to be addressed.” And he urged the passage of a bill that would allow medical students to defer interest until they complete their residency programs.</p>
<p>“I realize that many of them stay in the large metropolitan areas because they can make more money,” Dr. Joyce said during that hearing. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The success of the initiative could hinge on the experiences of the first cohort of students.</p>
<p>Shannon Link, a 24-year-old student from Carrolltown, Cambria County, chose to do her clinical rotation at the Conemaugh hospital in Johnstown. Ms. Link said she will save money by living with her parents.</p>
<p>She acknowledged Johnstown would be an unusual choice among her classmates, who often seek out large cities. But urban hospitals have downsides, too, she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The huge hospitals in Pittsburgh — they’re great and you’re going to learn so much, but you might get lost in the crowd,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After completing the program, Ms. Link plans to serve a residency in the U.S. Army. But she expects to return to Cambria County once again.</p>
<p>“It’s a great idea because that’s what we need to keep the area up-and-coming,” she explained.&nbsp;“With medicine especially, you don’t need a big city to be able to serve your patients. Usually, it’s more rural areas that actually need the help.”</p>
