<h1>As stimulus checks start showing up, what will you do with the money?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Millions of Americans woke up Wednesday to find that the long-awaited stimulus checks being distributed as part of the U.S. pandemic relief package had been deposited into their bank accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Donald Trump signed the unprecedented $2.2 trillion economic rescue package into law nearly three weeks ago that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/03/28/When-how-to-expect-1-200-stimulus-payment/stories/202003280048" target="_blank">included direct payments</a> toward 80 million Americans’ wallets as many of them have filed for unemployment amid the coronavirus shutdown nationwide.</p>
<p>While some residents are still waiting for printed stimulus checks to come by mail (a process that may be delayed after the Treasury Department&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/04/14/stimulus-checks-IRS-coronavirus-Treasury-Trump-name/stories/202004140163" target="_blank">ordered Mr. Trump’s name be printed</a> on them),&nbsp;households who&nbsp;filed their tax returns the last two years and who have allowed the IRS to make direct deposits&nbsp;are seeing the stimulus money in their accounts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To check the status of your payment, use the IRS’ <a href="https://www.irs.gov/coronavirus/get-my-payment" target="_blank">online tool, called Get My Payment</a>, that launched Wednesday on its website. You'll need to enter your Social Security number, date of birth and mailing address in order to track your payment, the Treasury Department said.</p>
<p>Individuals will receive up to $1,200 and couples will receive up to $2,400 -- plus $500 per child under 17. Payments start phasing out for individuals with adjusted gross incomes of more than $75,000 and married couples who earn more than $150,000.</p>
<p>There were some hiccups as people rushed to check their accounts this morning: Some PNC Bank customers were <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/04/15/PNC-bank-addressing-issues-to-online-mobile-banking-access/stories/202004150092" target="_blank">having trouble accessing the website</a>. PNC spokesperson&nbsp;Marcey Zwiebel told the Post-Gazette that the technical issues were a direct result of an&nbsp;“unprecedented volume of customers” using these channels to access their economic impact payments. Ms. Zwiebel said PNC’s tech team was working as quickly as possible to correct the issue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After weeks of anticipation, the funds became a reality for many who reacted on social media Wednesday morning to the relief.</p>
<p>While some said they were putting the money directly into their savings account, others told the Post-Gazette that they plan on making sure their check goes towards others in need during this crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Edison Norford said he plans to use his money to help out family and friends, while another Twitter user said he wants to spend his at a small business that is currently facing financial hardships.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another user said she was going to use her money for political purposes and put it toward former Vice President Joe Biden’s presidential campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One group that won’t receive stimulus benefits, however, is the majority of college students. Congress’ bill stated that parents or guardians will receive $500 per child under the age of 17. That means if the students’ parent or guardian claims them as a dependent but the student is 17 or older, the parent nor the student qualifies for a stimulus check — despite the fact that many students lost employment during the shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Some students took to social media to express their disappointment through memes and GIFs about being left out of the stimulus package.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check out some more ways that social media users are spending their stimulus checks below:</p>
