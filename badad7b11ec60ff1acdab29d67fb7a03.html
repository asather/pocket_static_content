<p>Three Western Pennsylvania teachers were among 12 finalists for the 2021 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year.</p>
<p>Nicole Darroch of Ambridge Area School District (Beaver County); Kathleen Dickensheets of Hampton Township School District (Allegheny County); and Denise Leigh of McGuffey School District (Washington County) were chosen by nominations from students, parents, peers and members of the community wishing to honor and recognize educator achievements both inside and outside the classroom.</p>
<p>“Teachers impact students far beyond the traditional classroom, connecting with them and inspiring them during some of our most difficult times,” said Education Secretary Pedro A. Rivera in a news release. "We witnessed that extraordinary commitment this spring as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, with educators stepping up to make sure students and communities are fed, comforted and educated. The Department of Education applauds this year’s finalists, who represent the commitment and professionalism that so many Pennsylvania educators share.”</p>
<p>The 2021 Pennsylvania Teacher of the Year will be announced in December.</p>
<p>The recognition program is co-sponsored by the Pennsylvania Department of Education and the Pennsylvania chapter of the National State Teacher of the Year, which was founded in 1995.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s 2020 Teacher of the Year recipient is Joseph Welch, a middle school teacher in the North Hills School District in Allegheny County.</p>
