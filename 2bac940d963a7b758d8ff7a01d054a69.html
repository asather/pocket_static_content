<h1>Sidney Crosby, Alex Ovechkin meet for 50th time on Sunday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The stars first aligned on Nov. 22, 2005, when an 18-year-old kid named Sidney Crosby met a 21-year-old Alex Ovechkin.</p>
<p>The NHL was coming out of a lockout season and counting on the two most recent first overall picks to become the new faces of the league. They didn’t disappoint. The Penguins would go on to beat the Capitals, 5-4. Ovechkin assisted on one goal to earn the game’s third star, while Crosby earned the first star with a goal and an assist. A rivalry was born that day.</p>
<p>Much has changed since that meeting almost 15 years ago. Mellon Arena, the building where the game was played, no longer exists. The Capitals and Penguins both significantly changed their uniform colors and logos. Ovechkin’s hair is now graying. And Sid is no longer a kid himself, either.</p>
<p>But even now, when they meet for the 50th time in their careers as seasoned veterans and Stanley Cup champions, they remain two of the game’s elite players and most recognizable personalities.</p>
<p>"It's cordial and respectful,” Crosby said of his relationship with Ovechkin. “We're not best buddies, but at the same time, I think I respect the way he plays and what he's doing. I can relate to the pressure and expectations that come with the position that he was in coming into the league."</p>
<p>What’s remarkable is how well Crosby and Ovechkin lived up to their billing. So many young players are forced to carry the burden of expectation and struggle to handle it. But over the last 15 years, both players have established themselves as two of the best players of their generation – or any generation.</p>
<p>They do it with their own unique flare. Crosby is one of the most complete centers in the game, a willing defender, elite passer and creative offensive innovator. Meanwhile, Ovechkin is one of the best pure goal scorers to play the game. Earlier this season, he passed Mario Lemieux (690 goals) to enter the NHL’s all-time top-10 goal scoring list.</p>
<p>Currently, with 695 goals, Ovechkin ranks eight in league history, just ahead of Steve Yzerman and Mark Messier. It’s not out of the question to envision Ovechkin finishing his career somewhere near the top of the all-time list, possibly even ahead of Wayne Gretzky (894 goals).</p>
<p>“I think Ovechkin is one of the best goal-scorers of his generation,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “He might be one of the best goal-scorers in the history of the league. He’s certainly shown that during his tenure in this league. He’s a real good competitor.”</p>
<p>Time will tell which player earns the top star when the two players meet Sunday in Washington.</p>
<p><strong>Sid adds spark to power play</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins power play was one of the league’s unsolved mysteries through the first half of the season. A group that for years was among the game’s best became strikingly average, as healthy bodies rotated in and out of the lineup.</p>
<p>But over the last handful of games, that’s beginning to change.</p>
<p>The Penguins have scored multiple power play goals in four of the last seven games. Over the same seven-game stretch, they have converted 8-of-22 chances (36.4%). That's more than twice as efficient as the first 44 games when Pittsburgh converted on just 17.9% of opportunities.</p>
<p>One big key: Crosby. He’s been part of six of those seven games and contributed directly to many of the goals.</p>
<p>“Obviously, you’re probably putting the best passer in the league back on our power play,” Kris Letang said. “It just kind of makes ourselves more dangerous. I think we’ve been committed to playing the right way. Shooting the puck and working hard. So we’ve had success.”</p>
<p><strong>Rust shows versatility</strong></p>
<p>With 22 goals, Bryan Rust has already set a new career benchmark. And he's got 31 more games to possibly add to it.</p>
<p>But even as Rust establishes himself as a true top-six, scoring winger, he’s continuing to lean on the qualities that got him the opportunity in the NHL in the first place. Namely, versatility.</p>
<p>With Dominik Kahun still recovering from a concussion, the Penguins flipped their most productive winger from Evgeni Malkin’s right wing to the left wing during Friday night’s win against the Flyers. Sullivan said he thought Rust was one of the “better players” on the ice during the game.</p>
<p>“I utilize him in so many different positions and rules and capacities,” Sullivan said. “Whether it’s on the penalty kill, Or the power play. Or 5-on-3. Playing on the left side. Playing on the right side. Playing in the top six. Playing in the bottom six. He’s done all of the above. There haven’t been too many hats that he hasn’t worn.</p>
<p><strong>Hornqvist visits the dentist</strong></p>
<p>Penguins forward Patric Hornqvist missed Saturday’s practice in order to get a little dental work completed before the team’s road trip.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Kahun missed practice again as he continues to recover from a concussion. Nick Bjugstad, who is working back from core muscle surgery, also missed practice. The Penguins begin a week-long road trip to Washington D.C. and Florida on Sunday. Sullivan didn’t say if either would make the trip when asked on Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Samsonov in goal for Caps</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins and Capitals have a somewhat similar situation in net. Both teams feature a Stanley Cup-winning goalie – and a newcomer who is pushing for playing time of his own.</p>
<p>While Sullivan declined to name his starter for Sunday’s game, the Capitals plan to go with their rookie, Iiya Samsonov. The 22-year-old hasn’t lost a game since Nov. 15 and is coming off of a 5-3 victory against the Senators on Friday. He’s currently 16-2-1 with a .925 save percentage in 20 games.</p>
