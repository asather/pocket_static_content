<h1>Utica and Marcellus Shale condensate prices plunge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Prices for Marcellus and Utica shale condensate fell below zero this week as collapsing demand for oil and gasoline pushed specialty grades out of the market.</p>
<p>Ergon Oil Purchasing’s price for Marcellus and Utica condensate was a penny per barrel on Monday and Tuesday before dropping to -$0.69 on Wednesday. The price rebounded Thursday to $4.32, but it was still down 91% from the start of the year.</p>
<p>Condensate is an ultra-light liquid hydrocarbon produced along with natural gas from some shale wells. It is not as valuable as oil, but prices for the two commodities tend to rise and fall together.</p>
<p>Between 2012 and 2014 — when oil prices were high and gas prices were low — condensate and natural gas liquids buoyed producers focused on the liquids-rich areas of the Marcellus and Utica shales in Western Pennsylvania and Ohio, said Tony Scott, managing director of analytics at BTU Analytics.</p>
<p>Condensate at $50 a barrel, as it was before the recent collapse, “goes a long way to making those wells economic at the type of gas prices we are seeing today,” he said.</p>
<p>Now, regional natural gas prices are still “very weak” and the condensate premium has evaporated.</p>
<p>Jesse Mercer, senior director of crude oil markets at Enverus, said it “makes sense that Utica condensate is pricing at next to nothing right now.”</p>
<p>The condensate is mostly used in making gasoline. Demand for transportation fuels is down dramatically amid the global economic shutdown associated with COVID-19, as cars and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/03/31/Pittsburgh-International-Airport-American-Airlines-Delta-Republic-grounded-jets/stories/202003300136" target="_blank">airplanes sit parked</a>.</p>
<p>“Refiners are concerned about running out of storage capacity for all the unwanted gasoline, so they are shunning grades that make a lot of gasoline,” he said.</p>
<p>“In this crisis, nobody wants a grade that makes none of the stuff you want and only the stuff you don’t have room to store.”</p>
<p>In December 2019, the most recent month available, Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia produced 150,000 barrels of oil and condensate per day, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.</p>
<p>All oil and condensate produced in the three states is light, but Ergon defines Marcellus and Utica condensate as the lightest in that range.</p>
<p>Nicholas Andreychek, manager of Appalachian crude and condensate for Mississippi-based Ergon Oil Purchasing, said he has never seen condensate prices like this.</p>
<p>His company’s purchase of condensate “is extremely small compared to what’s available in the region.” Marathon Petroleum, Chevron, Shell and EnLink Midstream purchase more, he said.</p>
<p>Condensate pricing is not as transparent as oil benchmarks like West Texas Intermediate, but “Ergon’s pricing tends to be a pretty good indicator of what producers will report as their condensate pricing,” Mr. Scott said.</p>
<p>On Thursday, the credit rating agencies Moody's and Fitch Ratings both downgraded Denver-based Antero Resources, a Marcellus and Utica-focused operator and the nation’s second-largest producer of natural gas liquids.</p>
<p>Fitch said Antero’s “near term metrics have weakened substantially versus our previous expectations” in part because the company has “high exposure to spot [natural gas liquids] pricing” and the liquids “are heavily oversupplied.”</p>
<p>Analysts say it is possible that natural gas-focused producers in Appalachia will benefit as oil producers in Texas begin to cut back. That is because oil wells in Texas are producing a significant amount of associated natural gas. When that supply is diminished, gas prices should rise.</p>
<p>In that case, Appalachian operators may begin to move rigs out of “wet gas” areas into drier gas regions, such as northern Pennsylvania, Mr. Mercer said.</p>
<p>“That could very well happen if condensate completely falls out of favor,” he said.</p>
