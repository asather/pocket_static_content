<h1>‘Women for Trump’ bus tour stop in Cranberry canceled</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Donald Trump's re-election campaign canceled a three-day “Women for Trump” bus tour that was supposed to swing through Cranberry on Wednesday.</p>
<p>The campaign cited “scheduling conflicts” in an email to reporters on Monday.</p>
<p>The announcement was made as news broke that multiple Republican members of Congress were self-quarantining after coming into contact with someone infected with COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, at the recent Conservative Political Action Conference — an event in Maryland also attended by the participants of the now-canceled bus tour.</p>
<p>The Wednesday stop was intended to bring together female supporters of the president and feature appearances from campaign officials Lara Trump, Mercedes Schlapp and Kayleigh McEnany, as well as the duet of Lynnette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson — otherwise known as the Fox Nation commentators Diamond and Silk.</p>
<p>All five women had attended CPAC in the final days of February, but none has indicated they came into contact with the individual who is now hospitalized with COVID-19.</p>
<p>Reps. Paul Gosar, Doug Collins and Matt Gaetz and Sen. Ted Cruz have announced, in the last two days, that they will self-quarantine for 14 days after coming into contact with the individual. All four have said they aren’t experiencing symptoms, but are acting out of caution, according to NBC News.</p>
<p>Matt Schlapp, the chair of the American Conservative Union that organizes the conference, wrote Monday on social media that his family, including his wife Mercedes, and his entire conference staff are “healthy.”</p>
<p>“The State of Maryland did 2000 screenings around the [convention center] and found nothing concerning,” Mr. Schlapp wrote. “We have no symptoms. Stay calm USA! Check your temp, if elevated call your [doctor].”</p>
<p>The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment.</p>
<p>The Cranberry stop has not yet been rescheduled, according to the campaign's event listings. A later stop in York, Pa. — originally scheduled for this Wednesday evening —&nbsp;is now listed as a “Women for Trump” event with Ms. McEnany and second lady Karen Pence on March 18.</p>
