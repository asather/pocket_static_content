<h1>PG Stratford trip: Shakespeare as the main course, with a 'Spamalot' dessert</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This summer, the Post-Gazette offers a unique Critics Choice motor coach tour to&nbsp;Canada’s Stratford Festival, July 21-24.</p>
<p>The trip centers on three varied works by Shakespeare — a sunny comedy, a dark&nbsp;comedy and a witty history play that combines comedy and bloodshed. But the full menu&nbsp;also offers a contemporary comic appetizer and a farce-like musical-comedy dessert,&nbsp;resulting in a five-play package that should appeal to everyone, Shakespearean or not.</p>
<p>The famous Stratford Festival is the largest repertory company in North America,&nbsp;staging 15 shows in four theaters over eight months. We stay at the Arden Park Hotel on the&nbsp;edge of the main festival grounds, a short walk from the iconic Festival Theatre, shaped like&nbsp;a huge circus tent, looking down on the swans along the Avon River. Our plays are:</p>
<p><strong>* “The Sisters Rez,”</strong> a recent Canadian comedy about seven women in competition,&nbsp;described as “ribald, harrowing and mystical.”</p>
<p><strong>* “Much Ado about Nothing,”</strong> Shakespeare’s famous comic sex-duel between Beatrice&nbsp;and Benedict, full of juicy material on the gender wars.</p>
<p><strong>* “Richard III,”</strong> featuring Shakespeare’s most intriguing anti-hero, who outrageously&nbsp;schemes his way to the crown and then battles to retain it.</p>
<p><strong>* “All’s Well That Ends Well,”</strong> a comedy, ending happily, but with dark and&nbsp;ambiguous twists along the way.</p>
<p><strong>* “Spamalot,”</strong> the musical comedy based on Monty Python, a satiric send-up of the&nbsp;legends of King Arthur – sort of a palate cleanser after a main course of Shakespeare.</p>
<p>The city of Stratford is an attraction in itself, with restaurants, shopping, gardens and&nbsp;bike paths. We stop at the border duty-free shops on our return.Included with the motor coach, hotel and plays are a welcoming dinner, picnic lunch,&nbsp;backstage tour and a post-show get-together over drinks, with discussions along the way led&nbsp;by PG senior theater critic Chris Rawson, who spent several decades at Pitt teaching&nbsp;Shakespeare, comedy and satire, preparing him well for the plays we’ll see.</p>
<p>The basic tour price is $1,658, double occupancy; the single supplement is $259. Registration requires a deposit of $500 per person and a completed reservation form. Make&nbsp;checks payable to Avenue Two Travel, and mail to Gulliver’s Travels, 634 Beaver St.,Sewickley PA 15143.</p>
