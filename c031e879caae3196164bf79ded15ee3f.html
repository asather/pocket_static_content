Because goalie Tristan Jarry is scheduled to start the second half of the two games at home vs. the Florida Panthers, the Penguins thought they’d get a little bit creative. They let Jarry stay at home to rest and planned to call up Casey DeSmith from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton to serve as the backup to Matt Murray.</p><p>One problem. You need a passport to get into Canada. In a season full of shuffling, DeSmith misplaced his somewhere.</p><p>“It’s unfortunate,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “It was an honest mistake. Casey’s had a lot going on in his life since last summer. He got married. He moved into a new house. He ends up going to Wilkes-Barre.”</p><p>The Penguins called an audible, recalling Emil Larmi from their ECHL affiliate, the Wheeling Nailers. If nothing else, it’s a nice pay day for Larmi. He makes about $4,000 every day he’s in the NHL and $400 every day he isn’t.</p><p>Meanwhile, for DeSmith, this just adds to what’s surely been a frustrating season.</p><p>The 28-year-old backed up Matt Murray in 2018-19. After Murray struggled in November then went on injured reserve for four weeks, DeSmith helped the Penguins get their season back on the rails. In 36 games, 30 of them starts, he posted a 15-11-5 record with a .916 save percentage and 2.93 goals-against average.</p><p>Last January, the Penguins rewarded DeSmith with a three-year extension paying him $1.25 million per season. But this offseason, the Penguins had some decisions to make in goal. Teams around the league knew that the Penguins would have to either place DeSmith or Jarry on waivers before one could be assigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p><p>Not wanting to lose a good, young goalie and second-round pick in Jarry for nothing, DeSmith went on waivers. He cleared and was re-assigned to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p><p>“We felt that, the lesser risk of [losing] the guy on waivers was Casey,” Penguins general Jim Rutherford told the Post-Gazette in mid-December. “Not that Casey was happy, but we were happy he got through.</p><p>“DeSmith is a very good backup goalie. He had a really good year here last year. He’ll be back in the NHL at some point, whether it’s this year or next year.”</p><p>While the move somewhat caught DeSmith off guard, it’s proved to be the right one for Pittsburgh. Jarry has risen up the leaderboards to become the NHL leader in goals-against average (1.94) and save percentage (.936). Not only has he squashed DeSmith’s chances of reclaiming the backup job, he’s wrestled considerable playing time away from Murray.&nbsp;Saturday’s start will mark Murray’s first of the New Year and just his fourth appearance since November.</p><p>“Obviously, Tristan has played extremely well,” Sullivan said. “That has had an influence on the decisions the coaching staff has made as far as who is starting in goal. We believe in Matt, as well. Matt has played some good games for us. He’s helping us win games also.</p><p>“Right now, the way the coaching staff looks at it is we have two really good goalies that are going to give us a chance to win.”</p><p><strong>Di Pauli set to make debut</strong></p><p>Growing up in a small, northern Italian town of Caldaro, Thomas Di Pauli used to stay up until 1:30 in the morning to watch the NHL and dream about one day reaching the world’s best league.</p><p>“I remember watching Sidney Crosby play,” Di Pauli said. “That’s all you want to do as a little kid.”</p><p>Now, with Crosby not yet ready to return from his sports hernia surgery and Sam Lafferty sick, Di Pauli will get the opportunity to achieve to goal he set for himself all those years ago and an ocean away. He was recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton in time for Saturday night’s game against the Montreal Canadians.</p><p>Di Pauli, whose family moved from Italy to the Chicago-area when he was 12 in order to pursue a career in hockey, has been on the fringe of making his NHL debut for a few weeks now. He was recalled twice before recently as insurance in case the Penguins unexpectedly lost a forward while on the road. The speedy forward joined the club from Dec. 20-22 and Dec. 27-28 but returned to Wilkes-Barre/ Scranton both times without earning the nod at game time. Now, it appears the third time is the charm.</p><p>“Getting called up and getting the experience of being around the guys and seeing what it’s all about made me want it that much more,” Di Pauli said. “I wasn’t sure that was possible.”</p><p>In 22 games for Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, Di Pauli has logged 12 points (six goals, six assists). His style of game sounds like it fits when the Penguins like to do.&nbsp;</p><p>“He brings a lot of speed,” Sullivan said. “He brings a lot of energy. He’s good on the forecheck. He’s a pesky player. He’s hard to play against... I’m sure Thomas will be excited to play. He’ll bring a lot of energy.”</p><p><strong>Galchenyuk returns to Montreal&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Alex Galchenyuk was back in a familiar arena on Saturday. Drafted by the Montreal Canadiens third overall in 2012, the Penguins winger played his first six seasons in the Centre Bell.&nbsp;</p><p>“I had a lot of fun playing in this arena,” Galchenyuk said. “It’s definitely a little bit more emotional.”</p><p>Galchenyuk was in the visitors locker room last season when he came back to Montreal as a member of the Arizona Coyotes. But because of back-to-back games, he was only in the city briefly. Flying in the night before the game gave Galchenyuk a chance to revisit his old stomping grounds.&nbsp;</p><p>“I didn’t have that much time to walk around the city or go to restaurants,” Galchenyuk said. “I had a great opportunity to do that yesterday. I enjoyed it.”</p><p><em>Mike DeFabo: <a href="mailto:mdefabo@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">mdefabo@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;and Twitter @MikeDeFabo.&nbsp;</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/01/04/Misplaced-passports-keeps-Penguins-goalie-Casey-DeSmith-from-making-first-NHL-stint-this-season/stories/202001040038</original_url>
