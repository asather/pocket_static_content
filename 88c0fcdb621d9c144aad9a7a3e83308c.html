<h1>At an Ohio BBQ joint cashing in on Pa. customers, Gov. Wolf named its 'employee of the month'</h1>

<p>Mike Morgan had no idea a throwaway line at the end of a Facebook post would result in the kind of media attention his restaurant — Breakwall BBQ in Conneaut, Ohio — has been receiving over the last 24 hours.</p>
<p>On Monday, Breakwall BBQ posted a message to its Facebook page that was intended to thank <a href="https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/109456-alesha-zappittella" target="_blank">local MMA fighter</a> Alesha Zappitella for eating at that establishment. The post also included a seemingly innocuous joke at the expense of Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf: “Also want to give a shout out to our employee of the month, Pennsylvania’s very own Governor Wolf .. you the man sir!”</p>
<p>This comment was referring to the notable economic boost Breakwall BBQ has been enjoying due to an influx of Pennsylvanians crossing the Ohio border to take advantage of Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2020/05/ohio-restaurants-bars-get-green-light-from-ohio-gov-dewine.html" target="_blank">allowing dine-in service to resume</a> at his state’s restaurants last month after being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Though that same <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/dining/2020/06/16/Restaurants-bars-COVID-19-green-phase/stories/202006120114" target="_blank">restriction has been lifted</a> in most Western Pennsylvania counties, Mr. Wolf was still facetiously honored as Breakwall’s “employee of the month” for driving so much business its way.</p>
<p>“That was just a silly little joke at the end [of a Facebook post],” Mr. Morgan told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. “The whole thing just blew up. I’m kind of shocked about it honestly.”</p>
<p>The joke probably took on a life of its own because it inadvertently highlighted a consequence of Mr. Wolf taking his time moving most Pennsylvania counties to the “green” phase of reopening.</p>
<p>Ohio businesses were happy to take Pennsylvanians’ money while most of the state remained closed, and unlike Florida bars and restaurants that had to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/florida-bars-restaurants-close-coronavirus-spike-outbreak-a9568631.html" target="_blank">close within a week of reopening</a> due to a resurgence in COVID-19 cases, they’ve so far been able to remain open to the public. Buckeye State liquor stores were so full of KeyStone State residents in April that Mr. DeWine <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/04/13/Ohio-governor-liquor-store-order-identification-pennsylvania-sales-west-virginia-plcb-maryland/stories/202004130129" target="_blank">decreed that liquor stores</a> in the six Ohio counties closest to Pennsylvania could only sell their products to customers with Ohio IDs.</p>
<p>Conneaut is only about five miles from the Pennsylvania border and thus prime territory for Pennsylvanians who missed eating in restaurants. Breakwall in particular has seen a surge of folks from nearby Erie County, which is still in Mr. Wolf’s “yellow” phase and thus isn’t permitting dine-in service yet.</p>
<p>“We have a lot of people from Erie anyway,” Mr. Morgan said. “Now it’s twice as much.”</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan said that business at Breakwall has been flourishing so much lately that he has had to shorten restaurant hours because he doesn’t “want people waiting over an hour for food” and also had to stop providing takeout services because with the dining room as busy as it is, “we can’t do both.”</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan isn’t complaining about the increased customer load and said “there’s some guilt involved” that Breakwall’s success is partially coming at the expense of Pennsylvania restaurants. He has plenty of friends in Pennsylvania who are restaurant owners and his Breakwall business partner, Gabriel Cellini, is from Beaver Falls.</p>
<p>Both hope that Pennsylvanians continue to visit Breakwall and will once again be allowed to eat and drink at restaurants in their own counties.</p>
<p>“Those are our brothers over there, and they’re suffering,” Mr. Morgan said. “For God’s sake, man, it would be nice if they could open up.”</p>
