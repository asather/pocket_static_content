<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Should Steelers sign James Conner to another contract after this year?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>Jason:</strong> Do you think the Steelers will sign James Conner to another contract? Do you think the Steelers should sign James Conner to another contract?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t think they will nor do I think they should. I would say this: Conner is an excellent ambassador for Pittsburgh. He has a great story and he has been a model of courage. He has also been a good football player for the most part. But he plays a position that has a career expectancy of about three years. He has not been very durable or reliable. And the Steelers have proven they will move on from running backs. The Steelers have drafted a running back in each of the past three drafts. They are committed to Conner for this year, but I don’t see them sinking big money into him for a long-term deal. He can say he will take a home town discount, but that’s not good business and he needs to cash in on this contract. I just don’t see it as a marriage that is likely to continue.</p>
<p><strong>Greg:&nbsp;</strong>Will Pitt's offense be more balanced this fall compared to last year when it was too pass heavy? Was that because of the new OC or because the O-line couldn't run block well enough?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The offensive line was not good at run blocking at all. The line wasn’t much better at pass blocking, to be honest. Pat Narduzzi wants to play tough guy football so the lack of a running game wasn’t for lack of trying. It was because they couldn’t do it. They just couldn’t block well enough to make it happen. The line should be much improved this year with four starters returning. I would expect the running game will be more of a factor this year and take some of the pressure off of Kenny Pickett. The offense should be more balanced and thus become more efficient and effective.</p>
<p><strong>Zach:&nbsp;</strong>Was MLB pitcher Blake Snell's statement the other day the biggest tone-deaf moment for any pro athlete that you can remember?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Any time someone uses&nbsp;“tone deaf” or&nbsp;“bad look” or&nbsp;“optics” they have already made a losing argument in my book. Those words don’t mean much of anything, just words people use to make themselves sound more empathetic, insightful and smarter than they really are. As for Snell, he just comes off as kind of a jerk and not real bright. His argument is lame — these are different economic times for baseball. The pie of money they are trying to divide up is a lot smaller than it has been in a long, long time. The owners and players have to work together to make a deal that works and that means players will have to play for less than they normally get. And at the end of the day, if Snell doesn’t want to play because he&nbsp;“can’t get mine,” then don’t play. He isn’t that important and some of these guys need to be reminded of that.</p>
<p><strong>Albert:&nbsp;</strong>I’m sure they can simulate crowd noise during Steelers games, but how are they possibly going to simulate the most important thing: The Terrible Towel? And will they still play Renegade with no fans in the stands? I sure hope so because it fires up the team.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I bet they will play Renegade at a certain time in games even without fans. I can’t imagine stadiums aren’t going to have the interactive scoreboard still because it will add at least some atmosphere. As for the Terrible Towel, that’s a tougher one but I bet the Steelers will get fans to send videos of twirling the towel and add it to the in-game video presentation up on the Jumbotron.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> Is the City Game really worth all this discussion? Duquesne hasn’t been relevant in decades. How does playing this game help Pitt?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> The City Game is enjoyed by the basketball community here in Pittsburgh. That’s all that really should matter in this discussion. It is good for Pitt, it is good for Duquesne and it is good for the city. Pitt could get a Quad 2 game on a neutral court, make some money and with a win really enhance its NCAA resume. Duquesne is getting better and thus the game is going to become more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> Do you understand Pitt’s challenges in scheduling since the ACC went to 20 league games? If you just took a look at the actual schedule you would understand why Pitt can’t play Duquesne this year. Why can’t you understand this?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I’ve heard it all and it is all nonsense. Pitt still has five or six home games it has to fill with non-conference opponents. Duquesne is better than any of the teams they will bring in. Duquesne is cheaper than any of the teams they will bring in. Duquesne will fill the arena; Maryland-Eastern Shore will not. There is not a downside to it for Pitt because even if it loses — especially at PPG Paints Arena — it won’t hurt them because Duquesne is now a quality team.</p>
<p><strong>Terry:</strong> I think what people defending Jeff Capel and Heather Lyke are missing is that this is a stepping stone job for both of them. And they should not be tearing apart traditions like the City Game when they won’t be here in a few years to live with the consequences of canceling a series that local people love. Do you agree?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I don’t know if they are carpetbaggers or not, I just know this was not a decision that was made with the city, the fan base and the history in mind. And that is a shame. It is the kind of thing that could harm the relationship between two athletic departments for no other reason than ego.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Edward:</strong> You and all your co-workers miss the point about why Ben Roethlisberger’s haircut is a problem. People everywhere wish they could get their haircut, but can’t because they follow the rules. Why are you so willing to let Ben Roethlisberger off the hook? And don’t you think that it shows an incredible level of being tone deaf toward what is happening in the world?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> There is that&nbsp;“tone deaf” stuff again. Sigh. Roethlisberger got a haircut. Many people are doing it every day behind closed doors. He just happened to be dumb enough to film it. This wasn’t a case of him being privileged or whatever the dumb narrative is about it. Get over it. He got a haircut. Who cares? There are far more important things to worry about.&nbsp;</p>
