<h1>Pittsburgh Councilmen Burgess, Lavelle pursue task force on race and COVID-19 response</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Councilmen Ricky Burgess and R. Daniel Lavelle introduced legislation Tuesday aimed at monitoring how race and equity factor into the local COVID-19 response.</p>
<p>The plan proposes the creation of a task force comprised of elected officials from the city, county and state levels, as well as university representatives and public health officials.</p>
<p>"In most cities across the country African Americans have a disproportionate rate of COVID-19 infections," Mr. Burgess said in a press release. "In Pennsylvania, African-Americans are 11% of the populations yet they account for 21% of all COVID-19 related deaths. We must begin to systematically test Black people in Pittsburgh. The COVID-19 Task force along with its community health center partners will assist in that effort.‚Äù</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/resources/COVID-19/Covid-19.aspx" target="_blank">county-level data</a> on Tuesday, 19% of Allegheny County's 1,375 cases were among African Americans. Fifty-five percent were among whites, 2% among the Asian population. The racial data of 23% of the cases were unknown.</p>
<p>The racial data on COVID-19 testing in the county are much more scarce, with the racial profiles unknown in 55% of test recipients.Thirty-three percent of recipients were identified as white, 10% as African American.</p>
<p>African Americans account for 13.4% of the county's population, according to census data.</p>
<p>The task force would also "help coordinate resources given to the African American community both during and immediately after the pandemic to lessen its effects," Mr. Lavelle said.</p>
<p>Council is expected to discuss the proposal next Wednesday.</p>
