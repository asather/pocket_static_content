<h1>Kevin Colbert, Steelers preach lessons from '70s during unusual draft prep</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are no pro days, no chances to take a prospect to dinner and get to know him, his family or friends. There are no visits to the team facility, no in-person interviews with the coaching staff, no follow-up exams by team doctors and trainers.</p>
<p>OK, NFL teams did have the benefit of the scouting combine in Indianapolis in late February, allowing them to get the exact measurables of each player and see test results from the 40-yard dash, vertical jump and all the other drills that are staged at Lucas Oil Stadium.</p>
<p>But this aspect of the post-combine draft process for the Steelers — the second-most important part of their preparation — has been interrupted by the restrictions imposed because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It has forced them, said general manager Kevin Colbert, to rely on what they think is the most essential element of finding players anyway: evaluating players based on what they did in the fall on the football field.</p>
<p>To reinforce this and deliver something of a pep talk to his staff, Colbert reminded his scouts of the 1974 draft in which the Steelers selected four future Hall of Famers and signed another as an undrafted free agent while operating under similar — though not league-enforced — circumstances. And he told them of the three people in charge of evaluating those Hall of Fame players — vice president Art Rooney Jr., personnel director Dick Haley and his assistant, the late Bill Nunn.</p>
<p>“Those guys relied on what they watched as football players,” Colbert said. “They did some individual timing here and there, but there was no pro day, there were no extensive interviews, there was no combine, there was no physicals. They just drafted what they thought were football players. And I reminded our guys that was the best draft in NFL history. We have to be confident in what we’ve done with our evaluations because we’ll have to draft based on what we saw as football players because we have minimal information after that.”</p>
<p>The Steelers don’t go into any draft realistically thinking they are going to draft four Hall of Famers such as they did in 1974 with Lynn Swann, Jack Lambert, John Stallworth and Mike Webster. Or immediately afterward sign an undrafted safety such as Donnie Shell, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/01/16/Donnie-Shell-never-lost-faith-that-he-would-make-the-Pro-Football-Hall-of-Fame-Steelers/stories/202001160144" target="_blank">who gets inducted this year</a> as part of the Pro Football Hall of Fame’s 2020 Centennial Class.</p>
<p>But they did it in 1974, without any of the advantages and opportunities teams are afforded now with the combine, pro-day workouts, on-site interviews and shared medical information. The only other time they picked two future Hall of Famers in the same draft was 1970 when they selected Terry Bradshaw and Mel Blount.</p>
<p>“You would attend the games and you went out always to see the guy live, either in practice or the game,” said Art Rooney Jr., who was vice president in charge of the player personnel department in the 1970s. “The basic stuff was height, weight and speed. The combine thing, that came after years and years. Now they have everything — height, weight, speed, 40 times, change of direction, jumping. And it comes out on TV.”</p>
<p>Back then, Rooney said he and his scouts had to time players wherever and whenever they could because “back then, you couldn’t always get a time.” He remembers one of his scouts taking a prospect out to a high-school football field at night, measuring off 40 yards with the line from a fishing reel and turning on the lights from a car so they could see.</p>
<p>When the Steelers first timed Swann in the 40-yard dash, he ran a 4.65. When one of the scouts, Jack Butler, tested him another time, he ran a 4.55, persuading them, however unofficially, to draft him in the first round in 1974. Not the same as the radar-clocked times in the 40 at the combine these days.</p>
<p>“Swann was a brilliant player and athlete, but the best we could ever get on him was 4.65,” Rooney said the other day from his winter home in Palm Beach, Fla., where he has remained during the pandemic. “Right before the draft, Jack Butler got him in a 4.55 or something like that. If he was good enough, that was fast enough, and he was sure good enough.”</p>
<p>Rooney said Haley was a “real good personnel guy and a real good guy” when he worked with the Steelers for 20 years (1971-1990). It is Haley who is generally given credit for the 1974 class. But, as a former defensive back at Pitt and with three NFL teams, including the Steelers, Haley would often engage in a drill with a prospect — sometimes to the player’s detriment.</p>
<p>It happened one time when a player from a small West Virginia school was invited for a tryout.</p>
<p>“It was almost like ‘The Gong Show,’ ” Rooney said. “This kid came up and we had him do the high jump, so he jumped and Dick said, ‘Take another jump.’ And he did and Dick said, ‘Is that as high as you can jump?’ Then Dick jumped. Dick said to him, ‘We’d be glad to give you the whole workout, but I’m 50 years old. If that’s all the better you can jump, you just can’t play.’ So the guy left.”</p>
<p>In those days, the Steelers were of one of five teams who comprised the Blesto scouting service run by Butler. During the draft, they would send trainer Ralph Berlin to Philadelphia for the Blesto meetings to act as a liaison for the Steelers with the scouts. If they needed additional information on a prospect during the draft, Rooney said they would have Berlin check with one of the scouts in attendance.</p>
<p>But Berlin managed to do even more than that. Acting on something he overheard during the meetings, he left immediately after the draft and went to Temple University to sign a tight end before the Eagles could do it. The tight end was Randy Grossman, who played eight seasons with the Steelers and started or played on all four Super Bowl teams in the ’70s.</p>
<p>“Ralph heard things,” Rooney said. “He had been in the Marines and he was trained to listen to that stuff. He told me, ‘The Eagles are going out tomorrow morning. I better go out tonight.’ And he did.”</p>
<p>Rooney said Nunn used some of the same intuition, not to mention his standing as the first person to actively scout the small black colleges, to sign Shell. A year earlier, Rooney had gone to Shell’s school, South Carolina State, to scout defensive end Barney Chauvos, who was a second-round pick of the Denver Broncos in 1973. He had little remembrance of Shell, only that he was a small linebacker who was too undersized to play in the NFL. Not Nunn.</p>
<p>“He said, ‘No, no, he’s special,’ which he was,” Rooney said. “Bill said, ‘He can play on special teams, like Rocky (Bleier) did, and he’s a real smart kid. He can cover kicks for a couple years and he’ll end up playing.’ ”</p>
<p>Nunn left before the 1974 draft even ended and flew to Atlanta, armed with contracts to sign free agents. That’s when he signed Shell, who, as predicted, was a special-teams player on the ’74 and ’75 Super Bowl teams before becoming a starter in 1977.</p>
<p>“The thing about it is, whatever tools you had, you used,” Rooney said. “And it got to be an art form with us. It’s a lot different now.”</p>
<p>The Steelers are getting a taste of what it was like in 1974. And Colbert has used that moment to remind his staff the job is not insurmountable.</p>
