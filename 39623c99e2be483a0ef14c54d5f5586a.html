<p>“I understand this news will disappoint many people, and I wish circumstances were different, but we must make the responsible decision to postpone the ceremonies.” Mr. Hennigan added.</p>
<p>He said graduating students&nbsp;will be contacted by their schools and respective programs regarding ideas and suggestions for a virtual commencement for each school or program.</p>
<p>“The University will continue to explore options for a University-wide, in-person, Commencement ceremony for the entire class of 2020 when conditions allow,” he said.</p>
