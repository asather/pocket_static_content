<h1>Everything you need to follow the Chinese Professional Baseball League</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL has formed a Return to Play committee aimed at steering its effort to restart — and hopefully complete — the 2019-20 season. NBA players, as long as their state allows it, will be allowed to work out on their own at team facilities starting Friday. Meanwhile, it’s been 46 days since the last live Pirates game on TV, with nothing but hypothetical scenarios to inspire hope.</p>
<p>Which is why, if you’re like me, you might be yearning for some live sports to watch — anything to carry us through the days between episodes of “The Last Dance” and games where we already know the result.</p>
<p>Enter the Chinese Professional Baseball League, one of the only leagues around the world holding games right now because of the coronavirus pandemic. The CPBL is not the best baseball you’ll find — it’s like the low-to-mid minor leagues here in the United States — but it is live baseball with breakfast. That’s not terrible.</p>
<p>So, what is the CPBL? Who plays in it? How’s it structured? Where can fans watch and follow along? This primer is designed to answer those questions and hopefully turn us all into a bunch of rabid monkeys ... er, fans of the Rakuten Monkeys, the defending champs and league winners in six of the past eight seasons.</p>
<p><strong>How many teams play in the CPBL?</strong></p>
<p>Right now there are four: the Rakuten Monkeys, Uni Lions, Chinatrust Brothers and Fubon Guardians. The Wei Chuan Dragons are an expansion team currently playing in the CPBL’s minor league system. They’ll move up to the majors in 2021.</p>
<p>The CPBL started in 1990 and grew as large as 11 teams during the latter part of that decade before a series of game-fixing scandals thwarted any momentum it had. It recently has been trying to bounce back with cleaner play.</p>
<p><strong>Where/how can you watch?</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually pretty easy. English-language broadcasts have become a thing, which is cool. Gives us a much easier entry point.</p>
<p>Most are accessible via Twitter, and games start at 6:35 a.m. during the week and at 5:05 on the weekends.</p>
<p>Live streams are free. To watch archived games — if you don’t want to get up at 5 a.m. on a weekend — you can pay $35/year for CPBL TV.</p>
<p><strong>Who should you root for?</strong></p>
<p>Up to you, obviously, but I liked these comps from Rob Liu, who runs the English-language CPBL Stats blog (<a href="http://cpblstats.com/" target="_blank">cpblstats.com</a>) that every fan delving into the league should probably bookmark.</p>
<p>Liu was on a <a href="https://blogs.fangraphs.com/effectively-wild-episode-1533-its-baseball-oclock-somewhere/" target="_blank">Fangraphs podcast called Effectively Wild</a> (tremendous listen, by the way) and broke the four teams down like this:</p>
<p>Rakuten Monkeys — Most comparable to the Oakland Athletics. They were a small-market team and knew they couldn’t compete, so they invested heavily in scouting and player development.</p>
<p>Fubon Guardians — Similar to the Los Angeles Dodgers. Great lineup but have had trouble winning the big game.</p>
<p>Chinatrust Brothers — Liu compared them to the Yankees. They’re loved and hated, both with equal vigor. Also have some really good players, which we’ll get to soon.</p>
<p>Uni Lions — Most like the Marlins, per Liu. Chances are Pirates fans will make another comparison. They have raw talent but also a bit of a problem spending money.</p>
<p>One example Liu cited was a new CPBL rule where, in 2020, teams can sign four foreign players instead of three. The Lions eschewed that and stuck with three.</p>
<p>“It’s almost like they don’t want to win,” Liu said on the podcast. “Or their front office doesn’t care about their baseball team at all.”</p>
<p><strong>What does the season look like?</strong></p>
<p>CPBL teams play 120 games, 60 in the first half and 60 in the second. Winning the first half punches a team’s ticket to the postseason.</p>
<p>From there, though, it gets a little complicated — which is crazy for a four-team league. For example:</p>
<p>• If one team wins both halves, then the second- and third-best teams (according to winning percentage) play a five-game series to advance to the best-of-seven Taiwan Series.</p>
<p>• If a team finishes with the best winning percentage but does not win a half-season, it plays the half-season winner with the lower winning percentage, the winner advancing to the Taiwan Series.</p>
<p>• If the same team finishes first during both half-seasons, it plays the winner of the wild card series and begins the Taiwan Series with a one-game lead.</p>
<p><strong>Who are some of the best players?</strong></p>
<p>• We should probably start with Chu Yu-Hsien, a first baseman for the Monkeys. He’s the reigning MVP after hitting a league-high 30 home runs last season and already has eight through nine games.</p>
<p>• Henry Sosa is a name you might recognize. He pitched for the Astros before his first stint in the Korea Baseball Organization. On the Fangraphs podcast, Liu floated the idea of Sosa potentially winning the pitching triple crown (wins, strikeouts and ERA).</p>
<p>• The Guardians also have a very good first baseman in Lin Yi-Chuan, a 34-year-old who could make a run at the league’s all-time hits record (2,134). Last week, he became the CPBL’s fastest player ever to 1,600 hits.</p>
<p>• The Brothers have another foreign pitcher in Ariel Miranda, a left-hander who pitched for the Mariners. It’s believed that Miranda has the richest contract for a foreign player at the moment — at least $600,000. In three starts, Miranda has struck out 23 over 18 innings, allowing three earned runs.</p>
<p>• Lin Chih-Sheng was a terrific story before Sunday. He’s 38 and entering his 17th CPBL season. He began the year just seven home runs shy of breaking the all-time CPBL record, then fractured two fingers sliding into home plate on Sunday.</p>
<p>• Su Chih-Chieh, a 25-year-old outfielder for the Uni Lions, became the first player in team history last year to produce a 20-20 season with 27 home runs and 21 stolen bases. Liu believes he’s a future star.</p>
<p>• The Monkeys have a couple more interesting foreign pitchers in Lisalverto Bonilla and Ryan Carpenter, who’ve combined for 27 strikeouts in 28 innings. Longtime Monkeys hurler I-Cheng Wang has won both of his starts thus far; he tied for second in wins (12) last season.</p>
<p><strong>What’s it like watching games?</strong></p>
<p>Weird, for one. There’s obviously nobody in the stands thanks to COVID-19, although the Monkeys have been using robot mannequins to act as fans — which is somehow more strange than playing in empty stadiums.</p>
<p>And many of the in-game entertainment stuff remains — the drum team, DJs, cheerleaders and mascots all creating a wacky atmosphere that looks absolutely nothing like baseball in America.</p>
<p>It’s really odd hearing the echoes when the visiting team is hitting (when the cheering madness stops), but baseball-wise, it’s not bad. If you liked the XFL, you could get into this. Riu likened it to bad Class A baseball on the worst days and a few ticks shy of Class AAA on the best. I can see that.</p>
<p>Hitters are aggressive, which is nice. They don’t step out of the box. You can tell the pitching lacks, although not enough to make watching prohibitive; 90 mph is considered pretty good.</p>
<p>Online, there’s an ongoing chat that accompanies the broadcast, creating a neat sense of community that we’ve lacked during these times.</p>
<p>On Sunday, it was oddly comforting when one team challenged a safe/out call at first base, and they cut to the obligatory truck shot. After a lengthy delay, the call was overturned. There have also been complaints about a juiced ball.</p>
<p>You know what they say about the more things change ...&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Final thoughts</strong></p>
<p>It’s obviously not Major League Baseball and doesn’t try to be. But for anyone who’s up at 5 or 6 in the morning — maybe you have little kids or simply stink at sleeping — those longing for live sports could do a lot worse.</p>
<p>I know I’m picking the Monkeys and riding that bandwagon all the way to another championship.</p>
