<h1>Patients responding well to clinical trial of possible COVID-19 drug remdesivir</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The first clinical trial of a potential COVID-19 treatment has reportedly shown encouraging results.</p>
<p>The trial is of the drug remdesivir, an antiviral developed by California-based Gilead Sciences. It was given to 125 people at a Chicago hospital, and STAT reports the small batch of results from a larger clinical trial has resulted in nearly all patients recovering and going home within a week.</p>
<p>“The best news is that most of our patients have already been discharged, which is great. We’ve only had two patients perish,” said Kathleen Mullane, the University of Chicago infectious disease specialist overseeing the study, in a video conference with faculty members. STAT obtained a copy of the video.</p>

<p>While the results are promising, there is a concern with the trial itself. Normally, clinical trials involve a “control” group, or a group basically given a non-effective treatment to eliminate a phenomenon known as “the placebo effect.” That is essentially when a person’s brain convinces the person’s body a treatment is working, even though no actual medicine was taken. Patients in the control group are not supposed to respond to the treatment, so if they do, it means the positive results may be more mental than medicine.</p>
<p>Without a control group against which to compare the results, the actual effectiveness of the drug can be questioned. However, with time of the essence, any drug showing encouraging signs could get quick approval in an effort to begin treating the most critical cases while a more accurate study is conducted.</p>
<p>The small group of Chicago patients are reportedly among 2,400 around the world in this trial.</p>
<p>Remdesivir, created several years ago as a potential treatment for the Ebola virus, has become a popular drug for treatment research.&nbsp;Dr. Amy Hajari Case, medical director for pulmonary and critical care research at Piedmont Healthcare, said it’s known to have a positive preclinical effect against different forms of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Before the results reported by STAT, remdesivir made international headlines after researchers reported in an article published last week in the New England Journal of Medicine&nbsp;two-thirds of patients hospitalized with severe infections of COVID-19 had improved their support status after receiving the drug once a day for up to 10 days.</p>
<p>Seven patients died from the disease after completion of remdesivir treatment, including six who had been receiving invasive ventilation.</p>
<p>But the research, supported by drug-maker Gilead Sciences, involved only a small group of patients. Researchers in the Journal report discussed some other limitations to the study.</p>
