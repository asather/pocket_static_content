<h1>Penguins GM Jim Rutherford not planning to travel to Toronto for NHL's restart — at least not at first</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jim Rutherford's ability to build championship-caliber teams and push the right buttons with in-season coaching changes has forever earned the Penguins general manager a place in Toronto’s Hockey Hall of Fame. However, when the Penguins head to Toronto to start their quest for another Stanley Cup, Rutherford isn’t planning to be there — at least not initially.</p>
<p>The 71-year-old is erring on the side of caution, considering he’s in an age bracket that puts him at a higher risk of complications should he contract COVID-19. He hasn’t ruled out joining the team as the 24-team tournament plays out.</p>
<p>Also staying at home will be depth defenseman Zach Trotman. Rutherford declined to get into specifics about why he’s been ruled out.</p>
<p>“It’s something he’s trying to work through that could flare up when we get into the bubble,” he said. “We didn’t want to take that chance.”</p>
<p>As long as we’re taking attendance here … the Penguins expect to have their full complement of players ready for training camp on Monday, with the exception of forwards Dominik Simon and Nick Bjugstad, who are both recovering from surgeries. That includes Kris Letang, another individual whose name has come up often in COVID-19 discussions.</p>
<p>The defenseman said previously that he was “not at all” concerned the stroke he suffered in 2014 could put his eligibility at risk. However, questions resurfaced when the league published Phase 3 and Phase 4 protocols. Every player must meet with a doctor and consult with an infectious disease specialist before returning.</p>
<p>“To my knowledge, all our players are cleared to go,” Rutherford said. “Any player that participates in our camp starting Monday is cleared to go.”</p>
<p>The Penguins have until Monday to submit a list of 52 people who will enter the NHL’s bubble in Toronto, which will include no more than 31 players and team ownership, executives and staff.</p>
<p><strong>New way of reporting injuries</strong></p>
<p>In an effort to maintain medical privacy, the NHL does not plan to announce positive tests on a club-by-club or player-by-player basis. Instead, it will report only the total number of positive tests.</p>
<p>To keep individuals from inferring who tested positive, the league will also handle all injury news during this postseason.</p>
<p>The St. Louis Blues and Tampa Bay Lightning briefly suspended practices during their Phase 2 informal skates. Deputy commissioner Bill Daly said once teams arrive in hub cities for Phase 4, “one positive test shouldn't shut down the tournament.”</p>
<p>However, he noted that an “outbreak” would be different and require a judgement call.</p>
<p><strong>Families allowed, but not until later</strong></p>
<p>The NHL has tried to find a middle ground between keeping the bubble tight and being sensitive to players’ desire to see loved ones in the middle of a pandemic. The compromise was to allow families to join hub cities for the conference finals and Stanley Cup Final, which will be played in Edmonton.</p>
<p>NHLPA special assistant to the executive director Mathieu Schneider said the idea came from Toronto Maple Leafs forward Jason Spezza. The World Championships use a similar model, with families joining only as the tournament goes on.</p>
<p>Players who advance to the Eastern Conference Finals could go five weeks without seeing their families.</p>
<p><strong>Statistically speaking</strong></p>
<p>Attention stats nerds. The NHL clarified one detail that, “all games from the 2020 Stanley Cup Qualifiers (round robin and qualifying rounds) are considered part of the 2020 postseason. Accordingly, all skater/goalie/team statistics accumulated in these games will be included in the 2020 player and team postseason stats.”</p>
<p>This also means the Penguins have extended their postseason streak to a league-best 14 seasons.</p>
<p><strong>Crowd noise?</strong></p>
<p>When asked if the NHL will pump crowd noise into arenas to simulate a real game environment, Commissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL has “some special things planned and you have to tune in to see them.”</p>
<p>Considering dogs can’t contract COVID-19, one can only assume Bettman was trying to keep his plan of an arena full of dogs under wraps.</p>
