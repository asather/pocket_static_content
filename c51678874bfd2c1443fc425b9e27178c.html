<h1>What home-field advantage can the Steelers have at an empty Heinz Field?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Broncos quarterback Drew Lock was just flushed out of the pocket to his right, and had to side-step a diving T.J. Watt to throw the ball away out of bounds, and still needs 10 yards to keep the drive alive.</p>
<p>“It’s thiiiiiird down!” bellows the voice of public address announcer Larry Richert, and the sound of a steam whistle booms to make you feel like you’re riding the Bayern Kurve at Kennywood.</p>
<p>Thing is, there are no fans there to hear it, no one to get fired up, no one to bang on the seats in front of them in hopes of giving their defense a little extra oomph.</p>
<p>Such is life for the Steelers in 2020 at Heinz Field, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/08/27/Heinz-Field-will-not-allow-fans-for-Steelers-Pitt-games-in-September/stories/202008270189" target="_blank">possibly for just two games</a>, possibly for the entire season. While they’ve already experienced the eeriness of a training camp in their cavernous stadium with no fans, as well as a season opener on the road against the Giants without a crowd, Sunday will be something else entirely: a Steelers home game with no Terrible Towels twirling and not a single yinzer who staggered through Gate A a few minutes before kickoff chanting “Dee-fense! Dee-fense!” with a hot dog in one hand and a tall boy in the other.</p>
<p>“Man, that’s a tough one,” said star wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster, who plays off the crowd as much as any Steeler. “Honestly, Pittsburgh fans, Steeler Nation, they’re unbelievable. They’re like nothing else. The fan base is incredible. For us to go out there and them not to be out there, that’s going to be tough.”</p>
<p><strong>An even playing field</strong></p>
<p>The interplay between Steeler Nation and the members of their governing body begins before the ball is ever kicked off. Each Sunday — or Monday or Thursday — at Heinz Field begins calmly enough, with fans filing into their seats as players stretch and warm up to the familiar drone of music and highlights on the big screen.</p>
<p>But around 10 minutes before game time, the ceremonies begin. That’s when the Steelers starting lineup is introduced in to the tune of “Back in Black” by AC/DC; offense one week, defense the next. Over the years, it’s provided the players a platform to take the field like gladiators entering the arena, from Ike Taylor being ahead of his time wearing a Terrible Towel mask, to Casey Hampton pounding his chest, to the current anchor of the intros, Watt, doing his signature sack leap.</p>
<p>Then there are the more understated routines, such as Ben Roethlisberger jogging out as he points to the crowd after being the final starter announced. He’s not sure what he’ll point to in his first home game in more than a year.</p>
<p>“When I got hurt, and knowing I was going to come back, one of those things I was most excited about was running out of the tunnel at Heinz Field in front of our fans,” Roethlisberger said. “To not have that this time, I’m going to be a little disappointed.”</p>
<p>Of course, once the game starts, there’s plenty more energy to keep the players engaged. If there’s such a thing as home-field advantage anymore for teams without fans, the extent of it might be the fact that the Steelers can sleep in their own beds the night before the game and enjoy a short commute to and from the office.</p>
<p>The cliche of Pittsburgh being a tough place to play won’t be a factor whatsoever for the Broncos as they come to town. If Lock, their second-year quarterback, struggles with his cadence or takes a delay of game, it’ll be no one’s fault but his own.</p>
<p>“Communication should be easy without fans,” Lock said. “I’ll probably keep the communication the same as we would for a home game, since we’re all pretty equal with how many fans we can have at a game.”</p>
<p>Added outside linebacker Bradley Chubb: “When you go to a place like Pittsburgh, you know they have a great tradition of having a good fan base and a good team. It’s going to be a little weird not having fans there. At the end of the day, they have to go through it as well. I know it’s going to be an even playing field.”</p>
<p><strong>Not moving the Styx</strong></p>
<p>Do the players actually pay attention to the scoreboard and hear what’s going on around them during the game? According to perhaps the most passionate Steeler, the answer is a resounding yes.</p>
<p>“In our mock game we did here at Heinz Field, it definitely does have a home game feel to it, just as far as being able to drive in, being in your own locker room, wearing the black jerseys, having all the third-down sounds that we’re used to,” Watt said. “They still play the towel twirling [graphic] up on the Jumbotron. Things like that kind of remind you it’s a home game. Even though the atmosphere isn’t going to be everything we’re used to, it’ll still be nice to be in Heinz Field.”</p>
<p>One of the staples of any game at Heinz Field is the playing of “Renegade” on the video board, which isn’t so much a theme song as it is an immersive experience of reliving bone-jarring hits, memorable sacks and thrilling takeaways — for fans and for players.</p>
<p>“I hope at some point they play it. I always love watching the video, seeing what wrinkle they add to the video and all the explosive, game-changing plays the defense and offense have,” Watt said. “I know it will be a lot different without fans, but still, it will bring back memories of what the atmosphere should be like, and it will juice up the defense, for sure.”</p>

<p>Fear not, T.J. — hangman is coming down from the gallows, according to Ryan Huzjak. Huzjak is vice president of sales and marketing for the Steelers, overseeing the team’s content group and helping to plan the game presentation.</p>
<p>Not only do they plan to keep deploying the late-game highlight package set to a thumping classic rock song before drives when the defense needs a pivotal stop, but it might be a bigger and better “Renegade” than ever. The Steelers have been collecting photos and videos of fans they can show on the scoreboard in place of when they’d normally pan to live shots of a raucous section getting rowdy, spittle flying from the mouth of an average Joe who looks as if he’s about to be the one rushing the passer.</p>
<p>“We’ve not ever experienced this before, so it’s something we’re learning about how to do it,” Huzjak said. “We’ve had a couple opportunities to practice through training camp, a couple scrimmages and practices that were simulated games, so we were able to get into the building and practice some of the elements. The reality of it is, we plan a lot of our content around driving energy and passion of those 68,000 people who are in the seats every week.”</p>
<p><strong>Just not the same</strong></p>
<p>While the seats will be empty, the show must go on. That means Richert calling down and distance, crediting players who make the tackle and generally making it sound like any other game. There will still be digital signage around the stadium, including out-of-town scores, in case any players, coaches or team staffers want to check out what’s happening around the league.</p>
<p>The Steelers also are planning to get their supporters involved from afar, through their Steeler Nation Unite app, as well as other digital platforms. That means a virtual Terrible Towel twirl at the start of the game, as well as a virtual national anthem.</p>
<p>“It’s not only a Heinz Field and a Pittsburgh issue,” Huzjak said, “it’s an NFL issue, largely, in terms of how to ensure that the quality of the games coming to the broadcast can be upheld, and then also how to make sure the environments are kind of fair and equitable across the league from a competition perspective. There are some league-wide parameters we’re all adhering to just for consistency and competitive fairness.”</p>
<p>That means piped-in crowd noise, or an “ambient audio track,” that is pre-recorded and distributed to all 32 teams. And the Steelers can’t jack up the volume just because it’s third-and-long for the Broncos. There’s a set decibel level, no higher or lower, at which the sound must be played.</p>
<p>Still, each individual team has some leeway with their usual prompts and cues that make a Steelers game feel like, well, a Steelers game.</p>
<p>“Yeah, we do. Our traditions, our work whistle that’s played when the stadium’s opened and on third downs, we’ll continue to use that,” Huzjak said. “We’ll continue to bring forth some of the high-energy defensive highlights and music that we put forth for defensive series.”</p>
<p>As much as Heinz Field will sound different, it also will look different. The signs that are often draped over the rotunda, or banners that hang above certain seat sections, always have been brought into the stadium by fans themselves, so they won’t be there. Plus, the first several rows of seats will be covered with tarps, same as every other venue.</p>
<p>Viewers watching from home will hear a little bit livelier source of audio than what’s pumping through the stadium speakers. If you noticed boos when a team didn’t go for it on fourth down, or for an unfavorable penalty in Week 1, that was a feed made to enhance the TV experience. In real life, it will be much more sterile but hasn’t that been a theme of this COVID-19 NFL season?</p>
<p>“You’re not going to hear the celebrations, the oohs and ahhs. That’s one thing I learned [last] weekend,” Smith-Schuster said. “When plays were being made, it was just quiet in the stadium. Even though we do have the sound of the crowd, the speakers, it still doesn’t feel the same. For the most part, we’ll give Steeler Nation what they want — what they need — a ‘W.’”</p>
