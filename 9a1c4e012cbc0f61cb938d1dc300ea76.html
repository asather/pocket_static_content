<h1>Inverness plays nice during Round 1 as Danielle Kang takes lead</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TOLEDO — Birdies were flying early at the LPGA Drive On Championship at Inverness. By lunchtime, Danielle Kang, ranked No. 4 in the world, had carded six birdies and nary a bogey, good for a 6-under-par 66 and the first-round lead. Close behind was Lee-Anne Pace at 4 under, Lydia Ko, Minjee Lee, and Amy Olson at 3 under, and Carlota Ciganda and Dana Finkelstein at 2 under.</p>
<p>Benign conditions became tougher in the afternoon in the form of wind and firmer greens. At the end of the day, 18 players shot under par, as Kang leads Jodi Ewart Shadoff by one stroke, followed by Pace and Celine Boutier at 4 under, with Ko, Lee, and Olson rounding out the top five.</p>
<p>Rain is in the forecast Saturday and Sunday — and Inverness’ teeth.</p>
<p><strong>Rest and recovery</strong></p>
<p>First, Ciganda’s muscles ached. Then came a fever and headaches.</p>
<p>The coronavirus symptoms proved correct when she soon tested positive. For nearly a month, Ciganda was sequestered in her Arizona apartment until multiple tests came back negative.</p>
<p>“I just stayed inside all the time,” she said, choosing to keep her mask on while doing a socially dstanced interview.</p>
<p>Ciganda has been in the clear for about three weeks now, arriving in Toledo brimming with confidence. After a 2-under 70, it’s clear why she felt good about her game. She paired four birdies with two bogeys on a day that could have been better if a few early putts dropped.</p>
<p>“Very happy with the way I played,” Ciganda said. “I think under par on this course is always a good round.”</p>
<p>The Spainard dusted her American playing partners Lexi Thompson (73) and Nelly Korda (76), who are both ranked in the top 10.</p>
<p>“It was fun,” Ciganda said. “I like playing with good players. Obviously Nelly and Lexi are two of the top players. Great fun, long hitters. Have a great time playing with them.”</p>
<p>The LPGA conducted 466 pre-travel and on-site tests. Three were positive — Gaby Lopez, Marina Alex, and one caddie. Lopez and Alex withdrew.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t fun, but I don’t think I did anything wrong,” Ciganda said. “I think the virus is there. We have to learn how to live with it. I think it’s going to be here for a long time, so you have to take all the measurements, all the precautions that you can take. And then if you get it, I think it’s unlucky. I don’t think you can stay home and do nothing unless you are one of those people that has problems, and if you get it, it can be tough. I’m just happy to be back here.”</p>
<p><strong>Silence is golden</strong></p>
<p>When Kang rolled in her sixth birdie of the day on the par-4 ninth — she started on the back nine — there were no cheers. In the previous group, Ko jokingly waved to the non-existent crowd.</p>
<p>Welcome to professional sports in the coronavirus era.</p>
<p>There are no fans at Inverness, just as there won’t be any at Highland Meadows next week for the Marathon Classic.</p>
<p>“I definitely think it’s calmer, more level headed,” Kang said. “Maybe that’s good for me. I don’t know. But I also really like the fans. Today was very mellow. I’m pretty sure that’s the fans not being around. I also really love it when there are a lot of roars.”</p>
<p>A lack of fans and a bare-bones staff meant that wayward tee shots were more difficult to find. On the par-5 13th hole, Lexi Thompson hit her drive right of the fairway. During the search to find her golf ball, Golf Channel broadcaster Jerry Foltz accidentally ran over it with her golf car.</p>
<p>Thompson was allowed to place the ball in the rough, replicating the lie she faced before it was run over.</p>
<p>The tightly controlled tournaments also mean no leaderboards, which prevents players from knowing where they stand on the golf course. To help alleviate such First World problems, players are allowed to use the LPGA app on their phone to see scores.</p>
<p>“I’m a leaderboard watcher, so that’s a bit different, not knowing where the leaders are standing,” Kang said.</p>
<p>But she will not seek out her phone this weekend. Neither will Pace.</p>
<p>“That feels weird anyway to me, right, to look at your phone on the golf course?”</p>
<p>Sacrilege.</p>
<p><strong>O Captain! My Captain!</strong></p>
<p>How excited was Angela Stanford to restart the LPGA season?</p>
<p>Enough so that she forgot her golf clubs.</p>
<p>Stanford, who lives in Saginaw, Texas, drove to Toledo for the two-week stint. But when the 2021 assistant United States Solheim Cup captain was 15 minutes down the road, she realized there was precious cargo missing from her car: a golf bag filled with 14 clubs.</p>
<p>The 17-hour trip was extended by a few minutes.</p>
<p>The morning after arriving in Toledo, she had a flat tire.</p>
<p>“I’m like, ‘OK, is this supposed to be an analogy? What is going on here?’ said Stanford, who shot a 2-over 74. “I feel like a rookie. This is my 20th year, and it was supposed to be smooth sailing.”</p>
<p>Friday’s round didn’t give her much time to look around and imagine potential pin placements or teeing locations for next Labor Day. But she will return Tuesday for a Marathon Classic pro-am, which will give her an opportunity to gather a full scoring report.</p>
<p>“I hope we keep it firm and fast,” she said. “I think that would be more entertaining.”</p>
<p><strong>Like brother, like sister</strong></p>
<p>One year after little brother Alexis played in the U.S. Junior Amateur at Inverness, Albane Valenzuela is in the field for the Drive On Championship, shooting a 1-over 73.</p>
<p>Alexis shot 77-81 last year and missed the 36-hole cut. He caddied for his sister in the 2017 U.S. Women’s Amateur, helping her to a runner-up finish at San Diego Country Club. Albane finished second again in 2019 at Old Waverly.</p>
<p>“I knew how special this place was,” said Valenzuela, an LPGA Tour rookie who starred at Stanford. “It’s been fun hearing about his experience here at Inverness and me coming back now for this tournament. It’s just so special to be back on tour.”</p>
<p>Valenzuela, born to a Mexican father and French mother in New York, is a Switzerland citizen. She’s now a resident of the Bahamas, where she spent the past five months. The former Olympian had a 20-minute virtual graduation ceremony from Stanford.</p>
<p>Her next step is graduating to the winner’s circle on the LPGA Tour.</p>
<p>“It feels like I’m a rookie again,” Valenzuela said. “It’s been so long since I last competed, so you get the same nerves and excitement as when you started the season.”</p>
<p><strong>Hole of the day</strong></p>
<p>The par-5 second hole was the easiest on the course — by far, playing more than a half-stroke under par. There were two eagles, 68 birdies, and only five bogeys. Not only was it playing short at 476 yards, it was straight downwind, creating perfect scoring opportunities. Lee was the only player among the seven-person top five who didn’t birdie the hole.</p>
<p><strong>Quoteable</strong></p>
<p>“I’ve had a few members seeing me doing it, which is kind of embarrassing.” — Ko, detailing her standard on-course bet with Lindy Duncan and Anne van Dam at Lake Nona in Orlando: greenside push-ups.</p>
