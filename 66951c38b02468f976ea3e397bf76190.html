<h1>Unions clamor for pandemic rescue funds, and leverage, as federal dollars flow to big businesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The federal taxpayer dollars moved swiftly to airlines contending with a sharp drop-off of passengers because of a national disaster. The companies proceeded to sever union contracts, lay off workers and declare bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The 2001 rescue package approved by the George W. Bush administration after the 9/11 terrorist attacks is still fresh, two decades later, in the minds of labor union officials as they seek worker protections during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“There were basically no strings attached” to the 9/11 package, said Dan Mauer, director of government affairs for the Communications Workers of America, which represents flight attendants and airport workers.&nbsp;“That was a lesson that was 20 years ago now, but it really left a mark.”</p>
<p>This time around, “we didn’t want to repeat the same mistake again,” he said. “We need to make sure all the money is directed to benefit workers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Congress approved a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/04/05/A-burning-question-after-a-2-2-trillion-package-Is-it-enough-for-Pittsburgh/stories/202004010005?cid=search" target="_blank">$2.2 trillion rescue package</a> last month aimed at businesses and individuals enduring a widespread economic shutdown to stem the spread of the virus. During Capitol Hill negotiations, labor unions joined Democrats in labeling emergency loans for businesses as “slush funds” and&nbsp;“bailouts.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>But those unions are now clamoring for the federal dollars. The caveat: Unions want conditions that would dictate how companies spend the money and would specifically protect their contracts and bargaining power.</p>
<p>It can be a tricky messaging balance for unions, which&nbsp;represent workers in many of the industries temporarily shuttered by the virus — or deemed essential to combat it. With a flood of taxpayer money heading to employers, union officials said in interviews they are muscling their way into the conversation.</p>
<p>The goal, officials said, is to pressure employers to immediately fill gaps in the CARES Act and pressure Congress to go further in the next round of legislation expected in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>“We see the bargaining table as the way we can protect our workers,” said Mary Kay Henry, international president of the&nbsp;Service Employees International Union. The SEIU recently secured a voluntary&nbsp;$2,000 child care subsidy in Washington State, free testing for 175,000 janitors in 22 cities and plans to announce a&nbsp;“major breakthrough” on the West Coast this week, Ms. Henry said.</p>
<p>All of them build momentum, she said, for lobbying for the fourth COVID-19 bill.</p>
<p>“Those wins help inform what we should demand in package four,” Ms. Henry said, ratting off a list of demands: expanded unemployment benefits and paid sick leave, access to health care coverage and free virus testing for all Americans, including immigrants.</p>
<p>“If union-represented employers agree to it, it should be good enough for the federal government to require it for all employees,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Unions fought successfully for some provisions in the rescue package, called the CARES Act, that prevent companies from using money to pay executive bonuses and stock buybacks that go to investors.</p>
<p>Mid-sized businesses, defined as employing 500 to 10,000 workers,&nbsp;must agree to “remain neutral in any union organizing effort” for the entire life of the Treasury Department loan. Further, those businesses must agree not to break their current union contract for at least two years after repayment of the loan.</p>
<p>The union-protection language should be expanded to employers of all sizes, union officials said.</p>
<p>Mr. Mauer, the CWA official who had flashbacks to 2001, said the union got a provision that requires airlines to pay their workers through September and prevents companies from breaking union contracts.</p>
<p>“That’s a huge victory that’s going to keep tens of thousands of our members employed for the next several months,” Mr. Mauer said.</p>
<p>Beyond the bill, the CWA will be monitoring to ensure the&nbsp;head off loopholes the Trump administration may seek to exploit, he said.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows the underlying purpose is to benefit workers,” Mr. Mauer said. “We think we have a strong moral argument that people will find persuasive — maybe not the executives, but the general public.”</p>
<p>That appeal to the public can be a good strategy when companies are accepting federal dollars,&nbsp;said Rebecca Kolins Givan, associate professor in the Rutgers School of Management and Labor Relations.</p>
<p>“The power of significant organizing going on by workers both in essential industries and the hardest-hit industries will really change the conversation,” Ms. Givan said.</p>
<p>“The pandemic is exposing the inequality that was already there, but there’s a point of leverage when public money may be used to either shore up inequalities or address them,” she said.&nbsp;“The power that workers will have is the strength of their organizing and the support from the public.”</p>
<p>Still, some unions accused companies of not following the spirit of the law.</p>
<p>For example, small business loans are available to employers — with full loan forgiveness for payroll and other overhead expenses. But some hotel and restaurant chains, who had lobbied for small business loans be made available to individual locations, are now opting to lay off workers rather than apply for those loans, said Meghan Cohorst, spokeswoman for Unite Here, which represents 300,000 hospitality workers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They are bristling at this idea that they should be forced to keep on workers,” Ms. Cohorst said.</p>
<p>Unite Here, beginning this week, is planning a series of campaigns pressuring specific employers to keep workers on the payroll and provide health care and sick leave to workers who often make low wages, she said.</p>
<p>“We’re now seeing how employers are responding to it, and we’re developing responses,” she said. “We’re in a position now to be more proactive and actually campaigning on different companies to do the right thing.”</p>
<p>The pain has extended to those covering the pandemic.</p>
<p>As businesses have shut down, they have slashed their advertising budgets in newspapers and magazines. Those publications, already struggling with a long decline in advertising revenue and corporate consolidation, have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/03/23/Newspapers-cuts-layoffs-print-editions-COVID-19-advertising-revenues/stories/202003230103?cid=search" target="_blank">responded by furloughing staff</a>.&nbsp;Gannett, the country’s biggest newspaper chain, announced plans to furlough employees for one week each month.</p>
<p>The NewsGuild, which represents about 26,000 journalists including the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette newsroom, has called for a “journalism stimulus” — while proposing more than a dozen conditions newspapers must meet to accept federal money.</p>
<p>These included:&nbsp;a ban on consolidation or mergers than result in job losses;&nbsp;public financing for local journalism; adding media workers on company boards; and increasing diversity in news operations.</p>
<p>“We cannot stand by and let news organizations in our communities die,” NewsGuild President Jon Schleuss <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/newsguild-life-saving%C2%A0news%C2%A0needs-stimulus" target="_blank">said in a statement</a>&nbsp;last week.&nbsp;“Public stimulus funds are the only way to ensure the long-term viability of the news organizations people rely on.”</p>
