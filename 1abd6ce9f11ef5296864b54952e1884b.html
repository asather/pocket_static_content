<p>Five people, including three brothers from Spring Hill, have been charged federally in connection with the attempted burglaries of firearms dealers in Moon and Bethel Park in May.</p>
<p>Jerwahn Atkins, 23; Jerquay Atkins, 25; and Jamir Atkins, 21 — all brothers — were indicted Tuesday on charges of conspiracy.</p>
<p>Two alleged accomplices, Haliston Este and Jasmine Greenlee, are charged separately in a complaint brought by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.</p>
<p>ATF said the group tried to burglarize Allegheny Arms in Bethel Park on May 30 and National Armory in Moon early on May 31, the same night and early morning of widespread protests over the shooting of Greg Floyd by Minneapolis police.</p>
<p>ATF said no guns or ammunition were taken in either attempt but agents learned the burglaries were related to numerous other burglaries of commercial properties across Allegheny County.</p>
<p>At 11:13 p.m. on May 30, Bethel Park police responded to an alarm at Allegheny Arms, which thwarted the burglary attempt. A few hours later, at 1:37 a.m., Moon police responded to an attempted burglary at National Armory. A review of surveillance video showed four people in a silver sedan fleeing the area.</p>
<p>At 2:13 a.m., burglars hit the Verizon store in Mt. Lebanon, where officers saw a smashed window and discovered stolen merchandise. Then, at 2:30 a.m., police in Green Tree were on patrol when they heard glass break in a shopping plaza behind the police station. As they pulled into the parking lot of a Verizon store on Greentree Road, they saw a man inside the store. The suspect jumped out of a broken window and climbed into a silver sedan. Police gave chase but lost sight of the car.</p>
<p>A review of security cameras determined that the cars involved at the burglaries were a silver 2020 Chevrolet Malibu with a Florida plate and a white Oldsmobile with a Pennsylvania plate.</p>
<p>Police pulled over the Oldsmobile on June 1 and found a box of disposable gloves, cutting pliers and a black face mask. The driver told law officers that they had lent the car to the Atkins brothers on May 29 and got it back June 1. The witness also reviewed surveillance footage from the parking lot of Allegheny Arms from May 30, when the Malibu and the Oldsmobile are seen pulling into the lot. The occupants are seen talking while the driver and passenger in the Oldsmobile pull on blue latex gloves.</p>
<p>The witness identified Jerquay Atkins and Jamir Atkins from the video, according to an ATF affidavit.</p>
<p>Agents then presented images from the Verizon burglary and the witness identified Jerwahn Atkins.</p>
<p>Police also stopped the Malibu, driven by Ms. Greenlee, on June 1. She told agents and police that she and the three Atkins brothers, along with Haliston Este, 27, of Glen Hazel, took part in numerous burglaries across the region, according to the affidavit.</p>
<p>Ms. Greenlee told agents that Jamir Atkins used a crowbar to gain access to the businesses.</p>
<p>At Allegheny Arms, she said, she remained in the car as the others tried to gain entry, but the alarm went off. Ms. Greenlee said one of the men then searched for gun stores on his phone and located National Armory, where she then drove them.</p>
<p>On July 21, police and the ATF interviewed Mr. Este, who said he participated in several burglaries with the Atkins brothers, according to the affidavit. He said a crowbar was used to gain access to Allegheny Arms.</p>
<p>He also said he and the other three were involved in the attempted burglary at National Armory, ATF said, in which Ms. Greenlee served as the driver.</p>
