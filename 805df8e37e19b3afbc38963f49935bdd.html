<h1>James Mattis: In union there is strength</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I have watched this week’s un­fold­ing events, an­gry and ap­palled. The words “Equal Justice Under Law” are carved in the ped­i­ment of the United States Supreme Court. This is pre­cisely what pro­test­ers are rightly de­mand­ing. It is a whole­some and uni­fy­ing de­mand — one that all of us should be able to get be­hind. We must not be dis­tracted by a small num­ber of law­break­ers. The pro­tests are de­fined by tens of thou­sands of peo­ple of con­science who are in­sist­ing that we live up to our val­ues — our val­ues as peo­ple and our val­ues as a na­tion.</p>
<p>When I joined the mil­i­tary some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to sup­port and de­fend the Con­sti­tu­tion. Never did I dream that troops tak­ing that same oath would be or­dered un­der any cir­cum­stance to vi­o­late the con­sti­tu­tional rights of their fel­low cit­i­zens — much less to pro­vide a bi­zarre photo-op for the elected com­mander-in-chief, with mil­i­tary lead­er­ship stand­ing along­side.</p>
<p>We must re­ject any think­ing of our cit­ies as a “bat­tlespace” that our uni­formed mil­i­tary is called upon to “dom­i­nate.” At home, we should use our mil­i­tary only when re­quested to do so, on very rare oc­ca­sions, by state gov­er­nors. Mil­i­ta­riz­ing our re­sponse, as we wit­nessed in Wash­ing­ton, D.C., sets up a con­flict — a false con­flict — be­tween the mil­i­tary and ci­vil­ian so­ci­ety. It erodes the moral ground that en­sures a trusted bond be­tween men and women in uni­form and the so­ci­ety they are sworn to pro­tect, and of which they them­selves are a part.</p>
<p>Keep­ing pub­lic or­der rests with ci­vil­ian state and lo­cal lead­ers who best un­der­stand their com­mu­ni­ties and are an­swer­able to them.</p>
<p>James Madi­son wrote in Fed­er­al­ist 14 that “Amer­ica united with a hand­ful of troops, or with­out a sin­gle sol­dier, ex­hib­its a more for­bid­ding pos­ture to for­eign am­bi­tion than Amer­ica dis­united, with a hun­dred thou­sand vet­er­ans ready for com­bat.” We do not need to mil­i­ta­rize our re­sponse to pro­tests. We need to unite around a com­mon pur­pose. And it starts by guar­an­tee­ing that all of us are equal be­fore the law.</p>
<p>In­struc­tions given by the mil­i­tary de­part­ments to our troops be­fore the Nor­mandy in­va­sion re­minded sol­diers that “The Nazi slo­gan for de­stroy­ing us ... was ‘Di­vide and Con­quer.’ Our Amer­i­can an­swer is ‘In Union there is Strength.’” We must sum­mon that unity to sur­mount this cri­sis — con­fi­dent that we are bet­ter than our pol­i­tics.</p>
<p>Don­ald Trump is the first pres­i­dent in my life­time who does not try to unite the Amer­i­can peo­ple — does not even pre­tend to try. In­stead, he tries to di­vide us. We are wit­ness­ing the con­se­quences of three years of this de­lib­er­ate ef­fort. We are wit­ness­ing the con­se­quences of three years with­out ma­ture lead­er­ship. We can unite with­out him, draw­ing on the strengths in­her­ent in our civil so­ci­ety. This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fel­low cit­i­zens, to past gen­er­a­tions that bled to de­fend our prom­ise, and to our chil­dren.</p>
<p>We can come through this try­ing time stron­ger, and with a re­newed sense of pur­pose and re­spect for one an­other. The pan­demic has shown us that it is not only our troops who are will­ing to of­fer the ul­ti­mate sac­ri­fice for the safety of the com­mu­nity. Amer­i­cans in hos­pi­tals, gro­cery stores, post of­fices and else­where have put their lives on the line in or­der to serve their fel­low cit­i­zens and their coun­try. We know that we are bet­ter than the abuse of ex­ec­u­tive au­thor­ity that we wit­nessed in La­fay­ette Square. We must re­ject and hold ac­count­able those in of­fice who would make a mock­ery of our Con­sti­tu­tion. At the same time, we must re­mem­ber Lin­coln’s “bet­ter an­gels,” and lis­ten to them, as we work to unite.</p>
<p>Only by adopt­ing a new path — which means, in truth, re­turn­ing to the orig­i­nal path of our found­ing ide­als — will we again be a coun­try ad­mired and re­spected at home and abroad.</p>
