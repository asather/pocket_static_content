<h1>Bethel Park lays out plan for school reopening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>How the school day will look for students in the Bethel Park School District when they return for classes on Tuesday drew some critical comments from parents at a meeting this week.</p>
<p>School will start remotely for the first few weeks, with the goal to transition to a hybrid format of students in school in-person two days a week, by Oct. 5.</p>
<p>At the high school and middle school levels, students will have two days of synchronous instruction, taught by a live teacher, and two days of asynchronous learning where they work on their own.</p>
<p>Students at the elementary level will receive four days of synchronous instruction and one day of asynchronous learning where they work on their own. This is a change from what the district originally announced, which upset some parents who sent their comments into the school board to be read aloud at the meeting on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“Once again, chaos reigns in Bethel Park,” said parent Jessica Montesano in a letter to the board.</p>
<p>“Here we are a week until school begins and the plans change yet again from two days to four days of synchronous learning at least for elementary students,” she said.</p>
<p>“These decisions, these plans should have been made a month ago and communicated accordingly,” she added, calling the last-minute change a “slap in the face” to working parents.</p>
<p>Parent Bradley Fitch added, “With the start of school approximately a week away I am very worried we have yet to receive information about the school year.”</p>
<p>Information on how students’ days will look in the remote models can be found on <a href="http://www.bpsd.org" target="_blank">www.bpsd.org</a> under each school’s individual website tab.</p>
