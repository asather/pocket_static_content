<html><head><title>With no patients to see, Ellwood City hospital parent files for bankruptcy</title></head><body><p>The lone physician still practicing at Ellwood City Medical Center before it closed Dec. 11 said Thursday that he has not been paid since November and has not seen a patient since early December.</p><p>“I’ve basically been unemployed since mid-November,” said Sandeep Sharma, a kidney specialist who now hopes to rejoin an independent company in Cranberry.</p><p>He’s also expressing skepticism the hospital will reopen in mid-January as officials say they hope to do.</p><p>On Tuesday, the Florida-based for-profit Americore Health, which owns Ellwood City Medical Center, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky, where another Americore hospital is already under the control of a bankruptcy trustee.</p><p>Americore also previously owned hospitals in rural Virginia and Arkansas, but the Americore Health website currently lists only two hospitals among its holdings: Ellwood City and Izard County Medical Center in Calico Rock, Arkansas.</p><p>The Ellwood City hospital closed, at least temporarily, shortly after the state health department banned the Lawrence County hospital from admitting new patients or treating them in the emergency department due to lack of functioning critical equipment, among other issues.</p><p>That left Dr. Sharma with no patients to treat and “as the one physician, I represented 60% of the [hospital’s] revenue on a monthly basis. And that’s not good,” he said.&nbsp;“It’s not like I was generating millions of dollars, either.”</p><p>In an email exchange Thursday morning, Americore CEO Grant White said someone would be made available to comment —&nbsp;“Obviously, a lot more details to come,” Mr. White wrote —&nbsp;but there was no further response by close of business Thursday.</p><p>There also was no response to email inquiries to the medical center’s outgoing CEO, Beverly Annarumo, whose tenure with the hospital ends this week.</p><p>The hospital had about 400 employees when Americore announced it was acquiring Ellwood City Medical Center in March 2017 but, in light of recurring problems making payroll, the roster had dwindled to 150 last spring. Currently, Ellwood City Mayor Anthony Court said he understands that about 20 employees remain at the hospital “tying up loose ends.”</p><p>The prognosis for reopening the hospital, which is licensed for 46 beds, he said, “is grim.”</p><p>Tuesday’s bankruptcy filing asks the courts to reorganize Americore’s debts so it can continue to operate. It is unclear what effect the Chapter 11 filing will have on last week’s legal filing in Lawrence County by Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro that asks the courts to compel Americore to pony up for workers’ owed wages and other obligations.</p><p>The filing also noted that Americore had agreed when it purchased Ellwood City Medical Center to continue to operate the facility as a full-service community hospital with a 24-hour emergency department for 10 years.</p><p>Dr. Sharma said the hospital’s unstable finances made it difficult to recruit new physicians who would bring in needed patient revenue. And, as more and more doctors in the area aligned with larger networks such as UPMC, Allegheny Health Network and Heritage Valley, patient referrals had dried up.</p><p>He said Americore planned “to go after accounts receivable from various insurance companies,” recapitalize and re-open the hospital in mid-January “which I thought was fairly ambitious.”</p><p>Between a possible court fight over control of the hospital’s assets, getting the state’s recertification and meeting other requirements needed to reopen, he expects the process could take months.</p><p>“My hope is that the hospital can go back to being operational, but when you look at what has to happen …”</p><p>Mr. Court said Americore’s bankruptcy filing raises concern about the $400,000 or so the hospital currently owes the borough in gas, electricity and back taxes.</p><p>He also confirmed, <a href="https://www.ellwoodcityledger.com/news/20200102/collection-agency-ellwood-hospital-debts-are-real" target="_blank">as first reported by the local Ellwood City Ledger newspaper</a>, that some former patients are hearing from a Texas-based collection agency about bills for medical care going back to 2018. The news report quoted Ms. Annarumo as saying that some bills were not sent earlier because the hospital was unable to pay its bill processing company.</p><p>“My understanding is that it is legitimate,” said Mr. Court of the collections efforts —&nbsp;adding that the reaction from Ellwood City’s citizenry has been “mostly disgust and anger.”</p><p><em>Steve Twedt: <a href="mailto:stwedt@post-gazette.com" target="_blank">stwedt@post-gazette.com</a>&nbsp;or 412-263-1963.</em></p><p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/newsletters" target="“_blank”"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2019/06/03/BOPnewsletterinsert" alt="Go to section"> </a></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/business/healthcare-business/2020/01/02/Ellwood-City-Medical-Center-hospital-Americore-bankruptcy-physician-Shapiro/stories/202001020171</original_url>
