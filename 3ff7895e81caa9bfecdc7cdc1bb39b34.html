<h1>Downtown Partnership to hold public workshop on Pittsburgh mobility plan Wednesday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With $5.2 billion of development in the past 10 years and another $3.5 billion on the drawing boards, Downtown Pittsburgh streets are getting more crowded all the time.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership will be looking for ideas to ease that congestion Wednesday when it holds its first public workshop to develop a Downtown mobility plan that makes better use of the limited streetspace in the Golden Triangle.&nbsp;The business group, which is leading the study that also includes participation from the city, Port Authority and Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission, will hear from the public from 6 to 8 p.m. at Point Park University’s Academic Hall, Downtown.</p>
<p>The study, funded by a grant from the Henry L. Hillman Foundation, began last fall and already has had 1,433 people respond to an online survey. Design consultants Arup, Utile, MonWin Consulting and SmithGroup are working with the downtown partnership.</p>
<p>In its request for proposals for consultants, the downtown partnership said it envisioned&nbsp;“this plan serving as a catalyst for enhancing the existing multimodal transportation network that is optimized for new development opportunities while still retaining the historical and natural assets of Greater Downtown.”</p>
<p>The goal to the study is to develop options beyond cars for getting workers and visitors in and out of the Downtown area as efficiently as possible. That could include expanded transit, bike lanes, pedestrian walkways, parking for shared or self-driving vehicles, even Mayor Bill Peduto’s suggestion of gondolas on the three rivers.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The study should be completed by September, but it is expected to be a living document that is adjusted as needed over time.</p>
