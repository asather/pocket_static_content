<h1>Here's a list of black-owned restaurants in Pittsburgh you should try </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh has a national reputation for good eats and it was no surprise when it was named top American food city for 2019 by San Francisco-based restaurant and hospitality consulting firm af&amp;co.</p>
<p>But a major part of the restaurant scene that may not always get recognition is the dozens of black-owned restaurants throughout the region — some of which have been staples in their communities for decades, while others are emerging with new, modern and inventive themes.</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette has compiled a list of black-owned restaurants that offer soul food, barbecue, cultural cuisine, breakfast specials, traditional American meals, coffee, specialty teas, desserts and more. We hope to continue to add to this list as more black-owned food spots emerge, so please feel free to send any restaurants you feel we missed to <em>ajohnson@post-gazette.com</em>.</p>
