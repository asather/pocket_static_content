<h1>Arts Council expands Emergency Fund for Artists to include COVID-19 disruption</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Arts Council is expanding the Emergency Fund for Artists in response to the impact of COVID-19 on the arts community,</p>
<p>Originally created for specific emergencies, such as fire or theft, that have disrupted artistic practice, the application guidelines now allow for coverage up to $500 in loss of income due to the coronavirus cancellations and closings.</p>
<p>The scope of the fund reaches to artists in Allegheny, Beaver, Butler, Washington, Lawrence, Indiana, Greene, Fayette, Washington and Westmoreland counties. There are no deadlines to apply, and funding "is determined according to the individualâ€™s need and according to each specific case." Applications will be reviewed anonymously, by an advisory committee that includes professionals in emergency response, health, social services and the arts.</p>
<p>Eligible artists can find the application form and view full guidelines at the GPAC website, <a href="https://www.pittsburghartscouncil.org/" target="_blank">www.pittsburghartscouncil.org</a>.&nbsp;Distribution is limited due to the original purpose of the Emergency Fund. Donations can be made directly to the Emergency Fund for Artists at <a href="/PittsburghArtsCouncil.org/support-effa" target="_blank">PittsburghArtsCouncil.org/support-effa</a>.</p>
