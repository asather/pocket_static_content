<h1>North Side helicopter traffic related to film production </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Helicopter traffic on the North Side is part of the filming of the Netflix movie,&nbsp;“<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2019/12/20/Oscar-winner-Marisa-Tomei-Jason-Momoa-Pittsburgh-filmed-Sweet-Girl-Netflix/stories/201912200117" target="_blank">Sweet Girl</a>,” and also involves the closing of some roadways, although that information wasn’t available Sunday evening, said City Police spokesman Chris Togneri.</p>
<p>However, two streets were closed throughout the evening — the 10th Street Bypass and a portion of Fort Duquesne Boulevard.</p>
<p>The Netflix revenge drama, led by Jason Momoa, stars Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei, whose credits include “My Cousin Vinny,” “The Wrestler” and Aunt May in “Spider-Man: Far From Home,” the Post-Gazette reported Dec. 20.</p>
<p>“Sweet Girl” is among the movies that have been filming around town, along with “I'm Your Woman,” starring Rachel Brosnahan (“The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel”).</p>
