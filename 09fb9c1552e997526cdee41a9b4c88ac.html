<h1>WPIAL Class 6A roundup: North Allegheny roars back against Penn Hills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After it looked as if neither team would have a game the first week of the season, WPIAL Class 6A member North Allegheny defeated Class 5Aâ€™s Penn Hills, 27-6, Friday night.</p>
<p>Both teams had their initial opponents pull out of their matchups due to COVID-19 concerns. North Allegheny was scheduled to play Seneca Valley, while Penn Hills was going up against Kiski Area.</p>
<p>Penn Hills scored first Friday, on a 22-yard strike from Julian Dugger to his brother Jaden Dugger. It was all North Allegheny from there, as the Tigers scored four unanswered touchdowns. Mason Kress, J.R. Burton and Tanner Potts each scored a rushing touchdown. Sean Metcalf returned an interception 25 yards for another score.</p>
