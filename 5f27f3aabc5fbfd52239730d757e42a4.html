<h1>Some colleges, universities planning virtual ceremonies; others delaying them until fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With some high-tech planning and old-fashioned luck, West Virginia University leaders hope to pull off a celebration next month that gives spring graduates at least a hint of how their college commencement should feel.</p>
<p>The school’s gold and blue colors will be front and center, no doubt, and regalia will be worn. Selfies will be snapped and shared on social media by proud young adults celebrating a milestone.</p>

<p>Of course, none of that will happen inside the WVU Coliseum or other venues that normally host the university’s 16 ceremonies. The halls might well be empty, since the whole event will be conducted online.</p>
<p>For millions of college students in the Class of 2020, a pandemic that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/17/college-dorm-residence-refunds-coronavirus-COVID19-Pitt-Duquesne-Penn-State-Carnegie-Mellon/stories/202003170082" target="_blank">already stole their parting weeks on campus with friends</a> seems poised to deliver one last cruel blow: reordering what it means to “cross the stage” and pick up a degree.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But schools nationally and in Pennsylvania are trying to minimize stinging disappointment felt by what some have dubbed “the corona class,” a reference to COVID-19 <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/11/Penn-State-CMU-University-of-Pittsburgh-COVID19-coronavirus-classes-online-health-spring-break/stories/202003110126" target="_blank">that drove spring classes online</a> and sent students home. For weeks, campuses have puzzled over how best to rethink graduation, settling on varied approaches that continue to evolve.</p>
<p>Along with WVU’s May 16 virtual celebration, <a href="https://presidentgee.wvu.edu/messages/wvu-announces-plans-for-commencement" target="_blank">named “Mountaineer Graduation Day,”</a>&nbsp;campus officials will host graduates on Dec. 19 for an in-person ceremony, saying they deserve to experience the real thing.</p>
<p>“I will be there ready to give each and every one of you the biggest hug possible,” E. Gordon Gee, WVU’s president, promised them <a href="https://presidentgee.wvu.edu/messages/wvu-announces-plans-for-commencement" target="_blank">in a note outlining </a>the school’s plans.</p>
<p>Other large public institutions such as the<a href="https://www.commencement.pitt.edu/" target="_blank"> University of Pittsburgh</a>, <a href="https://www.commencement.psu.edu/" target="_blank">Penn State University</a>, <a href="https://www.kent.edu/commencement" target="_blank">Kent State University</a> and the <a href="https://commencement.umich.edu/" target="_blank">University of Michigan</a> have postponed their ceremonies and will decide later when to reschedule.</p>
<p>Small private campuses like <a href="https://www.laroche.edu/commencement/" target="_blank">La Roche</a> and <a href="https://www.chatham.edu/academics/academic-calendar/commencement.html" target="_blank">Chatham</a> universities are wrestling, too, with how to replace now-postponed events. Among schools that already have rescheduled in-person ceremonies,&nbsp; August and December are top picks, though some schools are inviting graduates to walk in future years’ ceremonies.</p>
<p>Then there’s Purdue University and what officials on the West Lafayette, Ind. campus are calling their <a href="https://www.purdue.edu/commencement/" target="_blank">“on-demand commencement.”</a></p>
<p>Students already sent home to slow the virus’s spread will receive a mailing with a diploma cover, commencement program, any honor cord they earned, along with instructions on how to download a digital event they can watch with their families at their convenience.</p>
<p>To make it feel more real, recorded performances by Purdue Bands and other musical organizations will play, and students can select virtual campus backgrounds for their keepsake photos. Graduates “will hear their names called, hold their diplomas in their hands, wear a cap and gown,” the school said in announcing the idea.</p>
<p><strong>Short of the mark</strong></p>
<p>Still, crushing disappointment isn’t easily soothed. To some, remote&nbsp;ceremonies fall well short of the mark.</p>
<p>That’s clear from online petitions that have sprouted in Ohio, New Jersey, California and other states, including one for students, parents and alumni from WVU.</p>
<p>“Walking across that stage was one of the best moments I had at WVU and signing Country Roads will be something I cherish forever,” wrote Amanda Gerhard, who signed a petition to discourage WVU from forgoing its in-person commencement altogether.</p>
<p>Backlash over a <a href="https://www.commencement.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">March 18 decision by the University of California at Los Angeles </a>to hold a virtual commencement led the school the next day to step back and rethink its approach. Chancellor Gene Block apologized and said “we should have listened first” to students and parents.</p>
<p>One of those dissenting voices was Tara Ostad, organizer of an online petition that drew more than 10,000 signatures.”We did not work this hard to have an online graduation,” she said.</p>
<p>Promising to hold an in-person commencement in the fall, and a virtual celebration in the meantime,&nbsp; <a href="https://duq.edu/academics/university-registrar/graduation/commencement" target="_blank">Duquesne University president Ken Gormley</a> said nothing can replace an in-person ceremony.</p>
<p>“We just won’t be able to do that on May 8.”</p>
<p>Such sentiments do not surprise Karen Whitney, president emerita of Clarion University whose 40 years in higher education include service as interim chancellor of Pennsylvania’s state university system. She’s seen, year after year, the emotional sway commencement holds for students, families, faculty and administrators.</p>
<p>That said, there may well be “amazing examples of creativity and ingenuity [allowing] colleges to find a way to have that celebratory moment,” she said.&nbsp;“Given that this generation is so creative, there may be students who virtually create their own commencement.”</p>
<p>In recent days, Edinboro University surveyed 650 undergraduate and graduate students due to finish this spring. The 547 responses prompted rescheduling the event to sometime this fall.</p>
<p>“Nearly, 76 percent of respondents voted for an in-person ceremony, even though it will be delayed,” President Guiyou Huang told the Class of 2020 by email last week.</p>
<p>It’s probably no surprise that the Internet figures prominently in fallback plans announced by technology powerhouses like Carnegie Mellon University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Carnegie Mellon, a few years back, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2017/05/17/Tepperbot-3000-CMU-graduation-robotics/stories/201705160149" target="_blank">sent robots to “walk” in place of two business graduates</a> who could not attend commencement.</p>
<p>Virtual events are planned for a <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/commencement/" target="_blank">yet-to-be-announced date for Carnegie Mellon</a> and for <a href="https://commencement.mit.edu/" target="_blank">May 29 by MIT.</a> They will be followed up by future in-person events.</p>
<p>In a campus note,&nbsp; MIT president L. Rafael Reif, a Venezuelan-American who grew up Caracas, said he empathizes with this year’s degree candidates.</p>
<p>“The day before I was set to graduate from my Caracas high school, the city suffered a major earthquake. Buildings collapsed. There were serious casualties. Suddenly, it was impossible, physically and emotionally, to hold the traditional graduation ceremony we had all been counting on,” <a href="https://covid19.mit.edu/update-on-commencement-reunions-and-community" target="_blank">he wrote to degree candidates a week or so back</a>. “I still remember the pain and disappointment.”</p>
<p>Angst in large doses could await schools with fallback events set for August, should health advisories, stay-at-home orders and other restrictions persist well into summer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;West Virginia’s Bethany College <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/30/Bethany-College-commencement-postpone-graduation-reschedule-university-COVID-19/stories/202003300122" target="_blank">plans a May 9 online degree conferral</a>, followed by an Aug. 20 commencement ceremony timed to the start of the new academic year.</p>
<p>Washington and Jefferson College <a href="https://www.washjeff.edu/event/commencement/" target="_blank">intends to move events planned for May</a> to the weekend of July 31-Aug. 1.</p>
<p>“These plans are still tentative, and are based on whether large group meetings will be allowed at that time,” said spokeswoman Erin Jones.</p>
<p>Given that nearly a third of Bloomsburg University’s enrollment consists of first-generation students, officials decided that an in-person ceremony would be especially important to families, said Thomas McGuire, spokesman for the school belonging to the State System of Higher Education. <a href="https://intranet.bloomu.edu/graduation/live" target="_blank">Plans are in motion for an event the weekend of Aug. 7-9.</a></p>
<p>Other Western Pennsylvania State System schools that have announced changes include <a href="https://www.clarion.edu/academics/registrars-office/commencement/" target="_blank">Clarion</a> and <a href="https://www.sru.edu/events/commencement" target="_blank">Slippery Rock Universities</a>, which as of last week had not set replacement dates. Indiana University of Pennsylvania plans an in-person event in the fall, <a href="https://www.iup.edu/news-item.aspx?id=283840&amp;blogid=6121" target="_blank">president Michael Driscoll said.</a></p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/coronavirus?utm_source=widget&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_campaign=banner" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-landing-page-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click for more coverage"> </a></p>
<p>At WVU, 4,700 students had filled out their graduation applications for the university’s 150th Commencement, spokeswoman April Kaull said.</p>
<p>Planning so far calls for live and prerecorded elements, including social media in real time. In a spring that has pushed higher education to embrace remote instruction as never before, it may be no surprise that the commencement lawn has gotten a nudge, too.</p>
<p>“This will be an entirely virtual event,” Ms. Kaull said. “No brick and mortar venue involved.”</p>
