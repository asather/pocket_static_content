<h1>Review: A musicologist calls for a ban on Beethoven and the Pittsburgh Symphony performs Beethoven's "Fidelio"</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 250th anniversary of Beethoven’s birth falls in December this year, and orchestras around the world are celebrating by programming his complete symphonies and his oratorical works and concertos in spades.&nbsp;Amidst the frenzy, musicologist <a href="https://www.smith.edu/academics/faculty/andrea-moore" target="_blank">Andrea Moore</a> of Smith College recently published <a href="https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-ban-beethoven-anniversary-20191230-ukklfgb25baaxcjjiddm3ud76y-story.html" target="_blank">an opinion essay in the Chicago Tribune</a> arguing for a one-year moratorium on Beethoven’s works in favor of programming newer, more forward thinking music to honor the composer’s legacy.</p>
<p>On its face this seems like a ridiculous argument. Beethoven wrote enduring, capital-G “Great” music that still brings bodies into halls, and why not celebrate his birthday? Then again, Ms. Moore writes;&nbsp;“Letting Beethoven’s music fall silent for the duration of his 250th anniversary year might give us a new way into hearing it live again,” adding that organizations already frequently program those composers that have publicly celebrated birthdays. This is obviously true — In Pittsburgh we’ve heard Beethoven’s third symphony as well as the ninth, the fifth, all five of the piano concertos and more in the previous two years alone.</p>
<p>Program space is finite. While removing Beethoven’s music altogether is draconian, questioning the opportunity cost seems reasonable. In programming so much Beethoven, what are listeners potentially missing out on?</p>
<p>It’s a thought-provoking question, especially in light of performances such as the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra’s Friday Fidelio in Heinz Hall, when PSO&nbsp;music director Manfred Honeck led the orchestra along with several vocal soloists and the intrepid Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh in a concert version of “Fidelio,” Beethoven’s only opera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The quality of artistry was first-rate, another demonstration of Mr. Honeck’s ability to marshal massive musical forces with sensitivity, blending voices into the sound of the orchestra as additional instruments rather than simply setting up a traditional “solo and accompaniment” sort of balance. Don Marinelli, formerly a professor of drama and arts management at Carnegie Mellon University, narrated in English between arias, piecing together the tale of a wife entering a prison in disguise to rescue her husband as the libretto and score celebrate virtue, love and loyalty in the face of corruption and adversity.</p>
<p>Baritone Brian Mulligan in particular distinguished himself as the villainous Don Pizarro, delivering powerful melodies with malevolent passion. Another standout, soprano Nicole Chevalier proved a sensitive protagonist as Leonore/Fidelio, spinning a rich, poignant tone straight to the back of the hall. Wei Wu, a bass, proved yet another bright spot as the jailer Rocco, providing the concert’s only bits of humor alongside an inimitable David Portillo, his assistant.</p>
<p>Orchestra and choir were wonderfully matched, especially in the first act when a group prisoners are allowed into the sunlight for a moment. Here was a transcendent moment — transparent, gossamer strings blending seamlessly with the choir’s hushed, hopeful tones. True the finale was rousing and triumphant, but for my money that scene in the first act moment was far and away the most memorable part of the evening.</p>
<p>As for the work itself, Beethoven revised “Fidelio” twice after an unsuccessful premiere in 1805, first in 1806 and again in 1814. While the 1814 version was the most successful version historically and is the most commonly heard today, Mr. Honeck elected to use the 1806 edition. No reason is given in the program for using the 1806 version this weekend, but in an interview available on WQED, Mr. Honeck said he considered all three versions masterpieces and that the 1806 had never been performed in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Part of the genius of Beethoven is his contribution to pushing the field of classical music into what we still recognize as a meaningful form of artistic expression. Spending a year pushing music in new directions as Ms. Moore suggests in her essay would be an inflammatory way to honor that legacy, and it’s neither advisable nor feasible for large institutions.</p>
<p>My personal opinion: dropping Beethoven altogether would be drastic, but I’d certainly welcome a little less Beethoven in favor of not stifling music by wonderful composers we don’t hear as often, particularly by those still breathing. MacMillan. Bates. Vali. Wolfe. Bartok. Mendelssohn. MacMillan. Grieg. Kabalevsky. Hindemith. Saint-Saens. A mixed bag composers that have also appeared briefly in recent PSO programs, but comparatively are rarely heard. Let’s tip that scale.</p>
