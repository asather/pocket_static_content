<p>Here are the details, as announced in a release on the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board website:</p>
<p><em>Curbside pickup orders will be limited to one order of no more than six bottles. Only one order will be accepted per caller, per store, per day. Callers will be guided by store staff through products available to purchase at each location. Payment by credit card will be required by phone, and all curbside pickup sales are final (no returns).</em></p>
<p>“Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits is making strides in expanding service to our customers,” the release said. “We ask you to remain patient if you don’t get through by phone right away. We’re optimistic our capacity to fulfill orders through our website and curbside pickup will increase in the coming weeks.”</p>
<p>Reached Saturday night, a PLCB spokesperson declined to comment.</p>
