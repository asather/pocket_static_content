<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday is expected to announce the broad outlines of his administration’s requirements for relaxing coronavirus restrictions on businesses and residents in Pennsylvania, officials said.</p>
<p>But it is unlikely that the governor, who is <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/live/" target="_blank">scheduled</a> to make the announcement at 2 p.m., will provide a specific timeline for reopening the state.</p>
<p>Rather, he is expected to advocate for taking a regional approach toward opening certain business and industry sectors, with a requirement that hospitals and health systems in those areas have adequate bed space and personal protective equipment.</p>
<p>He is also expected to push certain stringent standards that businesses must meet before they reopen in those areas, including the ability to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for monitoring employees for illness and sanitizing shared workspaces. Widespread testing would also have to be available.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Wolf told reporters that he had not yet made a decision on whether to extend the stay-at-home order for residents past April 30. He has also cautioned against a swift return of employees to workplaces. Earlier this month, he announced that schools will remain closed through the end of the academic school year.</p>
<p>Federal guidelines call for a phased reopening of states. The White House has provided a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/" target="_blank">guide</a> recommending that states wait until they report a downward trajectory of documented COVID-19 cases, or a downward trajectory of positive tests as a percent of total tests, within a 14-day period.</p>
<p>The guide also calls for the ability to both conduct robust testing and treat all patients “without crisis care.” At the moment, Pennsylvania <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/04/pennsylvania-coronavirus-testing-antibodies-undetected-availability/" target="_blank">lacks the testing capability</a> experts say is needed to safely reopen the state.</p>
<p>Once those benchmarks have been met, states can begin to reopen in phases, with vulnerable populations continuing to shelter at home during the first phase while everyone else avoids social gatherings of more than 10 people. Employers should also encourage teleworking during this phase.</p>
