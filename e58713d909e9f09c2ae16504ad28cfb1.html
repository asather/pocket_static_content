<h1>Police issue arrest warrant for man involved in Brookline shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An arrest warrant has been issued for a 44-year-old man who police say shot a man following a verbal dispute Sunday in Brookline.</p>
<p>An unidentified man was hospitalized in stable condition Sunday after he was shot, according to police. Authorities responded around 12:15 p.m. that day to the 900 block of Norwich Avenue and found the man with&nbsp;at least one gunshot wound to the left groin area, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>Edward Phillips, 44, is charged with two felony counts of aggravated assault, carrying a firearm without a license, recklessly endangering another person and driving with a suspended license. The Brookline man is&nbsp;a convicted felon on prior drug charges, court records show.</p>
<p>Sundayâ€™s shooting happened shortly after an argument between Phillips and the victim, police said in the criminal complaint. Witnesses told police they saw Phillips leaning inside a car that was parked on the street in the neighborhood. The victim walked up to Phillips and asked him what he was doing, according to the complaint. An argument ensued, and the victim turned around to walk away, police said.</p>
<p>That's when Phillips spit on the back of the man's head before shooting him, witnesses told police.</p>
<p>Phillips allegedly fled the scene in a white Chevrolet Impala with a temporary registration sticker in the rear window. He was last seen leaving on Queensboro Street, the criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>As of Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Phillips was not in custody.</p>
