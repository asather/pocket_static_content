<h1>Jameson Taillon: ‘Our guys are genuinely excited to return’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The return of baseball this summer hinges on players agreeing to a specific set of health and safety protocols and their willingness/ability to report for spring training 2.0 by July 1.</p>
<p>Neither appear to be problematic for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Jameson Taillon, the Pirates’ union representative for the Major League Baseball Players Association, said he and his teammates can’t wait to get going again, even if it's technically for a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/22/mlb-mlbpa-negotiations-rob-manfred-season-implementation/stories/202006220104" target="_blank">60-game season</a> that was implemented by commissioner Rob Manfred.</p>
<p>“Our guys will be really fired up to get back together and to get back to doing what we love,” Taillon told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette via text message. “It’s time for us to get back on the field and to get back to representing Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We’re committed to returning to play in this new environment and excited to do so.”</p>
<p>This hasn’t been an easy time for Taillon, the Pirates or baseball as a whole.</p>
<p>It’s gotten ugly on side sides, and Taillon, in his position, has seen this thing play out plenty on Twitter. He has even reacted to a few things, often sticking up for his fellow players.</p>
<p>“It’s too bad that the majority of these negotiations played out on social media, and it’s something that will need to be addressed and cleaned up going forward,” Taillon said. “It was extremely tone deaf and untimely.”</p>
<p>Spring training 2.0 will be held in Pittsburgh. After three weeks, it looks like opening day will be the weekend of July 24. For Taillon, it can’t come soon enough.</p>
<p>“We weren’t able to agree. That’s OK. We move on,” Taillon said. “Players are professionals and can separate the business side and their love for the game and competing. And I can promise our guys are genuinely excited to return.”</p>
