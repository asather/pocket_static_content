<h1>Penn State reports eight positive COVID-19 tests among athletes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penn State athletic department announced on Wednesday that eight athletes have tested positive for COVID-19 as part of their return to campus protocol, with 66 test results pending.</p>
<p>The tests results are through July 24, and Penn State said it has conducted 466 total tests since athletes started to return to campus in June.&nbsp;The school has updated the public on athlete testing on a bi-weekly basis since last month, with the next update scheduled for Aug. 12.</p>
<p>Last week, Penn State confirmed its first positive test among athletes after the Pennsylvania Department of Health reported a positive case in the 16802 zip code, where University Park is.&nbsp;The university didn’t say the sport any of the athletes who tested positive play.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our student-athletes, coaches, staff and the broader community are of the utmost importance,” the university said via email last week. “Therefore, as part of the protocols established in return to campus plan by the Penn State Athletics medical staff and consultation with University, local and national officials and guidelines, individuals with a positive test have been put into isolation for 14 days and will be retested at that point.</p>
<p>“In addition to isolation, contact tracing procedures have been implemented, including quarantine and testing for those individuals who might have been exposed, even if asymptomatic.”</p>
<p>The athletic department stressed Wednesday the expectation that athletes continue to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines,&nbsp;“including wearing masks, practicing social distancing, washing their hands regularly and not gathering in large groups.”</p>
