<h1>'Working blind': How a COVID-altered recruiting cycle could affect Pitt, 2021 prospects</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rutgers has a top-20 recruiting class.&nbsp;Yes, the Scarlet Knights, who have 13 wins the last five years, also have 21 high school prospects verbally committed to sign and play for them in 2021. Let that sink in.</p>
<p>COVID-19 has thrown everything out of whack the last few months. The 2021 recruiting cycle, for Pitt and all of college football, is no different.</p>
<p>During the coronavirus shutdown, a recruiting dead period has been in place. Prospects can talk with coaches. They can go on Zoom tours, chat about the playbook, build relationships. They just can’t meet in-person. Camps were canceled and, until at least July 31, rising seniors are barred from visiting campus.</p>
<p>They’re committing anyway.</p>
<p>Pitt’s 2021 class grew to 16 members when two defensive backs picked the Panthers on June 5. Go back to June 5, 2019, and you’ll see Pat Narduzzi and his staff had just three commits in the 2020 class. On June 5, 2018, Pitt had zero in the 2019 class.</p>
<p>The Panthers aren’t alone in experiencing this commitment boom. As of May 6, there were 627 recruits across the Football Bowl Subdivision who were committed in the 2021 class. As of May 6 of last year, there were 302 committed recruits in the 2020 class, per 247 Sports. This major bump is happening nationwide — and it might lead to more than a few players and coaches reneging on their commitments.</p>
<p>“Anybody that tells you that they know for sure is lying. We’ve never seen this before,” said Brian Dohn, a national recruiting analyst for 247 Sports. “But the feeling is, we’re going to be in line for more decommitments.”</p>
<p>Fittingly, the 2021 cycle has been labeled “the year of the decommit” by many in the recruiting business. Mike Farrell, the national recruiting director for Rivals.com, believes those decommitments aren’t a matter of if, but when.</p>
<p>Once the dead period is lifted and visits are allowed, prospects who committed to schools they’ve never been to before might not like the campus or the vibe the coaching staff gives off. Feelings may change, too, if those prospects visit other schools. Right now, though, 2021 recruits are “working blind,” Farrell said.</p>
<p>“If you’re visiting Pitt, you’re going to visit maybe West Virginia or swing over to Penn State or over to Ohio State. And you’ll hear different things and get a feel for the process and what’s legit and what’s not,” Farrell added. “But being isolated like this, it just changes your perspective as a recruit. You have to believe coaches when they say, ‘Hey, you better jump on this now.’ Because you just don’t know if you’re going to have a football season, if you’re going to get back out there to visit, if you’re going to have an offer in the fall. A lot of that is really up in the air.”</p>
<p>Assuming those “up in the air” issues get resolved and the dead period is eventually lifted, prospects will have decisions to make.</p>
<p>Nate Yarnell, a three-star quarterback commit in Pitt’s 2021 class, said he doesn’t plan on visiting any other schools and that he’s “super committed” to the Panthers. But, as a Texan who’s never been to Pittsburgh before, he understands it’s important to visit before signing a national letter of intent.</p>
<p>Brandon Honorable, a fellow 2021 Pitt commit and three-star offensive lineman from Detroit, agreed with Yarnell. The 6-foot-7 blocker even added that he can see why prospects might choose a different program later on given the circumstances.</p>
<p>“My guys in the 2021 class, I feel like everyone’s committed to Pitt. They’re not going to leave,” Honorable said. “But I can understand why some players would decommit. Right now, all you can really do is Zoom virtual visits. ... So I can understand where they’re coming from.”</p>
<p>Those missed visits affect more than players’ choices, too. They affect the coaches to whom they’re committing.</p>
<p>Due to COVID-19, coaches have missed an entire spring and summer evaluation period. Typically, programs will host prospects at camps in May, June and July, making sure recruits are as athletic as they look on film and as tall and big as they said they were. More often than not, coaches won’t take a prospect until they verify speed, weight and other tangibles at a camp before their senior year.</p>
<p>In order to lock in spots and not be left scrambling later on, coaches have offered scholarships even without that evaluation period. But there will be some current commits whose programs will no longer want them come the fall, once there are opportunities to assess high school games and practices in person and see what they really have to offer.</p>
<p>Farrell called not having spring and summer evaluation periods “an absolute nightmare” for college coaches. “Scouting is so personal,” Farrell added. “Coaches rely on it more than people think.”</p>
<p>Some prospects rely on it, as well.</p>
<p>Summer camps are often where fringe scholarship candidates make or break their chances. Perform well, and you might be pulled into a coach’s office and get an offer. Even future walk-ons can have productive camp performances and garner attention.</p>
<p>Take Pitt center Jimmy Morrissey, for example. In June 2015, Morrissey was noticed at a camp at Pitt’s South Side facility. He dominated a group of players who weren’t invited, like himself, and more than held his own among the invited prospects. He wasn’t offered a scholarship, but later accepted a preferred walk-on role, one awarded based on his surprise showing.</p>
<p>Morrissey, a 2019 first-team All-ACC center, wouldn’t have been a Panther if not for that camp. Without evaluation periods this summer, there’s a chance Pitt and other Power Five programs will miss out on their next Morrissey.</p>
<p>Of course, having a staff with deep roots to lean on helps fill in the gaps. Pitt defensive line coach and former Florida Atlantic head coach Charlie Partridge picked up another Sunshine State commit in April. Defensive backs coach Archie Collins, a Detroit native, pulled in a pair of Motor City linemen in May. And Chris Beatty, Pitt’s wide receivers coach and a former Virginia high school coach, secured three commits from the Tidewater region since the quarantine period started.</p>
<p>Dohn said the coaches’ connections in those areas have been crucial to building a class ranked in the top 20 nationally. Still, when the dead period ends, Pitt’s staff will have to work to not only keep its class together, but also add more members.</p>
<p>Though Yarnell and Honorable expressed optimism, it’s difficult to say how exactly a potential decommitment spree might affect Pitt — and what imprint this COVID-affected cycle will leave on the college football landscape in the years ahead.</p>
