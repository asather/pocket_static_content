<p>In a living room littered with beer cans, a young man shouts “Nolan, breathe for me buddy!” while performing CPR on a motionless peer. As he gives chest compressions, the man repeats frantically, “1-2-3.”</p>
<p>But the effort to save Nolan Burch, 18, ultimately fails.</p>
<p>During the 34 minutes that follow, viewers of the documentary “Breathe, Nolan, Breathe” get an excruciatingly close-up look at one more alcohol-drenched fraternity hazing death, this one from West Virginia University five years ago. It spawned criminal charges at the time, a lawsuit and now a campaign that will greet thousands of WVU students who return Monday for spring semester classes.</p>
<p>Images of the Kappa Sigma pledge lying nearly lifeless on a wooden plank that November night —&nbsp;kicked by one bystander, photographed by another —&nbsp;are not a re-enactment. They are real, as is the videotaped police interrogation of peers who must live with knowing the freshman from Williamsville, N.Y., near Buffalo, might be alive had someone in the fraternity house summoned help sooner.</p>
<p>The campaign’s title,&nbsp;<a href="https://safety.wvu.edu/would-you" target="_blank">“Would you?”</a> asks students if they would do what’s needed to help someone in crisis, even dial 911, rather than stand idly by. A university that in recent years rewrote its Greek policies, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2018/09/27/With-a-heavy-heart-WVU-president-bans-fraternities-who-broke-away-from-university/stories/201809270210" target="_blank">banished individual chapters</a> and saw five fraternities break away in protest, is trying another approach, working with Mr. Burch’s parents who had sued WVU, and with the foundation that the couple created after their son’s death.</p>
<p>The campaign’s most obvious aim is to stop hazing and alcohol abuse, and to call attention to amnesty law in West Virginia that lets people seek emergency aid for someone without penalty —&nbsp;even if they, themselves, were drinking.</p>
<p>“No one should fear the consequences of calling for help,” WVU president E. Gordon Gee said.</p>
<p>But more broadly, officials said they want to encourage students to intervene if someone is in emotional or academic trouble, or is being sexually assaulted.</p>
<p>The safety campaign will employ social media messages, print posters and leadership training for fraternity members and for others, including the 5,000 or so freshmen arriving each fall.</p>
<p>College populations are transient, so sustaining the message will be hard, said Corey Farris, WVU dean of students. But he’s hopeful.</p>
<p>“To me, reasonable success will be if we have fewer reports of things like this taking place, if people are getting to the emergency room, to crisis counselors because they’re suicidal, and if there are fewer sexual assaults,” he said.</p>
<p>“Will this be a turning point? I hope so,” he said of the campaign. “But if it isn’t, then we’ll try something else.”</p>
<p>The documentary premiered in November a few weeks before final exams, with Nolan’s parents sitting among the audience inside The Mountainlair student union.</p>
<p>The film focuses on small decisions that could have changed the outcome, and was the brainchild of Daniel Catullo III, a WVU alumnus who is CEO and founder of&nbsp;<a href="/%20breathenolanbreathe.com" target="_blank">City Drive Studios</a> located in New York and Los Angeles.</p>
<p>Mr. Catullo, himself a fraternity brother in college, saw media coverage and reached out to Nolan’s parents who were willing to participate. “To allow me to put that out there for the world to see, it took a lot of guts,” he said.</p>
<p>It felt almost numbing, watching the horrific last hours of their son’s life, said Nolan’s father, T.J. Burch, but the couple decided there was no other choice. “It’s the only way things are going to change,” he said in an interview Thursday.</p>
<p><strong>Nolan M. Burch</strong></p>
<p>Nolan M. Burch enrolled at WVU as a freshman pre-sports management major in fall 2014.</p>
<p>That semester, he pledged Kappa Sigma, an unsanctioned chapter and participated in a hazing event on Nov. 12. It included being blindfolded and brought to a location where the teen who weighed 140 pounds was to chug a bottle of 100-proof bourbon, what would be the equivalent of downing 17 mixed drinks.</p>
<p>Suffering from alcohol poisoning, he was carried back to the living room and left for an hour before 911 was called, according to the university.&nbsp;His blood-alcohol level, at 0.493, was six times the legal limit for a motorist in West Virginia, according to the NMB Foundation.</p>
<p>Nolan was removed from life support and died on Nov. 14. His lungs, kidneys and liver were donated to four individuals, including one now enrolled at WVU.</p>
<p>In the documentary, Nolan’s mother, Kim, recalls the start of the family’s unending nightmare: a series of phone calls to their home after midnight —&nbsp;ones she initially did not answer. “I don’t know why,” she said.</p>
<p>Once she did, the couple learned that they needed to get to the emergency room at Ruby Memorial Hospital in Morgantown. Once there, a physician’s face said it all.</p>
<p>“When a doctor meets you and he’s crying, that’s not good,” Nolan’s mother said.</p>
<p>As the parents describe their devastation in the film, images appear of a family day at the beach, of Nolan’s dad playing piano with his toddler son, and of Kim in 1996 gently stroking the feet of her newborn in the delivery ward.</p>
<p>“As a mother you’re supposed to protect your kids, and to think he was laying there, and I wasn’t with him, to think I couldn’t protect him from what they did to him,” she said, her voice cracking. “I would have taken his spot in a second.”</p>
<p>Hospital staff said that if he received help earlier he could have survived.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If one person had made a call. One,” she said. “We’d have our son.”</p>
<p>She and her husband said they don’t understand how others could find Nolan’s loss of bodily function control, and the fact he soiled himself, to be humorous rather than a sign he was in mortal danger.</p>
<p>His death is a void they can not fill.</p>
<p>“He’s gone, and he’s never coming back,” his dad said.</p>
<p>“I lost my only son. I don’t have anybody to carry on the name or to do whatever, I don’t have a little boy.”</p>
<p>Think of the worst possible nightmare, he added, “then go 20 times beyond that. That’s what it feels like.”</p>
<p><strong>Anti-hazing debate</strong></p>
<p>Every year for six decades, at least one school, club or organization has reported a hazing death, according an unofficial count by <a href="http://www.hanknuwer.com/hazing-deaths/" target="_blank">Hank Nuwer, a professor at Franklin College</a> in Indiana who writes extensively about hazing deaths.</p>
<p>Three years after Nolan’s death, Penn State sophomore <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2018/02/01/Penn-State-University-Timothy-Piazza-fraternities-hazing-drinking-Greek-life-colleges-Pennsylvania/stories/201802010245" target="_blank">Timothy Piazza died after a night of alcohol and hazing.</a> He waited hours before help was summoned. It led to a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2019/01/15/Penn-State-hazing-Timothy-Piazza-law-fraternities-sororities-college-Pitt-Duquesne-CMU/stories/201901150176" target="_blank">Pennsylvania anti-hazing law</a>&nbsp;that requires universities to report such incidents.</p>
<p>At WVU, administrators overhauled its Greek system after Nolan’s death. Things improved, but renewed problems in 2017 led to a moratorium in 2018 on social and recruiting activities and a campus review.</p>
<p>Chapters that dissociated from WVU said their<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/2018/09/28/west-virginia-university-and-fraternity-and-Gee-and-Sigma-Chi-Greek/stories/201809280148" target="_blank"> due process rights</a> were being violated.</p>
<p>But officials said deferring rush until spring of students’ freshman year and other moves helped boost average grades for the Greek system from 2.89 in 2015 to 3.06 —&nbsp;above the overall university average.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the debate nationally continues with Congress eyeing anti-hazing moves of its own.</p>
<p>In the documentary, Bob Roberts, who was WVU police chief when Nolan died, said hazing’s toll nationally is all the harder to take because the loss of life simply makes no sense.</p>
<p>“What happens is you get young people and alcohol and stupidity takes over,” he said.</p>
<p>“You can’t always cure stupid.”</p>
