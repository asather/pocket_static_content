<h1>Gov. Wolf endorses former Vice President Joe Biden for president</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Deeming him a “steady” leader who can help mend the country’s divides, Gov. Tom Wolf endorsed former Vice President Joe Biden for the presidency on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf, in a statement provided by the campaign, said he’s backing Mr. Biden because during times of insecurity, fear and uncertainty, “we need leadership in the White House that we can look to for calm and guidance.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania “needs a partner in Washington,” the governor said, someone who will “navigate us through the long, arduous process of recovery.”</p>
<p>“I believe that Joe Biden is the strong, steady, leader who can best heal our deep divides and enact legislation to lift up all working Pennsylvanians,” Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden, the presumptive Democratic nominee who will take on Republican President Donald Trump in the November general election, appeared alongside Mr. Wolf in a virtual chat on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf described the “uncharted waters” that Pennsylvania is navigating as it fights the COVID-19 pandemic, and cited challenges of securing protective equipment and adequate testing capacity, among others.</p>
<p>But it “starts with leadership at the top,” Mr. Wolf said, insisting that Mr. Biden and former President Barack Obama exercised that leadership and “surrounded [themselves] with really good people.”</p>
<p>“We need that now —&nbsp;people who are going to be our partners in terms of dealing with the challenges we’re facing,” Mr. Wolf told Mr. Biden on the stream.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee responded to the endorsement by saying that Mr. Biden and his campaign “have already proven that they have a losing message with Pennsylvanians” —&nbsp;labeling his energy plan an “anti-energy agenda that would wreak havoc on Pennsylvania’s economy.”</p>
<p>The former Vice President has called for transitioning to a 100% clean energy economy by 2050, a process his campaign says will create jobs and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
<p>Mr. Biden’s views on the climate were cited in another endorsement he received on Wednesday, this one from the largest youth voter mobilization group in Pennsylvania: NextGen.</p>
<p>The group, which has said it plans to invest millions of dollars to register nearly 40,000 young voters here, praised Mr. Biden for listening to the concerns of young voters and offering “progressive solutions” that reflect their needs.</p>
