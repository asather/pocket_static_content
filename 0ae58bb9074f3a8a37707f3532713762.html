<h1>Pirates spring training: Fifth-starter competition takes shape</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>LAKELAND, Fla. — It’s looking more and more like Derek Holland will begin the regular season as the Pirates’ fifth starter, the same sort of thing Jordan Lyles experienced a season ago.</p>
<p>Holland’s start against the Tigers in a 4-1 Pirates loss at Joker Marchant Stadium on Tuesday was something of a mixed bag. He stuck out six and walked none, flashing pinpoint control at times.</p>
<p>But he also made three mistakes, all of which were hit over the fence. The homer Tigers first baseman C.J. Cron hit, Holland joked, might still be traveling.</p>
<p>The interesting part about Holland’s start was that it came an hour or so after Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk confirmed that Steven Brault <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/03/10/steven-brault-injury-update-pirates-opening-day/stories/202003100086" target="_blank">won’t be ready for the regular season</a> because of a left shoulder muscle strain.</p>
<p>Which means that, almost by default, Holland will more than likely win the job, edging out Chad Kuhl.</p>
<p>It’s stating the obvious, but the Pirates (3-14-2) will need the good version of Holland, the one that sort of showed up here.</p>
<p>The left-hander pitched into the sixth inning and allowed three earned runs on four hits, freezing Tigers hitters on each of his last three punchouts.</p>
<p>“Overall I thought [Tuesday] was outstanding,” Holland said. “It was a much better game than what the line said.”</p>
<p>At least the curveball — Holland’s biggest issue Tuesday — should be an easy fix.</p>
<p>Holland said he “guided” it, which is another way of saying he thought a little too much instead of trusting the feel. That’s not a fundamental, tear-it-up-and-start-over problem. Holland should be able to fix that rather quickly.</p>
<p>“To Cron, I was just trying to get that backdoor curveball and it leaked over the middle,” Holland said. “I don’t even know if it landed yet. He got a hold of it. You have to tip your hat. I’m trying to make sure that I’m working on the things that I need to work on to get to where I need to be.”</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Chris Stratton struggled with his command the last time out but fared better Tuesday. He worked 1 1/3 scoreless before giving way to Robbie Erlin. Each notched a strikeout.</p>
<p>Dovydas Neverauskas relieved Erlin in the eighth, walked the first batter he faced and gave up a double off the wall to Tigers shortstop Willi Castro.</p>
<p>Better command was pervasive for the Pirates, as Holland, Stratton, Erlin and Neverauskas combined to issue just one walk — by Neverauskas.</p>
<p>“I get upset about giving away free bases,” said Holland, who threw 62 pitches, 44 for strikes. “I thought [Tuesday] I was attacking the zone the way I needed to.”</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>J.T. Riddle continues to impress and rack up triples. Starting at third base, Riddle went 2-for-3 with a run scored. His triple to start the fifth inning led to the Pirates’ only run — Riddle scoring on Socrates Brito’s bloop single to right — and it was Riddle’s third of the spring.</p>
<p>Other than that, it was pretty quiet. Cole Tucker, who had struck out just twice all spring before Tuesday, whiffed in his first two at-bats. Colin Moran entered the game with seven hits (four for extra bases) in his last six games, but went 0-for-3.</p>
<p>Jose Osuna singled to lead off the sixth inning and moved to second on a wild pitch. However, Riddle lined a two-out shot to first that Cron snared.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>No errors or particularly difficult/spectacular plays for the Pirates. The most impressive thing might’ve been the synergy displayed between Holland and John Ryan Murphy.</p>
<p>Developing pitcher-catcher chemistry is not automatic, and Holland has been throwing a little to everyone thus far this spring.</p>
<p>“Great job by him game-calling-wise and being able to mix up and down, in and out,” Holland said.</p>
<p><strong>Up next</strong></p>

<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Pirates vs. Blue Jays, LECOM Park, Bradenton, Fla., 1:05 p.m.</p>
