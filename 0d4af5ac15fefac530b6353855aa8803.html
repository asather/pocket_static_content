<h1>Paul Zeise: Steelers are well positioned for year with limited workouts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mike Tomlin met Tuesday with Pittsburgh media for the first time since the NFL draft addressed myriad topics, from social justice to safety in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>On the football front, he talked about how much&nbsp;different the upcoming season will be in terms of how teams get prepared for it.</p>
<p>There won’t be live OTAs or minicamps, and preseason games are very much in question. Their training camp, taking place at Heinz Field instead of Saint Vincent College in Latrobe, will also be different and likely shorter, which will greatly affect the coaches’&nbsp;ability to make evaluations, install offenses and defenses and teach techniques in individual work.</p>
<p>That will hurt the rookies and the younger players who are trying to move up the depth chart and will likely have an effect on decision-making when it comes to rosters. This would be one of the worst years for teams who have a lot of questions and holes to fill. But the Steelers not one one of those teams, and that’s where they’ll have an edge over many in 2020.</p>
<p>The Steelers rank No. 5 in the NFL in “continuity,” according to ESPN.com. They return 82.4% of player snaps from last year. And that number would even be higher had Ben Roethlisberger played more than 1½ games.</p>
<p>Now, three of the teams ahead of the Steelers on that list are also in the AFC: the Bills (88%), Chiefs (84.7%) and the Colts (82.7%). But the Steelers have 23 total starters returning, both coordinators and 11 out of 13 assistant coaches. They are basically the same operation they were last year.</p>
<p>That doesn’t guarantee success or a Super Bowl run, but it is a great place to be. The Steelers have always thrived on continuity and stability, and this is an important part of why they have a chance to be successful this year.</p>
<p>The offensive line is a little troublesome. There were some leaks in it last year and now they have two holes to plug with some new faces. Alejandro Villanueva, David DeCastro and Maurkice Poincey also are all a year older.</p>
<p>In the salary cap era, though, those are minimal changes, and there are a number of teams who are trying to fill a bunch of holes. And as I’ve mentioned, those teams with a lot of rookies and younger players will be at a disadvantage because there isn’t as much time to teach. That’s not an exact science, but it’s a good guide.</p>
<p>Tomlin seems excited about the season, and he should be. He has a team that is capable of winning and competing for an AFC title. And the veteran presence throughout the coaching staff and roster means the Steelers are already ahead of the game.</p>
