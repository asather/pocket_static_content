<h1>Witness in Wilkinsburg mass shooting case said investigators paid him, used him as illegal informant </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A jailhouse witness who provided information used to charge Cheron Shelton and Robert Thomas for the 2016 <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/" target="_blank">Wilkinsburg mass shooting</a>&nbsp;claims investigators paid him and used him as an illegal informant.</p>
<p>Referred to in court documents as Witness No. 1, Kendall Mikell said he was used as an informant despite a court order that barred him from doing so, and he was given undocumented pay by county police and the district attorney’s office in exchange for providing information on the two men charged in the March 9, 2016, Wilkinsburg shooting that killed five people and one unborn child.</p>
<p>Court documents unsealed Wednesday show the prosecution rejected the claim that Mikell was provided undocumented payments for participating in the case against Shelton and Thomas, calling the claim “unfounded and frivolous.”</p>
<p>The district attorney's office paid Mikell $1,756 from its own witness relocation fund after he requested relocation in November 2016, court filings show.</p>
<p>"This was done to further protect the witness, even if the commonwealth did not use him, because of the number of cases he had participated in," the filing said.</p>
<p>Prosecutors didn’t call Mikell as a witness in the trial, but used conversations he had with Thomas and Shelton in jail to build a case against the two suspects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Mikell was arrested and sent to Allegheny County Jail in November 2016, police told him they would arrange for him to be sent directly next to Shelton so he could attempt to extract information, Mikell said. He bypassed all of the usual steps in processing and was sent almost immediately to the cell beside Shelton.</p>
<p>“From intake, they made it arranged for me to go strictly to the hole, and I was in the cell right next to him,” Mikell said. But Shelton maintained his innocence, and Mikell, not wanting to comply with the investigation, asked to be moved elsewhere.</p>
<p>In an interview with the Post-Gazette, Mikell said he was provided money by the DA’s office and county detectives, on the record and off the record, for the case against Shelton and Thomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Sometimes I signed for it, sometimes I didn’t,” Mikell said.&nbsp;“They did whatever they could to keep me happy because they wanted me to be happy to testify for this trial.”</p>
<p>Mikell was provided thousands of dollars during the investigation into Thomas and Shelton, he said. After telling prosecutors he feared retaliation from those he informed on, Mikell was given money to relocate, as well as money for food and coffee.</p>
<p>“Anything I asked for, they always came through,” Mikell said. At one point, he was wired $2,700 through a Walmart in West Virginia, according to a recently unsealed interview he conducted with defense attorneys.</p>
<p>He also said he was used as an illegal informant when McKeesport police, county detectives and Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives agents asked him to make controlled purchases for&nbsp;“guns and dope.”</p>
<p>Initially, Mikell reached out to his probation officer to make sure he was allowed to be an informant, but the officer told Mikell he was not permitted to be used as an informant while on probation.</p>
<p>“So I eventually text the detective and ask,&nbsp;‘Did you talk to my probation officer?’” Mikell said.&nbsp;“He texted me back and lied, like,&nbsp;‘Yes, I talked to him. Everything is a go.’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators met Mikell behind a school and gave him money and a recording device to make a controlled buy of an assault riffle, Mikell said. Detectives told him the operation was to build up Mikell’s credibility as a potential witness in the Wilkinsburg trial, Mikell said.</p>
<p>“They gave me a cellphone that was a recording device,” Mikell said.&nbsp;“On this cellphone, he labeled me as an informant, like I was signed up. But I wasn’t.”</p>
<p>The operation resulted in a run-in at a red light where Mikell said he was threatened, and called a rat, leading him to request relocation funds from the DA’s office. The stress that resulted caused Mikell to become paranoid and depressed.</p>
<p>“They almost broke me. I was suicidal at times,” Mikell said, adding he’s experienced mental breakdowns and constantly loses weight due to fear of retaliation from those he’s informed on.</p>
<p>Investigators don’t care, he said. “They just think about their convictions right then and there.”</p>
<p>Mikell said if someone is willing to represent him, he wants to sue the district attorney’s office.</p>
<p>“I got tons of text messages from the county detectives’ work phones,” Mikell said.&nbsp;“I can’t forge that or make that up.”</p>
<p>“I feel, honestly, that the public should know that the criminals ain’t the only bad guys out here,” Mikell said. “That the prosecutors is just as guilty as the criminals because they’ll do anything it takes for a conviction for their record.”</p>
