He currently serves on the boards of Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, Visual Comfort &amp; Company and Untuckit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Contrary to the view that the apocalypse of retail is imminent, this is an exciting time to build relationships and serve customers," said Mr. Fleming in the company’s announcement. "Given the momentum we have at rue21, I'm excited by the opportunity to accelerate our business by modernizing our model and delivering value to our customers by building a seamless and personalized experience."</p>

<p>Mr. Appel had served as interim CEO from October 2017 to June 2018. He was named chief executive effective Nov. 12, 2018. He succeeded Laurie Van Brunt who served as president and CEO.</p>
