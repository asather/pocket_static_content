<h1>State awards security grants to religious, non-profit groups</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state has announced grants totaling $5 million to 113 religious and other non-profit institutions around the state to increase their security against potential hate crimes.</p>
<p>The grants were awarded in implementation of a 2019 allocation approved by state lawmakers in the wake of the Oct. 27, 2018, massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue. Eligible institutions were invited to apply.</p>
<p>Those eligible for the grants —&nbsp;which can fund training, improvements to building security and related programs&nbsp;— include any religious or non-profit group that serves a population that could be targeted for hate crimes under definitions used by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Those categories include race, gender, gender identity, religion, disability, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency administered the grant program.</p>
<p>The grants range from $5,000 to $150,000. Recipients include not only a significant number of synagogues and other Jewish schools and institutions, but also numerous Christian, Muslim and non-profit, non-sectarian groups around the state.</p>
<p>The General Assembly approved the allocation in 2019 in the wake of a gunman’s 2018 attack on the Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha synagogue building in Squirrel Hill, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/squirrel-hill-massacre-victims/" target="_blank">killing 11 worshipers</a> from three congregations worshiping there, Dor Hadash, New Light and Tree of Life. The man accused in the shooting, Robert Bowers, faces trial on federal hate-crimes charges.</p>
<p>The grant can cover anything from planning and training surrounding security to the physical hardening of buildings using anything from metal detectors to deadbolts to emergency communications systems.</p>
<p>Twenty-five of the grant recipients are in Allegheny County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They include: Beth El Congregation, $90,000;&nbsp;Planned Parenthood of Western Pennsylvania,&nbsp; $35,080;&nbsp;Hillel Academy of Pittsburgh, $45,158;&nbsp;Center that CARES, $24,000;&nbsp;The Aleph Institute, $23,385;&nbsp;Locally Grown, $20,000;&nbsp;Gemilas Chesed Synagogue, $20,800;&nbsp;Temple Ohav Shalom of Pittsburgh, $40,916;&nbsp;Yeshivath Achei Tminim of Pittsburgh, $119,341;&nbsp;Lubavitch Center, $25,000;&nbsp;Rodef Shalom Congregation, $24,589;&nbsp;Adat Shalom B'nai Israel Beth Jacob, $97,481;&nbsp;Mount Lebanon United Presbyterian Church, $71,636;&nbsp;Chabad of Carnegie Mellon University, $25,000;&nbsp;ACHIEVA, $24,419;&nbsp;Pittsburgh Kollel Beth Yitzhok, $25,000;&nbsp;Community Day School, $74,584;&nbsp;Carnegie Library of Homestead, $71,593;&nbsp;Allies for Health &amp; Wellbeing (formerly Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force); $54,053;&nbsp;First Methodist Church of Pittsburgh, $17,500;&nbsp;Temple Emanuel of South Hills, $74,800;&nbsp;The Union Project, $25,000;&nbsp;Calvary Episcopal Church, $25,000;&nbsp;Generations House of Worship, $22,700; and&nbsp;Congregation Dor Hadash $15,100.</p>
