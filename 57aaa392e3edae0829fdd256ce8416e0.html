<p>A Morgantown, W.Va. health system is joining a clinically integrated network run by Allegheny Health Network, extending the reach of the Pittsburgh-based provider into West Virginia.</p>
<p>Mon Health System is joining AHN’s Physician Partners of Western PA LLC, an organization founded in 2017 that coordinates care for nearly a quarter million patients through claims-based analytics and predictive modeling. In addition, Mon Health will join AHN’s bulk purchasing group, giving the health system access to competitive prices for an array of medical supplies.</p>
<p>Mon Health, which was formed in 1982, operates three hospitals, an ambulance service, retirement community in West Virginia.</p>
<p>AHN’s bulk purchasing group represents more than 90 hospital members in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware.</p>
<p>As part of the agreement, AHN will open a heart failure program at Mon Health headed by cardiologist Christopher Link, who came to Allegheny Health Network from Maine Medical Partners in 2019. Heart failure is a chronic, costly disease with a high rate of mortality.</p>
<p>“We are honored to call AHN a partner in providing higher level services to our patients,” Mon Health President and CEO David Goldberg said in a prepared statement. Mr. Goldberg was previously a executive vice president at AHN.</p>

<p>“We look forward to working with the leadership of Mon Health System to help support their mission of service to the people of north central West Virginia,” she said in a prepared statement.</p>
