<h1>Tech site that provides money, help to families in crisis wins UpPrize competition </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As manager of strategic initiatives in Allegheny County’s Office of Children, Youth and Families, Kim Cauley Eckel has an up-close perspective on the challenge of keeping families together in time of financial crisis.</p>
<p>She doesn’t think government supports are adequate to help parents who may suddenly find themselves jobless or homeless and who may be forced to place their children in foster care or other arrangements.</p>
<p>Crowdfunding sites like Kickstarter that generate donations don’t always work quickly enough to assist families experiencing such issues, she said.</p>
<p>So in 2018 she launched her own platform, Footbridge for Families, a nonprofit that channels donations from individuals, corporations and foundations directly to families along with referrals and help from health care and social services professionals.</p>
<p>The organization Thursday won the top award of $150,000 in the UpPrize competition, a social innovation challenge sponsored by BNY Mellon of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>UpPrize this year awarded nearly $400,000 to five businesses and nonprofits that are developing innovative solutions to societal problems.</p>
<p>Ms. Cauley Eckel, 41, created Footbridge for Families on nights and weekends while working full-time for CYF, she said.</p>
<p>Finding help for families trying to navigate short-term financial issues “is a passion of mine,” she said after placing first in the pitch competition held at Carnegie Science Center on the North Shore.</p>
<p>The mother of three children — ages 5, 6 and 9 — was having her own challenges getting the technology for Footbridge developed when a friend who teaches at Carnegie Mellon University suggested students in her information systems course tackle the platform.</p>
<p>They built it out in four semesters, said Ms. Cauley Eckel, who lives in Point Breeze.</p>
<p>She raised her first $1,000 for Footbridge from a women’s investment group in Fox Chapel, and also sought initial backing from friends and contacts through crowdfunding.</p>
<p>Footbridge’s advantage for people in crisis, she said, is that it allows families to remain anonymous and it connects them quickly to professionals like home health care workers who can visit them, assess their situations and validate their needs.</p>
<p>Instead of waiting weeks or months for a story posted on a crowdfunding site to resonate with potential donors, “Our platform has rapid response,” she said.</p>
<p>She aims to pilot the program beginning in June and launch a commercial version in January 2021.</p>
<p>The second-place winner at UpPrize, Honeycomb Credit, received $100,000 for its community loan platform that helps fund small businesses.</p>
<p>The third-place prize of $50,000 went to Civic Champs, a startup that developed a mobile app that allows nonprofits to track volunteers’ hours and activities.</p>
<p>The other finalists, Homewood Children’s Village and Beamdata, each received a special award of $10,000 in addition to a prize of $10,000 awarded to all five finalists.</p>
<p>Homewood Children’s Village is developing a digital app and other tools that will help students who face social and financial barriers plan their post-high school education or career goals.</p>
<p>Beamdata developed an app to help citizens better engage with elected officials and communicate about community concerns.</p>
<p>UpPrize was launched in 2015 by the BNY Mellon Foundation of Southwestern Pennsylvania and the Forbes Funds, an affiliate of the Pittsburgh Foundation.</p>
<p>Innovation Works, a state supported economic development agency, took over management of the event last year from the Forbes Funds.</p>
