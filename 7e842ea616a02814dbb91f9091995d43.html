<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A&nbsp;Pennsylvania State Employees Credit Union, or PSECU, employee is taking precautionary measures and working from home after having contact with someone who may have been exposed to the coronavirus while in Europe, the company said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The employee, based in Dauphin County, had contact with someone who had traveled to Italy, and the person was tested for the virus and has not been quarantined, the company said. The PSECU employee has not exhibited any symptoms and the company says there is no reason to believe the employee was exposed.</p>
<p>“Acting with our staff’s safety in mind, PSECU recently took precautions within our Harrisburg headquarters,” the company said in their statement. The employee will remain home until the individual who was exposed to the virus is cleared.</p>
<p>“To address the situation, we immediately reached out to the PA Health Line for direction and protocols. In addition, to safeguard our employees, we have heightened our cleaning and disinfection efforts in areas visited by the employee and have distributed hand sanitizer throughout the building,” the company said.</p>
<p>“We take seriously the health and well-being of our employees and the greater community and will take additional actions, if needed,” the company said.</p>
