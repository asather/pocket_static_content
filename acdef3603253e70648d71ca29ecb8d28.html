<h1>State to expand testing for COVID-19 at nursing homes</h1>

<p>State Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine on Tuesday announced a plan to greatly expand COVID-19 testing at long-term care facilities including nursing homes and personal care homes. The facilities, which represent nearly 70% of the state's deaths from the highly contagious disease, will be required to test every resident and every staff member on a regular basis.</p>

<p>The new supply of swabs would come from the federal government, Dr. Levine said, as well as state and commercial laboratories. The National Guard is preparing a mobile testing unit as well. The frequency of testing will differ from facility to facility; those with confirmed cases of COVID-19 will test more often, the secretary said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"This strategy focuses on ensuring testing is accessible, available and adaptable to the evolving landscape of this virus," Dr. Levine said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The secretary also said that residents who are hospitalized will now be required to test negative for COVID-19 before returning to nursing homes. Additionally, long-term care facilities will be required to use the same reporting system as hospitals for positive, negative and fatal cases of COVID-19 beginning May 17. The data will be made public, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>"By testing every resident and every staff member in every nursing home, we will be able to pinpoint exactly who has COVID-19, who has been exposed but no symptoms and cohort positive cases to prevent spread," Dr. Levine said. "This effort will give us a clearer picture of the extent of outbreaks in nursing homes and a head start at stopping them.â€™</p>
<p>The new initiative comes amid concerns surrounding the state's handling of the COVID-19 outbreak at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County. Over 325 residents and staff have tested positive since the start of the pandemic, and over 70 have died, leading the state to appoint a temporary manager. The National Guard was deployed to Brighton on Monday to provide direct care support.</p>
