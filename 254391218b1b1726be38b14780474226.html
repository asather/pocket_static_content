<h1>Blake Cederlind impresses in debut, but Pirates still lose to Reds, 4-1</h1>

<p>CINCINNATI — By the time Joe Musgrove stepped off the mound after the first inning Tuesday night, all the necessary damage had been done.</p>
<p>The Cincinnati Reds blitzed Musgrove with two singles and a walk to start the inning before Musgrove hit Mike Moustakas in the foot with a curveball on an 0-2 pitch, then allowed a sacrifice fly and another single.</p>
<p>All told, the Reds plated three runs in the blink of an eye. They added another run on a solo bomb in the second, and though Musgrove tightened it up after that, eventually pitching five innings and allowing just two hits the rest of the way, it was all the Reds would need.</p>
<p>The Pirates got nothing against Reds right-hander Michael Lorenzen, scoring only one run on a single from first baseman Colin Moran in the fourth and losing their seventh game in a row, 4-1.</p>
<p>“I had a chance, I think, if I punch [Moustakas] out, the flow of the inning's different, the energy's a little different,” Musgrove said. “It's super frustrating to have a guy in an advantage count like that and then put him on. But that was kind of the plan of attack with him, trying to get the breaking balls more to the back foot than just down the middle or down. Feel like that's the hole we had open for him, and I just pulled it a little bit too far in.”</p>
<p>While it was another tough blow for a reeling Pirates team, the middle of the sixth inning on Tuesday night began their highlight for the evening, as right-handed reliever Blake Cederlind trotted in from the Pirates’ bullpen.</p>
<p>He stepped onto the mound, chatted with catcher Jacob Stallings for a moment and hurled his first warmup pitch toward home. The radar gun at Great American Ballpark clocked the pitch at 97 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Then, as the Cincinnati Reds stepped up to face Cederlind in his debut, he threw the real gas. He touched 99 twice in his 14 pitches. One of them, a 99.5 mile-per-hour fastball to Reds outfielder Brian Goodwin, was the hardest pitch thrown by any Pirate this season. Goodwin and Reds shortstop Freddy Galvis to ground out to second base. Reds shortstop Jose Garcia flew out to left field, and Cederlind recorded a 1-2-3 inning in his first career appearance.</p>
<p>“I wish I could’ve gotten a couple [strikeouts], but I was happy it was clean,” Cederlind said. “Anytime you can get a clean one, you never complain. But the guys were so supportive coming off. I think they know I’ve been waiting for this one.”</p>
<p>Still, as with many of the small, in-game victories for the Pirates (14-33) this season, it was not enough to impact the game in a meaningful way. Their current losing streak has dropped them back down to the worst record in the league, a distinction they have been hovering around all season.</p>
<p>Though they would be notable in any season, it’s those struggles that have made the debuts of Cederlind and third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes, who doubled and scored on Moran’s single, so meaningful for the Pirates. They represent young, new faces and a bit of possibility in what has otherwise been a slog of a season.</p>
<p>Still, the Pirates fell short again Tuesday. Musgrove, Cederlind and co., despite the first-inning troubles from Musgrove, pitched a pretty good game. As has been the case many times this season, though, one side of their team didn’t live up to the performance of the other.</p>
<p>They tallied just five hits. Four of them were in the fourth inning or earlier, and three of them were in the third. No Pirate had more than one hit, and only designated hitter Josh Bell got on base more than once. After striking out 25 times in their doubleheader against the Reds on Monday, they struck out nine more times Tuesday.</p>
<p>Three of those punch outs came from right fielder Gregory Polanco who has two hits in his last 33 at-bats, including a four-game hitless streak.</p>
<p>“We have to continue to get [Polanco] out there,” manager Derek Shelton said after the game. “We have to continue to make sure he gets his at-bats and work through it. He’s going to work through it, and he’s going to be a big part of what we’re doing not only at the end of this year but into next year.”</p>
<p>In the top of the ninth, the Pirates did threaten. After Moran hit a deep fly ball to the wall in right center field, which was caught with an impressive leap by Goodwin, Bell and Polanco drew consecutive walks to bring the tying run to the plate.</p>
<p>Center fielder Cole Tucker worked his way into a three-ball count against Reds lefty Amir Garret, but he struck out. Kevin Newman, who pinch hit, flew out to right.</p>
