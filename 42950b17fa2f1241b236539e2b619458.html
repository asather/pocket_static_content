<h1>Tuned In: ‘Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood’ inspires second PBS Kids series</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif. – Just as Fred Rogers Productions’ offered a rare live-action show for children with PBS’ “Odd Squad,” its next PBS Kids’ entry will be another uncommon contemporary entry: a children’s program featuring puppets.</p>
<p>Scheduled to premiere on PBS in winter 2021, “Donkey Hodie” is inspired by the “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood” character whose name is a play on Don Quixote and was first seen in the Neighborhood of Make-Believe during the show’s first season in 1968. <a href="https://www.misterrogers.org/articles/donkey-hodie/" target="_blank">Donkey went on to appear in 59 episodes</a> between 1968 and 1993.</p>
<p>PBS ordered 40 half-hour episodes – each containing two 11-minute stories — of the new live-action puppet series, which will feature new music and reimagined versions of Rogers’ songs.</p>
<p>“Donkey Hodie,” designed for children ages 3-5, is a co-production with Deerfield, Ill.-based Spiffy Pictures (“Nature Cat”) and is currently in production at PBS station WTTW in Chicago.</p>
<p>Created with a social-emotional curriculum and inspired by Rogers’ sillier side, “Donkey Hodie” follows the adventures of the granddaughter of the original Donkey Hodie character, who is now known as Grampy Hodie. The series is set in Someplace Else, a location from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe in “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”</p>
<p>In each episode, Donkey and friends Purple Panda, Duck Duck and Bob Dog come up with solutions to everyday childhood frustrations and challenges.</p>
<p>Ellen Doherty, chief creative officer for Fred Rogers Productions, said “Donkey Hodie” grew out of an office conversation about other characters from the Neighborhood of Make-Believe, besides those on “Daniel Tiger’s Neighborhood,” that might be able to anchor a series.</p>
<p>“Looking at the list of character names, Donkey Hodie jumped out because it’s funny. It makes you giggle,” Ms. Doherty said.</p>
<p>Initially the thought was to make “Donkey Hodie” as an animated series because “puppets are harder to develop these days,” but they decided on puppets because they better fit the stories they wanted to tell.</p>
<p>“You get so much great comedy and drama from puppets that is different from animation,” Ms. Doherty said, “The flailing and exaggeration — it’s so much fun. It’s great to be back in this world and having puppets that are really fuzzy and have so much texture. It’s a world that’s huggable.”</p>
<p><strong>‘Odd Squad’ new season</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the new series, FRP’s “Odd Squad” returns for its third season on PBS on Feb. 17.</p>
<p>The live-action kids’ show, which has a math, science and engineering curriculum, gets a mostly new cast as Ms. O (Millie Davis) sends a new roster of agents out in a mobile unit to solve cases on the road.</p>
<p>The series filmed scenes for an episode in Pittsburgh in August. An air date for that episode hasn’t been set but it’s expected to be in the summer.</p>
<p>In addition to the 20 new half-hour episodes – actress Toni Collette (“Unbelievable”) guest stars as a villain – the show will launch its first-ever serialized podcast, “Odd Squadcast,” featuring Ms. O giving a weekly address to Odd Squad agents worldwide. A new season of online digital shorts “Odd Tube,” hosted by new character Agent Orla (Alyssa Hidalgo), will debut in the fall.</p>
<p><strong>‘Lizzie McGuire’ shakeup</strong></p>
<p>Variety reports Mt. Lebanon native Terri Minsky is out as showrunner for the upcoming Disney+ revival of “Lizzie McGuire,” which Ms. Minsky created. A Disney representative said after filming two episodes executives decided the show needed to move in a different direction.</p>
<p>“I loved working with Hilary Duff,” Minsky wrote via e-mail when asked for comment, “and I’m proud of the two episodes we made.”</p>
<p>The “Lizzie” sequel series is on hiatus while Disney+ executives search for a new showrunner.</p>
