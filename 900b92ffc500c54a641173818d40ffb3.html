<p>Among the staff at the facility, 19 workers have tested positive for the virus, while an additional 7 also wait for pending results, according to KDKA.</p>
<p>The assisted living facility has suffered a rash of infections, with 25 residents and 15 staff testing positive for the new coronavirus as of Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kane’s other three centers, in Scott, McKeesport and Ross, have had no confirmed cases as of Friday, although about half a dozen tests are still pending.</p>
