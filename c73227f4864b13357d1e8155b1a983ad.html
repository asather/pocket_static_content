<h1>Pittsburgh police review board stands behind bill that would hire outside firm</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bill to create a $25,000 agreement between the Citizen Police Review Board and a U.S. government contractor to investigate recent protests in Pittsburgh is being called into question by critics.</p>
<p>But the review board is standing firm that the Densus Group can provide expertise in crowd management and use of force that has been&nbsp;“proven around the world.”</p>
<p>On June 3, the review board said it was investigating police response to local protests that erupted in the days after a 46-year-old black man, George Floyd, was killed by a white Minneapolis police officer.&nbsp; Particularly, the board concentrating on the night of June 1 on Centre Avenue in East Liberty when police fired tear gas, bean bags and sponge rounds at protesters after declaring the gathering an unlawful assembly. Protesters said they remained peaceful; police maintain that they were hit with water bottles and rocks.</p>
<p>Shortly after the board’s announcement, Mayor Bill Peduto said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/06/03/Pittsburgh-citizen-police-review-board-protest-east-liberty-tear-gas-floyd/stories/202006030102" target="_blank">he wanted a&nbsp;“full, third party” investigation</a> into the police response.</p>
<p>At its June 9 meeting, City Council considered several bills, including <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/06/09/Pittsburgh-City-Council-discussion-police-reform-black-lives-matter-protests-burgess/stories/202006090093" target="_blank">four police reform bills from Councilman Ricky Burgess</a>, and a resolution from Councilman Bruce Kraus authorizing the mayor and police review board to enter into an agreement with Densus Group “for the purpose of assessing police citizen engagement and use of force as it is currently deployed.”</p>
<p>Densus, located in Plano, Texas, also has an office in Washington, D.C., and was&nbsp;“founded to advocate the professional and appropriate use of force,” according to its website. Major clients include the U.S. departments of State, Defense and Justice. Among its prior jobs listed are crowd management training and election monitoring training in Kyrgyzstan; use of force training for Bosnian police; and “non-lethal operations” courses for marines in Kuwait and the U.S. Other clients have included the Los Angeles Police Department and an unnamed Ohio media organization, for which it provided journalist training ahead of protests at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland.</p>
<p>Densus’ three-member management team is comprised of two British Army veterans and a former U.S. Marine.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess criticized the proposal to hire the group as&nbsp;“frivolous” and a “somewhat silly piece of legislation that in my opinion will be of very little consequence.” He said time would be better spent taking ideas from community members. He declined to comment further Wednesday — aside from calling the police review board’s work&nbsp;“important” — after council’s standing committee voted to hold the bill one week.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kraus said the agreement proposal came at the request of the police review board and that the idea is in line with the&nbsp;Pennsylvania State Legislative Police Reform Working Group.</p>
<p>Councilman Corey O’Connor, co-sponsor of the bill, said,&nbsp;“I was told CPRB needed assistance, and I support assisting them.&nbsp;… [The review board and Densus have] already worked together.”</p>
<p>In the months leading up to the 2009 G-20 summit in Pittsburgh, Densus warned City Council of eruptions between police and protesters. They said cities across the U.S. and the world “suffered demoralization, damaged reputations, and extraordinary economic consequences from control tactics gone awry resulting in civil lawsuits and criminal prosecutions,” according to a presentation delivered at a post-agenda council meeting July 28, 2009.</p>
<p>“They assisted in the G-20, they also issued recommendations after the G-20 related to training and procedures. But what happened is the city disregarded those recommendations,” said Beth Pittinger, the police review board’s executive director.</p>
<p>Sam Rosenfeld — Densus chairman, a former British Army infantry officer and a graduate of the Wharton School of Business —&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newsday.com/news/nation/civil-liberties-groups-police-overreacted-at-g-20-1.1477410" target="_blank">criticized the city following G-20 protests</a> in Oakland, saying the city’s tactics were “too aggressive” and that police had an inability to distinguish peaceful protesters from violent ones.</p>
<p>Public comments at the last two council meetings have criticized the idea of spending taxpayer money on an outside consultant, calling the group&nbsp;“Eurocentric” and that it peddles the&nbsp;“theory of outside agitators.”</p>
<p>“Despite conjecture about who we are and what we do, the facts are the Densus Group provides police reform to create community-based, transparent and accountable policing around the world,” Mr. Rosenfeld said when asked to respond to the criticism. “… Proactive policing rather than reactive, it means that you facilitate protest by working with the protesters and [carve out/identify those] who wish to cause the violence and successfully arrest and prosecute them.”</p>
<p>“The most human rights-promoting approaches to policing are also the most operationally and efficient ones,” he continued.&nbsp;“A&nbsp;higher level and propensity use of force is the most inefficient use of resources, doesn't get you what you want and destroys relationships with the community. This is about building bridges to get things and holding those who have criminal intent to account for criminal intent, by which I mean those who want to be violent and use peaceful protests as a cover, for doing so.”</p>
<p>Brandi Fisher, head of the Alliance for Police Accountability and a member of Mr. Peduto’s community police reform task force, said she questioned&nbsp;“if we already have a Citizen Police Review Board, why would we need them?”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there’s the question of how far $25,000 would go for an organization that works with entities as large as the federal government.</p>
<p>Mr. Rosenfeld said the amount is&nbsp;“sufficient” for the&nbsp;“very clear and narrow terms of reference” in the contract.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those terms are not yet available. Council is expected to discuss the bill Wednesday.</p>
<p>The city’s Department of Public Safety declined to comment on the Densus Group.</p>
<p>"The Citizen Police Review Board is an independent body and as such they are entitled to seek any assistance that they find appropriate. Public Safety respects the Citizen Police Review Board’s independence and always welcomes their input on improving police-community relationships,” said Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich in a written statement.</p>
