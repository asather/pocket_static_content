<h1>Couples with 60 years of wedded bliss share their secrets for successful, lasting marriages</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As students at Mt. Lebanon High School in the 1940s, Carol Kunz and Jean Gilfillan became fast friends. So, after her freshman year of college, Ms. Kunz invited Ms. Gilfillan in a girls-night at her home.</p>
<p>When it ended, Bill Gilfillan came by to drive his sister home. He immediately became smitten with the young hostess, who he met for the first time.</p>
<p>“I thought she was an attractive young lady, interesting and someone I would like to see again,” the Upper St. Clair man recalled.</p>
<p>Their first date was the Fourth of July fireworks in Mt. Lebanon. But any ‘sparks’ that night were limited to those in the sky: this match-up was less than love-at-first-sight.</p>
<p>But months later, when Cupid’s arrow finally hit its mark, it was a bulls eye: The couple married just three years later in 1949.</p>
<p>The Gilfillans were among local couples with 60 years or&nbsp; more of wedded bliss who shared their own, unique recipe for marriage longevity as the holiday for sweethearts - Valentine’s Day – approaches.</p>
<p>Mrs. Gilfillan, 92, attributes their success, in part, to common interests over the years, such as music, reading, golf and dancing.</p>
<p>The couple also shares a mutual passion for helping others through the Salvation Army, as he was an advisory board member of the local chapter and she helped start its Women’s Auxiliary of Greater Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilfillan cited their common Presbyterian religious commitment, and the absence of any serious disagreements over the years.</p>
<p>“It’s a combination of a lot of things, and obviously a great love for each other,” Mr. Gilfillan, 94, said.</p>
<p>He is a retired senior executive of Duquesne Light and Mrs. Gilfillan is an artist. The couple has two daughters, three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Even after 70 years together, there is no letting up in – what else? -- togetherness.</p>
<p>Mr. Gilfillan drives his wife to arts and crafts shows and helps her set up. They watched the Super Bowl together.</p>
<p>“Make sure you’re willing and ready to commit to a lifetime of marriage. It is not a short-term commitment,” Mr. Gilfillan advised today’s newlyweds.</p>
<p>As for celebrating Valentine’s Day 2020, the couple agreed that every day is Valentine’s Day when you are in a happy union.</p>
<p>“We never made a lot out of it,” Mrs. Gilfillan said of the holiday.</p>
<p>Georgeann Germeyer met her future husband, Earl Kleckner, in 1955 when he was a patient in South Side Hospital and she was a teenage cafeteria worker who brought him food.</p>
<p>As they chatted she realized she wanted to see him again, and gave him her phone number.</p>
<p>“I liked him from the start,” Mrs. Kleckner said.</p>
<p>After he was discharged he called and the pair went to the movies.</p>
<p>With more dates the couple realized they were “the one” for each other, and married three years later in 1958.</p>
<p>Mr. Kleckner, 87, is retired from Mellon Bank. Mrs. Kleckner, 81, is a retired cafeteria worker in the Baldwin-Whitehall School District.</p>
<p>The Whitehall couple agreed the key to their long marriage is working together on all issues.</p>
<p>The latter was evident recently when Mrs. Kleckner was hospitalized for 45 days for a serious illness, followed by a month in a nursing home.</p>
<p>“Earl visited me all day, every day.&nbsp; He pulled me through,” she said.</p>
<p>The couple has three sons, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>As for Valentine’s Day, it is just another day when a relationship is solid, Mrs. Kleckner said.</p>
<p>“Valentine’s Day is all-year-round,” she said.</p>
<p>Rita Stanchak and Art Belback met in 1955 when he was the best man, and she a bridesmaid, in his twin brother’s wedding. They married seven months later.</p>
<p>Mrs. Belback, 82, is a retired county treasurer’s office employee, while her husband, 89, is a retired Alcoa design worker.</p>
<p>Mr. Belback’s tip for a long and loving marriage is “getting along.”</p>
<p>“We worked together raising our five kids.&nbsp;Today, we travel together to visit them. We spend a few weeks in Georgia and Colorado visiting three of the kids.</p>
<p>“That’s our vacation,” he said.</p>
<p>The Bethel Park couple, who also have 13 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren, is also united in their volunteerism with Meals on Wheels and at St. Thomas More Church.</p>
<p>“You have to think of the other person,” Mrs. Belback said of a successful marriage.</p>
<p>“It’s not just all about you.&nbsp;Think about what’s good for both of you,” she said.</p>
<p>Sandy Piccioni met Tom Urbanski when he invited her out for a hamburger and root beer. When her father, Tony Piccioni, got to eventually know and like him, his daughter’s heart was sealed.</p>
<p>“I knew he was for me,” Mrs. Urbanski, 81, said.</p>
<p>She credits their 61-year marriage to “being understanding and listening.” She also points to their mutual civic involvement over the years: he is the former mayor, while she was a member of the Glassport Women’s Club and the historical society.</p>
<p>They also operated as a team in the family business: Mr. Urbanski, 88, owned a heating/air-conditioning company, while his wife handled the book work.</p>
<p>They have four children, four grandchildren, four great-grandchildren and four step-great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>Her advice for newlyweds?</p>
<p>“Sit down, and compromise.&nbsp;Cooler heads always prevail,” she said.</p>
