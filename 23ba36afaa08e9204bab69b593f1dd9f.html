<h1>More than 300 in U.S. test positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Officials across the United States reported 308 cases of coronavirus and 17 deaths as of Friday, with Florida reporting the first deaths on the East Coast. The number of infections does not count the 21 people who have tested positive aboard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/california-coronavirus-cruise-ship.html" rel="nofollow">a cruise ship off California, the Grand Princess</a>.</p>
<p>Florida officials reported on Friday night that there had been two deaths in the state related to the coronavirus. Both of the people who died had traveled internationally, they said.</p>
<p>On the East Coast, a cluster has emerged in New York State. All but a few of its 33 confirmed cases as of Friday were linked to a New Rochelle man. More than 2,700 people are under some form of quarantine in New York City.</p>
<p>The West Coast has borne the brunt of the toll in the United States. Washington State has recorded the most coronavirus cases, more than 80, and the highest number of deaths, 14. Most of the fatal cases emerged from a Seattle-area nursing home. Officials in King County, Wash., said 15 residents of the facility, Life Care Center, had been taken to hospitals over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>California has treated 70 people for the virus, one of whom has died, and new cases continue to emerge at a worrying rate. An employee of the F.B.I.’s San Francisco division tested positive, the first confirmed case at the bureau.</p>
<p>And Starbucks on Friday night reported that one of its employees in downtown Seattle had tested positive. The company said the store has been closed for cleaning.</p>
<p>Also in the Seattle area, two Microsoft employees were being treated for the coronavirus, a company spokesman said. Microsoft did not close its campus, but it had already advised employees to work from home if possible.</p>
<p>Two residents of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/coronavirus-washington-state.html" rel="nofollow">other Seattle-area complexes</a> that largely serve older people have now also been hospitalized and tested positive, officials said, identifying them as Issaquah Nursing &amp; Rehabilitation Center and Ida Culver House Ravenna.</p>
<p>The chief federal judge in Seattle ordered the cancellation of all in-person federal court hearings in Western Washington State. And Hawaii reported its first confirmed infection, a person who had been on the Grand Princess.</p>
<p><em>Stanford and other universities take measures to stem the outbreak. </em></p>
<p>At Stanford University, officials announced late Friday that classes would not meet in person as of Monday, and that any looming exams would be changed to a take-home format.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/coronavirus-college-campus-closings.html" rel="nofollow">University of Washington</a>, with 50,000 students, said that it would cancel in-person classes from Monday through at least March 20, and have students take classes and final exams remotely.</p>
<p>Seattle University, with about 7,300 students, also said it would move to online classes for the rest of the winter quarter, and Northeastern University in Boston will do the same for students on its Seattle campus.</p>
<p>But New York City’s public schools will probably stay open even if the new coronavirus becomes more widespread. Richard A. Carranza, the schools chancellor, said this week that he considered long-term closings an “extreme” measure and a “last resort.”</p>
<p>New York City has the largest public school system in the United States, a vast district with about 750,000 children who are poor, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/19/nyregion/student-homelessness-nyc.html" rel="nofollow">including around 114,000 who are homeless</a>. For such students, school may be the only place they can get three hot meals a day and medical care, and even wash their dirty laundry.</p>
<p>Even a single snow day can seriously disrupt the lives of New York’s most vulnerable children and their parents and other relatives, whose jobs often do not provide paid time off, said Aaron Pallas, a professor of education at Columbia University’s Teachers College.</p>
<p>“Kids will need to be supervised,” Professor Pallas said. “And there are complex interactions here that affect the well-being of families.”</p>
<p>Mayor Bill de Blasio said Friday that none of the city’s 1.1 million public school students had shown any symptoms of the virus. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised that, so far, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/specific-groups/children-faq.html" rel="nofollow">children have been less likely than adults to become infected</a>.</p>
<p><em>A U.S. Navy sailor tests positive in Italy.</em></p>
<p>An American Navy sailor stationed in Naples, Italy, was found to have the coronavirus, the first positive case of a U.S. service member in Europe, the United States European Command said on Saturday in a statement.</p>
<p>The sailor is being restricted to his or her home and receiving medical care in accordance with guidelines from Italy and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the statement said.</p>
<p>Health officials in the military were also conducting contact tracing for anyone else who may have been exposed.</p>
<p><em>As the epidemic grows in Europe, an Italian politician says he has the virus.</em></p>
<p>The coronavirus outbreak that has paralyzed and disrupted economic and social life in Italy spread into the top of the Italian politics on Saturday when the leader of the governing coalition’s Democratic Party announced that he had contracted the virus.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s arrived; I also have the coronavirus,” the politician, Nicola Zingaretti, the leader of the Democratic Party, said in a Facebook video.</p>
<p>In the video, Mr. Zingaretti, wearing a sweater and looking relaxed, said that he would follow all the protocols suggested by the authorities, who have urged infected people to separate themselves from others.</p>
<p>“I’m well, and so it was decided home isolation,” Mr. Zingaretti said, adding that his family was following the protocols as well.</p>
<p>He said that Italian health officials had already begun contacting people with whom he worked closely and had meetings and that the party’s vice president would take over “political activities” as he stayed home.</p>
<p>The number of infections climbed past 7,400 in Europe on Saturday — more than doubling in just a few days.</p>
<p>France, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands, Italy and others each recorded their biggest one-day increases in cases on Friday. More than 30 European countries now have cases; 10 of them have at least 100 each.</p>
<p>A member of the French Parliament tested positive for the virus. Doctors in Britain warned that the already-strained health care system there could be overwhelmed as the outbreak grows, and the country had its second coronavirus death.</p>
<p>In Italy, with the worst outbreak outside of Asia, the toll rose on Friday to more than 4,600 cases, 197 of them fatal, increases of almost 800 infections and 49 deaths from the day before. Only China has had more people die from the new coronavirus.</p>
<p>Outside Europe, in Iran’s outbreak, one of the world’s largest, the government reported more than 4,700 infections, an increase of more than 1,200 from the day before.</p>
<p><em>Americans are quarantined in Bethlehem over coronavirus fears.</em></p>
<p>A church group from Alabama is among dozens of guests and workers who have been quarantined at a hotel outside Bethlehem, after a Greek tourist who had stayed there came down with the coronavirus.</p>
<p>All told, some 40 people, most of them Palestinians, are being quarantined at the Angel Hotel, officials said, with Palestinian security officers in masks standing guard outside on Saturday.</p>
<p>The 13-member Alabama group, which includes pastors, other church workers and several spouses, arrived in Beit Jala on Monday and visited Bethlehem and Jerusalem before checking out on Thursday morning and heading to the West Bank, expecting to continue on to the Sea of Galilee, the Jordan River and Petra.</p>
<p>But they were summoned back to their hotel by the authorities, said the Rev. Chris Bell, the lead pastor of 3Circle Church in Fairhope, Ala.</p>
<p>The group was tested for the virus on Friday but had not been told the results as of midday on Saturday, he said in an interview.</p>
<p>“We’re heartbroken in a million different ways,” he said.</p>
<p>Eleven of the Alabama group were making their first pilgrimage to the Holy Land, Pastor Bell said.</p>
<p><em>In the province where the virus emerged, the only new cases are in Wuhan.</em></p>
<p>Hubei, the Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak, reported on Saturday that for two consecutive days, the province had seen no new infections outside its capital, Wuhan. The news confirmed that China’s new cases and deaths are increasingly concentrated in that city, where the virus emerged, while the rest of the province — and the rest of the country — are largely spared.</p>
<p><a href="http://wjw.hubei.gov.cn/fbjd/dtyw/202003/t20200307_2174360.shtml" rel="nofollow">Hubei reported 74 new infections</a> on Saturday, all in Wuhan. China also recorded 24 cases in people who had arrived from abroad, including 17 in Gansu, a northwest Chinese province. Excluding the infections in Wuhan and among arrivals from abroad, there was only one other new infection in the rest of China.</p>
<p>China also reported 28 deaths among those with the virus, all in Hubei Province. By comparison, there were 49 deaths from the virus in Italy on Friday.</p>
<p>The downward trend in China is a result of an all-out effort by the government to contain the spread of the disease, which has come at a great cost to the country’s economy and its social life. Since January, the government has enacted nationwide quarantine and travel restrictions and placed Hubei under a strict lockdown, effectively penning in 56 million people.</p>
<p>The new numbers reflect a steep decline from just a few weeks earlier. At one point in early February, Hubei reported more than 1,400 new cases outside Wuhan in one day.</p>
<p>One of the government-appointed Chinese researchers working to control the outbreak told the state-run newspaper People’s Daily on Thursday that, based on the data, he expected Wuhan to hit zero new infections later this month.</p>
<p><em>Two teenagers are arrested after a virus-related assault in London.</em></p>
<p>The Metropolitan Police in London have arrested two teenagers in connection with a racially aggravated assault, days after a 23-year-old student from Singapore said he was attacked by a group of men, one of whom shouted “I don’t want your coronavirus in my country.”</p>
<p>The student, Jonathan Mok, was confronted by four men on Monday as he was walking on Oxford Street in central London. As he turned to confront them, Mr. Mok wrote on Facebook, the men kicked him and punched his face, leaving him with swollen eyes and other injuries.</p>
<p>Two boys, 15 and 16, were arrested on Wednesday and Thursday, the police said. One was released under investigation, and the other was conditionally released until later this month. Detective Sgt. Emma Kirby said she was still trying to identify and speak to two other individuals.</p>
<p>“This attack left the victim shaken and hurt,” Sergeant Kirby said in a statement. “There’s no room on our streets for this kind of violent behavior and we are committed to finding the perpetrators.”</p>
<p>As the new coronavirus has spread, so have anti-Chinese sentiment and xenophobic acts against Asian people, with hashtags like #ChineseDon’tComeToJapan trending on Twitter in Japan, and Chinese students facing discrimination in Italy.</p>
<p><em>A South Korean city orders church members to submit to testing.</em></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/25/world/asia/daegu-south-korea-coronavirus.html" rel="nofollow">South Korean city of Daegu</a> has ordered members of a Christian sect at the center of the country’s coronavirus outbreak to be tested for the virus by the end of Saturday.</p>
<p>Daegu, a southeastern city of about 2.4 million, has been scrambling to test more than 10,000 members of the<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/21/world/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-shincheonji.html" rel="nofollow"> Shincheonji Church</a> of Jesus within its jurisdiction since last month, when it became clear that its followers had been spreading the virus in Daegu and elsewhere. Local officials are still trying to locate and test more than 1,000 members of Shincheonji, which is considered a cult by many other South Korean Christian churches.</p>
<p>South Korea, whose coronavirus outbreak is the biggest outside China, reported 483 new infections on Saturday, bringing its total caseload to 6,767, including 47 deaths. More than 5,000 of those infected are Daegu residents, and a vast majority of them belong to the church.</p>
<p>“Yesterday alone, we tested 709 Shincheonji members and 236 of them tested positive,” Daegu’s mayor, Kwon Young-jin, said on Saturday. “This is why church members should extend their self-isolation and must subject themselves to testing.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kwon issued an executive order that made the testing mandatory. Anyone who disobeys it can be fined under South Korea’s laws on controlling epidemics.</p>
<p>Mr. Kwon said the church members’ tendency to live and worship in groups made them likelier than others to spread the virus. The church’s founder, Lee Man-hee, recently <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/02/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-shincheonji.html" rel="nofollow">apologized</a> for its role in the outbreak but said the church had been cooperating with the authorities.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Daegu placed two adjacent apartment buildings under quarantine after 46 of their residents, all of them Sincheonji members, were confirmed to have the virus.</p>
<p><em>Malaysia and Thailand turn an Italian cruise ship away.</em></p>
<p>An Italian cruise ship has become the latest luxury liner to be kept at sea over coronavirus fears, as Malaysia and Thailand denied it entry for fear that passengers from Italy had been exposed to the virus before boarding.</p>
<p>Malaysia turned away the ship, the Costa Fortuna, which has more than 2,000 people aboard, under a government policy announced on Saturday, which bars all cruise ships from docking at any of the country’s ports until further notice.</p>
<p>The ship was denied permission to dock at the island of Penang in northern Malaysia on Saturday morning. On Friday, it had been turned away from the island of Phuket in southern Thailand, about 220 miles from Penang.</p>
<p>Thai officials refused to allow the Costa Fortuna to dock because 64 of its passengers had departed less than 14 days earlier from Italy, which has been hit hard by the coronavirus. Fourteen days is believed to be the virus’s maximum incubation period.</p>
<p>The operator of the Costa Fortuna, Costa Cruises, <a href="https://twitter.com/Costa_Press/status/1235899288502366208" rel="nofollow">confirmed on Twitter</a> that the ship had been turned away by Thailand, but it said none of the ship’s passengers on board were suspected of having Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus.</p>
<p>According to its itinerary, the vessel departed from Singapore on March 3 on a seven-day cruise to Malaysia and Thailand and had been scheduled to return to Singapore on Tuesday.</p>
<p><em>N.B.A. gives teams a refresher on playing in empty stadiums.</em></p>
<p>With the coronavirus spreading in the United States, the N.B.A. reminded its teams on Friday about the protocol for postponing or canceling games, and for playing without fans in attendance. The basketball league has not indicated that it plans to pursue any of those options.</p>
<p>According to a memo sent to teams on Friday, the league’s protocol requires a series of actions before such changes, including consultation with the affected teams and written notice from a top league official. Separately, the N.B.A. and its players’ union recently advised against high-fives and handshakes in favor of fist bumps, to limit the spread of germs.</p>
<p>The N.B.A. could be particularly affected by the epidemic in states that have declared a state of emergency, such as California. The mayor of San Francisco, London Breed, <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/sports/annkillion/article/Coronavirus-Bay-Area-sports-impact-Expert-15111972.php" rel="nofollow">has called for sporting events to be canceled</a>. San Francisco is the home of the Chase Center, where the N.B.A’.s Golden State Warriors play. On Friday, the <a href="https://www.nba.com/warriors/news/statement-coronavirus-concerns-20200306" rel="nofollow">Warriors released a statement</a> that listed new sanitizing measures the team had implemented.</p>
<p>As for games without fans, the league has advised teams to prepare contingency plans that would include deciding which staff members would need to attend. Teams were also told to prepare for the possibility of implementing temperature checks for anyone who would be considered essential for such a game, including players and referees.</p>
<p>LeBron James of the Lakers told a reporter that he wouldn’t play if fans weren’t present.</p>
<p>The league rarely postpones games and almost never cancels them. This season has been an exception because of the death of Kobe Bryant in a helicopter crash on Jan. 26.</p>
<p>The N.B.A. also announced on Tuesday that because of the coronavirus, it would postpone the first season of its Basketball Africa League, a professional league of 12 teams that had been set to debut in Senegal on March 13.</p>
<p><em>South by Southwest leads a long list of canceled events.</em></p>
<p>The 34th annual edition of South by Southwest, the annual festival of music, film and technology in Austin, Tex., that has become a global draw, was ordered canceled on Friday by local officials over fears about the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Festival organizers and government officials had come under intense pressure in recent days to pull the plug, with more than 50,000 people signing an online petition and a growing list of tech companies — among them Apple, Facebook, Twitter and TikTok — announcing their withdrawal.</p>
<p>The festival was to have run from March 13-22, with events spread across bars and party spaces in Austin, in addition to the main conference activities.</p>
<p>The cancellation is perhaps the largest collateral damage of the virus so far on the international cultural calendar. Last year, South by Southwest’s various events had a combined attendance of 417,000, including 159,000 who came to the music portion, according to <a href="https://explore.sxsw.com/hubfs/2019-SXSW-Event-Stats_9-10-19.pdf?__hstc=66818801.52a968f693bfa47862e1ef151801ae20.1583166647148.1583166647148.1583166647148.1&amp;__hssc=66818801.22.1583166647148" rel="nofollow">festival figures</a>.</p>
<p>Two other large-scale, multiday gatherings were also called off or pushed back on Friday: Emerald City Comic Con, a convention that draws thousands of people to Seattle each year, was postponed until the summer; and the Ultra Music Festival, an electronic dance music event held annually in Miami, where city officials blocked the event from going on.</p>
<p><em>Everyone on the Grand Princess cruise ship will be tested, after 21 tested positive.</em></p>
<p>All of the 3,533 people aboard <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/health/self-quarantine-coronavirus.html" rel="nofollow">a cruise ship idling off San Francisco</a> will be tested for the coronavirus, after 19 crew members and two passengers tested positive, Vice President Mike Pence said on Friday.</p>
<p>The ship, the Grand Princess, had been halted off the coast on Wednesday, until passengers with possible coronavirus symptoms or exposure could be tested. On Thursday, a Coast Guard helicopter flew testing kits to the ship and flew samples for 46 people back to shore.</p>
<p>“Twenty-one of those on the ship tested positive for the coronavirus, 24 tested negative and one test was inconclusive,” Mr. Pence said at a White House news briefing — blindsiding the passengers and the ship’s operators.</p>
<p>“We have developed a plan which will be implemented this weekend to bring the ship into a noncommercial port,” he added. “All passengers and crew will be tested for the coronavirus. Those that need to be quarantined will be quarantined. Those that require additional medical attention will receive it.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pence said the Defense Department was working to locate a California military base where passengers on the ship could be tested. Two air bases in the state have been used to house quarantined Americans repatriated from Asia.</p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Pence’s briefing, the ship captain came over the loudspeaker and apologized that passengers were getting updates from television news rather than him. The captain said that he had not received any advance notice about the news briefing and that the ship would notify individuals of their test results “as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The Princess cruise line said Centers for Disease Control and Prevention officials had told the doctor on board of the results as Mr. Pence was speaking.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/06/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-cdc.html" rel="nofollow">President Trump</a>, speaking at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said he would have preferred not to let the passengers disembark onto American soil. “I don’t need to have the numbers double because of one ship that wasn’t our fault,” he said. “And it wasn’t the fault of the people on the ship either. OK? It wasn’t their fault either. And they are mostly Americans.”</p>
<p>He added that, after all, he had authorized federal health officials to make the decision.</p>
<p><em>How to quarantine yourself. (Don’t even pet the dog.)</em></p>
<p>If you’re returning from an area that’s had a coronavirus outbreak, or if you’ve been in close contact with someone who tests positive, you may be asked to isolate yourself at home for two weeks, the presumed incubation period for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>It’s not easy to lock yourself away from your family and friends. These are the basics.</p>
<p><em>Isolation</em> If you are infected or have been exposed to the coronavirus, you must seclude yourself from your partner, your housemates, your children, your older aunt and even your pets. If you don’t have your own room, one should be designated for your exclusive use. No visitors unless it’s absolutely essential. Don’t take the bus, subway or even a taxi.</p>
<p><em>Masks</em> If you must be around other people — in your home, or in a car, because you’re on your way to see a doctor (and only after you’ve called first) — wear a mask. Everyone else should, too.</p>
<p><em>Hygiene</em> Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue to cough or sneeze, and discard it in a lined trash can. Immediately wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. You can use sanitizer, but soap and water are preferred. Wash your hands frequently and avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth, if you haven’t just washed them.</p>
<p><em>Disinfecting</em> Don’t share dishes, drinking glasses, eating utensils, towels or bedding. Wash these items after you use them. Use a household cleaner to wipe down countertops, tabletops, doorknobs, bathrooms fixtures, toilets, phones, keyboards, tablets and bedside tables. That also goes for any surfaces that may be contaminated by bodily fluids.</p>
<p><em>Household</em> <em>members</em> When around the patient, wear a face mask, and add gloves if you’re touching anything that might carry the patient’s bodily fluids. Dispose of the mask and gloves immediately. The older members and those with chronic medical conditions should minimize contact with the secluded individual.</p>
