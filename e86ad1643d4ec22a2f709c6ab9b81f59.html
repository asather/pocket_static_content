<p><strong>THEATER:&nbsp;</strong><strong>‘Chronicles’ of assistance</strong></p>
<p>On May 11, 2015, Mark Clayton Southers, founder and leader of Pittsburgh Playwrights Theater company, was seriously injured in a car accident. Over the next year he wrote 99 essays documenting his recovery.</p>
<p>With theaters closed nationwide, Southers, a writer, director and photographer, established an Artist Assistance Fund to distribute donations to Pittsburgh theater artists in need. He reached out to 99 actors to support this mission, and they have begun readings of <strong>“The 99 Chronicles,”</strong> available at www.pghplaywrights.org. First up on Friday was “Chronicles #20: Pills, pills, pills!,” read by David Conrad.</p>
<p>The videos at <a href="/pghplaywrights.org" target="_blank">pghplaywrights.org</a> are free, but the nonprofit Pittsburgh Playwrights is asking for contributions to its assistance fund.</p>

<p><strong>Saturday, March 21</strong></p>
<p><strong>THEATER:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Drive-in stage</strong></p>
<p>As Pittsburgh theaters find ways to reach audiences, the Plaza Theatre Co. of Cleburne, Texas (near Fort Worth), is finding a way to work and maintain social distance. After having to shut down its production of "Little House on the Prairie," the theater regrouped to create drive-in live theater.</p>
<p>The actors will perform a free "drive up" theater production called "The Nifty Fifties." Patrons can park in the theater's parking lot and watch and listen (via radio set up) from their cars. The show will feature fifties songs by a small group of five performers, singing mostly solos and dud</p>
<p>The cabaret style show begins at 7:30 p.m. and will stream live on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PlazaCo/" target="_blank">The Plaza Theatre Facebook page</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WEEKNIGHTS</strong></p>
<p><strong>TELEVISION:&nbsp;‘The Tonight Show: At Home Edition’</strong></p>
<p>If you want to get a sense of what it’s like for celebrities to work and parent 24/7, plus see stars such as Lin-Manuel Miranda and Jennifer Garner, check out “The Tonight Show: At Home Edition.”</p>
<p>While other late-night talk show hosts have gone to strictly repeats, JImmy Fallon and his family have been recording from home. His wife, Nancy, is his camera operator, and his three daughters create the “graphics” for the NBC show, airing at 11:35 p.m.</p>
<p>On Thursday, Miranda was his first guest, via Zoom, and performed “Dear Theodosia” from his at-home keyboard, while Garner played “Happy Birthday” on the clarinet. Both artists pitched for charities, including #SaveWithStories, launched by actresses Garner and Amy Adams as a fundraiser for Save The Children and No Kid Hungry (more at <a href="http://www.savethechildren.org" target="_blank">www.savethechildren.org</a>).</p>
