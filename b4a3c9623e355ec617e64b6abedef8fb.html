<p>Beaver County reported 13 new deaths due to COVID-19, according to the latest figures released by the state health department on Tuesday. No other information was immediately available about the deaths, but the state indicated that Beaver County reported 13 deaths at its nursing/long-term care homes. In Allegheny County, there were 11 new deaths reported, with eight new deaths reported at nursing homes. Westmoreland County also reported one death at a nursing care facility.</p>
<p>Statewide, the number of cases increased by 1,214 for a total of 43,264. Deaths in Pennsylvania grew by 119 for a total of 1,716.</p>
<p>Despite Beaver County’s spike in deaths, it reported just one new case of COVID-19. Allegheny County reported 11 new cases.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s total case count rose to 1,235 — 1,193 confirmed and 42 probable —&nbsp;and its death count rose to 87 — 78 confirmed and nine probable — since the first case was reported on March 14.&nbsp;A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>Both the state and Allegheny county have seen somewhat encouraging numbers in recent days. Monday marked Pennsylvania’s third day in a row with less than 50 reported deaths from COVID-19. On Sunday, Allegheny reported zero new deaths.</p>
<p>With the exception of Westmoreland County, where its coroner reported three new deaths, bringing its total to 30, there were no other fatalities blamed on COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania reported Monday.</p>
<p>The state is still reporting probable cases, which Dr. Levine said represent less than 1% of total cases, but is no longer reporting probable deaths — those that list COVID-19 on the death certificate but do not have a positive test. Last week, the state removed over 90% of probable deaths from the count after deciding that they needed further investigation.</p>
<p>Of the 1,235 cases in Allegheny County, 222 have required hospitalization. Of them, 87 made visits to the intensive care unit and 52 required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania. Philadelphia has the highest number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the state with&nbsp;11,604 and 276, respectively.</p>
