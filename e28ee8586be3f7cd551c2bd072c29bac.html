<p>Pennsylvania’s hospitals will take an even bigger financial hit this year than previously thought, according to a new analysis commissioned by the state hospital association.</p>
<p>The losses this year could exceed $10 billion statewide between lost revenue from postponed or cancelled elective treatment and an expected jump in uninsured and medical assistance patients due to job losses, the report says.</p>
<p>The loss could be partially reduced should hospitals receive an expected $3.13 billion in federal corona virus relief funding.</p>
<p>Analysis for the Harrisburg-based Hospital and Healthsystem Association (HAP) estimates that for the last half of March alone — after federal and state officials told hospitals to cancel or reschedule non-emergency services — Pennsylvania hospital operating margins declined $914 million.</p>
<p>If negative margins are 10% of revenue for the remainder of the year, it says, there will be an additional $4.7 billion margin shortfall, which HAP President and CEO Andy Carter called “a staggering number.”</p>
<p>Elective procedures typically are more lucrative for hospitals. But canceling them did not significantly improve hospitals’ operating expenses due to the often-intensive care treating COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>Mr. Carter said in a telephone media briefing Wednesday that the association is having detailed discussions with Gov. Tom Wolf’s office and Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine “to establish guidelines to ensure the resumption of non-emergent health care services” in a manner that protects both the safety of patients and their care providers.</p>
<p>He expects the resumption will occur in staggered fashion across the state as “some will be ready sooner than others.”</p>
<p>UPMC, the region’s largest provider, has notably resisted state orders to temporarily halt all non-emergency procedures, although new federal guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) has said hospitals in areas with low incidence of COVID-19 cases could resume those services.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, more than 50 House Republicans sent Dr. Levine a letter urging her to establish a protocol for resuming non-emergency services so hospitals could “immediately begin performing elective surgical procedures in those counties who have not had a significant impact of the coronavirus resulting in COVID-19.”</p>
<p>Mr. Carter said hospitals and health systems would work collaboratively with the state Department of Health “to establish guidelines that would allow the safe and effective resumption” of those services.</p>
<p>The 11-page analysis was done by the Michigan-based Health Management Associates analytics firm based on interviews with leaders at 11 hospital systems, including Excela Health in Westmoreland County.</p>
<p>Neither UPMC, Allegheny Health System nor Heritage Valley Health System leaders were listed as participants. Mr. Andy Carter said he is “very confident of the findings,” noting that the respondents represent 40% of the industry statewide.</p>
