<h1>Dapper Dan honors: Steelers 'never saw a flinch' from Mike Tomlin in 2019</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As a former Army Ranger who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, Al Villanueva knows all about having leaders and trusting them on the battlefield. And, as a two-time Pro Bowl left tackle with the Steelers, he is adroitly capable of identifying those same leadership qualities on the fields of the National Football League.</p>
<p>And he sees that in Mike Tomlin.</p>
<p>“The Steeler culture, in my opinion, is how to do it as a leader, and, for me, I’d be Coach Tomlin,” Villanueva said. “If I could go back to the real army, if I went to the corporate world, I would want to be him. He understands how to maximize everyone’s potential and creates an environment where you win at life. You don’t win at football; you win at life.”</p>
<p>As the second-longest tenured head coach in the NFL, Tomlin had to lean on everything he has experienced in his 13 years as head coach with the Steelers to pull his team through a season that had the potential to be disastrous but instead ended up surprising and darn-near magical. It started with three consecutive losses and it ended the same way, but in between Tomlin managed to do what any coach hopes to do — keep his players believing.</p>
<p>And he did it without his two-time Super Bowl winning quarterback, who sustained a season-ending elbow injury just two weeks into the regular season. And he did it with two quarterbacks who had never appeared in an NFL game and were greener than the grass on which they played.</p>
<p>“This year, when things unraveled with the injuries, it was never a woe-is-me feeling,” said general manager Kevin Colbert. “It was, ‘OK, Ben’s out, let’s go; Stephon Tuitt is hurt, let’s go; we’re not going to have James Conner or JuJu (Smith-Schuster) this week, OK, this is who we got, let’s go.’ I think the players responded because they never saw him flinch. It wasn’t surprising to anybody that you never saw a flinch.”</p>
<p>Because of his ability to guide the Steelers from a disastrous start and a plethora of significant injuries to the precipice of the postseason in 2019, Tomlin will receive the Dr. Freddie Fu Sports Leadership Award at <a href="https://one.bidpal.net/dapperdan20/welcome" target="_blank">the 84th Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction</a> on Feb. 10 at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown. Even though the Steelers lost their final three games to finish with an 8-8 record, many consider Tomlin’s coaching performance to be one of the best of his 13-year career with the franchise.</p>
<p>“There’s no question this year was different,” Steelers president Art Rooney II said. “I think we faced different kinds of adversity — starting out 0-3, losing your starting quarterback — those are tough things to overcome. I’ve seen different teams around the league respond not too well to those circumstances. I think Mike kept everybody focused, kept them believing we could be successful. That’s a big part of it, having a team believe they can continue to compete. We were in the hunt all the way to the end.”</p>
<p>And Tomlin did it the only way he knows how: By staying the course, never panicking, focusing more on the players he did have each week rather than the ones he didn’t. It didn’t matter that the entrance to the team’s South Side facility was a like a revolving door for new players or that members of the practice squad were just a sore knee away from playing, sometimes even starting, in an NFL game.</p>
<p>If there is one thing Tomlin likes, it is a challenge, even one such as he faced this past season.</p>
<p>“I think the National Football League, particularly from a coaches’ standpoint, is a competitor’s league,” Tomlin said the other day, reflecting on a season that saw the Steelers miss the playoffs for the second year in a row. “I’m a competitor. I enjoy the challenges each season presents. Maybe I’ve been doing it long enough that it’s easy for me to have this perspective, but we’re all given a certain amount of materials, resources, budgets. We all have access to quality players. We had eight opportunities at home, we had eight opportunities on the road, we have the same calendar structure. I like how fair it is.</p>
<p>“And so we all go into training camp every year with that fairness in mind, and then the journey starts and things happen. And our ability to insulate ourselves from those things happening and our ability to adjust really kind of defines that. I enjoy that. I expect the unexpected. I don’t know that I go into any season with any preconceived notion other than we’re going to be challenged and we’re going to be challenged in a big way.”</p>
<p>The biggest unexpected was losing Ben Roethlisberger in Week 2 with an elbow injury that required season-ending surgery — the first time since he came into the league in 2004 that he played fewer than 12 games. Then, one month later, it was watching his most disruptive defensive lineman, Stephon Tuitt, go down with a season-ending pectoral injury. After that, three Pro Bowl players — running back James Conner (6), receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster (5) and center Maurkice Pouncey (3) —&nbsp;missed a combined total of 14 games.</p>
<p>Throw in trying to navigate the highs and lows of backup quarterbacks Mason Rudolph and rookie Devlin Hodges, neither of whom had ever appeared in an NFL game, and it somehow seems remarkable the Steelers managed to win eight of their next 10 games after an 0-3 start.</p>
<p>“You don’t ever want to have as many injuries as we’ve had, and coming off the season before and everything that went on during the offseason,” Pro Bowl defensive end Cam Heyward said. “But the thing that I loved about Coach Tomlin through it all was he was attacking it. There was never a moment where I felt like he sat back. He was very open about what was going on. He took on a role where he was going to be more hands-on with every group. I appreciated that.”</p>
<p>Said Rooney: “There is no question Mike did a great job. One of the head coach’s biggest jobs is to keep the team focused, keep the team fighting through adversity, and we certainly had more than our share of it to fight through this year. I think being able to do that starts with your head coach and obviously some of the leadership we have on this team. I think that paid dividends this year and [I’m] happy with the way Mike handled everything and the way the coaching staff handled everything.”</p>
<p>Colbert, who has been with the Steelers since 2000, said Tomlin’s leadership skills are innate. He commands a room, any room, without even trying. Monte Kiffin, his former defensive coordinator when he broke into the league with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2001, said “you could feel the room come alive” the first time he interviewed Tomlin to be their secondary coach.</p>
<p>When Rooney and his dad, Dan, the late former owner and chairman, interviewed Tomlin for their head-coach position in 2007, they each saw a person who could stand stood in front of a room and command everyone’s attention. “Those are qualities you want to have in a head coach, and Mike certainly has that ability,” Rooney said.</p>
<p>“He’s so natural in any setting, he doesn’t even need to try to be inclusive,” Colbert said. “If he walks into a room, he just fits, and it doesn’t take long for people to put him in a leadership type capacity because he doesn’t try to be that person, it just happens. The team understands that obviously. When he walks in to address the team or on the practice field there’s no question who’s the leader. But it’s just so natural for him. Like any great leader, it just happens.”</p>
<p>That was put to the test in the summer, early in training camp, when his friend and receivers coach, Darryl Drake, died in his dormitory room at Saint Vincent College in Latrobe. Drake was a friend and confidant to all the players, not just his receivers, and his death was an emotional forearm to Tomlin and the team. It was a difficult way to start to a season, particularly this one.</p>
<p>The Steelers were going through a “cleansing” — Tomlin’s words — because they had rid themselves of two of their best players, receiver Antonio Bell and running back Le’Veon Bell, in the offseason because of the repeated and, in Brown’s case, inexcusable distractions they had caused the team.</p>
<p>But Tomlin never blinked. Even when the Steelers opened the season in New England and were blasted by the Patriots, 33-3, then lost Roethlisberger right before halftime the following week against Seattle, the resolve never changed. The man who reads and quotes Robert Frost and uses expressionless faces to deliver many of his pointed messages only became more, in his words, thoughtfully non-rhythmic.</p>
<p>“Singular focus,” Tomlin said, identifying the element most essential to keeping a team together through tough times. “The direction of the focus, the ability to tune out the noise, and whatever ways that you tune out the noise, that allows the team to No. 1, prepare, and No. 2, go play. We all have that opportunity week in and week out. Our ability to focus throughout that and prepare ourselves to deliver is a big proponent of delivering. Sometimes when you’re carrying negativity, it makes that process more difficult and leadership’s job is to minimize that.”</p>
<p>Tomlin’s leadership did that.</p>
