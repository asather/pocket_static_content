<h1>Heinz History Center furloughs staff </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Senator John Heinz History Center will fully or partially furlough more than half of its 130 employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Andy Masich, president and chief executive officer of the museum, announced the layoffs Friday in a written statement.</p>
<p>On March 14, the Heinz History Center closed its doors and also shuttered Point State Park’s Fort Pitt Museum, which it operates. The history center also runs Meadowcroft&nbsp; Rockshelter and Historic Village, the oldest site of human habitation in North America, which was slated to open for the season May 2.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The doors of the Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum, and Meadowcroft Rockshelter and Historic Village will remain closed until further notice. These extended closures and the attendant loss of revenue require that the history center make additional budget cuts and staff furloughs,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>“Nearly all of our remaining staff members will be affected by pay adjustments and many will be redeployed to concentrate on essential activities, including security and safety, preservation of Smithsonian and History Center collections, facilities and asset protection, communications, finance and funding, and distance/virtual education programs,” Mr. Masich said in his statement.</p>
<p>Ms. Masich said the museum’s board members and staff have developed a financial plan that reallocates resources and takes advantage of existing and new federal and state assistance for the museum and its employees.</p>
<p>“Government agencies, foundations,&nbsp;banks, donors, and creditors have all demonstrated a willingness to work with us, as they are able, to protect the History Center, Pittsburgh’s oldest cultural institution, and enable us to deliver historical research materials, publications, films, exhibitions, and educational programs remotely,” Mr. Masich said.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh and the history center, Mr. Masich noted,&nbsp;“have survived (in one form or another) the Great Fire of 1845, the Spanish Flu of 1918, the St. Patrick’s Day Flood of 1936, the Great Depression, and the Pittsburgh Diaspora. As resilient as we are, the repercussions of this pandemic pose an existential threat to the history center and all of our regional cultural institutions. There is no doubt that we will all be changed by this event.”</p>
<p>“I believe we will survive and in some ways emerge stronger than ever. With the help of our community, we can, and will, do it,” he added.</p>
