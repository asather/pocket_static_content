<p>Former Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Ridge criticized those protesting the stay-at-home orders as dishonoring America’s veterans.</p>
<p>“In recent days, we have seen images of Americans carrying weapons as part of their protests to immediately reopen society,” Ridge wrote in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2020/04/29/coronavirus-stay-at-home-protests-dishonor-veterans-column/3038871001/" target="_blank">an op-ed column Wednesday in USA Today</a>. “What are they planning to do, shoot the virus with their AR-15s?”</p>
<p>Ridge, who also served as the country’s first Secretary of Homeland Security, referenced an 86-year-old Vietnam War veteran, Bennie Adkins, who was diagnosed with COVID-19 and eventually died from the virus after a 23-day battle with the virus.</p>
<p>“A little more than 50 years ago, halfway around the world, Bennie’s heroic actions at the battle of Dai Do in Vietnam resulted in his being awarded the Medal of Honor,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he said, recent protesters whom he called “self-absorbed and selfish Americans” complain “they are irritated, anxious, bored, upset — unhappy that their lives have been affected by this temporary restraint on their freedoms. Some have even gotten into confrontations with nurses and other front-line health care workers who believe now is not the time to resume normality.”</p>
<p>Ridge said he understood why people were protesting, acknowledging that the shutdowns, stay-at-home orders, and isolation have led to economic pain.</p>
<p>“Let’s consider that while out of work, and I don’t for a minute minimize the real financial pain this is causing, they are generally confined to their homes, with refrigerators, televisions, the internet and the ability to take a walk, go to the store or just talk to a neighbor,” he said.</p>
<p>But, he added, “…if we check the history books and remind ourselves that we are a resilient country and that we can prevail in this battle if we work together.”</p>
