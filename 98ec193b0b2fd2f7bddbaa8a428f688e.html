<h1>Could Mars' Michael Carmody miss part of the state basketball playoffs?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Michael Carmody’s status with the Mars basketball team for the PIAA playoffs is up in the air because he is facing disciplinary action from the WPIAL.</p>
<p>The WPIAL sent a letter to Mars on Monday outlining a penalty it wanted to be imposed on Carmody for a foul he committed in the WPIAL Class 5A championship Friday, and also his actions after the game. Neither the WPIAL nor Mars coach Rob Carmody (Michael’s father) would reveal the penalty, but such penalties on a player usually involve a suspension from a game or games. Mars begins the PIAA playoffs Friday.</p>
<p>After receiving the letter, Mars requested a hearing on the matter with the WPIAL board of directors. The hearing will be Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Because it’s a matter of student discipline, we can’t reveal what we told them in the letter,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “If it were about a team or a school, we could talk. The penalty already has been levied. Whether the board decides to alter the penalty will be based on Mars’ request and the hearing.”</p>
<p>Rob Carmody declined comment on the matter.</p>
<p>Mars lost to Laurel Highlands in the WPIAL championship at Petersen Events Center and might not have Carmody for the PIAA playoffs if he is suspended. He has been one of the most dominating players in Western Pennsylvania this season. Carmody, a Notre Dame football recruit, is a 6-foot-7, 290-pound standout forward who is averaging 19 points and 19 rebounds a game.</p>
<p>Carmody was called for an intentional foul in the third quarter of the WPIAL final when he grabbed a rebound and swung an elbow in the direction of Laurel Highlands’ Rodney Gallagher. But Carmody was not charged with a flagrant foul.</p>
<p>Mars lost, 52-51, and had a chance to win the game when Mihali Sfanos drove to the basket, but his shot in the lane was off the mark just before the final buzzer. Sfanos and a Laurel Highlands player fell to the ground on the play. Some thought a blocking foul should be called.</p>
<p>When the buzzer went off, Michael Carmody ran up to an official, complaining that a foul should’ve been called. He then kicked the basketball to halfcourt into Laurel Highlands players who were celebrating.</p>
<p>If Carmody is suspended or penalized, it brings about an interesting situation where the WPIAL would be taking action on a player after a game when officials took no action.</p>
<p>But Scheuneman said, “This is not the first incident we addressed with [Mars] this year.”</p>
