<h1>Steelers' right tackle job still up for grabs during difficult evaluation period</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers open the season in exactly three weeks against the New York Giants on Monday Night Football. Every starting position is accounted for — except one.</p>
<p>And it’s a rather important position considering the most important part of the job description is protecting Ben Roethlisberger.</p>
<p>The job at right tackle remains open as training camp rolls on at Heinz Field. Chukwuma Okorafor and Zach Banner are battling for the spot after Matt Feiler, the starting right tackle the past two seasons, moved inside to play left guard.</p>
<p>“The evaluation has to be fast, but I’m not in a hurry about it,” offensive line coach Shaun Sarrett said on Friday. “It could be a deal where I’m going to let them compete all the way up into the week of practice [before the opener]. I’m not going to make that decision right now or be forced into it. They’re out there competing every day.”</p>
<p>One reason the Steelers are taking their time is the relative lack of inexperience of both players. Okorafor, a third-round pick in 2018, has two starts on his resume — one as a rookie against the Broncos and one last year against the Rams. Banner has never started a game at tackle in his previous three NFL seasons.</p>
<p>“Every day, whether I’m with the 1s or 2s, it doesn’t matter if it’s team [period] or seven shots, I just go out there and do my best,” Okorafor said Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>Right now they’re both taking reps with the first-team offense. When they’re not with the starters, they’re working as an extra blocking tight end. It’s the role Banner played last year when he served as the top backup tackle, and it’s a role Okorafor played some as a rookie.</p>
<p>Banner earned the swing tackle job over Okorafor last season, dressing for 14 games and playing 222 snaps at tight end. Okorafor only dressed for one game — his start against the Rams — in part because he was coming off labrum surgery that forced him to miss OTAs and minicamp in the spring of 2019.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to make an excuse for last year in terms of it being a problem, but there was a little pain last year during camp,” Okorafor said. “It was tough, for sure, but now I feel great.”</p>
<p>The start against the Rams came on Nov. 10 when Ramon Foster was injured and could not play. Sarrett explained his reasoning behind moving Feiler inside. He believed Feiler would hold up well against All-Pro defensive tackle Aaron Donald, and he was right. Feiler did more than hold his own against the best defensive lineman in the game.</p>
<p>It also spoke to the confidence they had in Okorafor to dress him for the first time all season and play him against the defending NFC champions.</p>
<p>“I thought to myself my job is to put the best five out there, and that week, that was the best five,” Sarrett said. “I commend [Feiler] for what he did against Aaron and so forth. He played hard. There were situations where he had a bunch of one-on-ones against the guy, and he performed well. That’s another thing. You’re sitting here, and your evaluation gets cut. You’re sitting here, and you’re like, who are the best five?</p>
<p>“Well, I know [Feiler] can do that. He can go inside and play guard at a high level. I know he can go out to right tackle and play a high level. All right, well, who’s the next guy up? That’s where we’re at right now. We’re finding that next piece to set our line for the year.”</p>
<p>Sarrett said the pandemic played a role in how they’re evaluating all positions on the line in training camp. In a normal year, Stefen Wisniewski, who was signed as a free agent in March, and Kevin Dotson, who was drafted in April, might have competed for the starting job at guard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But without OTAs and minicamp, those plans were put on the back shelf. Wisniewski remains an option to earn a starting job, but first crack is going to Okorafor and Banner because of their experience in the Steelers’ system.</p>
<p>“I had seen Anchor go in there and play guard in a game last year,” Sarrett said, referencing Feiler by his nickname. “I’ve seen Chuks play tackle. I’ve seen Banner play tackle. We went into this idea that we were going to have to evaluate fast. We are going to start there and make our evaluation from there.</p>
<p>“Both of those guys outside have done a good job. Anchor has done a great job moving. That’s one thing that I’ll credit Anchor for. He played a high level at tackle last year, and he didn’t bat an eye when we asked him to move inside. He’s ready to go, and we appreciate that.”</p>
<p>Now it’s up to Okorafor or Banner to grab a hold of the right tackle job — and the faster it happens, the better. Offensive lines take some time to mesh and the winner of the competition will benefit with more reps alongside the other starters as the Steelers prepare for the Giants and the rest of the season.</p>
<p>“I think there’s obviously a difference between practice and games, so the more you play the better you feel,” Okorafor said of his experience starting twice previously. “You know what to expect. Practice is different in terms of the speed of the game. The more games you play you get a sense of this might happen or that might happen.”</p>
