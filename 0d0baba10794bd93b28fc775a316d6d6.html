<h1>Death of woman paralyzed in 2005 Brighton Heights shooting ruled a homicide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Glen Hazel woman's death in January has been ruled a homicide and&nbsp;linked to her being shot and partially paralyzed as a teen in 2005.</p>
<p>Tionna Highsmith died Jan. 27 in her apartment on Roselle Court. She was 29.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office determined that she&nbsp;died as a result of complications from paraplegia associated with a&nbsp;suspected gunshot wound.</p>
<p>Ms. Highsmith lost the use of her legs at the age of 14 after being wounded&nbsp;during a drive-by shooting at a Brighton Heights church festival in&nbsp;August 2005.</p>
<p>Police believed she was an innocent who got caught in a crossfire&nbsp;between rival gangs when she wandered over to see a commotion involving two women fighting in the street.</p>
<p>Someone dangling out a car window fired a 9mm handgun numerous times in Ms. Highsmith’s direction.</p>
<p>Her shooting remains unsolved.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police said Monday they are continuing to investigate.</p>
