<p><strong><em>This is a developing story and will be updated:</em></strong></p>
<p>The Pirates on Wednesday announced that they’ve signed Nick Gonzales, their first-round draft pick from earlier this month.</p>
<p>Gonzales, out of New Mexico State, was expected to sign for slot value ($5,432,400), a source told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Tuesday. The Pirates did not announce terms of the deal.</p>
<p>The 21-year-old infielder ranked first in the NCAA when the college baseball season was stopped in home runs (12), runs scored (28), RBIs (36) and total bases (67) while switching from second base to shortstop.</p>
<p>Gonzales concluded his career with the Aggies by reaching base safely in 82 consecutive games.</p>
<p>“We are thrilled to add Nick Gonzales to the Pirates family,” Pirates general manager Ben Cherington said. “Nick has been an elite performer at every level of his baseball career. Nick has a broad skill set which allows him to impact multiple areas of the game. Just as importantly, Nick has demonstrated a deep passion for the game and for learning and improvement.</p>
<p>“We believe those qualities will allow him to continue finding new levels of performance and, one day, to become a valuable member of our major league team. We welcome Nick and his family to the Pirates.”</p>
<p>Gonzales began his college career as a walk-on and, with a tremendous work ethic, eventually became one of the country’s best hitters.</p>
<p>Gonzales’ draft stock received a big boost after his performance in the Cape Cod League in the summer of 2019, when he was the MVP after hitting .351 with 14 doubles, four triples, seven home runs and 33 RBIs in 42 games.</p>
<p>“This has been his dream for a long time,” Gonzales' father, Mike, said Wednesday morning. “As long as the Pirates were fair, he was signing. There was no way around that.”</p>
