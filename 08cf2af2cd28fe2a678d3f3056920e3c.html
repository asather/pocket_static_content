<h1>Jackie Robinson-George Shuba statue in Youngstown aims to promote equality</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The way Mike Shuba imagines it, children from various elementary schools will visit downtown Youngstown, Ohio, and sit in a set of sandlot-style stands located in Wean Park, between the Covelli Centre and the Youngstown Foundation Amphitheatre.</p>
<p>When they look up, they’ll see a statue of Jackie Robinson crossing home plate at Roosevelt Stadium in Jersey City, N.J., and shaking hands with Mike’s father, George “Shotgun” Shuba, during a minor league game while with the Montreal Royals on April 18, 1946.</p>
<p>The image depicted might not look like anything special to a youngster in 2021, but that’s the entire point of the project, Mike Shuba said. Not only to commemorate Robinson, who broke baseball’s color barrier, but to celebrate a moment of acceptance, George Shuba extending a congratulatory right hand whenever the two baserunners who had scored on Robinson’s home run snubbed the shortstop.</p>
<p>“I hope people will look at it as a corrective to what is going on today,” Mike Shuba said. “I hope it inspires people to do great things by looking at the statue and remembering this moment.”</p>
<p>The Shuba story involves a bronze statue, a pavilion type memorial and the ongoing goal to raise $400,000 to fund the entire project — which will be finished on April 18, 2021, 75 years after the moment occurred — but in reality, it’s much more than that.</p>
<p>As baseball — and society — wrestles with a social reckoning, one that’s long overdue and needed to promote equality both inside and outside of the sport, Shuba hopes the statue of his father and Robinson shaking hands promotes a message of acceptance and understanding.</p>
<p>The same way George Shuba taught his son to live life.</p>
<p>“My dad always said he didn’t care if Jackie was technicolor,” Mike Shuba said. “He was on our team. He was on our side. That was all there was to it.</p>
<p>“He didn’t think anything of it. It was just the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>The moment in question happened the year before Robinson made his major league debut. In the third inning, Robinson hit a three-run homer, part of a four-hit afternoon in a 14-1 victory for the Royals. Shuba was a utility outfielder and pinch-hitter for the Dodgers from 1948-1955 and helped the Dodgers win the World Series in 1955.</p>
<p>Mike Shuba said his dad was an altar boy growing up and routinely played alongside and against Black athletes at Chaney High School in Youngstown. Even though George Shuba was white, Mike said George always impressed upon his kids the need to treat everyone equally.</p>
<p>“He always said, ‘If you’re ever put on the spot, just do the right thing and everything will work out fine,’ ” Mike Shuba said. “Shaking Jackie’s hand was the right thing to do.”</p>
<p>The edict resulted in one life lesson that Mike Shuba remembers to this day.</p>
<p>George Shuba wasn’t much for displaying any of his old baseball stuff. He actually kept it in a pair of old Maytag boxes downstairs … except for the photo of George Shuba shaking Robinson’s hand. That was the only picture on their living room wall.</p>
<p>One day after school, after Mike had some sort of issue with another kid in his kindergarten class, he walked into a lecture from his dad.</p>
<p>“My father was sitting in his chair in the living room,” Mike Shuba said. “He pointed up to the handshake photo, which was above his chair, and told me, ‘Look at that photo. I want you to remember what that photo stands for. … You treat all people equally.’ ”</p>
<p>Mike Shuba is 58 now. He majored in electrical engineering, worked as a cell phone technician and gave that up to travel the country with his father — who passed away in 2014 at age 89 — to share their message of inclusion.</p>
<p>It might be more important now than ever, Mike Shuba said, and it’s taken a team of people — and some ingenuity — to put it all together.</p>
<p>A big moment was when Mike Shuba received a phone call almost a year ago from a guy named Eric Planey, a New York businessman and the former Youngstown/Warren Regional Chamber vice president.</p>
<p>Planey wanted to help erect a statue, Mike Shuba loved the idea, and that helped spawn the <a href="https://robinsonshuba.org/" target="_blank">Robinson-Shuba Commemorative Statue Committee</a>, which along with the Economic Action Group, a Youngstown development advocate, set out to raise the necessary funds.</p>
<p>Several co-chairs have helped push this forward: Mike Shuba; Greg Gulas, a retired sports information director at Youngstown State; Herb Washington, a former baserunning specialist for the Oakland A’s; and Ernie Brown, a longtime editor at the Youngstown Vindicator.</p>
<p>The statue, which will be nearly 7-feet tall and stand near the Mahoning River, is being designed by Marc Mellon, a Connecticut-based sculptor.</p>
<p>“To actually be involved in a project that would have a statue of Jackie Robinson here I think is very important,” Brown said. “I think the people of Youngstown need to know — particularly ... the millennials and young Black people still living in the city — how important Youngstown was in this situation in history, where the color barrier was broken.”</p>
<p>The project is extra special to Brown, 68. He grew up hearing stories from his father, who was from Arkansas, and his grandmother, who was from Alabama, about segregation and how Black people were not afforded the same luxuries as whites.</p>
<p>It was equally as difficult for Brown to tell his son several decades ago now about Robinson, how it wasn’t always the case that Black athletes were allowed to compete like everyone else.</p>
<p>“I think the connection with having this statue, showing that a Youngstown man was involved in the breaking of the color barrier, that actually was the springboard for allowing Blacks to play in all of the major professional sports, is significant,” Brown said. “And I think they need to know how a Youngstown native played a small part in that history.”</p>
<p>Fundraising got off to a rousing start, with close to $150,000 raised within the six weeks, Brown said. It has since stalled, which is likely tied to the coronavirus pandemic.&nbsp;There’s a GoFundMe page for the statue, which as of Monday listed a total of $163,359.</p>
<p>Both Mike Shuba and Brown are confident the goal will be reached, even if progress has been slow of late. They’re also in agreement that this statue will help promote understanding and the need to ensure that everyone is treated equally.</p>
<p>“I know my dad would be very proud if he was here today,” Mike Shuba said. “He passed away in 2014. My mother passed away in 2016. I know both of them, if they could see this, they would be absolutely thrilled to see this happening for the world and for baseball.”</p>
