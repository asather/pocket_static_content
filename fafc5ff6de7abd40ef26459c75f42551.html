<h1>Jahan Dotson has faith in Penn State's returning receivers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are reasons to have doubts about the Penn State receiving corps heading into the 2020 season.</p>
<p>KJ Hamler had 56 catches for 904 yards with eight touchdowns on his way to getting drafted by the Denver Broncos.&nbsp;Justin Shorter and Mac Hippenhammer have transferred to other schools. Jahan Dotson is the elder statesman of a group of wideouts that includes redshirt freshman John Dunmore, a redshirt sophomore Daniel Jones and a redshirt freshman TJ Jones.</p>
<p>Other than Dotson, the majority of the unit hasn’t had much experience playing on Saturdays.&nbsp;The Nazareth, Pa., native has heard the dissent and has a response for those concerns.</p>
<p>“We have to come out and prove that we’re the best group on the team,” Dotson said. “It has to start from Day 1. We have to show that we’re the group that works the hardest. A lot of people have us as one of the weaker spots. We’re going to prove ourselves every day.”</p>
<p>That hopefully will start for Dotson and his band of pass catchers next Monday. Dotson said he took a COVID-19 test Monday as part of the first wave of Nittany Lions football players who arrived back on campus this week and sequestered at a hotel in University Park. It’s different, but Dotson didn’t seem too bothered by the changes.</p>
<p>“I’m going to adapt to whatever environment that I need to so that we can be successful,” Dotson said. “It’s a sacrifice. But sacrifice is one of the core values of our team.”</p>
<p>Dotson caught 27 passes for 488 yards and five touchdowns last year, and people in the program believe that is the tip of the iceberg for him. Taylor Stubblefield, Penn State’s wide receivers coach, holds the Big Ten record for career receptions (325) from his time playing at Purdue from 2001-04. Stubblefield racked up 3,629 yards and 27 touchdowns during his time as a Boilermaker.</p>
<p>Stubblefield is confident Dotson can exceed the standard he set.</p>
<p>“Jahan is much more athletic than I ever was,” Stubblefield told reporters in April. “He can do some things naturally that I couldn’t. I was more of a technical-skilled guy. He’s a guy that has more athletic ability than I had.”</p>
<p>This season will be weird, with likely restrictions and guidelines surrounding any return to play. Athletes will have to be more cautious than ever.</p>
<p>“There is going to have to be some accountability toward guys going out and the risk of getting sick,” Dotson said. “That comes with a leadership role. Honestly, I’m just going have to take it on myself, to let guys know that, ‘We need you. We need everyone. All hands on all deck.”</p>
<p>Perhaps, in addition to leading on the field, Dotson can join Gov. Tom Wolf for a PSA off it.</p>
