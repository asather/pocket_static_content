<h1>Bells will ring across Pennsylvania to honor the helpers in COVID-19 pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cities, towns, boroughs, hamlets and municipalities all over the state are being urged to make a joyful noise May 3 as part of “Bells Across Pennsylvania Day.”</p>
<p>At 7 p.m., residents are asked to step outside and ring bells. Clanging pots and pans will do nicely, as well.</p>
<p>Why bells? “It kind of harkens back to the [Liberty] Bell in Philadelphia,” said Jim Nowalk, mayor of Whitehall Borough and president of the Pennsylvania State Mayors Association, which issued the proclamation.</p>
<p>And why all the noise in general? The idea isn’t new, but it’s not common in our region. When the novel coronavirus began to spread and forced people into isolation in Italy, videos of neighbors in apartment buildings singing and playing instruments from balconies begat other ideas.</p>
<p>In New York City, the music continued. Residents began participating in a communal moment of recognition at 7 p.m. every night, about the time many essential workers were returning home.</p>
<p>Bells, whistles, singing, drums, pots and pans and cheers have gone a long way— people might be lonely, but they’re not entirely alone.</p>
<p>Mr. Nowalk said he first heard about the New York moment after his mother, Teresa Nowalk, died April 11. A cousin who lives in NYC had called to express her condolences, and they talked for a while.</p>
<p>“Then she said ‘I have to hurry up, Jimmy, because at 7 o’clock New Yorkers go to their windows and they ring bells for the first responders.’</p>
<p>“And I thought that sounded pretty exciting.”</p>
<p>A fellow mayor, John Hollenbach of Perkasie, Bucks County, later told him that on April 13, his borough had a bell-ringing to honor hometown heroes involved in helping through the pandemic.</p>
<p>In Squirrel Hill and Downtown earlier this month, event planner Evelyn Castillo arranged for an&nbsp;“Illumination Ovation,” where house, office and porch lights were turned on briefly to honor pandemic helpers.</p>
<p>A proclamation was issued by the Bethel Park-based mayors association requesting that houses of worship with outside bells also join people in raising a joyful ruckus for three minutes.</p>
<p>“We’re calling upon our community to participate and honor their hometown heroes, rally with other Pennsylvanians&nbsp;on the front lines of the COVID-19 battlefield, and show resolve to restore their local businesses and civic life to their former prominence,” said Bethel Park Mayor Jack Allen in a statement.</p>
<p>Per the proclamation, the purpose is threefold:</p>
<p>• To recognize and honor first responders, healthcare workers,&nbsp;and employees of grocery stores, pharmacies and other life-sustaining businesses who have maintained essential services&nbsp;to the general public while at risk of infection from COVID-19,&nbsp;and deserve to be celebrated as "hometown heroes."</p>
<p>• To show solidarity with elected officials and residents of&nbsp;municipalities across the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, all of&nbsp;whom are fighting COVID-19 on the frontlines together in their&nbsp;communities.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;To demonstrate a collective resolve that Pennsylvanians will&nbsp;prevail over COVID-19 and work tirelessly to ensure that their&nbsp;businesses and civic life will thrive once again.</p>
<p>The PSMA is also encouraging residents to help one another.</p>
<p>“We want everyone to come together, to do things like deliver goods to shut-ins,” said Chris Kelly, mayor of West Mifflin. He said since the sheltering began, the community has already pulled together with mask-making and impromptu parades for birthdays and holidays.</p>
<p>“As bad as the virus has been, and it’s been cruel, it is comforting to see there is still good out there.”</p>
<p>“If you are aware of someone in your neighborhood [in need], drop them a note, pick up a phone, send them some baked goods,” Mr. Nowalk said.</p>
<p>Castle Shannon Mayor Don Baumgarten said his borough got a lift several weeks ago when the firemen got involved. Coordinating with other local groups, they gave a lift to the Easter Bunny in an&nbsp; parade of vehicles that wound through the streets.</p>
<p>Teachers from the elementary schools followed in their cars, waving to students in their homes.</p>
<p>When the moment arrives Sunday, Mr. Baumgarten will have to make do with what he finds in the kitchen since he doesn’t own a bell. “I’m going to have to bang some pots and pans together.”</p>
