<p>WASHINGTON â€” Attorney General William Barr will self-quarantine out of caution after President Donald Trump and several other lawmakers and aides tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Justice Department spokesperson Kerri Kupec said Sunday that Mr. Barr has had four COVID-19 tests since Friday and that all four have come back negative. She said he will self-quarantine for several days out of an abundance of caution.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr attended one meeting at Justice Department headquarters Friday and stayed home during the weekend, except to be tested. He plans to remain home for several days.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr attended the White House event for Supreme Court nominee Amy Coney Barrett last weekend and was seen on video having a conversation with former Trump aide Kellyanne Conway, who has tested positive for the virus. Neither was wearing a mask.</p>
