<p>If you’re going to build the home of your dreams in Pennsylvania, you might as well reach for the heavens.</p>
<p>The house at <strong>476 Sheets Road</strong> in Champion stands at an elevation of 2,900 feet above sea level and offers spectacular views of the Laurel Highlands. Nearby is Mount Davis, the highest point in the state at 3,213 feet.</p>
<p>Built in 2011 by owner Gary D. Gadley, the timberframe house features walls of windows that show off Laurel Hill and Chestnut Ridge below. The house sits on 35 acres adjacent to Forbes State Forest and the Roaring Run Natural Area.&nbsp;It has six bedrooms, 3½&nbsp;baths and more than 7,000 square feet of living space.</p>
<p>The property is priced at $1.795 million (MLS No. 1442539) and listed with Elaine Shetler-Libent of Keller-Williams Realty (<a href="https://www.palandandfarm.com/idx/listing/PA-WPENN/1442539/476-Sheets-Rd-Champion-PA-15622" target="_blank">www.kw.com</a> or 724-681-0412). There is a <a href="https://fusion.realtourvision.com/939284" target="_blank">virtual tour</a> online and visitation in accordance with state COVID-19 restrictions.</p>
<p>From the driveway, the stone house appears to have only one level. A&nbsp; solarium-style greenhouse connects the main living space to an attached three-car garage to the right. The bedrooms and a private outdoor deck are on the other side.</p>
<p>After walking through the front door, visitors see the open floor plan and a wall of windows that fills the rear A-Frame to take full advantage of the views. The great room at the center has a vaulted, beamed 24-foot ceiling finished in Douglas fir tongue-and-groove panels. A catwalk looks down into the main living space and leads to a cozy den.</p>
<p>The double-walled fireplace extends to the ceiling and features hand-laid stacked stone. The kitchen has custom-made hickory cabinetry, granite counter tops, a built-in television and&nbsp;Bosch appliances that include&nbsp;dual convection ovens and a five-burner cooktop.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A pair of leather recliners face the fireplace, and there are dining tables at the front and rear of the open living space.&nbsp;On the other side of the fireplace is a family room with a built-in entertainment center, custom bar and service area.</p>
<p>The greenhouse has a ceramic tile floor, removable windows and screens and radiant floor heat. Water hookups and floor drains allow it to work as a growing space. There is also an indoor golf range.</p>
<p>The office is trimmed in hickory and has built-in bookcases and cabinets. Radiant floor heat extends into the office and the bedrooms. The master bedroom is part of a suite that includes a private deck and a master bath with an oversized shower for two people with a Koehler DTV electronic shower control system and custom body sprays. The heated tub has remote controls and the counter tops are granite. There is a laundry room with a concealed ironing cabinet.</p>
<p>The grounds include a unique 75-foot observation tower — the real highest point in the state —&nbsp;and a patio with a fire pit and outdoor sound system.</p>
<p>The energy-efficient home has a geothermal heating system with six zones, a foam-insulated concrete foundation and ultra high-efficiency windows. It also has security system and 400-amp electric service.</p>
<p>The property is in the Somerset Area School District and is close to the Hidden Valley and Seven Springs ski resorts and Ohiopyle State Park.</p>
