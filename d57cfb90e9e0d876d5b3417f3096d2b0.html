<h1>Dominik Kahun gets another look on Malkin line as Alex Galchenyuk tumbles down depth chart</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Alex Galchenyuk’s audition got called off much earlier the second time.</p>
<p>The Penguins last week gave the struggling winger another opportunity next to Evgeni Malkin after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/31/jake-guentzel-shoulder-injury-penguins-news/stories/201912310095" target="_blank">Jake Guentzel had shoulder surgery</a>. It took coach Mike Sullivan only a few periods to yell “cut” and call in somebody else.</p>
<p>That was Dominik Kahun, who impressed Sullivan Saturday in 3-2 overtime win against the Canadiens in Montreal. A day later, when the Penguins played host to Florida at PPG Paints Arena, Sullivan kept Kahun on the top line with Malkin and Bryan Rust.</p>
<p>“When we think Dominik is going on a given night, we try to find ice time for him because we think he’s that good. He’s got great offensive instincts. He can score goals,” Sullivan said. “We’re trying to find combinations right now that give us some balance and some consistency. That’s why we made the switch.”</p>
<p>Putting Kahun on the top line midway through the Montreal game gave the Penguins a spark. Eventually, it broke through when Rust swatted the tying goal into an open net after a fortunate bounce off the end boards.</p>
<p>Kahun has been streaky in his first season with the Penguins. It took him 12 games to get his first goal and he was a healthy scratch for one game in early November. He eventually got comfortable and has provided secondary scoring. With 9 goals and 12 assists entering Sunday, Kahun is on a 40-point pace.</p>
<p>“He’s a great kid. He works extremely hard. He responds to some of the decisions the coaches make. He always responds the right way,” Sullivan said. “He’s a competitive kid. He wants to play up the lineup. And he shows it through his play.”</p>
<p>His game has some similarities to that of Dominik Simon. They are smart, shifty players who excel in the give-and-go game. They also are decent defensively. The biggest difference is obvious — Kahun is actually putting the puck in the net. His .148 shooting percentage is more than twice as high as the other Dominik.</p>
<p>Those qualities could help the 24-year-old land a leading role alongside Malkin or next to Sidney Crosby when the captain returns to the lineup.</p>
<p>Galchenyuk, meanwhile, is running out of opportunities to prove himself.</p>
<p>Sullivan felt the Malkin line, with Galchenyuk on the left wing, was “decent” in a loss Thursday to the San Jose Sharks. He wanted to get a longer look at Galchenyuk there but didn’t like what he saw in Montreal — not enough zone time or dangerous scoring chances for Malkin and Rust, two of the hottest players in hockey.</p>
<p>Galchenyuk started Sunday against the Florida Panthers on the fourth line, playing with grinders Joseph Blandisi and Thomas DiPauli.</p>
<p>“Alex is working hard. I know with Alex, it’s really not an effort issue. I see how hard he works every day. It’s an adjustment process,” Sullivan said. “We’ve moved him around the lineup quite a bit this year. We’re trying to find a spot where we think he has a comfort level. And we’ll continue to work with him.”</p>
<p><strong>More work for Murray?</strong></p>
<p>Matt Murray stopped 26 of 28 shots against the Canadiens, a performance that his coach called “terrific.” He earned the win in three of his past four starts.</p>
<p>“We’ve got two goalies that are playing really well for us,” Sullivan said.</p>
<p>Sullivan suggested that Murray, who has started just four games since the start of December, could be in line for more work in the next three weeks.</p>
<p>“We’re [near] the beginning of playing 11 games in 20 days,” he said. “That’s a lot of hockey in a short period of time. We’re going to rely on both of them.”</p>
<p><strong>Taking show on road</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins have been one of the NHL’s toughest teams to beat at home. Recently, they’ve been pretty formidable away from PPG Paints Arena, too. Saturday in in Montreal was their fifth in their past six road games.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we draw up a game plan for the road and [one] for at home,” Sullivan said. “We’re trying to play a game that will bring this team success regardless of where the rink is. It boils down to commitment, execution, discipline. It’s all the things we talk about all the time. When we have it, we’re pretty good.”</p>
<p>Then will need to have it these next three weeks. Following the Florida game, the Penguins will hit the road for a week, with games at Vegas, Colorado and Arizona, all playoff hopefuls. Nine of the next 12 games are on the road.</p>
<p>“I think it will be nice … to go out west and get some nice weather and have some games, but we’ll also have some time to relax and re-energize,” Zach Aston-Reese said. “But these games are huge. [Getting] these points — February and March fly by — is going to put us in a good spot going into the playoffs.”</p>
<p><strong>Around the boards</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan, both before Sunday’s game and after, declined to say whether Crosby would travel with the team out west. ... The Penguins sent Emil Larmi back to Wheeling of the ECHL. Larmi was the backup goalie in Montreal so that Jarry could remain in Pittsburgh to rest for his start Sunday. … Sam Lafferty, who did not play Saturday due to an illness, sat out his second in a row game. … Prospect Calen Addison, a defenseman, won gold at the world junior championship. Addison assisted on all three third-period goals for Canada on Sunday as they rallied to beat Russia, 4-3.</p>
