<h1>COVID-19 dents St. Clair Hospital's operating margin, which still exceeded statewide average</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Not even a strong balance sheet shielded hospitals from the fiscal pain caused by the COVID-19 shutdown in Western Pennsylvania as community hospitals and academic medical giants alike smart from the sudden hit to revenue from dark operating rooms.</p>
<p>But robust fundamentals along with an assist from the federal government helped St. Clair Hospital dodge the worst of the economic pain caused by the shutdown of nonemergency and surgical procedures from mid-May to mid-June to stop the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>Net patient service revenue dipped 3.2% to $292.4 million for the 12 months ending June 30 at the 329-bed Mt. Lebanon hospital, while income from operations skidded 44% to $21.3 million.</p>
<p>The decline in operational revenue fueled a 42% drop in the hospital’s operating margin to 6.9% from 12% a year ago, which is a measure of the institution’s return on providing core medical services.</p>
<p>Still, St. Clair’s operating margin for the year easily topped the statewide hospital average of 5.6% for fiscal 2019 and the Western Pennsylvania operating margin average of 4.5%, according to the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Council.</p>
<p>During the April to June period, heart care at St. Clair took the brunt of the economic hit, with open heart operations, catheterizations and related procedures all down —&nbsp;sometimes by more than half compared to a year ago. Hospital inpatient surgeries during the quarter fell 27.3% to 848 operations from 1,168 a year ago while outpatient surgeries were off 37% to 1,832 from 2,911 a year ago.</p>
<p>St. Clair’s balance sheet was helped by $7.1 million in federal Corona and Relief and Economic Security Act money and payroll tax credits.</p>
<p>Hospitals and health systems of all sizes in the region are smarting from the government-ordered shutdown of nonemergency medical procedures through mid-June, which included postponing some of hospitals’ most lucrative procedures. Citing COVID-19 fallout, health care titans Allegheny Health Network and UPMC each reported losses for the six months ending June 30, $116 million for AHN and $165 million for UPMC.</p>
