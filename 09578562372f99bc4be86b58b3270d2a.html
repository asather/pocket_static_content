<h1>'I worry about them.' Homeless shelters desperately adjust to new social norms amid COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Social distancing is enough of a challenge if you have a home.</p>
<p>To roughly 620 homeless people in Allegheny County, at last count, social isolation is the norm. The shelter they seek is between a rock-and-a hard place right now — both crowded and potentially life saving.</p>
<p>For that reason, shelters in the area remain open, but with more screening, more cleaning and thermometers at the ready during the COVID-19 emergency.</p>
<p>In some cases, their clients face even greater emergencies.</p>
<p>“Our center will always find a place for women who are fleeing for their lives from domestic violence,” said Nicole Molinaro, president and CEO of the Women’s Center and Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, where 50 women and children live at any given time.</p>
<p>“We are anticipating that domestic violence may increase” during the stress of closures, she said. “We know that stress does not cause domestic violence but it can make it worse.”</p>
<p>“It’s an intense moment, because I can’t say to our people, ‘Go home for a few weeks,’” said Rev. Mike Wurschmidt, a co-founder of Shepherd’s Heart Fellowship and CEO of its Veterans Home in Uptown. “What do these precious lives do without a home or food? I can’t close operations and I will not. We need to live out our lives for our brothers.”</p>
<p><strong>Risk factors and solutions?</strong></p>
<p>Homelessness affects thousands across the state — not just in cities but in the most rural of counties, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Community and Economic Development.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania's Chester County, less than 30 minutes southeast of Montgomery County, where the highest number of COVID-19 cases are concentrated in the state, a men's shelter called Good Samaritan Services has had to rely on their own funds to provide food for the nearly 40 men they house across their six housing units in the last week. One is an emergency shelter that holds up to eight men.</p>
<p>One of the hardest things to do is turn people away when maximum capacity is reached, especially during the spread of COVID-19, according to Richard Baxter, lead resident services coordinator of Phoenixville in Chester.&nbsp;Donations from churches and individuals make up about 97% of Good Samaritan’s funding. The other 3% comes from the county, Mr. Baxter said.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday afternoon, four people from Chester had tested positive for COVID-19, while neighboring Montgomery led the state with 32, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. Cases in Allegheny rose to 12 (eight confirmed, four presumed) by Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“We want to be able to help everybody, but its been this way since I came into this position,” he said. Those who don't make it in shelters are often left to fend for themselves, he said.</p>
<p>Homeless shelters need money, and “they need it now,” said Diane Yentel, president and CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition.</p>
<p>“People experiencing homelessness are at high risk of both severe illnesses from coronavirus and of potentially spreading it to others given their inability to isolate or self-quarantine after being exposed to the illness,” she said. “It has never been clearer that housing is health care.</p>
<p>“The Senate must expand on the first, inadequate step taken by the House and quickly pass a bill that includes critical resources to protect people experiencing homelessness and those at risk of homelessness. This is not just a moral imperative; it is an urgent public health necessity.”</p>
<p>The state Department of Health on Monday officially received notice of nearly $17M in federal funds to aid in the pandemic. Department press secretary Nate Wardle said previously some funding will be used for lab equipment, protective clothing for health workers and overtime pay.</p>
<p>Some will be provided to the state’s 10 county and municipal health departments as part of their responses, he said.</p>
<p>Shelter representatives said they are coordinating efforts with their respective counties, in accordance with guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>So how are homeless people to self isolate?</p>
<p>If homeless shelters have a symptomatic client, the CDC recommends shelters alert health facilities that their client is en route, according to Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs. It was not clear whether or not local hospitals are prepared to take in such clients, given that many are encouraging people to stay home if they have symptoms of the virus.</p>
<p>In a statement released by the city&nbsp;on Monday, Pittsburgh Mercy’s Operation Safety Net is working with local officials to “coordinate all camp engagements.”&nbsp;Ms. Downs said the county is “working with partners to identify locations to house individuals who are homeless whose symptoms indicate they should be separate, but are not ill enough to be at a hospital.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>OSN spokeswoman Zandy Dudiak offered minimal comment Wednesday regarding preparations for the homeless at hospitals, citing “a lot of back and forth” in fluid conversations surrounding COVID-19 decisions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Teams are working around the clock trying to figure out what to do,” Ms. Dudiak said.</p>
<p>Allegheny Health Network officials did not immediately respond to request for comment.</p>
<p>Caroline Woodward, philanthropic engagement director at Bethlehem Haven’s social service agency for women in Uptown, described homeless people as “the most vulnerable population.”</p>
<p>“I worry about them,” she said.&nbsp;“They have compromised immune systems” due to their living conditions and underlying health problems.</p>
<p>Many people who are homeless have a history of addiction, abuse, trauma, mental health problems or all of these. The homeless population has declined in Allegheny County since 2017, when the county’s point-in-time January count totaled 675. It counted 631 in 2018 and more than 620 last year.</p>
<p>Bethlehem Haven serves 28 women at full capacity every night. It has operated for nearly 40 years.&nbsp;All visitors are screened before being allowed in, and volunteering and visitations have been halted, Ms. Woodward said. Meal donations from about 225 churches, synagogues and mosques in the state have significantly slowed, she said.</p>
<p>Since last Thursday, at least eleven groups canceled providing meals at Bethlehem Haven.</p>
<p>“We're <strong>changing</strong> our meal times to make sure we can spread the meals out,” she said. “There are plenty of shelters who rely on volunteers to provide meals like we do. We're asking people if they choose to donate, then they can drop it off. Pre-<strong>packaged</strong> meals and not homemade are preferred due to safety concerns.”</p>
<p><strong>‘We want them to stay close’</strong></p>
<p>The Light of Life Rescue Mission on the North Side has been keeping people farther apart during meals and taking temperatures of people when they first come in, said Doug Smith, director of development.</p>
<p>There is a hand-washing station on the sidewalk outside.</p>
<p>Its web site it states that people with symptoms “will be given access to testing through the Allegheny County Health Department. Plans are being put in place to isolate any affected individuals.”</p>
<p>The mission provides 34 beds in the basement, an open, shared space; 10 beds in the chapel and 38 in a long-term program upstairs. Some upstairs rooms are for individuals, others are shared by a few, said executive director Jerrel T. Gilliam.</p>
<p>He said if anyone has a temperature over 100, they are given a to-go meal and a referral to Allegheny General Hospital.</p>
<p>The mission requires that its clients make no unnecessary trips in the next month, “any place there will be crowds,” he said. “We want them to stay close.”</p>
<p>At the East End Cooperative Ministry in East Liberty, homeless clients live two, four or six to a room.</p>
<p>“We have talked to the county about what to do if people present with symptoms and if they have a place where we could isolate them,” said Carole Bailey, CEO of the Ministry.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, water fountains have been turned off, she said, “because we don’t have enough people to wipe them down every time someone takes a drink.”</p>
<p>Community lunch service is boxed and left outside for people to pick up between 12:15 and 1:15 p.m. at Entrance G. The agency’s food pantry is assembling emergency boxes for clients to pick up weekly, but clients will not be admitted to the building, she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Molinaro said her shelter for battered women has no choice but to stay open.</p>
<p>“We cannot have our services impacted because they are life savers,” she said. “We are having to do some screening for travel and exposure and symptoms.”</p>
<p>She said anyone with symptoms can be quarantined in one of two rooms the shelter has set aside for that purpose. Sister organizations can help with overflow, including shelters outside the county.</p>
<p>Shepherd’s Heart houses 15 veterans and has beds for five drop-ins. It serves meals to 50 people regularly.</p>
<p>“We are taking steps to protect our homeless veterans,” Rev. Wurschmidt said. “As of last night, no visitors are allowed. We put together a pandemic plan based on Veterans Administration and CDC guidelines.”</p>
<p>While many religious services have been canceled, morning prayers and Sunday services will continue at Shepherd’s Heart, Rev. Wurschmidt said.</p>
<p>Only one entrance will be used from now on, he said, so that staff can monitor and screen those who come in and ensure that they use hand sanitizer before entering.</p>
<p>“I understand people’s fear,” he said. “If I don’t feel well, I’ll stay home. But we need to be a beacon of hope.”</p>
