<h1> Building on what can be built upon </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>American optimism is in short supply these days.</p>
<p>While the economy makes strides — slowly in recent weeks — toward eventual recovery, almost half of families who experienced a layoff due to COVID-19 believe those jobs to be gone forever, according to recent polling.</p>
<p>That’s about 10 million workers total, the Associated Press calculates. Restaurants and retail closures and bankruptcies have dominated news cycles lately, with 129 Pittsburgh restaurants closing for good to date and retail chains ranging from J.C. Penney, to GNC and Neiman Marcus announcing the shuttering of numerous locations, including area malls.</p>
<p>Digging through Bureau of Labor Statistics data reveals that the largest job gains in July are occurring in leisure and hospitality industries, government, retail trade, professional and business services and health care. But numbers are still far short of where they were in February.</p>
<p>But this is a country of innovation. Of grit.</p>
<p>While many people are no doubt doing all they can to survive, those with the time and means should explore which of their skills are transferable to potentially growing industries and explore developing skills if theirs are not transferable. After all, there will be jobs after the pandemic, though hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Americans will be shunted into different industries and vocations.</p>
<p>Online education and skills courses have also boomed during the pandemic, with adult enrollment for certain skills skyrocketing in recent months. And some skills, like customer service, food preparation or team leadership, already transfer easily between industries.</p>
<p>Some foresight now could pay off in spades as the economy rights itself. For example, a McKinney &amp; Company briefing indicates that the pandemic has stimulated automation and digitization as companies look for ways to reduce physical contact between staff and customers. The end may not yet be in sight, but those who are proactive in developing their skills will have a leg up on capitalizing on a post-pandemic job market.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the upheaval and turmoil of the coronavirus isn’t dissipating, and Congress’ ability to agree on any sort of relief package is shamefully lacking. There are temporary positions available in various sectors that could provide a supplement to unemployment benefits or stave off some of the worst of the current hardship.</p>
<p>Employment in delivery services has increased dramatically (though admittedly this benefits only those with cars).</p>
<p>Stocking and warehouse jobs remain plentiful.</p>
<p>Video conferencing companies are booming.</p>
<p>These jobs are not going to pay enough to provide long-term security, but as a way to avoid despair or be stuck on unemployment they are a means to an end.</p>
<p>Do what you can and build on what is. This is the pragmatic, and proud, American way.</p>
