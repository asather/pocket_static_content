<h1>Trial begins in Wilkinsburg mass slaying </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nearly four years after five people and an unborn child were gunned down in a Wilkinsburg backyard, the trial — against just one man now accused of participating — began Monday morning.</p>
<p>An hour earlier, Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Edward J. Borkowski threw out the prosecution’s case against Robert Thomas, agreeing with his defense attorney that there is not enough evidence against him to sustain the case.</p>
<p>That means that just Cheron Shelton, 33, of Lincoln-Lemington faces the death penalty if convicted.</p>
<p>By lunchtime Monday, openings had concluded, and prosecutors had already called six witnesses to set the scene for the chaos that first responders found just before 11 p.m. on March 9, 2016.</p>
<p>It had been an unseasonably warm day, Deputy District Attorney Kevin Chernosky told the jury in his nine-minute opening statement — the kind of day where people in Western Pennsylvania emerge from their winter hibernation to run errands, wash their cars and have an impromptu barbecue.</p>
<p>“The kind where one person brings the beer, one person brings the hamburgers,” he said. “People stopped over and left. They came and went.</p>
<p>“They talked. They joked. They listened to music. They took pictures.”</p>
<p>And some of that information went out on social media, including Facebook, where Shelton, who believed that one of the people at the gathering had killed his best friend in 2013, learned about it.</p>
<p>“That Facebook post would be an invitation to murder,” Mr. Chernosky said. “That defendant was holding a grudge.”</p>
<p>The prosecutor said that Shelton and “another individual,” went to the alley behind the home on Franklin Avenue and began firing an “unmerciful hale of bullets.”</p>
<p>Eighteen came from a handgun. Thirty more, police said, were fired by an assault-style rifle.</p>
<p>“When the smoke cleared, they were gone, and all the hope of that spring day was gone, as well,” Mr. Chernosky said.</p>
<p>The prosecutor then walked the jurors quickly through the evidence in the case.</p>
<p>A Wilkinsburg detective who spotted Shelton in his mother’s car near the scene moments after the shooting; video showing Shelton coming and going that evening from his mother’s house in Homewood North; ammunition and weapons found at that house; letters Shelton wrote from jail; and video of him from the jail .</p>
<p>“The case is going to test you,” Mr. Chernosky told the jurors. “It’s going to be long. It’s going to be arduous.</p>
<p>“The scene is vast. The exhibits are many. But you will not be alone in the journey.”</p>
<p>He urged the jury of six men and six women to use the facts, the law and their oath to guide them in finding Shelton guilty of six counts of first-degree murder, what Mr. Chernosky called “a brazen, vengeful, callous act.”</p>
<p>Defense attorney Randall McKinney agreed with the prosecution that the mass shooting was a tragedy.</p>
<p>“But what is also tragic,” he told the jurors in his 22-minute opening statement, “is that this young man, who played no role in what happened that night, is sitting here as a defendant.”</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney urged the jurors to assess the credibility of each witness.</p>
<p>In his opening, he primarily targeted one of them, Michael Adams, the Wilkinsburg detective who said he spotted Shelton that night.</p>
<p>“The evidence will show Detective Adams is lying to you,” Mr. McKinney said.</p>
<p>The defense attorney told the jurors that Detective Adams will testify that he was on patrol that evening with his windows down and heard the shots from just a street away. As he traveled slowly in the direction of Franklin Avenue, Mr. McKinney said, Detective Adams saw a man get into a white Lincoln.</p>
<p>“What does Detective Adams do?” Mr. McKinney asked. “His job is to investigate and solve crime.”</p>
<p>Instead, he said the detective pulled his cruiser alongside the Lincoln and stared into it, for up to a minute, as the person inside failed to make eye contact with him or even start the ignition.</p>
<p>Then, Detective Adams pulled away heading to the scene. As the Lincoln drove off, Mr. McKinney told the jury, the detective looked at the car’s license plate in his mirror and then wrote it down.</p>
<p>“He never questioned him or detained him. He never said, ‘hey, buddy, did you hear those shots?’</p>
<p>“You’ll have to ask yourself, does that sound reasonable?”</p>
<p>Mr. McKinney then told the jury that the information about the Lincoln and the man inside was never turned over to the lead investigating agency, Allegheny County police, until three days later.</p>
<p>“There is no physical evidence tying him to the scene,” Mr. McKinney said of his client. “In fact, forensic evidence at the scene points to someone else.”</p>
<p>He told the jurors that a puddle of saliva was found near where police believe the suspects were.</p>
<p>“They tested the saliva,” the attorney said. “Not a match. It comes back to some unknown male, not to Cheron Shelton.”</p>
