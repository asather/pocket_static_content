<h1>Stephon Tuitt will stand for the national anthem and doesn't care what others think</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers defensive lineman Stephon Tuitt is confident the national anthem will not become a divisive issue for the team this season, but he was surprisingly mum on the subject Wednesday afternoon after some rather combative posts on his social media platforms last month.</p>
<p>Tuitt made it known in no uncertain terms that he would be standing for the anthem and that anyone who disagreed with him shouldn’t waste their breath if they have a different perspective.</p>
<p>“That’s just pertaining to me and how I feel morally on the subject,” Tuitt said Wednesday afternoon. “That’s just my beliefs and what I want to do.”</p>
<p>He had plenty more to say on the matter when he fired off his thoughts July 27.</p>
<p>“Also I’m not kneeling for the flag and screw anybody who [has] a problem with that,” Tuitt tweeted last month. “My grandmother was [an] immigrant from the [Caribbean] and ... worked her ass off to bring 20 people over the right way. She had no money and educated herself to be a nurse. [She’s] living good now.”</p>
<p>He followed that up with a post on Instagram that went into more detail on his stance.</p>
<p>“I stand for the flag because I am a proud American. Like previously stated, this country has provided and rewarded my family in so many ways through our perseverance and hard work. I will continue to honor my country and be an example to my children to stand for what they believe in. In regards to police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement I will support these causes through other means. It’s unfortunate that a couple unprofessional individuals have caused such havoc on our country and damaged the trust of its citizens. I will not let those individuals steer me from the fact on the opportunity this country gives for everyone. God Bless.”</p>
<p>When he was asked Wednesday how he plans to support Black Lives Matter and other social injustice movements, Tuitt did not say. He said the players “haven’t gotten together as a team yet to talk about it.”</p>
<p>Tuitt’s posts caused a bit of an awkward situation when Steelers offensive lineman Zach Banner, a vocal supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, quote-tweeted him with the following message last month:</p>
<p>“Everyone is entitled to their own opinion But do not associate this message with me, or others who will decide to kneel because Breonna Taylor’s killers are still free and George Floyd and Manuel Ellis’s last words were, ‘I CAN’T BREATHE!’ BLACK LIVES MATTER!”</p>
<p>Saints quarterback Drew Brees had to apologize for his remarks earlier in the summer when he made his feelings known on standing for the national anthem. Brees said he “will never agree with anyone disrespecting the flag.”&nbsp;The reaction to Brees’ comments — and his subsequent backpedaling — might have had something to do with Tuitt’s silence on the matter Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of Tuitt’s teammates have said they will support the social injustice movement, though specific plans have not been detailed. Cornerback Steven Nelson said he would use his social media platforms to get his message out and would try to “spread positivity and love throughout the country.”</p>
<p>Team captain Cam Heyward, who starts on the defensive line with Tuitt said:&nbsp;“I think we want to stay united in what we do and what we want to accomplish. Coach (Mike Tomlin) has always told me if we win the Super Bowl, that’s not enough in the city of Pittsburgh. We want to leave lasting change among the community as well. For us, we’re going to have those opportunities to branch out and be individuals and affect our community.”</p>
<p>Tuitt, who is entering his seventh season in the league, missed most of last season with a pectoral injury he said is now fully healed. He said the plan last season was for him to come back for the playoffs if the Steelers made it to the postseason.</p>
