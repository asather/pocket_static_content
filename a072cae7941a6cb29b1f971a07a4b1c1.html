<h1>Art Quest: Gazing at 'The Chariot of Aurora'  </h1>

<p><em>Art Quest is an occasional column about art beyond the familiar. We'll tell you where to find it.</em></p>
<p>Sitting in a quiet museum gallery and soaking up the beauty of a single artwork feels like a luxury. At the&nbsp;Carnegie Museum of Art in Oakland, you can rest on a comfortably upholstered, circular sofa and look at “The Chariot of Aurora,” a massive gold- and silver-leafed mural in the Scaife Galleries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Created for the SS Normandie, a French ship that epitomized elegance, the mural is 18 feet tall, 26 feet wide and consists of&nbsp;32 lacquered panels. On its maiden voyage in 1935, the Normandie was the largest and fastest passenger ship in the world.</p>
<p>The liner’s opulent decor included chandeliers fashioned from Lalique crystal and swimming pool tiles made by Sevres, the French porcelain company. Algerian onyx lined a ceremonial hallway, a dining room was paneled entirely in stained, engraved or hammered glass and Aubusson tapestries covered furniture in a lounge.</p>
<p>“The Chariot of Aurora” was designed by French artist Jean Dupas, who was known for working in art deco and Art Nouveau styles, and executed by Jean Dunand, a Swiss born artist who became a French citizen. Both men signed the mural, which adorned a wall that divided the ship’s Grand Salon from its Smoking Room.</p>
<p>During World War II, the U.S. seized the Normandie in New York’s harbor and converted it to a troop ship. The mural was removed before the conversion and&nbsp;reinstalled on the SS Ile de France, where it remained until 1959. Then the&nbsp; artwork disappeared for 25 years.</p>
<p>When it surfaced at a 1984 auction, billionaire Frederick R. Koch bought it and donated it to Carnegie Museum of Art in 1992. Mr. Koch died last month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Greek mythological figures in this scene exude godly grandeur.&nbsp;In the lower left corner, Aurora, daughter of the Greek sun god Hyperion, appears as dawn, rising with her torch while riding in a chariot drawn by two horses. In the lower right corner, Aurora becomes evening, illuminated by stars as she descends. Her journey suggests the sun’s daily passage from east to west.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In Greek mythology, Aurora is the mother of the four winds and the stars. In the clouds above her, at left, Boreas, the north wind, blows an icy blast on a conch shell. At right, Notos, the south wind, empties a large jar of water.</p>
<p>Just below them are their two brothers, Zephyrus, the west wind, and Eurus, the east wind. In the right corner, the gold star floating above Aurora’s raised arms may be her fifth son, Hesperus, the evening star.</p>
<p>At the center of the mural is a compass rose whose rays suggest the sun.&nbsp;The figures represent the basics of navigation — the movement of the sun, the compass, the winds and the stars.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Carnegie Museum of Art spent $150,000 to restore the mural in 1997 and it was the main attraction at a Founder’s Day dinner in 1998.</p>
