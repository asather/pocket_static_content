<h1>Analysts, betting odds favor Louis Riddick, Pat McAfee for ESPN's new 'Monday Night Football' booth</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If football analysts and sports gambling sites are to be believed, there’s a legitimate chance ESPN’s “Monday Night Football” booth next season might be manned by one, maybe two ex-NFL players with strong Pittsburgh ties.</p>
<p>On May 9, The Athletic’s Richard Deitsch reported that last season’s crew of Joe Tessitore and Booger McFarland will not be coming back for the 2020-21 NFL season (whenever that will be) and whoever replaces them will come from within ESPN.</p>
<p>With the candidates for the job being narrowed down to folks who already work for ESPN, two names have consistently been proposed to take over commentating duties: Pitt football alum Louis Riddick and Plum native Pat McAfee.</p>
<p>Riddick has been an ESPN analyst since May 2013 who has since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/17/NFL-draft-Louis-Riddick-ESPN-Mel-Kiper-Pitt-football-Trey-Wingo-Booger-McFarland/stories/202004170069" target="_blank">become a huge part</a> of ESPN’s yearly NFL draft coverage. He’s <a href="https://www.bovada.lv/sports/football/nfl-specials/who-wll-be-announcing-monday-night-football-for-espn-for-game-1-of-the-2020-nfl-season-202005151201" target="_blank">currently the co-favorite</a> for one of the “Monday Night Football” positions with ex-NFL journeyman quarterback Dan Orlovsky, according to odds put out by betting site Bovada.</p>
<p>Not far behind Riddick in the odds is McAfee, who <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-colleges/2019/08/29/Pat-McAfee-ESPN-booth-debut-college-football-UCLA-Cincinnati/stories/201908290247" target="_blank">made his ESPN booth debut</a> during a UCLA-Cincinnati college football game in August of last year, though he has plenty of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/07/Pat-McAfee-Troy-Polamalu-Colts-Steelers-touchdown-Chuck-Pagano-Ike-Taylor/stories/202002070128" target="_blank">other broadcast experience</a> elsewhere. He and veteran “SportsCenter” host Steve Levy are tied for the next-highest Bovada odds right behind Riddick and Orlovsky.</p>
<p>Former NFL quarterbacks Matt Hasselbeck, Kurt Warner and Peyton Manning all have odds high enough to indicate that they could be highly sought-after prospects for this job, as well. Two fun long shots for the gigs according to Bovada are current Colts quarterback Philip Rivers and legendary coach and broadcaster John Madden.</p>
<p>Fellow sports gambling operation BetOnline also released its odds Tuesday for the “Monday Night Football” jobs.</p>
<p>Leading this pack is Brian Griese, a former NFL quarterback and current color commentator for “ESPN College Football.” The rest of their odds are about the same as Bovada, though they give McAfee less of a shot at the coveted role. It’s also worth mentioning that an expanded version of BetOnline’s odds apparently <a href="https://www.si.com/nfl/patriots/news/antonio-browns-mnf-booth-oddsmakers" target="_blank">also includes Antonio Brown</a> at 100-1, according to Sports Illustrated. Moving on.</p>
<p>If either Riddick or McAfee land a job in the “Monday Night Football” booth, it wouldn’t be the first time someone with Pittsburgh ties called those nationally televised games. Dennis Miller, a former “Saturday Night Live” cast member and Castle Shannon native, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20030221060805/http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,6673,00.html" target="_blank">held that position</a> from June 2000 until February 2002. Fun fact: He apparently beat out conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who also auditioned for the job.</p>
<p>Whoever ends up landing this job, one thing’s for sure: Plenty of folks in the football media sphere and beyond would love to see Riddick given that prestigious opportunity.</p>
<p>McAfee seems to be confident he would do well in the job, though he’s not quite sure it’s his time yet.</p>
