<h1>Trump revels in Democratic dysfunction after Iowa caucuses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — As Democrats struggled to count the votes in the opening presidential nomination contest, the one person clearly rejoicing in their dysfunction was the man they hope to evict from the White House.</p>
<p>“The Democrat Caucus is an unmitigated disaster,” President Donald Trump <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1224657196392370177" target="_blank">wrote on Twitter on Tuesday morning</a> as the Iowa results remained unknown. “Nothing works, just like they ran the Country. Remember the 5 Billion Dollar Obamacare Website, that should have cost 2% of that. The only person that can claim a very big victory in Iowa last night is ‘Trump.’”</p>
<p>But Mr. Trump rejected suggestions that the breakdown in counting should cause Iowa to lose its status as the first stop in the presidential nomination process. “It is not the fault of Iowa, it is the Do Nothing Democrats fault,” he wrote. “As long as I am President, Iowa will stay where it is. Important tradition!”</p>
<p>Even as he was mocking the Democrats for their debacle, though, Mr. Trump himself was coming under fire for appearing to be less than fully respectful during the playing of the national anthem during the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>A smartphone video posted on Instagram and <a href="https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article239913588.html" target="_blank">published by the Miami Herald</a> showed Mr. Trump during a Super Bowl watch party at Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, near his Mar-a-Lago estate, standing and pretending to lead an orchestra while “The Star-Spangled Banner” played before the start of the game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Kansas City Chiefs. While his wife, Melania, and son Barron had their hands on their hearts, the president fidgeted, looked around and pointed at guests.</p>
<p>The Herald pointed out that Mr. Trump has lectured others to be respectful during the playing of the anthem, harshly criticizing black National Football League players who took a knee to protest racial injustice. “You have to stand, proudly, for the national anthem or you shouldn’t be playing. You shouldn’t be there. Maybe you shouldn’t be in the country,” Mr. Trump told Fox News in 2018.</p>
<p>The video is the second point of criticism of the president stemming from this year’s football championship game. He was roundly ridiculed for posting a Twitter message after the game congratulating the Chiefs and “the Great State of Kansas” even though they actually play in Missouri. Trump quickly deleted the mistaken tweet and reposted it with Missouri substituted in.</p>
<p>The Iowa caucus meltdown provided ammunition to the president just as the reelection season gets underway in earnest. Rather than facing an emboldened Democratic candidate following a caucus win, Mr. Trump has an opening to paint the opposition party as incapable of governing.</p>
<p>“When will the Democrats start blaming RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA, instead of their own incompetence for the voting disaster that just happened in the Great State of Iowa?” <a href="https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1224699832901799939" target="_blank">he wrote on Twitter, making light of Moscow’s interference in the 2016 presidential election on his behalf</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump is scheduled to deliver his State of the Union address on Tuesday night, which will prevent the Iowa winner, once announced, from having even a single news cycle to himself or herself. On Wednesday, the president is expected to be acquitted by the Senate after an impeachment trial on charges of abuse of office and obstruction of Congress, which he will almost certainly claim as exoneration and take to the campaign trail as evidence of Democrats persecuting him out of partisan animus.</p>
