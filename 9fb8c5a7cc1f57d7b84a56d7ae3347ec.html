<h1>Commuters passing through Painters Run Road to expect more traffic changes </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Commuters passing through Painters Run Road will experience a new set of changes as The Department of Public Works announced Wednesday that part of Painters Run Road has reopened – and another part has ‘unexpectedly’ closed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Part of the 1800 block of Painters Run Road in Scott Township and Upper St. Clair has reopened to traffic after completion of repairing Bridge No. 9 that started on July 20.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another part of Painters Run Road – just west of the intersection with McMillan Road in Upper St. Clair – has closed “unexpectedly” after crews discovering an unmarked underground mine void that would&nbsp;“affect the road’s stability” while originally completing drainage work there.</p>
<p>Public Works said in a press release that they will keep that section of road closed, “until it can ensure that it is safe for drivers,” with&nbsp;“no time table” for when the road will reopen. Representatives of&nbsp;the PA Department of Environmental Protection’s Bureau of Abandoned Mine Reclamation are also being brought in to “evaluate the mine void and potential remediation options.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, traffic will be redirected to use Bower Hill Road, Kelso Road and Rob Hollow Road.&nbsp;</p>
