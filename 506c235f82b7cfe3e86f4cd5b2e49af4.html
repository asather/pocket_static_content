<h1>Daughter of Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy to attend CMU this fall</h1>

<p>Carnegie Mellon’s School of Drama is no stranger to accepting students with dreams of becoming famous. This fall, they’ll be welcoming a new pupil who already has a high profile for a multitude of reasons entirely out of her control.</p>
<p>In her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sophmacy/" target="_blank">Instagram bio</a>, Sophia Macy, daughter of actors Felicity Huffman and William H. Macy, added&nbsp;“CMU Drama ’24,” and a source confirmed to People that the 19-year-old has been accepted into the school’s theater program. The pop-culture site Page Six said Ms. Macy on Sunday “posted the school’s logo and two smiley heart emojis to Instagram Stories.”</p>
<p>Ms. Macy was caught up in last year’s massive college admissions bribery scandal that involved 34 parents, including mother Felicity, who used their wealth and clout to get their children into the universities of their choice. Ms. Macy had her 2019 college offers rescinded after news broke of her mother’s involvement in this scandal.</p>
<p>"Felicity is so proud and grateful that Sophia has kept her chin up over the last year," the source told both People and Page Six. "It was a painful, challenging time and she pulled through it with strength and grace."</p>
<p>Ms. Macy will begin her time as a Tartan with at least one acting gig booked, as she has already <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/celebrities/2020/01/13/felicity-huffmans-daughter-sophia-grace-macy-cast-twilight-zone/4426997002/" target="_blank">secured a role</a> in a season two episode of Jordan Peele’s “Twilight Zone” reboot on CBS All Access. Her younger sister, 18-year-old Georgia, will be a freshman at Vassar College beginning in the fall semester.</p>
<p>Ms. Huffman, a former “Desperate Housewives” star, paid admissions consultant&nbsp;William “Rick” Singer $15,000 to boost Ms. Macy’s SAT scores. For that, Ms. Huffman received a sentence to 14 days in prison, a $30,000 fine, 250 hours of community service and a year of supervised release.</p>
<p>“I can only say I am so sorry, Sophia,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/09/13/Huffman-gets-14-days-behind-bars-in-college-admissions-scam/stories/201909130156" target="_blank">Ms. Huffman said</a> on the day she was sentenced. “I was frightened. I was stupid, and I was so wrong. I am deeply ashamed of what I have done. I have inflicted more damage than I could ever imagine. I now see all the things that led me down this road, but ultimately none of the reasons matter because at the end of the day I had a choice. I could have said no.”</p>
<p>She made a similar statement to People in April 2019 reiterating how “ashamed” she was of her actions and that Ms. Macy wasn’t aware Ms. Huffman took these measures to boost her daughter’s SAT scores.</p>
<p>"My daughter knew absolutely nothing about my actions, and in my misguided and profoundly wrong way, I have betrayed her," Ms. Huffman said. "This transgression toward her and the public I will carry for the rest of my life. My desire to help my daughter is no excuse to break the law or engage in dishonesty."</p>
<p>The source that spoke to Page Six made it clear that Ms. Macy retook the SAT and her scores were good enough to get into Carnegie Mellon — with no help from her mother this time.</p>
<p>Whether Ms. Macy will be able to physically attend CMU this fall is up in the air right now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the school has not said when it expects in-person classes to resume.</p>
