<p>The city of Pittsburgh will further pare down operations to restrict face-to-face interaction between employees and residents, according an announcement Wednesday that declared “Level 2 Emergency Operations” in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The departments of&nbsp;Permits, Licenses and Inspections, Public Works, and Mobility and Infrastructure, will reduce to&nbsp;“skeleton staffing while still&nbsp;responding to emergency situations.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The City of Pittsburgh is committed to fully serving its residents throughout this outbreak, and is continuing to do so, while limiting close interactions to protect as many of our employees as possible,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a press release.</p>
<p>City police, firefighters and paramedics will&nbsp;will continue to operate normally, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/16/Pittsburgh-City-offices-rec-centers-close-essential-services-trash-emergency-continue-Covid-19/stories/202003160097" target="_blank">as announced on Monday</a>.&nbsp;Animal control will respond to “life safety matters only.”</p>
<p>Trash and recycling collection will continue, though all drop-off centers have been closed with the exception of the Strip District and Beltzhoover/Knoxville locations that will continue to accept recyclables.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Parking Authority is suspending parking enforcement, and although parking garage staff and security will remain in place, hand-to-hand cash transactions will be suspended.</p>
<p>Construction site inspections and the issuance of life safety citations&nbsp;will continue, as will 24/7 building emergency inspections. However, the city will be cancelling routine property maintenance inspections, the processing of all notices and citations, cashier functions, and Board of Appeals hearings.</p>
<p>City crews will continue street sign replacements, traffic signal repair and&nbsp;“life-safety inspections of traffic-related job sites,” according to the announcement. However, all street line painting and “general” sign maintenance will be suspended.</p>
<p>Job sites that are permitted by the departments of Public Works and Mobility and Infrastructure can continue provided that give written assurance that crews will modify work practices to keep workers six feet apart, use clean masks and gloves, and regularly sanitize commonly touched surfaces, including steering wheels and hand tools, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>The Peduto administration initially announced changes in services Monday morning, less than 24 hours after it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/15/Pittsburgh-gatherings-over-50-people-ban-Mayor-Bill-Peduto-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202003150150" target="_blank">banned gatherings of 50 or more</a>.</p>
<p>Senior centers and other recreation centers remain closed, but the Department of Parks and Recreation&nbsp;is planning to soon distribute grab-and-go meals at selected centers during limited hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All employees that are able to work remotely continue to do so, according to the city.</p>
