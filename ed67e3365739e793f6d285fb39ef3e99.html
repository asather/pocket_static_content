<h1>The 'Burgh's best dishes and drinks right now</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Here, found and devoured by our intrepid staffers across the city and the region, are this week’s #BBDD — ’Burgh’s best dishes and drinks right now.</p>
<p><strong>Baked burrata at The Foundry Table &amp; Tap, North Side</strong></p>
<p>One of the best dishes I had during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week Winter 2020 was the first of three courses ($20.20) at The Foundry. I was feeling antsy after placing my lunch order, thinking I should have ordered takeout because I had a pile of work waiting at my desk. But the minute the burrata arrived in a hot mini cast-iron skillet, my worries disappeared.</p>
<p>It was a pure feast for the eyes — red and yellow grape tomatoes scattered around a cream-filled ball of mozzarella topped with pistachio pesto and drizzles of balsamic vinegar. Oozing cream had pooled around the baked cheese ball.</p>
<p>When I poked my fork into the burrata, more filling burst forth. But a fork couldn’t pick up the mozzarella, cream, pesto, vinegar and tomato together at once.</p>
<p>Once I got a spoon, the oohs and aahs began because every element worked beautifully. The roasted tomatoes, especially the yellow ones, were delightfully sweet. The sweetish-tangy vinegar cut through the verdant pistachio pesto, and they both complemented the cheese. And the grilled slices of sourdough bread came in handy to sop up every drop of cream.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the burrata was not just a new item for PRW. The Foundry is adding it to its regular menu soon.</p>

<p><strong>Raclette at Butterjoint, Oakland</strong></p>
<p>There's probably no better cheeseburger in the city than the ones at Butterjoint, made fresh daily with local ground beef from Thoma Meat Market in Saxonburg ($13). But what drew me to the Oakland bar on a chilly Friday night was the promise of raclette.</p>
<p>In Switzerland, the nutty, semi-hard cheese is often cooked to order on a raclette grill or heated at the table with an open fire and then scraped onto a plate with a flat-edged spatula or knife.</p>
<p>At Butterjoint, artisan raclette-style cheese from Vermont's Spring Brook Farm is cut into ½-inch slices, placed in a cast-iron skillet and put under the broiler for 2 or 3 minutes until it melts but still holds its shape. It arrives at the table warm and gooey, which makes it easy to spread on warm slices of sourdough bread from Five Points Bakery.</p>
<p>Comfort food at its best, the dish is garnished with bite-sized pieces of sour dill pickle that chef Trevett Hooper makes in the summer with cucumbers from Rick Zang of Zang's Greenhouse in Butler (and available year-round at East Liberty Farmers Market). Wonderfully creamy, with nutty undertones, the cheese probably pairs best with a dry white wine, but Old Fashioneds were on special Fridays ($7), so that's how we rolled.</p>

<p><strong>Chinese New Year Dim Sum Feast at Soba in Shadyside</strong></p>
<p>Per the Chinese lunar calendar Saturday begins the Year of the Metal Rat (which would be an excellent name for a hardcore band) and this week at Soba, chef Lily Tran and her team have put together a fantastic Dim Sum menu to celebrate the new year.</p>
<p>On a Monday date night, my wife and I shared a veritable feast of a la carte items: indulgent and tender short rib egg rolls with flaky crusts ($10); silky and delicately spicy bay scallop fried rice ($19); funky brussels sprout kimchi ($7); note perfect lamb dumplings ($13); and a bracing hot and sour soup with crispy wonton, truffle ($10) to name just a few.</p>
<p>This special menu will be available, through Saturday (New Year’s Day) and reservations are suggested.</p>

<p><strong>Double chocolate cake at Corner Mercantile, Downtown</strong></p>
<p>The best decision I’ve made this year and last week’s most-liked post on my Instagram was a $2 slice of double chocolate cake after lunch at Corner Mercantile. It was delicious.&nbsp;</p>
