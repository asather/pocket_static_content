<h1>Saturday ‘Trump Boat Parade’ still on despite new county gathering limits</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At least one potentially large-scale event will be going on as planned on the Fourth of July despite the Allegheny County Health Department <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/02/COVID-19-coronavirus-Allegheny-County-Western-Pennsylvania-cases-deaths-data-pandemic-200/stories/202007020115" target="_blank">limiting gatherings</a> to 25 people or fewer for a week starting Friday at 12:01 a.m.</p>
<p>The “<a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/4th-of-july-trump-boat-parade-salute-to-first-responders-tickets-109172756654" target="_blank">4th of July Trump Boat Parade &amp; Salute To First Responders</a>” will still take place Saturday, according to Tricia Cunningham of local mobilization group Team Trump USA, one of the event’s organizers. As of Thursday evening, about 12,000 people and 283 boats have registered online for the event, though Ms. Cunningham has no idea how many people will actually show up given the recent spike in COVID-19 cases.</p>

<p>“If there’s one more person than me out there on the river Saturday, we will have accomplished something,” said Ms. Cunningham, 47, of Washington Township.</p>
<p>Supporters of President Donald Trump will begin the parade at 11 a.m. Saturday by either lining the Hot Metal Bridge in the South Side or hopping on one of the participating boats. The procession will go along the Monongahela and Ohio rivers before ending in a rally at the North Shore Riverfront Park that will be dispersed by 1 p.m.</p>
<p>This event is designed to make sure Mr. Trump “knows we’re still supporting him and his agenda,” according to Ms. Cunningham.</p>
<p>On Thursday, after Allegheny County reported a new daily high of 233 additional COVID-19 cases, health department director Debra Bogen ordered that bars, restaurants and casinos be closed and prohibited gatherings of 25 or more people for a week beginning July 3.</p>
<p>Ms. Cunningham said she has been planning for something like this to occur since Allegheny County was in Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf’s “red” phase and almost completely shut down. Her group and co-organizer Women for Trump have been in touch with the U.S. Coast Guard, Department of Homeland Security and Pittsburgh police to secure the necessary permits for the parade to go on as scheduled.</p>
<p>Everyone has been asked to wear masks, practice social distancing and — if they have recently traveled outside of Pennsylvania or feel at all sick — stay home and watch the parade on an online live feed, according to Ms. Cunningham.</p>
<p>“We’re trying not to invade anyone else’s space,” she said. “We just want to celebrate our freedoms. It’s July 4, Independence Day, and this is how we choose to do it.”</p>
<p>In addition to showing support for Mr. Trump, Ms. Cunningham also said that voter registration booths will be set up throughout the city during the parade in an effort to keep the promise Team Trump USA made to the president “that we will deliver Pennsylvania for him.”</p>
<p>“As long as Trump is president, we will remain Americans and we will survive,” she said. “We will stay true to him and his agenda, the America First agenda.”</p>
