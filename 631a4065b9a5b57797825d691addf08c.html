<h1>Gene Collier: Attention spans taxed heavily at impeachment trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For Americans who followed very closely the run-up to only the third impeachment trial in our tumultuous history, upwards of a dozen people I’m guessing, this week’s wall-to-wall TV coverage from the floor of the United States Senate delivered virtually nothing that was totally fresh.</p>
<p>Everyone else likely discovered only in the last few days that the case against Donald John Trump is of the open-and-shut variety.</p>
<p>Democrats have Open. Republicans have Shut.</p>
<p>The longest session was the first, on Tuesday, when the exact process of the trial was discussed to ghastly length. If you missed it, imagine a baseball game before which the managers and the umpires meet at home plate to discuss the ground rules, and stay there for approximately 13 hours.</p>
<p>Presiding is John Roberts, Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, reduced here to an ornament in a robe, though he has occasionally piped up with an admonition on civility, or to use the word, “pettifogging.”</p>
<p>No one knew what that meant, and few if any, inside or outside the Beltway, had ever heard it, save those who might have mistakenly thought their local TV meteorologist was warning about patchy morning pettifog.</p>
<p>Otherwise the general overview after some three days of prosecution led by Adam Schiff was that Democrats were trying to “move the needle” on public opinion, that Republicans were trying to “kick the can down the road” toward an all-but-inevitable acquittal of the 45th president, and that congresspersons of both stripes were at war with the media, not so much over access or similar matters of real consequence, but about who could say “at the end of the day” the most times in any 24 hour period.</p>
<p>No official accounting was available, but “at the end of the day” was trotted out at least once an hour, yet rarely at or near the end of the day. Jay Sekulow, lawyerly apologist for the president, came closest on Wednesday night when he said, “My prediction is that the president will be acquitted, at the end of the day.” It was 9:55 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday was the day senators first came under fire for their withering attention spans, as several media outlets reported they were leaving their seats, visiting the cloakroom, dozing off, doodling, or doing crosswords. So yeah, like it was any other Wednesday, save for lapping up corporate interest cash.</p>
<p>But you can’t blame anyone, not even senators, for being unable to sit through the full enumeration of Trump transgressions. Nobody’s got that kind of time.</p>
<p>At one point, I myself had to take the dog to the vet, where the waiting room had a CBS feed of the trial that was breaking up badly. The closed-captioning was on, but because that was breaking up as well, all I could hear as Trump attorney Pat Cippolone was speaking was a Pomeranian yapping from one of the exam rooms down the hall. Checking the DVR later, what Cippolone said was pretty much what the Pomeranian had been saying.</p>
<p>Externally, Mr. Trump commented that he thought things were going well enough, deftly adding, “honestly, we have all the material. They don’t have the material.”</p>
<p>D’oh!</p>
<p>Democrats, who’d just spent 20 hours lamenting the fact that they had no subpoenaed documents (after starting with some 90,000 during the last impeachment trial), pounced on that like a band of starving coyotes.</p>
<p>Val Demmings of Florida tweeted: The second article of impeachment was for obstruction of Congress: covering up witnesses and documents from the American people. This morning the President not only confessed to it, he bragged about it: "Honestly, we have all the material. They don't have the material."</p>
<p>I thought Mr. Trump might have meant something else, really. I thought he could have been trying to say that the Republicans have all the good arguments and that the Democrats don’t. I guess it depends on exactly how dumb you think the president is.</p>
<p>“The president is actually not a very smart man,” George Conway was saying on CNN moments later, never mind that he’s married to Kellyanne “Alternative Facts” Conway, presidential mouthpiece. “He’s admitting there that his strategy is to keep materials from getting out. He’s undercutting the arguments he needs to make.”</p>
<p>Well, I don’t know. The president just came back from the world economic forum in Switzerland where it sounded like he thinks the wheel was invented in America. “You know, we have to protect Thomas Edison,” Mr. Trump told CNBC in a conversation about Elon Musk. “And we have to protect all of these people that came up originally with the light bulb and the wheel and all these things.”</p>
<p>The wheel. Invented circa 4,000 B.C.</p>
<p>America. Invented 1776.</p>
<p>Wondering how to compare this to the time Mr. Trump said the moon was part of Mars, but never mind. The president’s intelligence is not at issue here. Maybe.</p>
<p>I prefer to think of this first week of impeachment the way Brian Williams of MSNBC summed up Mr. Schiff’s comprehensive presentation on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>“It was just so very effective. We’ll see if it was very effective.”</p>
<p>Uh-huh. What he said.</p>
