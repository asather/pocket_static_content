<h1>Poll: Nearly 1 in 5 fans won't return to local sports venues — ever</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Post-Gazette readers do not anticipate the sports world returning to normal any time soon. Or perhaps ever.</p>
<p>Polling conducted Saturday through Tuesday on the news organization’s website by <a href="https://civicscience.com/" target="_blank">CivicScience</a> covered a variety of topics related to sports and the coronavirus pandemic. Data compiled from the hundreds of responses show safety is top of mind for most and will guide decisions about attending games well into the future.</p>
<p>Asked when they plan to return to Pittsburgh sports venues, 17% — or nearly 1 in 5 — answered “never.” Quite a jarring figure in a city with a proud sports culture.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 42% plurality said they’ll wait for a vaccine to be developed and 11% said they’ll wait years after the pandemic. Only 29% said they’d return as soon as venues are opened to fans.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When those venues are open, readers overwhelmingly support imposing social distance measures to keep fans safe, with 79% of respondents backing a limited capacity to bolster that effort.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the mean time, most readers seem on board with proposals that bring pro sports leagues back in neutral, quarantined locations that exclude most teams’ home cities. A 57% majority said the change would make no difference in their interest, while 18% said they’d have more interest. Only 26% said they’d have less.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most also would not blame the NHL or NBA for bailing on their 2019-20 seasons. In a narrow vote, 54% of readers said the two leagues should simply start new seasons when they can return, while 46% want to see suspended seasons through.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for passing time while waiting for sports to return, most seem to be looking beyond the sports world for now. Just 19% of respondents said they’ve been watching replays of classic Steelers, Pirates, Penguins and Pitt sports games that have been shown on television.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 64% majority has not been watching replays at all, while 17% have been watching very little.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Esports are not a substitute either. A whopping 95% said they’ve not paid attention to any such competitions during the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Readers did, however, pay attention to the NFL draft last month. And they have lukewarm reviews of the Steelers’ performance.</p>
<p>A 41% plurality gave the team a B grade for their selections. C was the next most popular choice at 33%, followed by F at 9% and 8% each for A and D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There’s a bit more excitement for second-round pick Chase Claypool, the team’s top pick in the draft. Once again, B was readers most popular grade with 43% of the vote. A healthy 29%, however, gave the choice a top grade.</p>
