<h1>Brian O'Neill: Booze sales remain a rumor for most </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While it’s far down the list of this pandemic’s most frightening things, it’s nonetheless scary to hear that Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is monitoring Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits curbside sales as a possible model for other retailers.</p>
<p>Haven’t we suffered enough?</p>
<p>After scattered liquor stores began offering <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/04/18/wine-spirits-pickup-locations-order-by-phone-pa-liquor-online/stories/202004180067" target="_blank">curbside pickup</a> in Pittsburgh on Monday, I spent too much of that morning and Tuesday calling the two closest stores. I made a half-dozen calls to each place both days, and heard only busy signals. Those attempts were made only after checking the Liquor Control Board <a href="http://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/SpecialAccessLandingPageView?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10051&amp;catalogId=10051" target="_blank">website</a> that purportedly offers online sales. It told me to&nbsp;“please try again in the next few hours or coming days.”</p>
<p>Sure, that sounds like fun.</p>
<p>I understand the pent-up demand. On the afternoon of March 16, the state liquor monopoly announced&nbsp;“the indefinite closure” of all state stores by 9 p.m. the next day, which was (cue the tin whistle) ... St. Patrick’s Day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That guaranteed a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/03/16/State-closing-Allegheny-County-Fine-Wine-Good-Spirits-stores-PLCB/stories/202003160112" target="_blank">run on the stores</a>&nbsp;reminiscent of Black Friday sales, with security guards at the doors keeping imbibers-to-be chilling on the sidewalk. The virus could have made some easy hops from person to person that day.</p>
<p>In the weeks that followed, Western Pennsylvanians who were hovering in that sweet spot between desperate and innovative drove to Ohio and West Virginia to escape neo-Prohibition. Then on April 4, the Monongalia (W.Va.) County Health Department said it would begin requiring West Virginia ID to buy booze. On April 13, Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/04/13/Ohio-governor-liquor-store-order-identification-pennsylvania-sales-west-virginia-plcb-maryland/stories/202004130129" target="_blank">liquor stores in the six Ohio counties closest to Pennsylvania</a>&nbsp;would no longer be serving our kind. It didn’t want our money. Anyone wanting to buy booze in the border stores needed to show Ohio ID.</p>
<p>“Those who are coming in to buy liquor are creating a health hazard,” Mr. “No Wine for Yinz” DeWine said.</p>
<p>I was not among those crossing state lines to buy booze. I gave up hard liquor for Lent, and wine has been available in enough supermarkets to spare me from washing down pasta with water. But now the Lenten season is over and the bottle of Bushmills Irish whiskey that had been waiting patiently in my cupboard is looking dangerously low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania may be working with six other northeastern states to coordinate a gradual reopening from the COVID-19 lockdown, but ours is the only state that entirely monopolizes sales of hard liquor. There are 12.8 million Pennsylvanians, and on Monday there were but 1,400 people working at 176 state stores and licensee service centers.</p>
<p>That works out to about 72,700 Pennsylvanians per liquor store. That works out to 9,142 Pennsylvanians per LCB employee on the job Monday. Hence busy signals ad infinitum. As one frustrated person commented about a recent story on the new system, “Pennsylvania is dragged kicking and screaming into the 1980s.”</p>
<p>Thankfully, not every Pennsylvanian drinks, so there might be only a few thousand people calling any given store. But even teetotalers should care about this because liquor stores make money and the state is going broke.</p>
<p>There’s no telling how much revenue was lost to neighboring states during neo-Prohibition this spring. But the state had its highest daily sales ever, nearly $30 million, on March 16, even with stores in the four suburban “collar counties” around Philadelphia already closed. Statewide, more than $50 million worth of booze sold on the last two days stores were open in March.&nbsp; People were clearly stocking up because sales for the entire St. Patrick’s Day weekend in 2019 (Friday through Sunday) were less than half that.</p>
<p>Millions of dollars of wine sold in grocery stores and convenience stores last month have kept the state surprisingly even since. The LCB reports total sales for March at $198.1 million — only $4.1 million less than sales in March 2019, a drop the fiscal equivalent of backwash.</p>
<p>And since online sales began, appropriately enough, on April Fool’s Day, thousands have beaten the odds and gotten through. On Monday, the LCB reported. there were 9,007 online orders of 45,875 bottles of wine and spirits worth $859,547. Together with nearly 6,000 phone orders at the stores, sales topped $1.3 million. At the stores I called to no avail — in Wharton Square on the South Side and at 339 Fifth Avenue Downtown — sales were around $3,000 apiece, about one-quarter the business of a typical Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Reported statewide sales jumped by more than a third Tuesday as more workers clocked in, so I guess I’ll keep try­ing. Be­cause lately I find my­self re­call­ing that Lis­ter­ine is al­most 27% al­co­hol.</p>
<p>Re­lax. I’m just kid­ding. I’d never do that. I mean, have you priced Lis­ter­ine lately? No, if I ever go that route, I’ll go with Giant Eagle Orig­i­nal an­ti­sep­tic mouth­wash — much cheaper and also nearly 54 proof. It might not be half bad with tonic, though I’ll need to mask up and buy limes.</p>
