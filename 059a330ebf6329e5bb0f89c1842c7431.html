<h1>Vincentian parents seek to stop closure of high school</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Parents of Vincentian Academy students said they were set to launch a campaign intended to keep the McCandless school open after the congregation that operates it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/02/25/Vincentian-Academy-closing-end-of-school-year-2020-catholic-sisters-charity-nazareth/stories/202002250111" target="_blank">announced its impending closure</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A post written Tuesday afternoon on the&nbsp;Vincentian Academy Parent Association Facebook page said it would begin the&nbsp;“save our school” effort over the next 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Our goal is to show the sisters and the community in a very quick and convincing manner that Vincentian Academy is HERE TO STAY and will be stronger than ever after this,” the post read. “We will be casting a net far and wide to ensure that this mission continues.”</p>
<p>The Kentucky-based Sisters of Charity of Nazareth said last week that Vincentian Academy would close at the end of the school year because of financial issues.</p>
<p>Diane Curtis, a spokeswoman for the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth, said in an email that the sisters held a parent meeting Monday night to outline the decision to close and offer information for when the school shuts down.</p>
<p>She said that enrollment at the school has declined by more than 100 students over the past five years, leading to a drop in financial resources.</p>
<p>“We hear the pain. We hear the pain from parents and students around Vincentian Academy closing and the closing of other Catholic schools in Pittsburgh. We hear the sadness. Our sisters are sad, many of whom attended the school which began as a school for women aspiring to religious life,” Ms. Curtis said. “Many sisters also taught there. This is not an easy decision. Our hearts are breaking and we are praying for everyone involved.”</p>
<p>Also on Monday, Amy Nassif, president of the&nbsp;parent association,&nbsp;sent a letter to the sisters urging them to keep the school open, at least for students who currently attend or are committed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Nassif said that her group would be willing to work with&nbsp;the sisters to find an alternative to closing the school immediately.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We understood VA to be a mission of the&nbsp;Sisters of Charity of Nazareth when we signed our first contracts to join the school,” Ms. Nassif wrote in a letter to the sisters.&nbsp;“We are now asking the&nbsp;Sisters of Charity of Nazareth&nbsp;to complete that mission. All current students at Vincentian Academy and the incoming freshmen who committed to our beloved school remain under your mission.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Nassif said that the decision to close the school at the end of the year came without warning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The parents are completely stunned by the abrupt school closure announcement on Tuesday, February 25th,” she wrote.&nbsp;“No prior communication was afforded and we now left reeling with devastated teenagers who love Vincentian Academy. They chose this school for excellent teachers, [an] unmatched IB Diploma program, quality academics, 100% graduation rate, exemplary reputation award-winning academic and sports programs, and welcoming spiritual environment.”</p>
<p>Vincentian High School, founded in 1932 by the Vincentian Sisters of Charity, began as a school for young women aspiring to the religious life. The first lay student enrolled in 1939, and the school became co-ed in 1973.</p>
<p>The school, located on a 67-acre campus off of McKnight Road, has an enrollment of more than 160 students, according to its website.</p>
