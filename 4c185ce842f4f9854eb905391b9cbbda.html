<p>Former Greensburg Bishop Edward Malesic was formally welcomed into his new cathedral Monday afternoon at the start of a worship service marking his formal installation as the new Catholic bishop of Cleveland.</p>
<p>Bishop Malesic, who led the Greensburg diocese from 2015 to 2020, is being formally installed in his new role at the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Cleveland. He entered in a procession with fellow bishops —&nbsp;wearing red masks due to the pandemic, matching the red chasubles worn in commemoration of the feast day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross.</p>
<p>Attendance is limited due to the pandemic, with priests and others attendees sitting at socially distant intervals on the pews in the large sanctuary.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the start of the service, Bishop Christophe Pierre, the Vatican’s apostolic nuncio or diplomatic representative to the United States, read aloud Pope Francis’ formal letter appointing Bishop Malesic as leader of the Cleveland diocese.</p>
<p>His installation completes a Keystone-Buckeye state exchange, with Bishop Malesic filling the seat left vacant when former Cleveland Bishop Nelson Perez was installed ealrier this year as archbishop of Philadelphia.</p>
<p>No successor has yet been named for Greensburg.</p>
<p>Bishop Malesic, 60, was appointed in April 2015 to lead the Greensburg Diocese and was formally installed in July of that year. The diocese includes Armstrong, Indiana, Fayette and Westmoreland counties, with about 134,000 Catholics, according to the Official Catholic Directory.</p>
<p>A much larger diocese, Cleveland’s includes eight counties in northcentral Ohio, a region that is home to nearly 683,000 Catholics, according to diocesan officials.</p>
<p>Bishop Malesic, a native of Harrisburg, was ordained a priest in 1987 and served in various pastoral assignments and campus ministries in the Diocese of Harrisburg.</p>
