<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt has lost one of its basketball legends.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.wtae.com/article/former-pitt-basketball-star-lorri-johnson-dies/31223846" target="_blank">WTAE-TV reported Wednesday</a> morning that Lorri Johnson, the school’s all-time leading scorer, has died. Pitt later confirmed the news to the Post-Gazette.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Johnson scored 2,312 points for the women’s team during her career from 1987-92. That mark still stands as the highest career total for any Panther, man or woman. She also holds numerous other Pitt records, including single-season field goals and single-game points.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The university retired Johnson’s number early last year, becoming the first female athlete to receive that honor. She was also a member of the&nbsp;Pitt Athletics <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/06/13/Pitt-announces-its-2019-Hall-of-Fame-class/stories/201906130105" target="_blank">Hall of Fame’s 2019 class</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before her college days, Johnson was also a standout at New Castle, earning two selections to the Post-Gazette’s Fabulous Five team in 1985-86 and leading the WPIAL in scoring at&nbsp;29.9 points per game as a senior.</p>
<p>Her 40 points in a playoff game in 1985 still stands as a record in Class 4A. She also had a 53-point performance, which was the second-best in WPIAL history at the time.&nbsp;</p>
