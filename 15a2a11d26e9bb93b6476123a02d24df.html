<h1>Brighton Heights home celebrates two centenarians with birthday parade</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Little Sisters of the Poor held a birthday parade Wednesday to celebrate 203 combined years for two of its residents.</p>
<p>Kay Canyock celebrated her 100th birthday and Mary Sahayda celebrated her 103rd.</p>
<p>The Little Sisters staff lined up the birthday girls in front of the main entrance of the Brighton Heights home. A parade of vehicles — full of family, friends and volunteers — drove by, as the centenarians waved back.</p>
<p>Ms. Canyock was born on June 17, 1920, in Bristol, England. Every afternoon at the home, where she has lived for the past seven years, she has a proper English tea. She moved to the U.S. after she married Joseph Canyock, an American who, according to the Little Sisters, served as a motorcycle escort to Gen. George S. Patton during World War II. After they moved to Pittsburgh, the couple had three daughters.</p>
<p>Ms. Sahayda, who has been at the Little Sisters home for two years, was born on June 17, 1917, and grew up in the Woods Run section of the North Side and attended Irwin High School. She and her husband, Michael, raised three children — twin boys and a daughter.</p>
