<h1>No more ballpark outings, but companies adjust benefits, rewards to the new reality</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Company picnics? Too risky. Ballpark outings? Not an option anymore.&nbsp;Face time with company executives is relegated to, you guessed it, FaceTime on that smartphone.</p>
<p>Since the pandemic disrupted many company traditions and benefits, Western Pennsylvania’s companies have been offering new perks and premiums to make their employees feel valued —&nbsp;in some cases including additional vacation days, flexible hours and continuing with remote work systems even as some lockdown rules eased.</p>
<p>“We have a large staff but [our managers] know us personally —&nbsp;our husbands, wives, children —&nbsp;and they have a vested interest in us,” said Karen Imhoff, an account manager at The PT Services Group, a Downtown business services provider.</p>
<p>The PT Services Group has surprised its employees with companywide days off several times since transitioning to remote work in March.&nbsp;The company provided personal computers for employees, a particularly helpful gesture for those whose children use the family computer for online schooling. The company has also been flexible with work-from-home hours.</p>
<p>“We recognize that everyone’s under a lot of stress, and all of our folks are working really, really hard and keeping our business alive,” said Bob Zupanek, vice president of operations.</p>
<p>Although COVID-19 has left many businesses strapped for cash, employers are making health insurance a priority.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Star Auto Mall in Greensburg furloughed 75% of its 122 workers&nbsp;for eight weeks but continued to offer health care coverage to those employees. Cleaveland/Price, a Trafford-based engineering/manufacturing firm, has maintained coverage for all employees through Highmark, which offers COVID-19 testing at no cost.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Companies are also trying to be sensitive to the unique circumstances of their employees. Camillo Lamatrice, a senior associate at The PT Services Group, said he’s been hesitant to leave the house due to his age but hasn’t received any pressure to return to work.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First National Bank, based on the North Shore, added five days to its paid caregiver leave program,&nbsp;which typically provides employees up to 10 paid days off to care for a sick family member. It also provided a relief payment to its essential frontline workers to cover financial hardship brought on by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Most of Star Auto Mall’s employees are required to work at the dealership, but managers have been accommodating of those who typically rely on childcare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“If there’s&nbsp;a family situation, it isn’t questioned twice,” said Brian Malanowski, the IT director for Star Auto Mall. “They say, ‘Yeah, good, take care of it, no problem.’”</p>
<p>Along with adjusting benefits, companies have revamped employee rewards to adhere to social distancing protocols.&nbsp;Food continues to be the key to many employees’ hearts, even when consumed 6 feet apart — or on screen.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cleaveland/Price provides boxed lunches for its on-site employees each Wednesday. It’s a socially distant alternative to the buffet-style meal that the company typically served each week.</p>
<p>“Our caterer has tried to have a different combo of sandwich and side and dessert every week to keep things interesting,” said human resources manager Dan Gorenz.</p>
<p>Instead of taking employees out to lunch for their work anniversary — as was traditional before the pandemic —<strong>&nbsp;</strong>CEO Harvey Pollack of the PT Services Group has been sending his employees gift cards so they can get takeout and join him for a phone call.</p>
<p>These socially distant gatherings and meals will likely be the norm until companies can return to the Kennywood outings and happy hours of the past.</p>
<p>“We have employees asking,&nbsp;‘When are we going to have the hot lunches again?’” Mr. Gorenz said.&nbsp;“I tell them,&nbsp;‘When the virus is over!’”</p>
