<h1>Full Pint Brewing Co. is not dead yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Full Pint Brewing Co. has some good news for its fans:&nbsp;“We’re not dead yet.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of Pittsburgh’s bigger craft breweries announced that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2020/03/31/Full-Pint-Brewing-closing-North-Versailles-North-Huntingdon-Pittsburgh-brewery/stories/202003280037" target="_blank">it was going to close this past Friday</a> after selling the last of its beer from the brewery on the border of North Versailles and North Huntingdon in Westmoreland County. The business is in bankruptcy and co-owner and brewer Barrett Goddard expected Friday would be the last the place would be selling growlers of draft beer to go.</p>
<p>But so many people came for last week’s last call that he announced on social media on Saturday,&nbsp;“We are staying open until we run out of beer.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He profusely thanked supporters who bought enough beer to pay rent to keep the doors open for at least a little while.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He plans to keep dispensing the beer to go — bring your own growlers — Wednesday and Friday and perhaps beyond on those two days a week, from 5 to 8 p.m..</p>
<p>“Our wholesaler Wilson-McGinley has some inventory so we should be able to remain open through April at least and possibly longer depending on how quickly we are moving through beer,” he said in a text.</p>
<p>Having bought back some of that beer, he expects to be able to fill growlers of more than a dozen varieties, including some special ones as well as flagships including All in Amber,&nbsp;Chinookie IPA and&nbsp;White Lightning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He still is hoping someone buys the business for $750,000. “Hopefully we get a buyer by June,” said. “If not it will go to auction.”</p>
