<h1>Jeff Capel signs two-year extension with Pitt </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Almost two years ago, Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke entrusted Jeff Capel to take the reins of a men’s basketball program teetering dangerously close to a hole out of which it might not be able to climb.</p>
<p>This week, after Capel’s first 47 games at the school, she rewarded him for what she has seen thus far.</p>
<p>Capel has signed a two-year contract extension through the 2026-27 season, the school announced Wednesday, building on the seven-year deal he inked in March 2018.</p>
<p>“I am excited about the direction of our basketball program as we continue to build a sustainable winning culture in the Atlantic Coast Conference,” Capel said in a statement. “We will continue to give 100 percent of ourselves as we represent Pitt on the court, in the classroom and in the community. The Pittsburgh community has embraced my family and me and we look forward to deepening our roots here.”</p>
<p>Heading into Wednesday night’s game at North Carolina, the Panthers are 24-23 under Capel after going 12-35 in the 47 games preceding his arrival, which included an 8-24 finish in 2017-18 that led to the firing of Capel’s predecessor, Kevin Stallings.</p>
<p>Four of Pitt’s wins this season have come against teams from major conferences, which included a season-opening win against a Florida State squad now ranked in the top 10 of both national polls. Last season, it beat two teams, Florida State and Louisville, that went on to make the NCAA tournament on its way to an eight-win improvement overall from the previous season, including a four-win jump in conference play.</p>
<p>After coming to Pitt with the reputation as one of college basketball’s most effective recruiters following a seven-year stint as an assistant with Duke, Capel has provided some talent for a program in desperate need of it. In his 22 months at the school, Capel has signed five top-150 prospects, two of whom — center John Hugley and forward Noah Collier — are set to join the program next season. That tally does not include his most impactful signing to date, sophomore guard Xavier Johnson, who earned first-team all-ACC freshman honors last season.</p>
<p>Last week, Capel landed a commitment from Jalen Hood-Schifino, a five-star guard in the 2022 class, giving the Panthers their first such recruit since Steven Adams in 2012.</p>
<p>The program’s progress under its second-year coach hasn’t been without frustrations, the kind that many rebuilds entail. Earlier this season, Pitt lost at home to Nicholls State, and last Saturday it squandered a 16-point first-half lead in a loss to Wake Forest.</p>
<p>In 10-plus seasons as a head coach, four of which came at Virginia Commonwealth and five of which came at Oklahoma, Capel has a 199-133 record.</p>
<p>Details of the contract were not made available. Pitt, as a state-related institution, is not beholden to Freedom of Information Act requests.</p>
<p>Though a contract extension, short of an onerous buyout, won’t prevent other interested schools from luring Capel away, the move shows a level of commitment from Lyke to her highest-profile hire in her nearly three years as athletic director. Thanks to extensions they both received from Lyke, the coaches of the Panthers’ two biggest programs — Capel and football coach Pat Narduzzi — are tied to contracts that, after the completion of this basketball season, run a combined 12 years.</p>
<p>“In a short time, I have seen Coach Capel and his staff provide Pitt basketball with the opportunity to succeed at the highest level because of their work ethic, basketball acumen and belief in building this program the right way with the right people,” Lyke said in a statement. “What has impressed me most with Coach Capel is the genuine relationships he has developed with our student-athletes and he and his staff’s ability to make our student-athletes better players and people. These relationships are an early indicator of the long term success they will have together.”</p>
