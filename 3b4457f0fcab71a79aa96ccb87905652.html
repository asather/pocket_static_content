<h1>Pompeo, State Department work to bring home U.S. citizens but thousands remain abroad</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Department of State has identified about 21,000 Americans who remain stranded abroad and are seeking assistance in returning home to the U.S. as the COVID-19 pandemic spreads, Secretary Mike Pompeo said Friday.</p>
<p>The department is working to bring back U.S. citizens who are stuck around the globe — in many cases,&nbsp;in countries where commercial transportation options have been limited because of the virus — and said it had coordinated the return of more than 37,000 people from dozens of countries as of Friday morning.</p>
<p>Though he said he doesn’t expect there will be an “end date” to the repatriation program, Mr. Pompeo warned that people who want to come home “need to be expeditious” about coming back.</p>
<p>The State Department recently issued guidance to Americans abroad urging them to explore commercial flight options, and if none are available, to contact the nearest embassy or consulate.&nbsp;Mr. Pompeo has said he can’t guarantee the U.S. government will continue to arrange chartered flights indefinitely when commercial options are strained.</p>
<p>“It will become increasingly difficult for us to execute this mission,” Mr. Pompeo told reporters on a conference call, noting that conditions are not improving across the globe and that countries will continue to make changes to their respective lockdowns, restricting travel in and out of their countries in different ways.</p>
<p>“We still have a big group in front of us and we continue to get new people identified every day,” the Secretary of State added.</p>
<p>The federal government has not released state-by-state data on the Americans who remain abroad and are seeking return, but U.S. Sen. Bob Casey’s office indicated that it continues to hear from Pennsylvanians -- though that number “has decreased significantly from a few weeks ago” and many they’ve come into contact with have returned home, spokeswoman Natalie Adams said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, D-Pa., commended the state department for its efforts, but said he continues to be concerned about the “speed with which the effort came together,” citing the amount of time it took for the department to request the help of the Department of Defense’s Transportation Command in contracting aircraft for repatriation.</p>
<p>Some Pennsylvanians abroad who have contacted the senator’s office, Mr. Casey said, say they have not received a response from the State Department regarding return flights to the U.S., and those “failures in communication have frankly been a deep source of frustration for congressional offices across the board.”</p>
<p>Asked by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about the department’s contact with state officials, Mr. Pompeo said the department has talked with dozens of governors and hundreds of members of Congress who have reached out about particular situations with particular constituents, some with issues extending beyond the desire to return home.</p>
<p>The department, Mr. Pompeo said, has facilitated —&nbsp;and in some cases, delivered —&nbsp;the transfer of medicine to some Americans.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said that moving forward, he will continue to push the federal government to waive the cost for citizens returning home on State Department chartered flights.</p>
<p>“I will be pushing for such a waiver to be included in a future coronavirus legislative package,” Mr. Casey said. “Pennsylvanians should not have to pay exorbitant fees to get home during a crisis.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pompeo urged Americans who have questions or difficulties abroad to register with their nearest embassy at <a href="http://www.step.state.gov" target="_blank">www.step.state.gov</a>&nbsp;and to start the process of returning home immediately.</p>
