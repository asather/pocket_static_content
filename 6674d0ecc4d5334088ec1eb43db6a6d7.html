<h1>State auditors will stop school visits during COVID-19 shutdown</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>State Auditor General Eugene DePasquale said his auditors will cease school business office visits during the shutdown to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>School districts, he said, should focus on the health and safety of their communities and do not need the distraction that his office’s auditors would cause.</p>
<p>“School districts already have their hands full, and we are not going to add to their operational challenges,” Mr. DePasquale said in a statement. “My team will continue to work on audits that are already underway, but we will do so remotely and without making in-person contact.”</p>
<p>Mr. DePasquale said his department continues to operate through teleworking, and said districts should call his office if they have any questions.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf last week ordered all K-12 schools in Pennsylvania to close beginning Monday for 10 business days in an effort to slow the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
