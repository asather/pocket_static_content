<h1>Gene Therapy: Fix the Democratic debates format? Got dynamite?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The next Democratic debate is scheduled for March 15, affording the relevant authorities plenty of time to tweak the format, and by “tweak” I mean, of course, obliterate with explosives.</p>
<p>Who on God’s Earth thinks what CBS mashed into a prime time broadcast on Tuesday is the way a modern presidential debate ought to be presented?</p>
<p>I suppose it’s possible there was some mid-level corporate operative deep within the network’s programming division who wobbled away from the 10th debate of this election cycle thinking, “Yeah, that was fine,” but the rest of us are still trying to decide who should be most embarrassed, the candidates, the moderators, the live audience, or the people watching at home hoping for some trace of clarity. Aren’t they adorable?</p>
<p>Let’s start on stage and work our way back.</p>
<p>The candidates, now reduced to seven from the original 189, clearly prefer one of two basic optics. It’s either one person speaking while the rest try to flag down their Uber, or it’s everyone talking at once. If I want a TV show where everyone talks at the same time, I’ll watch “The View.”</p>
<p>The primary strategy on stage is to attack the candidate who projects as the most likely to achieve actual momentum in the moment. It was Joe Biden in the early going, then Mike Bloomberg, then Bernie Sanders on Tuesday. Elizabeth Warren, who eviscerated Mr. Bloomberg in Nevada last week, did it again Tuesday just for the hell of it. One or more of these people should have the option, for at least one debate, to wear one of those gray non-contact jerseys like the injured Penguins put on at practice. Bernie could have pulled one on Tuesday and saved himself plenty of grief.</p>
<p>The whole attack strategy is not only misguided, it sucks the rhetorical life from the whole purpose of the debate, to inform that portion of the public that cares enough to tune in. Attacks should be aimed at the incumbent. This is a one-issue election, one, and it’s President Donald Trump. Moreover, there is one qualification, one, and it’s electability. No one is tuning in to see what Pete Buttigieg thinks of Amy Klobuchar.</p>
<p>For a few minutes on Tuesday, it appeared Mr. Biden had figured this out. Near the middle of the stage, he kept a regal posture in quiet bemusement while the others savaged each other. Joe looked almost presidential, but he eventually found a groove from which he complained about the monitors over and over (not that they didn’t have it coming).</p>
<p>When CBS monitor Gayle King warned candidates to stick to their allotted time, Mr. Biden chirped, “Good idea!”</p>
<p>When Ms. King replied, “We’ll get to you,” Mr. Biden said, “You keep saying that, but you haven’t done it yet.” When the former vice president did talk, he mostly complained about being restricted. “Why am I stopping? No one else stops. Gentlemen don’t get very well treated up here.”</p>
<p>So Joe made himself into a victim, which was totally useless and seemingly ignorant of the fact that victimization is Mr. Trump’s lane exclusively (“Very unfair!”).</p>
<p>As for the moderators, Ms. King and Norah O’Donnell were definitively steamrolled by just about everyone on stage, thus affixing to what is supposed to be a very serious event the general flavor of a bar fight you’re listening to from the backroom. Separately and together, Ms. King and Ms. O’Donnell failed spectacularly. The questions they plucked from Twitter were better than those they asked themselves, which were transparently calibrated to ignite fireworks rather than add to anyone’s understanding of the issues. Forty-two minutes in, they were reinforced for a time by Major Garrett, Bill Whitaker and Margaret Brennan, but the horses had fled the barn. In the end, rather than provide time to each candidate for a summation or a closing statement, CBS decided to ask each about their “motto” and to reveal a “misconception about you.”</p>
<p>What, it’s “The Dating Game” now?</p>
<p>No one watching for the first time could sit through two hours and 15 minutes of this and come away thinking America is a serious country. When we produce the presidential debates like a very special Tuesday night edition of World Wrestling Entertainment’s “Monday Night Raw,” with pulsating music at the top and a live audience that acted like it had walked in from a tailgate, we aren’t really serious. When Ms. Klobuchar mentioned the so-called Charleston loophole, a hole in the applicable gun law that enabled Dylan Roof to get the weapon he used to murder nine people at a Charleston Church, some yahoo shouted out like his hometown had been name-checked by Jimmy Fallon on “The Tonight Show.”</p>
<p>“The Big Bang Theory” may be filmed before a live studio audience, but that doesn’t mean the presidential debates have to be. It’s stupid. If there must be an audience, it has to instructed to sit down and shut up. This would be easier if the networks, particularly the cable channels, weren’t so intent on pimping these things like an endless Super Bowl pregame show.</p>
<p>Finally, consider the home audience and the conclusions the networks and the candidates have apparently drawn about us, based on this show. How dumb do they think we are? Exactly as dumb as all this appears.</p>
<p>Obviously, I expect all this to be rectified in the next two weeks.</p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
