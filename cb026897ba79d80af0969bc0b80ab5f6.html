<h1> Mt. Lebanon School Board waives Keystone Exams requirement </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon School Board voted April 14 to waive the requirement that graduating seniors must pass the Keystone Exams.</p>
<p>Traditionally, in order for students to be eligible for graduation, they must demonstrate mastery on the algebra, literature and biology Keystone Exams. The Keystone Exams are end-of-course assessments that assess proficiency in the subject area. If students do not demonstrate proficiency on a Keystone Exam, they typically would be allowed to turn in a project to raise the test score.</p>
<p>However, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the board voted unanimously to waive both requirements for graduation.</p>
<p>Board members stated that students in the class of 2020 who have not demonstrated proficiency on one or more Keystone Exams and have not successfully completed the supplemental instruction program or a project-based assessment will still be eligible for graduation, provided that all other graduation requirements have been met.</p>
<p>Additionally, the board approved a revised calendar for the current school year.</p>
<p>The revisions included some retroactive dates including the date school resumed online, which was March 30, and four days school was in session, April 8, 9, 10 and 13, which had previously been Mt. Lebanon’s spring break.</p>
<p>April 28, which had previously been Election Day, will now be a day that school is in session. June 2, the new Election Day, will be an in-service day.</p>
<p>The revised calendar reflects 178 days of instruction for students, which is permissible under the guidelines provided by the state Department of Education.</p>
<p>Board President Sarah Olbrich said that Gov. Tom Wolf has allowed schools to have less than 180 days of instruction this year. She said typically, Mt. Lebanon has 184 days of instruction.</p>
<p>Also, taxes in the Mt. Lebanon School District are expected to remain at 24.79 mills for the 2020-21 school year as the board unanimously approved the district’s $105,724,915 budget at a meeting April 14.</p>
<p>“These unprecedented times call for creative measures,” board President Sarah Olbrich said prior to the vote.</p>
<p>“Tonight my fellow board members and I will be voting on a zero-mill tax increase for our community for the 2020-21 school year. This is our rainy day,” she said, adding that holding the line on taxes is in the best interest of the community.</p>
<p>The district is using $2,775,000 worth of its $12.1 million fund balance to balance the budget.</p>
<p>“This budget maintains all the current programs we are offering in Mt. Lebanon,” said Robert Geletko, director of business for the district. “I’m very happy with where we’re at and think this is a great thing for our taxpayers and community members.”</p>
<p>Mr. Geletko added that the district will be developing a three- to five-year plan moving forward to make up for this zero-millage increase year. He said come early next year, the administration will have estimates on a projected tax increase for the 2021-22 school year for the board to consider.</p>
<p>Additionally, the board voted that the district’s fund balance be set at 5% of budgeted expenditures in light of current circumstances, including but not limited to the COVID-19 emergency. Previously, it had been board policy to keep a fund balance of 6% of budgeted expenditures.</p>
