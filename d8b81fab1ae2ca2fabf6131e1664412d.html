<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in the seven-county Pittsburgh area jumped to 16.8% in April, up 10.9 percentage points from March as total non-farm jobs shrunk 17% to 985,100, the lowest number since 1990, according to new data from the state Bureau of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
<p>The jobless rate in the Pittsburgh metropolitan statistical area was the highest seen in the region since 1983 during the collapse of the steel industry.</p>
<p>Job losses in the Pittsburgh metro area totaled 207,000 in April compared to the same month a year ago.</p>
<p>Statewide, unemployment rate was 15.1% for April, up 9.3 percentage points from a month ago, while the national rate rose 10.3 percentage points to 14.7%.</p>
<p>The report reflects the shutdown of most forms of commerce to try to contain the spread of the new coronavirus, which causes COVID-19, a highly infectious respiratory disease.</p>
<p>Fayette County led the Pittsburgh metro region in unemployment at 20.5% followed by Beaver County at 18.7% and Armstrong County at 15.9%, according to the state Bureau of Labor &amp; Industry.</p>
<p>Unemployment in Allegheny County, which transitions to green Friday from the yellow classification as state-imposed business and travel restrictions ease, was 15.9%.</p>
