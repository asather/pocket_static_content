<h1>Pirates activate right-hander Blake Cederlind, option Jason Martin</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At long last, the Pirates have activated right-hander Blake Cederlind.</p>
<p>The 24-year-old fireballer, who enjoyed a 2.28 ERA at four separate minor-league levels in 2019, seemed a possible candidate to join the Pirates right off the bat in 2020. Unfortunately, if that was the plan, Cederlind’s progress was sidetracked by a positive COVID-19 test during summer camp.</p>
<p>Since then, he has spent the entire season at the Pirates’ alternate training site in Altoona. As the Pirates struggled during the season — they were 14-32 entering Tuesday’s game in Cincinnati — the call for some of their younger prospects to join the fray became stronger from fans.</p>
<p>That thirst was quenched a bit with the call-up of third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes, but Cederlind was a logical candidate for a midseason call-up as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pirates general manager Ben Cherington preached caution with Cederlind, though, saying they wanted to be careful with him because he does throw so hard, so it was important to make sure he was completely ready before he pitched in the majors.</p>
<p>Now, though, the Pirates have deemed the time is right. Already on the Pirates’ taxi squad for their current road trip, Cederlind is finally with the team and active for Tuesday night.</p>
<p>As a corresponding move, outfielder Jason Martin was optioned back to the Pirates’ alternate training site.</p>
