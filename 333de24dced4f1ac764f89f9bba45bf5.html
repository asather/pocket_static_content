<h1>For college students sent home early, dorm reimbursements, refunds are consolation for memories lost over COVID-19</h1>

<p>Cynthia Truong will drive across Pennsylvania with her parents this weekend to move out of a University of Pittsburgh apartment, her sophomore year on campus cut short by a spreading virus and efforts to combat it.</p>
<p>Along with boxes of belongings, the chemistry major from Downingtown, near Philadelphia, expects to bring home something else — a 30-percent refund on her $4,000 housing bill this semester that she is thankful for, though wistful nonetheless about what she and peers have lost.</p>
<p>“The things that I will miss most are the experiences with my friends,” the 19-year-old said.</p>
<p>As hundreds of thousands of college students in Pennsylvania and beyond head home mid-semester from campus housing, their expectations to be made whole represent one more financial worry for colleges already scrambling to transfer in-person courses to remote instruction amid COVID-19 fears.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Room and board fees, or auxiliary funds, are a crucial underpinning of campus budgets, used to finance payments on massive dorm construction projects and maintenance of those buildings once in operation. Dipping into that money will have impacts likely to vary based on campus size and financial strength — all at a time when enrollment losses have stretched thin the finances at many schools.</p>
<p>Pitt, Western Pennsylvania’s largest university with 34,000 students, breaks its refund policy down this way.</p>
<p>“Students who are moving out of the residence halls by April 3, 2020, will receive a pro rata reduction of housing and meal plan fees on their student account,” spokesman Kevin Zwick said. “These changes will be reflected in the eRefund bank account you have designated in PittPAY after you complete the move-out process.</p>
<p>“Those moving out by March 20 are to receive a 36% refund; those who move out between March 21 and April 3 (like Ms. Truong) receive 30 percent, and those after that do not recieve a refund,’’ he added.</p>
<p>Penn State Tuesday morning said it too will offer <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/612024/2020/03/16/administration/penn-state-plans-offer-prorated-housing-and-meal-plan?utm_source=newswire&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=612003_HTML&amp;utm_content=03-16-2020-22-54&amp;utm_campaign=Penn%20State%20Today" target="_blank">pro-rated housing and meal plan remimbursements</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Duquesne University’s website outlined a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.duq.edu/news/releases/university-update-regarding-covid-19-(coronavirus)-precautions" target="_blank">credit schedule toward a future semester’s charges</a> based on departure date. Moving out by March 22 will yield a pro-rated credit of 43% to a future semester; leaving by March 29&nbsp; yields 37%, and those afterward receive no credit.</p>
<p>On the Catholic university’s Bluff campus, the Rev. Bill Christy,&nbsp;director of campus ministry and university chaplain, sought to sooth disappointment and unease with messages he scrawled in chalk at various campus locations.</p>
<p>“Be patient. Be Brave. Be kind. Have faith,” he wrote on a brick walkway as cars with parents, students and their bags of&nbsp; belongings lined up nearby.</p>
<p>A post about it on the university’s Facebook page went viral Monday evening.</p>
<p>The call for an abrupt campus departure creates particular problems both for international students and others from far-away states whose travel by air may suddenly have become more difficult. A number of schools in the region have signaled flexibility in their move-out policies, even as they suggest students really should go home.</p>
<p>“Are students allowed to continue living in university housing for the remainder of the semester?’’ said Carnegie Mellon in a Q &amp; A. “At present, yes. However, all students who have the ability to finish this semester at home and only return to campus to retrieve their belongings are strongly encouraged to do so. There is no academic reason to return to campus.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;At Pitt, Ms. Truong left for spring break early this month and planned to return to the Forbes-Craig Apartments a few days ahead of the resumption of classes March 16. Now, with her two roommates — one from California and the other from New Jersey — already moving out, she and her parents decided it was best for her to do the same.</p>
<p>“I definitely think a lot of concern from my parents was about me being alone in Pittsburgh,” she said.&nbsp;“They saw no point in me staying.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;She feels badly for seniors, losing out on their final weeks with friends before graduation, and for freshmen, whom she said are just getting&nbsp; used to to living away from home.</p>
<p>“My freshman year, I was really closest to the people who were on my floor,” she said. “They’re really getting the rug pulled out from under them.”</p>
<p>But she is grateful, too, that she only has a five- or six-hour drive from eastern Pennsylvania, versus friends who live as far away as Orlando, Fla., and have opted to drive rather than risk flying right now.</p>
<p>She said she is also grateful that Pitt,&nbsp; along with refunds, has provided an orderly way for students to move out.</p>
<p>There are now 189,000 cases of COVID-19, also known as the novel coronavirus, and about 7,500 deathes globally as of Tuesday.</p>
<p>Many campuses in the Pittsburgh area as of Monday were just rolling out their reimbursement plans, including some that include recreation and parking fees. <a href="https://www.rmu.edu/about/health" target="_blank">Robert Morris spelled out</a>&nbsp;its plan in a message to campus Monday. Others including the State System of Higher Education and its 14 state-owned universities were still deciding how best to proceed.</p>
<p>“We’re still working out how we will do refunds for housing and dining,” said Michelle Fryling, a spokemwoman for Indiana&nbsp; University of Pennsylvania, western Pennsylvania’s larget state-owned university.</p>
