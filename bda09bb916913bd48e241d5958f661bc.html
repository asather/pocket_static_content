<h1>Hearings set on shale gas drilling air pollution regulations</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em><strong>This story will be updated.</strong></em></p>
<p>The state Department of Environmental Protection has scheduled three public hearings this month on proposed regulations to reduce air pollution from existing shale gas drilling, processing and pipelines.</p>
<p>The draft regulation, aimed at reining in emissions of volatile organic compounds and climate changing greenhouse gases, would require additional emissions controls at all of the approximately 12,000 existing unconventional natural gas well sites and connecting infrastructure, including compressor stations.</p>
<p>In addition to limiting VOCs, the regulations would, according to the DEP, have a “co-benefit of reducing methane emissions.”</p>
<p>The virtual hearings are scheduled for:</p>
<p>Tuesday, June 23, at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>Wednesday, June 24, at 2 p.m.</p>
<p>Thursday, June 25, at 6 p.m.</p>
<p>“This regulation is part of Gov. Wolf’s Methane Reduction Strategy, which is an important part of fighting climate change in Pennsylvania,” said DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell, in a release. “By utilizing reasonable pollution controls we can reduce air pollution from gas wells and related infrastructure and improve air quality.”</p>
<p>The proposed regulation would reduce air pollution by 4,404 tons per year of VOCs and 75,603 tons per year of methane.</p>
<p>VOCs can cause ground-level ozone to rise to unhealthy levels in the air during warm summer months. And methane, the primary component of natural gas, is a greenhouse gas.</p>
