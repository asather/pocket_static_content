<h1>Steelers sign tight end Eric Ebron, trade for Ravens DL Chris Wormley</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After a fairly sleepy start to free agency, the Steelers have kicked things into overdrive over the past 24 hours.</p>
<p>After agreeing to terms Thursday night with offensive lineman Stefen Wisniewski, the Steelers are now set to sign tight end Eric Ebron and trade for defensive lineman Chris Wormley, a source confirmed to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Ebron is reportedly coming in on a two-year deal worth $12 million, while the compensation for Wormley is a 2021 fifth-round pick headed to Baltimore (which will send back a seventh-rounder in the same draft).</p>
<p>With only Vance McDonald and Zach Gentry back at tight end from the active roster last year, Ebron fills an obvious need for talent, depth and experience. The 10th overall pick out of North Carolina in 2014, the 6-foot-4, 253-pound Ebron spent the past two seasons in Indianapolis after starting his career with Detroit. Ebron, who turns 27 next month,&nbsp;had a career year in 2018 with 13 touchdown catches and 750 yards, but couldn’t duplicate it last season. He missed the final five games with an ankle injury and finished with 375 yards and three touchdowns on 31 catches in the Colts’ first run without Andrew Luck at quarterback.</p>
<p>As for Wormley, at 6-5, 300 pounds, he can play both at nose tackle or end in the Steelers’ 3-4 defense. The 2017 third-round pick out of Michigan played in all 32 regular-season games the past two years for the Ravens and started 13. Last season, he had 2 tackles for loss, 1.5 sacks and 6 quarterback hits while playing 46% of the defensive snaps.</p>
