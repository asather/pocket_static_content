<h1>Slippery Rock student hurt in 80-foot fall at McConnell's Mill State Park</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A 21-year-old Slippery Rock University student was on a walk with friends when she <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/north/2020/02/23/McConnells-Mill-State-Park-Slippery-Rock-University-student-cliff-fall/stories/202002230195" target="_blank">slipped off an 80-foot cliff</a> in McConnells Mill State Park Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>Jocie Van Kirk was flown to a hospital where she is being treated for neck, back and pelvis injuries, according to her sister Chelsea Lynn Van Kirk’s Facebook post.</p>
<p>Brian Flores, assistant park manager at McConnells Mill State Park, said the friends were exploring off-trail by the Breakneck Falls rock climbing area, a “dangerous” area that usually required ropes and safety equipment.</p>
<p>Ms. Van Kirk, originally from Pittsburgh, was walking on a sloped rock when she lost her footing around 3:20 p.m., Mr. Flores said. She tumbled 15 to 20 feet down the sloped rock before hitting a tree, which threw her down about 25 to 30 feet to the next level. There, she hit dirt — rather than jagged rock — before tumbling 15 feet into the creek below.</p>
<p>Firefighters were on the scene by 3:30 p.m. Charles Peak, assistant chief with the Slippery Rock Township Fire Department, said emergency responders found Ms. Van Kirk on rocks next to the water near Breakneck Bridge.</p>
<p>Mr. Flores said her three friends and other park visitors helped Ms. Van Kirk out of the water before calling 911. The local Slippery Rock EMS crew used a stokes basket and ropes to move her to the park’s extraction area nearby. An ambulance then took her to Cheeseman Farm, where a helicopter flew her to UPMC Presbyterian in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Janet Falotico, the executive director of Visit Lawrence County, said falls in the park are not uncommon.</p>
<p>“It’s not like going to a typical park,” she said. It's beautiful, but “you really have to respect your surroundings.”</p>
<p>Charles Peak, assistant chief with the Slippery Rock Township Fire Department, said this time of year is the most dangerous, as rocks and roots are slippery.</p>
<p>Mr. Flores said little sunlight reaches the area Ms. Van Kirk was exploring around Breakneck Bridge, so there’s often ice and wet conditions late into the season.</p>
<p>He says they recommend park visitors “know their environment” and stay on trails.</p>
