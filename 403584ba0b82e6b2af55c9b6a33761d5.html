<p>Trent Soyster’s Franklin Park neighbors had a front-row seat to a production unlike anything they’ve seen before. Sure, they may have seen the musical “Les Miserables. But it’s unlikely the revolution began with the waving of a red tablecloth from a pool cue.</p>
<p>Mr. Soyster, 22, and his BFF Maddie Rodrigue, 24, a fellow teacher, performer, choregrapher and Pace University graduate, created the video “Broadway At Home: The MT Revue.” MT is for Maddie and Trent or musical theater. Either way, it works.</p>
<p>The duo’s elaborate planning produced a love letter to Broadway that has struck a nerve for its joyous DIY spirit as New York theater remains closed due to COVID-19.</p>
<p>Their video has been viewed nearly 12,000 times on YouTube and Instagram, and drawn attention from Broadway World, Playbill and a news program in Ms. Rodrigue’s native Baltimore. Featuring bits of musicals from “Oklahoma!” to “Dear Evan Hansen” packed into 4 minutes, the video is all Team MT, including videography.</p>
<p>The tribute came about after Broadway moved back its re-opening, from June to Sept. 6. At the time, Ms. Rodrigue had completed her first season as a Rockette in the “Radio City Christmas Spectacular,” and Mr. Soyster was traveling as a performer in the tour of “Escape to Margaritaville,” which would have brought him home May 12-17.</p>
<p>Mr. Soyster had attended his friend’s opening night as a Rockette, and she was planning to come to Pittsburgh to see him onstage before the shutdown.</p>
<p>Speaking via Zoom, the musical theater actor said a goal was to get away from “the I’m sorry narrative.” Instead of dwelling on what was lost, as in, “I’m sorry you lost your dream job,” the idea was to be proactive and have some fun.</p>
<p>“Also, we wanted to be like our 5-year-old selves again,” Ms. Rodrigue said.</p>
<p>Mr. Soyster has been performing nearly that far back, starting with Act One Theater School in Shaler. He moved on to CLO Academy and Pittsburgh CLO’s “A Musical Christmas Carol,” followed by roles in “Disney’s Newsies” and “Footloose” on the Benedum stage. He also was an intern with Front Porch Theatricals before landing his first national tour.</p>
<p>Both performers met while they were students in the School of Performing Arts at Pace University — but not at the school.</p>
<p>“We were at an audition and I saw him dance, and I just went up to him and said, ‘We should be friends,’ “ Ms. Rodrigue recalled. Then he saw her dance, and their friendship was sealed.</p>
<p>MT have since been a team as choreographers and working with Young Artists of America. They will continue teaching online this summer, bringing some of what they learned making “Broadway At Home” to creating an online “Wizard of Oz” with students.</p>
<p>If you are wondering how they worked out social distancing and safe practices, it took some discipline and help from their families. They each quarantined alone for three weeks before Ms. Rodrigue packed up her car and drove straight through from Baltimore to Mr. Soyster’s home.</p>
<p>Her car was filled with costumes from previous shows, but you will see that the pair otherwise followed their self-imposed rules: Use only available household items, and accept no help on the production.</p>
<p>To a recording of Ethel Merman’s “There’s No Business Like Show Business,” you will see closeups of the clicking heels of ruby red slippers, followed in the next shot by “Wicked’s” Elphaba. There are references to “Cabaret,” “Cats,” “A Chorus Line” … any theater fan will enjoy naming the references.</p>
<p>“Also, if you notice, any time we touch, we are wearing gloves,” Mr. Soyster said of the care that went into the performances.</p>
<p>Ms. Rodrigue drove into Pittsburgh early on May 17 and left three days later after an editing session that went into the wee hours of a Wednesday morning. They are each quarantining again for three weeks.</p>
<p>With a newfound mentor from the business sector, the duo is working on an online platform, dedicated to artists who want to let their creative flags fly and need a little inspiration to get going.</p>
<p>All this, from not giving into their loss but, rather, using it to have some fun, on their own terms.</p>
<p>“We were like, let’s stop saying ‘I’m sorry’ and let’s make something,” Mr. Soyster said. “Let’s send some Broadway smiles out to the world when you can’t go to New York and see a show.”</p>
