<h1>DeWine outlines cautious approach to reopening Ohio’s economy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — Routine outpatient procedures may resume in doctor, dentist, veterinarian, and other medical offices across Ohio on Friday.</p>
<p>Manufacturers, stores, and offices will follow over the next two weeks.</p>
<p>But there are no immediate plans to reopen bars and restaurants for sit-down service or allow theaters, concerts, sports events, or other mass gatherings to return to normal under the slow, methodical approach that Gov. Mike DeWine outlined Monday to reawaken Ohio's economy.</p>
<p>Salons, barbershops, public pools, and day care centers also remain in limbo.</p>
<p>When will they follow?</p>
<p>“I wish I knew,” Mr. DeWine said, resisting calls from some of those in his own party to entirely lift his state-at-home order by Friday at the latest.</p>
<p>The governor said he wants to move step by step and watch to see what happens with new infections and hospitalizations as Ohioans who remain vulnerable to coronavirus slowly get back out and interact with each other — albeit while wearing masks, washing their hands, and keeping at least six feet between one another.</p>
<p>He said his plan hits the “sweet spot” of balancing public health needs with the need of getting Ohio’s economy back up and running.</p>
<p>“To throw the doors open on May 1 and say ‘get rid of the state-at-home order, get rid of the distancing, get rid of everything,’ would be totally irresponsible,” he said. “I have an obligation as governor of this state to do two things right now — get people back to work and keep them safe.”</p>
<p>While his stay-at-home order will have more holes in it to allow reopening businesses to have customers, the general concept will remain in place with Ohioans otherwise remaining at home as much as possible.</p>
<p>The new rules in Ohio’s battle against the coronavirus coincide with another decline in new cases and deaths.</p>
<p>On Monday, the state reported 16,325 total cases, an increase of 362. There were 3,232 hospitalizations, up 54, and 978 deaths, up 26 since Sunday.</p>
<p>All three numbers were below the daily average seen over the last five days, the trend marker that Mr. DeWine and his health director, Dr. Amy Acton, have been closely watching.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said all medical, dental, and veterinary procedures that can be done that do not require an overnight stay in a hospital can move ahead as of May 1 — Friday. This will occur despite concerns among some medical professionals that, after turning over their own masks and other personal protection equipment to those on the front lines of the pandemic, they may not have enough for themselves.</p>
<p>Some elective surgeries, however, will still be prohibited.</p>
<p>On May 4, manufacturing, distribution services, and construction will resume. However, employers must follow sanitation and hygiene procedures, including the use of face masks by all employees, daily health assessments of employees, social distancing, and regular cleansing of facilities. Capacity would be reduced to 50 percent of that allowed by the fire code.</p>
<p>More specifically, manufacturers would have to implement six-foot distancing and changes to shifts to minimize people being in groups. Offices would also reopen.</p>
<p>“Companies have found out that many members of the office can work at home and be just as efficient,” Mr. DeWine said. “Personnel should work at home if at all humanly possible.”</p>
<p>The final step for now would come on May 12 when retailers could reopen, as long as they follow new regulations, including wearing facial coverings. While the governor has not mandated wearing masks by Ohioans generally, customers would have to wear them while in stores or risk being turned away.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, it’s going to be up to the store to regulate that,” Mr. DeWine said. “Ultimately, beyond that it’s the health department.”</p>
<p>There is still no set date for reopening businesses like barbershops, salons, and tattoo parlors. Spokesmen for the governor and Dr. Acton said neither has personally had a haircut since the shutdown orders were issued.</p>
<p>The current order shutting down non-essential businesses and instructing Ohioans to stay at home as much as possible will expire on Friday. Mr. DeWine has already given up on the idea that K-12 students could physically return to the classroom this academic year.</p>
<p>The Ohio Restaurant Association urged Mr. DeWine to give its members two weeks' advance notice and allow those that are ready to reopen to do so on May 15. It warned that every week that goes by will mean more restaurants will not survive.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said he considered a geographic approach, first reopening portions of the state that have had fewer infections. But he decided against it.</p>
<p>“I think people would have been confused...,” he said. “I just don't think it would work.”</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. Jon Husted also said such an approach would be counterproductive if it led to people in one area of the state to travel to another, potentially carrying the virus with them, to take advantage of more open businesses.</p>
<p>Some 30 House Republicans have signaled a desire to move much more quickly as about half of the GOP caucus signed a letter calling for a return to a more open economy.</p>
<p>“We believe it is time to trust Ohioans,” the Republican letter reads. “They have respectfully followed the guidelines and NOW is the time to responsibly open all businesses.”</p>
<p>Signing on from northwest Ohio were Reps. Derek Merrin (R., Monclova Township), Jim Hoops (R., Napoleon), Bill Reineke (R., Tiffin), Jon Cross (R., Kenton), Craig Riedel (R., Defiance), and Riordan McClaim (R., Upper Sandusky).</p>
<p>But about 10 of them went even further, demanding in a separate letter more from Mr. DeWine than he was willing to give Monday.</p>
<p>“Respectfully, understand that we will hold you and your administration notably accountable, just as our own constituents are doing to us if we believe your plan is not bold enough,” the letter reads. “We also request that the current 'stay-at-home' order be lifted immediately, but certainly no later than May 1, 2020.”</p>
<p>Northwest Ohio Republicans signing onto that letter included Reps. Riedel, Reineke, and McClain.</p>
<p>Among other things, House Democrats have urged expanded protection for workers — including the ability to stay home when sick, have access to safe day care for their children, the ability for vulnerable populations to stay home to protect themselves, and added support for businesses that will face additional expenses that are not usually part of their bottom lines.</p>
<p>“I had a constituent talk to me about the choice he's going to have to make between going back to work or losing his unemployment benefits,” Rep. Paula Hicks-Hudson (D., Toledo) said. “He's one of those in the [higher-risk] population...So we need to have something along the lines of paid sick and family leave that can specifically help those who have to make these types of choices.”</p>
<p>She also said such employees should have access to health insurance, personal protection equipment, hazard pay, and expanded workers' compensation benefits to cover employees who contract coronavirus outside the home.</p>
<p>A survey released Monday by Toledo-based Great Lakes Marketing Research found only 37 percent of adults in the area are ready to return to public places like libraries, zoos, gyms, and movie theaters when stay-at-home regulations are loosened.</p>
<p>The findings are based on responses from 1,200 randomly selected adults in the Toledo region.</p>
