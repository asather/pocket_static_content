<h1>Steelers mailbag: The COVID-19 contingency plan for kickers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Brian Batko’s Steelers mailbag. You’re more than welcome to email him at bbatko@post-gazette.com, tweet him @BrianBatko or slide into his DMs to inquire about the Steelers, NFL or anything out of bounds. </em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started, and don’t forget to join us on our all-sports podcast, <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/the-north-shore-drive-sports-podcast/" target="_blank">The North Shore Drive</a>, whether you use Apple, Spotify or any of the other major podcasting platforms.</em></p>
<p><strong>@Steelman7558:</strong> What do you do if you don’t have kicker on practice squad and Boswell tests positive on Friday or Saturday?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Make sure you score touchdowns in the red zone and then go for 2? Just kidding. In all seriousness, this is a concern, but here’s a sample scenario:</p>
<p>As an exercise, let’s say on Friday that kicker Chris Boswell (or long-snapper Kameron Canaday) tests positive for COVID-19 (or gets injured). The Steelers play Monday night.</p>
<p>In this case, they can afford to take a quick look at the kickers who are on the street, and they call up <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/sports/seahawks/heres-the-kicker-on-seahawks-hauschka-his-first-name-is-really-stephen-and-not-steven/" target="_blank">Stephen/Steven Hauschka</a>. Hauschka would need two negative tests 24 hours apart before he can join the Steelers. So, let’s say he manages to get a test Friday, the same day Boswell tests positive, now that’s Day 1. He then gets tested again Saturday, that’s Day 2. Now on Sunday, Day 3, he must test negative again, but this time in-person at the team facility. If he’s good to go, he can join the team in person.</p>
<p>To further extrapolate your very good question, let’s say Canaday tests positive on Saturday, two days before the game. Now you might be in a predicament where you risk not having enough time to sign a long-snapper off the couch. You still have two options: first, you can sign a long-snapper off a practice squad. Yes, there is one team, the Lions, with a snapper on their practice squad. Because he’s been with an NFL team and undergone daily testing, he only needs two negative tests before he can enter the team facility, essentially speeding up your timeline by one day. The other option is to bring in a snapper who tried out for another team within the last day, as long as there are any, because he’ll have been tested recently like a practice squad signee.</p>
<p>Now, it doesn’t seem too many teams are all that worried about this doomsday scenario, because if they were, all 32 would have a kicker, punter and long-snapper on their practice squads they could immediately elevate to the active roster. The Steelers did keep a punter in Corliss Waitman. But it’s still interesting to think about, especially if a kicker would test positive the day before the game and without enough time to bring in an outside option, now you have Cam Heyward kicking extra points.</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> The Steelers made heavy use of the XFL to fill out their offseason roster, signing a whopping nine castoffs before the NFL draft in late April. According to our friends at <a href="https://xflnewshub.com/xfl-to-nfl-player-tracker/" target="_blank">XFLNewsHub.com</a>, the Panthers had the next most at five, and 15 teams didn’t bother with one at all.</p>
<p>But while the Steelers went heavy on XFL products, they didn’t end up keeping a single one on the 53-man roster. Only two even made it to the practice squad: offensive linemen Anthony Coyle and Jarron Jones.</p>
<p>Once again, tracked by XFL News Hub, four players from that defunct league ended up surviving the final cut. The Chargers kept a tight end and tackle, while the Panthers kept a tight end and quarterback. But all along, Mike Tomlin was adamant about wanting to provide as much competition as possible, which means bringing in the best players possible (within reason), so those 10 guys who at least had some level of experience playing professional football may have been better camp bodies than undrafted rookies.</p>
<p>Can we give a quick shoutout J.C. Hassenauer, though? Flash back to last offseason, when the Steelers also made use of the Alliance of American Football folding and flooding the market with free agents. They signed eight of those alumni at various points, and while Kameron Kelly made the team last year — and even started Week 1, looking like a former AAF safety against the Patriots — only one player on the current roster can say he played in either spring startup league. That would be Hassenauer, the interior offensive lineman who went undrafted two years ago out of Alabama. We don’t know how long he’ll last, but he’s come a long way from the Birmingham Iron.</p>
<p><strong>Beth G.:</strong> Hi Brian, love your mailbags. I think the Steelers should continue the tradition of playing “Renegade” in the third/fourth quarter before a big defensive stand accompanied by the insanely loud crowd noise that greets each rendition. What do you think?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> Thanks, Beth. The scoreboard can still play “Renegade” when the defense needs it most, but “insanely loud crowd noise” — or insanely loud Styx — isn’t going to fly. The NFL has already told teams it will enforce policies about artificial noise at each stadium and has even set a maximum decibel level of 75 for music and “audio prompts,” such as when Steelers fans hear “It’s thiiiiiiiiiird down!” The league will also provide teams a pre-approved audio file of looped crowd noise, which must be played at 70 decibels, no higher or lower, throughout the game, fans or no fans in attendance. If you don’t abide by these rules, you’ll get in trouble.</p>
<p><strong>Ed B.:</strong> I see at the <a href="https://shop.steelers.com/pittsburgh-steelers-mens-black-and-yellow-bars-short-sleeve-t-shirt" target="_blank">Steelers store on steelers.com</a> they are selling shirts that say “black &amp; yellow”? So what’s the deal? Is our precious “black &amp; gold” now “black &amp; yellow”? Or do you think it’s just personal preference?</p>
<p><strong>Brian:</strong> You can thank Wiz Khalifa for this, Ed. Even if there’s been an age-old struggle for Steelers fans debating whether their primary color is gold or yellow, Wiz’s hip-hop hit from 2010 has cast the discussion in a new light. From my experience, the old school Steelers fans will never let go of calling them “the black and gold” and might even chew you out for suggesting anything else.</p>
<p>But the younger generation, especially those who grew up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UePtoxDhJSw" target="_blank">the famous “Black and Yellow”</a> song, must be accounted for. That’s what you’re seeing in the Steelers Pro Shop, no doubt. Surely, you can still find plenty of official merchandise to represent the “black and gold” if you wish, but the team is leaning into the colloquial term for the Steelers. Ten years after the release of that song, it clearly has staying power.</p>
