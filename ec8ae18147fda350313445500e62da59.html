<h1>Allegheny County jury trials — both criminal and civil — will resume in October</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jury trials in Allegheny County will resume in October, according to an announcement made Tuesday.</p>
<p>Criminal and civil trials for the Fifth Judicial District will begin Oct. 19, and will be held at different locations, including the David L. Lawrence Convention Center.</p>
<p>The convention site also will be used for jury selection, according to a release. It is secured through December and paid for with Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act funds. The contract with the Sports &amp; Exhibition Authority is worth $628,406.</p>
<p>The cases will resume after an order was issued Tuesday by Allegheny County Common Pleas Court President Judge Kim Berkeley Clark.</p>
<p><em>Here’s a copy of the order:</em></p>
<p>“The right to a trial by jury is one of the fundamental rights of U.S. citizenship, but due to the pandemic, there has not been a jury trial held in Allegheny County for the last six months,” said Judge Clark.&nbsp;“During this time, defendants who are being held in jail, as well as victims and their families, have been waiting for a just resolution of their cases, We must begin to bring resolution and closure to these cases in the safest manner possible.”</p>
<p>According to the court,&nbsp;Civil Division jury trials will be heard in the convention center. Jury trials in the Criminal Division will be heard at one of three sites:</p>
<p>● Courtroom 700 in the City-County Building.</p>
<p>● The Gold Room in the Courthouse.</p>
<p>● Courtroom 313 in the Courthouse.</p>
<p>However, some criminal jury trials and “minor matters” may also be held at the convention center, “with the approval of the (Allegheny County) Sheriff and the Administrative Judge.”</p>
