<h1>NASCAR is back. Here's what you need to know to watch</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NASCAR Cup series is back, and aside from UFC, it’s the only major American sport staging events for the time being due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Kevin Harvick won the first race in the sport’s return Sunday at Darlington Raceway in South Carolina. Drivers will race the same circuit Wednesday night before moving to Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina for a couple of races next week. An ambitious schedule of action follows in the following weeks.</p>
<p>So what are some things casual sports fans should know if they want to watch races knowledgeably? Here are some answers to the simple questions.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any structure to a race? Or is it really just cars going around in circles?</strong></p>
<p>Each race has a scheduled distance — usually 400 to 500 laps or miles/kilometers — and that distance is broken up into stages. In most races, there are three stages, and the top 10 finishers in the first two are awarded bonus points in the season standings.&nbsp;The winner of the third and final stage is declared the race winner, and the bulk of the points for each race are then distributed to all drivers based on their finish, with the winner receiving the most and the last-place car receiving the least.</p>
<p><strong>What do the various colored flags mean?</strong></p>
<p>• The green flag means exactly what it does on the road. Go.</p>
<p>• The yellow flag is for caution. When it’s displayed, drivers need to slow down to a low speed and maintain their position until the green is next waved, at which point they can begin racing again. Caution flags are primarily used to make sure wrecks and track debris can be safely cleared, but they’re also used to reset the field between stages and slow down drivers if rain begins to fall.</p>
<p>• The red flag stops the race, usually for rain. From time to time, it will also be used to clear particularly messy wrecks or late-race wrecks that would cause too many of the remaining laps to be run under caution.</p>
<p>• The checkered flag signals the race finish and is waved when the winner crosses the finish line. The green checkered flag signals the end of a stage when the leader crosses the line.</p>
<p>• The white flag signals the final lap.</p>
<p>• The black flag is NASCAR’s version of a penalty flag. If it’s waved at a particular car, the driver and team will receive some kind of punishment for various infractions.</p>
<p>There are other flags, but these are the ones the average fan will notice during a race.</p>
<p><strong>What’s the deal with pit stops?</strong></p>
<p>Most races are too long to run on a single set of tires or tank of gas, so drivers must stop to get service from time to time. Often, they’ll also request changes to the car’s setup to help it perform better at high speeds in a given track’s corners.</p>
<p>Most stops come under caution, when there’s no danger of losing time on the track, although spots can be lost on pit road if competitors have faster stops. Sometimes green-flag stops are required, though, which puts pressure on crews to be as fast as possible.</p>
<p>Most of the strategy in NASCAR revolves around stops, as crew chiefs must balance track position with their car’s performance. Late in races, they may choose not to pit at all or take just two fresh tires instead of four to restart in a more favorable position, ahead of those who stopped and took four tires. But that will come at the expense of speed. Fuel mileage is also a consideration, especially on long green-flag runs when a lap or two can make the difference between reaching the end of the race or running out of gas.</p>
<p><strong>Do the tracks make a difference?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. No two are the same, even if they have similar layouts. Most of the tracks on which NASCAR runs can generally be described as 1.5-mile ovals, but they have varying degrees of banking and cause varying degrees of tire wear, requiring different skills, strategies and car setups on a race-to-race basis.</p>
<p>Other types of layouts include:</p>
<p>• <strong>Short tracks:</strong> Driver skills and pit strategy are the biggest factors, as lower speeds reduce the influence of aerodynamics and engine power.</p>
<p>• <strong>Road courses:</strong> Numerous turns put driver skill and focus at the forefront.</p>
<p>• <strong>Superspeedways:</strong> Limits on engine performance&nbsp;allow drivers to stay in the gas all the way around but force them to run roughly the same speeds as their competitors. This leads to pack racing because drafting off the car behind you is often the only way to go faster than the engines would otherwise allow.</p>
<p><strong>How can multiple cars/drivers be one the same team? Are they competing against each other?</strong></p>
<p>Yes and no. Drivers compete individually to win races and accrue points in the standings, but team owners may field up to four cars. Drivers whose cars share ownership are therefore referred to as teammates, even though they’re technically trying to beat each other.</p>
<p>In practical terms, the relationship is mostly about collaboration on things such as car construction and setup, pit strategy and drafting strategy at superspeedways. Teammates will also share information and usually cut each other breaks on the track.</p>
<p><strong>How do the points standings and playoffs work?</strong></p>
<p>During the regular season, drivers compete to earn one of 16 playoff spots. Race winners earn automatic bids. The rest are decided by points, rewarding the most consistent performers without race wins.</p>
<p>Once the playoffs begin, four drivers are eliminated per three-race round. Drivers who win any of the three races in a given round automatically advance. Cuts are made based on points that include “playoff points” earned over the regular season by winning races and stages, giving the top performers an edge. Playoff points can also be earned in the regular season.</p>
<p>Once the field is winnowed to four, the season-ending race determines the champion. The highest finish among the four remaining drivers is crowned, even if he doesn’t win the race itself, which includes eliminated competitors, too.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Sounds complicated.</strong></p>
<p>It is, so you can get a more thorough explanation <a href="https://www.nascar.com/news-media/2019/02/08/nascar-driver-points-awarded-per-race/" target="_blank">on NASCAR’s official website</a>&nbsp;if you wish.</p>
<p><strong>Which driver and/or team should I root for?</strong></p>
<p>That’s completely up to you. Some people pick their favorite cars. Some people pick their favorite driver personality. Some people pick the guys who win the most. It’s ultimately a subjective question that you’ll have to sort out as you go.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for drivers with Pittsburgh ties, though, there are a few. Veterans and former champions Kurt Busch and Matt Kenseth <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2020/05/15/nascar-return-darlington-raceway-chip-ganassi-racing-matt-kenseth/stories/202005150069" target="_blank">drive for team owner Chip Ganassi</a>, a Fox Chapel native and one of the most decorated owners in auto racing history. That’s as close as you’ll get to a “hometown” team, even though they’re based in Concord, N.C.</p>
<p>Ligonier native Garrett Smithley competes in the top series as well. You won’t often see him toward the front, though, as his underfunded Rick Ware Racing team doesn’t have the equipment to compete with some of the more established teams.</p>
