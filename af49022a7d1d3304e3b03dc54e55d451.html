<h1>After inactive trade deadline, Pirates looking toward future in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A significant part of the excitement for the trade deadline stems from what happens afterward.</p>
<p>In theory, if the Pirates are able to trade away some of their major league players, it opens up spots on the roster and opportunities for the minor leaguers knocking on the door. That’s a glimpse of a hopeful future in a season when the Pirates are struggling.</p>
<p>Center fielder Jarrod Dyson was dealt to the Chicago White Sox for international bonus pool slot money last week, but&nbsp;the Pirates <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/31/Pirates-stand-pat-at-MLB-trade-deadline/stories/202008310110" target="_blank">didn’t really trade anybody</a> at the deadline.</p>
<p>While that could have been seen as a damper on the potential for the promotion of any of the Pirates’ top prospects, that may not be true. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/31/Sources-Pirates-to-promote-Ke-Bryan-Hayes-for-Tuesday-s-game/stories/202008310097" target="_blank">Sources told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a> on Monday that the Pirates are expected to call up third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the alternate training site in Altoona before their game against the Chicago Cubs on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I’ve said this before, I think it’s important that we continue to get better at the major league level, individually and as a team,” general manager Ben Cherington said Monday. “And part of getting better, certainly, will be giving players — younger players, players who have a chance to be here for a long time — opportunity. It’s still a meritocracy. There’s still got to be competition. You’re not just handed playing time, you need to invest in that. So we’ll see where that takes us. We expect to see Key soon in Pittsburgh. In addition, there’s a lot of other players on the current team that we want to continue to give a chance to continue their development.”</p>
<p>And while Hayes may be the first and only call-up for now, the Pirates do have to reckon with some changes in their near future.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cherington said holding onto players who the Pirates believe will be here for seasons to come was important. For that strategy to work, they must identify those players and give them opportunities to develop.&nbsp;That may be in line with how manager Derek Shelton sees things shifting after the deadline.</p>
<p>“I think we may see guys that get different opportunities or more opportunities, or maybe on the pitching side, different leverage opportunities, but one of the things we have to continue to do is we continue to have to focus on getting better not only for this year but moving forward, and kind of isolating the areas that we need to improve,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>If that is read as giving certain guys more playing time, perhaps the goal is more clarity.</p>
<p>In some cases, the Pirates could find that a player who is given a different opportunity could excel, giving the Pirates’ belief that they could be real competitors when the team is ready to compete again. Or, maybe, they struggle and the Pirates know to shift course.&nbsp;Either way, the Pirates have a clearer path moving forward.</p>
<p>“I think in a normal year, again, you think about that,” Cherington said. “It’s not a magic number, but if you if you think about that 40-, 50-game mark, get closer 200 plate appearances, whatever that matches up for a pitcher, you feel like you have a little bit more information to see where a player is. We’ll now get to that, those markers, by the end of September, so I think we’ll have a little bit more information, a little better sense of where guys are at by the end of the month. It won’t be the same as a full year, and we’ll still be weighing things that have happened in the past just as much, because it is such a different year.”</p>
<p>That will take a bit of time to analyze. For now, all the Pirates can do is afford opportunities to players they believe can flourish with them.</p>
