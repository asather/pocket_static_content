<h1>URA board to meet Thursday to consider plans for new FNB office tower at the former Civic Arena site</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>That didn’t take long.</p>
<p>A day af­ter de­lay­ing a vote on plans for the First Na­tional Bank head­quar­ters at the for­mer Civic Arena site, the Pitts­burgh Ur­ban Re­de­vel­op­ment Au­thor­ity board sched­uled a meet­ing for Thurs­day to again con­sider the proj­ect.</p>
<p>The de­ci­sion comes a day af­ter the Pitts­burgh Pen­guins, in re­ac­tion to the de­lay in the vote, an­nounced that they were halt­ing all de­vel­op­ment ac­tiv­ity at the 28-acre lower Hill Dis­trict site.</p>
<p>In a state­ment re­leased af­ter the board’s de­ci­sion, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/development/2020/05/14/Penguins-Civic-Arena-URA-First-National-Bank-development-headquarters/stories/202005140132" target="_blank">Pen­guins CEO David More­house</a> said it was be­com­ing “in­creas­ingly im­pos­sible” to de­velop on the land, to which the team holds the rights, be­cause of “chang­ing de­mands and de­lays.”</p>
<p>“At this point, given the cur­rent eco­nomic con­di­tions and the ap­par­ent lack of sup­port from the URA, we are ceas­ing our de­vel­op­ment op­er­a­tions on the lower Hill,” he said.</p>
<p>The Pen­guins de­clined com­ment Fri­day on the URA board meet­ing sched­uled for Thurs­day.</p>
<p>In ask­ing for the de­lay in the vote, URA board mem­ber R. Daniel Lavelle, a city coun­cil­man who rep­resents the Hill, said more time was needed to di­gest de­tails re­lated to the $221 mil­lion of­fice tower and pro­posed com­mu­nity ben­e­fits.</p>
<p>As part of the de­vel­op­ment, FNB had pledged to ad­vance $8 mil­lion in fund­ing to be used for de­vel­op­ment in other parts of the Hill and an­other $3 mil­lion for Hill-re­lated hous­ing.</p>
<p>That money would be re­paid through Lo­cal Eco­nomic Revi­tal­iza­tion Tax As­sis­tance (LERTA) pro­gram tax abate­ments and park­ing tax di­ver­sions re­lated to the con­struc­tion of an 850-space park­ing ga­rage on an­other part of the site.</p>
<p>Dan Gil­man, chief of staff for Mayor Bill Peduto, said the URA and Hill lead­ers did not re­ceive the fi­nal term sheet out­lin­ing those com­mit­ments un­til Thurs­day, one of the rea­sons for the de­lay.</p>
<p>In a state­ment is­sued Fri­day morn­ing, the URA board ex­pressed dis­ap­point­ment in the Pen­guins’ de­ci­sion to halt de­vel­op­ment ac­tiv­i­ties.</p>
<p>It stated that the de­lay was needed to give the URA time to en­sure that the var­i­ous com­mit­ments made as part of the deal “are real and con­crete.” Many of those de­tails were sub­mit­ted “well past the usual dead­line,” the board stated.</p>
<p>“Despite broad sup­port for the gen­eral con­cept, both from the URA and the Greater Hill Dis­trict com­mu­nity, it’s a mat­ter of pub­lic record that the de­vel­op­ment team knew in April that much more work was needed to so­lid­ify de­tails on com­mit­ments made to the pub­lic in pre­vi­ous agree­ments,” Mr. Lavelle said in the state­ment. “The min­i­mum turn­around time usu­ally re­quested is five busi­ness days.”</p>
<p>Kevin Ack­lin, the Pen­guins’ se­nior vice pres­i­dent, said the team had been mak­ing prog­ress on all of its com­mit­ments, in­clud­ing plans to re­de­velop the Am­mon Recre­ation Center in the Hill and clos­ing the fund­ing gap on the Cur­tain Call pub­lic art proj­ect that was sup­posed to be part of the PPG Paints Arena con­struc­tion.</p>
<p>“We’re fully co­op­er­at­ing with the com­mu­nity ... and we have a tenant in FNB which has gone above and be­yond with re­spect to their com­mit­ments in the Hill Dis­trict,” he said Thurs­day.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto also weighed in on the con­tro­versy Fri­day, say­ing that the city “re­mains fully com­mit­ted to de­liv­er­ing a trans­for­ma­tive de­vel­op­ment to the Lower Hill Dis­trict in part­ner­ship with the Pitts­burgh Pen­guins” and de­vel­oper Buc­cini/​Pollin Group.</p>
<p>“This de­vel­op­ment part­ner­ship will also bring over $10M in fund­ing to the greater Hill Dis­trict Com­mu­nity, new rec2tech fa­cil­i­ties, and an MWBE small busi­ness in­cu­ba­tor, union jobs, and lo­cal hir­ing pro­grams,” he said.</p>
<p>“The City and URA are work­ing closely to ad­vance a vote in the com­ing days that will build off that part­ner­ship and take the next step for­ward in see­ing this vi­sion come to re­al­ity.”</p>
<p>The 26-story FNB tower would be built at the west end of the arena site clos­est to Down­town.</p>
<p>It would serve as the an­chor of a pro­posed $1 bil­lion re­de­vel­op­ment that would hold up to 1,420 units of hous­ing, 810,000 square feet of of­fice space, 190,000 square feet of re­tail, a live mu­sic venue, a food hall and a ho­tel.</p>
<p>The Pen­guins have re­ceived ap­proval from the URA and the Sports &amp; Ex­hi­bi­tion Au­thor­ity, both of which own parts of the site, for the pre­lim­i­nary plans for the mu­sic venue to be op­er­ated by Live Na­tion, an 850-space park­ing ga­rage, and the first 288 units of hous­ing.</p>
