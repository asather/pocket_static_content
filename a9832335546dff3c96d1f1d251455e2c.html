<h1>Dormont woman starts 'CoronaChoir' and wants neighbors to sing from their sidewalks </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oliver Brooke has been rehearsing for a choral concert at Keystone Oaks High School for months.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That is, until last week when the district instructed students and staff not to return for at least the next two weeks due to impact of the coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although the concert is still scheduled for May, the pause in school activities left the 16-year-old with a lot of uncertainty.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I was kind of cheering on the inside, but I was also thinking, ‘Oh, no. My musical. My band trip... What’s going to happen with that?’”</p>
<p>The performance was set to features classic numbers from the 1980s musical “Les Miserables” that was adapted from a novel about a French peasant in the early 19th century.</p>
<p>Oliver assumed he and his classmates’ hard work would go to waste, but what he didn’t know was that a neighbor of his in Dormont was crafting a choir of her own.</p>
<p>Amy Kline became the organizer of the Dormont&nbsp;“CoronaChoir” after she was inspired by viral videos of Italian citizens singing from their balconies while on lockdown. Italy is one of the countries that has been hit hardest by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.</p>
<p>Ms. Kline told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday that she was scrolling on social media two nights ago, when she came across a tweet from a woman who wanted her neighbors to be ready to sing Les Mis songs out their windows, just as the Italians have been doing for weeks.</p>
<p>She thought it was a funny idea, and went on to share it in a Dormont community Facebook group, telling members that if her status got 100 likes, she would organize a way for her town to all come outside and sing at the same time.</p>
<p>“Then I went to bed and woke up and it had like 110 likes,” Ms. Kline said.”...and I’m like, ‘OK, I guess I’m all in.’”</p>
<p>Ms. Kline, who just moved to Dormont from Carrick in January, went on to create another Facebook group specifically for the event named “Dormont CoronaChoir” which quickly grew to over 200 members in just two days. She created a Google map for participants to pin their locations across the town. The map now has signups from residents on almost every street.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t shocked that it got 100 likes. I’m more shocked that people keep joining. It’s been nonstop,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Kline plans to start a livestream on Facebook on Sunday evening at 7 p.m. and screen-share a YouTube video of the a cappella version of Les Mis’ “Do You Hear The People Sing,” that includes the lyrics. The plan is for residents to sing the song in its entirety in front of their homes.</p>
<p>Ms. Kline wants the group to abide by social distancing guidelines that have been handed down by health officials. She’s asked members keep a safe six feet of distance while singing on the streets and sidewalks. “I just want people to like go outside for 10 minutes and go for it.”</p>
<p>Those minutes may turn into more&nbsp;camaraderie between neighbors in the small borough of Dormont, Ms. Kline hopes. The choir, she said, also will be about getting to know who lives to the left and right of you.</p>
<p>“I am also enjoying watching people post what streets they live on and introducing themselves to their neighbors,” she said. “I think there’s great potential here for building community right now, but also for an opportunity to meet your neighbors after this is all over.”</p>
<p>For Oliver, when his mom told him about the Dormont CoronaChoir he saw it as more than an opportunity for a fun distraction.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see my practice won’t completely go to waste because I’ll be able to sing Les Mis songs [from home.] And it won’t be just me and the people in the choir, it will be everyone. I think that’s pretty cool.”</p>
