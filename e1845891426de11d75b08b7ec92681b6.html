<h1>Paul Zeise: High school sports seem set up to fail</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I’m waiting for this headline to hit some day in the near future:</p>
<p><em>“Varsity high school cancels game for next year because a player might be exposed to coronavirus next week when he goes to the store.”</em></p>
<p>If you think I’m being sarcastic, I’m not. This is how silly this has all become. And it seems very clear that some school board presidents and administrators don’t want sports to happen but also don’t have the courage to be the ones to make the decision.</p>
<p>They understand kids want to play. They understand parents want their kids to play. They understand coaches and many within the communities want kids to play. And they also understand the “science and data” all suggest kids should play.</p>
<p>They understand there would and should be a huge backlash if they outright cancel varsity sports. And they understand that if they cancel varsity sports they could start the process of varsity sports being phased out as the primary place high school-aged athletes go to get their games on.</p>
<p>That’s why the strategy of many is very clear: vote to approve but then put in such insane measures and protocols with respect to COVID-19 that it is impossible to make them work. I’ve already heard stories of schools having administrators observe practices to search for COVID violations.</p>
<p>We’ve read stories of canceled games three weeks away. We’ve read stories of canceled games because the girlfriend of an athlete might have been exposed. We have heard stories of all kinds of lunacy, which suggests that these high school athletes are just being set up to fail.</p>
<p>Yeah, I know about “liability.” That’s the excuse for why these policies must be way over the top. Parents will sign waivers, for one thing, and so would any athlete who wants to play.</p>
<p>Why are we all of the sudden worried about liability for a condition that, for the demographic in question, is less deadly than the flu? So many concerns with high school athletes exist, so why is this any different?</p>
<p>And if we are suddenly worried about liability, then cancel high school football forever because staph infections, concussions, paralysis, brain injuries with long-term effects, and a bunch of other stuff far more dangerous than COVID for 16 year olds happen every year across the country.</p>
<p>On average there are 12 high school or college football players that die annually due to heat and cardiac/head trauma, so the liability stuff doesn’t fly. People can make choices to take risks in their lives and do every single day, and the risk of getting deathly ill from COVID is so small that it doesn’t move the dial.</p>
<p>All I know is I’ve watched AAU basketball all summer and there have been very few problems, and even fewer kids get seriously sick. It can be managed and it can be safe, but canceling games and shutting down for weeks at a time every time someone has — or might have — a positive test is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>I was excited for varsity players to get back on the field, but now I almost feel sorry for them. They almost have no chance to succeed because the protocols and procedures are so strict that they are destined to get shut down.</p>
<p>That’s a shame, too, because it will destroy the varsity sports model even more. Parents of many athletes who are serious about their sports already play on AAU/club//travel teams, and those are all ready to step in and fill the void left if varsity sports gets canceled.</p>
<p>Health and safety of athletes is important. I have a daughter who plays Division I basketball, so I understand there are some concerns. But either it is safe to play or it isn’t, and if it is, then we need to loosen the reins on some of this stuff and let the kids play. &nbsp;These procedures I’m reading and hearing about ensure that almost no seasons will be able to go on without interruption, and many will likely never get started.</p>
<p>I’m willing to listen to arguments that it isn’t safe, but if it isn’t then administrators and school boards should have the courage to cancel it all. The fact that so many would rather pass the buck and set students up for failure is sad. It is not the right way to go about business, and it is not the right way to handle important decisions.</p>
