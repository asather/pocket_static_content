<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Sheraden man will spend 10 to 20 years in prison after pleading guilty Thursday to third-degree murder.</p>
<p>Leonard Hilton, 26, of 1103 Adon St., admitted to shooting Mathew Bryan Zinnermon, 32, of Chesapeake, Va., around 4:10 a.m. on May 25, 2018, in the 2100 block of Park Hill Drive, East Hills.</p>
<p>A witness told police that they had been to several bars that night with Mr. Zinnermon and when they returned to the witness’s residence on Park Hill Drive, a man, identified as Hilton, swung the door open, knocking the witness aside.</p>
<p>The witness told police there were several gunshots and the witness then saw Hilton standing over Mr. Zinnermon with a “smoking gun” and a “crazed look in his eyes.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge David R. Cashman ordered Hilton to serve an additional 10 years of probation.</p>
