<h1>Will Pa. state-owned universities have a regular fall semester despite COVID-19?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just four months ago, the man tasked with leading a turn-around of Pennsylvania's financially ailing state university system stood before a livestream conference in Harrisburg and declared that after a bruising, four-year redesign, "We are ready."</p>
<p>Tuition policy changes, greater accountability and sharing academic programs among campuses were reasons why State System of Higher Education Chancellor Daniel Greenstein argued his system was poised for rebound. It could do it, he said, without shuttering any of the 14 universities, even as critics continued to call for closures given a 20-percent enrollment loss since 2010.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Then last month, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, slamming higher education generally and blowing a $100 million budget hole in a system already asking the state for a special appropriation to fund the redesign this year.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, the system's board of governors <a href="https://www.passhe.edu/inside/BOG/BOG%20Agendas/04-29-2020%20Agenda.pdf" target="_blank">meets via Zoom conference call</a> at noon for what should have been in itself a significant act: For the first time in its nearly four-decade history, the board will set tuition not just for fall but tentatively for the fall after that, to give families more notice.</p>
<p>Only now, the landscape has changed.</p>
<p>Schools nationally and in Pennsylvania suddenly are reeling and facing an uncertain fall. Leaders of this state’s most prominent public institutions — Penn State University and the University of Pittsburgh —&nbsp;already are expressing support for freezing tuition in 2020-21 to spark enrollment, and both announced their leaders would give back part of their salaries amid huge losses facing those institutions.</p>
<p>For many State System students, all that is secondary to this: Will the 14 campuses that enroll 96,000 students open in the fall as usual, and what will instruction look like if social distance rules enacted to slow the virus’s spread are still in place?</p>
<p>Mr. Greenstein was not available to be interviewed Tuesday, spokesman David Pidgeon said.</p>
<p>Mr. Pidgeon on Friday would not discuss whether the State System might freeze its tuition for the upcoming academic year.</p>
<p>Asked about moves by Penn State and Pitt in recent days, Mr. Pidgeon on Monday issued the following statement:&nbsp;“The focus is on continuing long-term cost-saving plans because our mission is to ensure public higher education remains affordable to Pennsylvania students, now and after the pandemic.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 14 system schools include the Western Pennsylvania campuses of California, Clarion, Edinboro, Indiana and Slippery Rock universities.</p>
<p>During Wednesday’s conference call, the State System will consider approving enhanced sick leave payouts intended to encourage union employees across the system to retire, from the Association of Federal, State, County and Municipal Employees to the Service Employees International Union, as well as smaller unions.</p>
<p>The programs follow one earlier this year that prompted at least 200 State System faculty to choose early retirement. Officials with the system have not disclosed the final count of faculty who are leaving, or how much money upfront the incentive will cost the system, and by extension, taxpayers.</p>
<p>The base yearly tuition across the system is $7,716, though a number of campuses have replaced full-time flat tuition rates with per-credit pricing.</p>
<p>Action items like the tuition measure on Wednesday’s full-board agenda usually flow through committees, which meet in public and endorse proposals a day before the entire board votes. However, there was no reference in the board’s agenda to any committee meetings, and it was not clear how the panel.</p>
<p>Mr. Pidgeon could not immediately be reached to explain the deliberative process.</p>
<p>The State System of Higher Education created in 1982 out of 14 state colleges is Pennsylvania’s access university systtem, charging tuition less than half that of Pitt and Penn State. As such, say officials, the system’s health is especially important to educational equity across the Commonwealth.&nbsp;</p>
