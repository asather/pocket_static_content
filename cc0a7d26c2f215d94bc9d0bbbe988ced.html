<h1>Pitt mailbag: What grade should Jeff Capel get for this season?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Trim</strong>: What letter grade do u give Capel on his first 2 yrs? I’m saying B. Gets a C just for getting people to care about Pitt hoops again. Bumped up to B for decent recruiting. Your thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: If the team doesn’t show improvement next year, will criticism of Capel be fair? I think he deserves a pass so far because of how bad of a situation he inherited, but this last month has been troubling. Or am I underestimating how difficult this type of rebuild is?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: We’re in about the same range as far as grading goes. I’d go with a B or a B-minus.</p>
<p>After last season, I would have given him an A-minus or a B-plus. I probably would have been in that same range had you asked me this question as recently as three weeks ago. I think Pitt’s current six-game losing streak is concerning, not because it changes whether Jeff Capel can turn this program into what it could realistically be — a consistent NCAA tournament participant — but because it has completely changed the perception of this season. Before, it was an obvious step in the right direction. While I think it would count for something if this team finished with a winning record, I’m skeptical that will happen at this point. And for that reason, I would say this season is likely to end as a disappointment.</p>
<p>He has done a lot of things right in his tenure. He has gotten people in a pro-centric market to care about Pitt basketball again — and sooner than I expected, as attendance this year is double what it was two years ago. He led the Panthers to a six-win improvement in his first season. He has recruited well, especially given what he inherited. With that said, both of his teams have cratered in the final weeks of the season, which was somewhat understandable last season but is less so this season. Though it’s due in some part to a lack of options, his teams have been one-dimensional offensively. The far more important grades will be coming in the next couple of seasons, but I’d say the B/B-minus range seems fitting right now.</p>
<p>As for criticism, I think it’s warranted. I don’t think any coach, especially given what these guys get paid, is immune from it. Even Mike Krzyzewski, John Calipari and (especially this season) Roy Williams get it. It’s the second consecutive season his team hasn’t improved over the course of the season and has, perhaps, gotten worse. Now, those struggles have to be placed in the context of the situation Pitt is in and has been in the past three or four seasons. Because of that, criticism in the form of thinking he isn’t the right person to rebuild Pitt basketball is, to me, premature and unwarranted.</p>
<p><strong>Jason</strong>: How troubling is it that there has been little to no progression out of Johnson and McGowens and given that, will they be surpassed by incoming freshman next season in terms of a larger timeshare than originally expected?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: It’s troubling. Expectations for both players, particularly Xavier Johnson, were likely too high headed into the season. Each player has gotten better in some areas but worse in others and when the fact they’re a year older is factored in, I think it’s fair to say both have regressed. I will say, though, that I think both players are impacted quite a bit by their circumstances — that is, playing without one (or more) consistently good outside shooters or a good offensive big man.</p>
<p>If they’re going to be surpassed by anyone next season, it will be Ithiel Horton. There’s a possibility Pitt adds a freshman guard like Femi Odukale, but considering he hasn’t even committed yet, that’s a topic for another day.</p>
<p><strong>Collin</strong>: At what point (if at all) do you see McGowens getting benched for Horton next year?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Given Capel’s recent praise of Horton and his skill set, especially his shooting, I would bet the Delaware transfer will be starting and playing significant minutes next season. Between Johnson and Trey McGowens, the former is the better ball-handler and distributor, so I’d be inclined to say that if one of them got benched for Horton, it would be McGowens. But if McGowens is still with the program next season, it’s possible Capel could play all three of them together, along with a big man and either Au’Diese Toney or Justin Champagnie (I’d confidently guess the latter). That seems like an unlikely scenario, though.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Is it true that the ACC doesn’t allow its teams to play in the CBI? That looks like it might be the only chance Pitt has at making the postseason.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’ve heard this get brought up a few times from different people, but the ACC has no mandate about postseason tournaments. Its programs can do whatever they want. An ACC team, however, hasn’t participated in the CBI since Virginia in 2008, the tournament’s inaugural season. Would Pitt want to play in it? It depends some on how its season ends. If it pulls off a win Wednesday at Georgia Tech and a win or two in the ACC tournament, thus finishing with a winning record, it could be a reward of sorts for taking that step. But given how this season has finished, and knowing what we do about Capel and his mindset on such matters, I’d be shocked if the Panthers accepted an invite.</p>
<p><strong>Evan:</strong> Way too Early prediction: who will have the better season next year and by how much: pitt football or basketball?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Football, for sure. There’s always the potential for disappointment, which Pitt fans of course know nothing about, but Pat Narduzzi’s team is coming off an eight-win season, returning basically the entirety of an excellent defense and has a quarterback entering his third full year as a starter. I think the expectation there is to win potentially 10 games. Knowing nothing about how Pitt’s freshmen and newcomers will fare (especially since it will have players on its roster it hasn’t officially added yet), I would say making the NCAA tournament would be a really nice finish for it next season in basketball. Football’s accomplishments would win that contest, though.</p>
<p><strong>None Given:</strong> Do you have any insight as to issues with discontent on the team?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: For all the frustration and disappointment of the past three weeks, I haven’t gotten the impression there’s any kind of discontent on the team with each other, which is where the mind races a lot of times during such losing streaks. The losses have undoubtedly taken their toll, but everything I’ve heard from people is that the players like each other a lot and get along. If there is any dissent, it’s with some players thinking they should be playing more or having a larger role, which you’ll find on any team.</p>
<p><strong>John M</strong>: Is player conditioning a issue with the men’s bb? Seems like last year and this year they seem to be worn down.</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> It’s a fair concern, especially given how the team has fallen apart late for the second-consecutive season, though this year’s plummet happened a few weeks later than last year’s, so that’s progress, albeit in kind of a perverse way. I don’t think it relates to any deeper issues with the Panthers’ staff, as Garry Christopher is well-respected in the sport. There’s a reason he was one of the few holdovers from the Kevin Stallings era.</p>
<p>The larger problem is that they have very little depth and therefore end up relying heavily on three or four players, which, over the course of a season, can really weigh on them. Pitt is only one of three teams with four players averaging at least 29.8 minutes per game this season. The other two? Syracuse (which plays a zone that doesn’t require its players to run around the court in the same way defensively, which changes the calculus on this) and North Carolina, which has had two of those four players miss at least nine games this season with injuries, which, in a very unfortunate way, gave them some rest.</p>
<p><strong>John S</strong>: how long is Capels leash?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: He’s got a recently extended contract through 2027, the support of an athletic director who hired him and gave him said extension (meaning his success or failure is reflective of her), and a fan base that very much still seems to love him. It’s a long one.</p>
<p><strong>Thomas</strong>: Besides Horton, are there any other transfers in the queue? Also, he drove me crazy at times but will Chuwhuka play next season?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: It’s damn near impossible to predict what players will be available via transfer with the season still not over yet. So we’ll give that one some time. And Kene Chukwuka will not be back next season. He took part in the team’s senior night last week.</p>
<p><strong>Aileen:</strong> Have you ever seen a team go such extended periods of time without scoring? This has gone on the entire season - not just 3 or 4 games. Capel must be ready to bang his head against a wall.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I have: last season’s Pitt team. And, before that, the 2017-18 Pitt Panthers (in what might stand as the most infamous example of such a team in program history). And, before that, the 2016-17 Pitt Panthers (which was inexcusable given some of the offensive options that team had).</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Which ACC school is most similar to Pitt?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: From a school and athletic department standpoint, I’ll say Georgia Tech. It’s a research university in a major metropolitan area with a similar undergraduate enrollment, an urban campus and with a domineering, much larger rival within the state (Georgia for Georgia Tech, Penn State for Pitt). I think the Yellow Jackets are the Panthers’ most similar counterpart not only in the ACC, but in all Power Five conferences.</p>
<p>If we’re judging it off fan bases, I’ll go with NC State, which may be clouded by recency bias since I was just there. While Pitt fans are more ...how to put this delicately? ... cosmopolitan than the Wolfpack’s, they seem to have somewhat similar mindsets — general expecting the worst, maybe a bit angry (in part because of the presence in the state of a more decorated, higher-profile rival) and longing for the days when one of their major programs was winning national titles (Pitt with football, NC State with basketball). Also, both their football teams play off campus and have produced a ton of notable NFL players in the past 20 years without enjoying the overwhelming team success that maybe should have come with having them.</p>
