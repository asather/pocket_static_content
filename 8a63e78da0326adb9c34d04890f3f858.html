<h1>11 students, 5 employees test positive as Pitt provides COVID-19 results</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Surveillance testing for COVID-19 at the University of Pittsburgh shows 11 active student cases and five among employees, a positivity rate under 1% that officials Monday called encouraging.</p>
<p>However, with the fall semester entering its second week, those administrators also warned that rates can change quickly if individuals do not adhere to social distancing, wear masks and avoid large gatherings on and near the Oakland campus with 29,000 students.</p>
<p>Dean of Students Kenyon Bonner, who last week said such gatherings were putting the semester at risk, said four additional fraternities and sororities face interim sanctions for violations, bringing the total to nine. During a mid-afternoon briefing held via Zoom call Monday, he did not name the four.</p>

<p>However, Pitt later identified them in a statement as&nbsp;Pi Kappa Phi, Sigma Sigma Sigma, Delta Delta Delta and Delta Chi. Last Wednesday, Pitt said these fraternities were placed on interim suspension following violations of health, Greek Life or other rules: Alpha Tau Omega, Chi Omega, Kappa Delta, Pi Kappa Alpha and Sigma Phi Epsilon.</p>
<p>In addition, a number of individual students now face sanctions, though Mr. Bonner did not specify how many.</p>
<p>“More than a handful,” is all he would say.</p>
<p>“The students involved have been placed on interim Persona Non Grata and modified interim housing suspensions ... and all above mentioned fraternity and sorority chapters have been placed on interim suspension of registration,” Pitt’s statement read.&nbsp;“This means that the individual students are restricted from campus and all university facilities, and that those chapters must cease all organizational operations ... until the student conduct process is complete.”</p>
<p>The statement added,&nbsp;“Our policies and expectations have been made very clear to our students. Your actions have consequences.”</p>
<p>Pitt students began classes remotely Aug. 17, and last week, the school decided to push back the start of in-person instruction until Sept. 14. Students already have moved into dorms, off-campus apartments and hotel rooms purchased to lower dorm density, and will continue arriving in stages through Friday, Mr.&nbsp;Bonner said.</p>
<p>He said that many Pitt students have followed expectations. The school learned of potential transgressions through the community, but not Pitt’s police force.</p>
<p>“Most of our information is coming from other students, or members of the community or staff who work in our residence halls,” Mr. Bonner said.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, spikes in cases on college campuses, many tied to parties, have caused rising concern at those schools and the communities in which they reside. The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill abruptly moved to remote instruction last week, sending many students home. Penn State President Eric Barron has warned the same could happen there.</p>
<p>At Pitt, the individuals who tested positive are in isolation, <a href="https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/healthy-community/campus-cases" target="_blank">according to a COVID-19 Dashboard</a>&nbsp;posted to the school’s website. Since Aug. 1, a total of 14 students and eight employees have tested positive.</p>
<p>Since Aug 12, 1,225 students have been tested, with a positivity rate of 0.16%, officials said. There were two positive results Monday and four on Sunday with a five-day moving average of 1.6.</p>
<p>About 280 students have been tested at Pitt’s four branch campuses since Aug. 12. The lone positive result was reported at Johnstown, officials said.</p>
<p>Pitt is doing randomized testing, both in Oakland and its four branch campuses, of varied subgroups living on and off-campus. It is testing students who come from Allegheny County, elsewhere in the state, across the U.S. and overseas. With numbers so low, there is not a discernible pattern of where the infections are most prevalent, said Dr. John Williams, director of Pitt’s COVID-19 Medical Response Office and chief of the medical school’s Division of Infectious Diseases.</p>
<p>“So far, the news is really encouraging and it supports that our students are doing what we ask them,” Dr. Williams said.</p>
<p>He said an individual’s geography is less important than how they behave. Students have been asked to self-quarantine for seven days before and after coming to campus.</p>
