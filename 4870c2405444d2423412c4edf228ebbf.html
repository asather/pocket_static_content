<h1>Atlantic 10 cancels conference tournament</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK — The Atlantic 10 tournament has been canceled due to fears of spreading COVID-19, otherwise known as the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The decision comes amid many other conferences, including the ACC, Big Ten, Big 12, SEC and Pac-12, also canceled their tournaments. It also comes a day after the NBA opted to suspend its season.</p>
<p>The cancellation also came as Thursday’s slate of games were about to begin at the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, N.Y., as VCU and Massachusetts were on the court warming up before being pulled off the court.</p>
<p>“The A-10 has made a decision to discontinue play as a result of the COVID-19 virus,” A10 commissioner Bernadette V. McGlade said in a press release.&nbsp;“Given the rapid spread of the virus, this decision was supported by the Athletic Directors and Presidents’ Council. These are uncertain times for sure, and we feel tremendous empathy for the student-athletes who will not have the opportunity to finish competing. However, the welfare of the student-athletes and the public is of utmost importance.”</p>
<p>Duquesne was scheduled to play Fordham on Thursday night, needing to win the entire tournament to earn a bid to the NCAA tournament. But now, that possibility seems to be gone, or at the very least, delayed.</p>
<p>“We got back from our walkthrough [on Thursday] and heard we weren’t going to play, but we thought we weren’t going to play,” Dukes coach Keith Dambrot told the&nbsp;Post-Gazette<em>.</em>&nbsp;“My thing is, I’m listening to ESPN last night ... and they’re talking about,&nbsp;‘Well, how can we protect the professional athletes and we’re not going to protect the college athletes that don’t make any money. To me, that made total sense to me.</p>
<p>“We’re going to put these kids in harm’s way? We can’t do that, when we’re closing campuses and protecting every other student in our campus. We can’t put our players in the line of fire.&nbsp;... I think there’s some disappointment in it, because we felt like we had a pretty good chance.”</p>
<p>Originally, the conference announced Wednesday that it would be continuing the tournament, but that it would be played without fans in attendance. Now, it seems, as things have progressed regarding COVID-19, the A-10 has deemed it necessary to cancel the event entirely.</p>
<p>“We’re kind of going into the den of it,” Dambrot told reporters on Tuesday, referencing the conference’s decision to play without fans. “All I do is get ready. I’m more susceptible than they are. I’m a 61-year-old old man with a high stress level. You can’t poo-poo it, though. It’s obviously serious stuff, but I try not to think about things that don’t happen until they happen. It cheats the experience.</p>
<p>“Would I like it? No. But if it’s in the best interest of everybody involved, we have to do what we have to do for health concerns.”</p>
<p>Dambrot expressed his belief that it will be hard to hold any postseason basketball, considering the conditions.</p>
<p>For the Dukes’ sake, that at least lightens the blow a bit. Their season, it seems, may be over, but so are the seasons of many other teams around the country, if not all of them.</p>
<p>“I don’t think there’s going to be any more games in college basketball this year, if I had to bet my house on it,” Dambrot said.</p>
<p>The other aspect for Duquesne, which could be considered fortunate in this circumstance, is that almost its entire roster has eligibility remaining. The Dukes had only one senior in 2019-20: fifth-year senior center Baylee Steele.</p>
<p>Steele expressed last week that his only goal when he transferred to Duquesne before the season was to make the NCAA tournament. Unfortunately, now, he likely won’t get the chance.</p>
<p>“I think they’re very, very disappointed for Baylee and him not having the opportunity to play his last game even,” Dambrot said.</p>
<p>Dambrot went on to say that much of his concern in the present is with the player’s schoolwork the rest of the year, as it’s unclear whether it would be in their best interests to go home or stay at school.</p>
<p>As for immediate plans, the Dukes will try to get a flight out of New York City on Thursday night. Until then, they will kill time in their hotel, as their season has suddenly been brought to a halt.</p>
