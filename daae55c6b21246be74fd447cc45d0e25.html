<h1>Wolf orders restaurants, bars to end dine-in service in Allegheny, 4 other counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf on Sunday <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/newsroom/wolf-administration-orders-restaurants-and-bars-to-close-dine-in-service-in-mitigation-counties-to-stop-spread-of-covid-19/" target="_blank">ordered all restaurants and bars in Allegheny and four other counties&nbsp;to close their dine-in facilities for 14 days</a> amid efforts to help stop the COVID-19 coronavirus’ spread.</p>
<p>The Wolf administration said in a news release that the governor was using his authority under the state’s COVID-19 <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/20200306-COVID19-Digital-Proclamation.pdf" target="_blank">disaster declaration order</a>.</p>
<p>Businesses in&nbsp;Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties “that offer carry-out, delivery, and drive-through food and beverage service may continue to do so,” according to the release, “but eating and drinking inside restaurants and bars is temporarily prohibited.”</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf said he understood “this is&nbsp;disruptive to businesses as well as patrons,” but&nbsp;ordering the restaurants and bars to close was in the best interest of the counties’ residents.</p>
<p>Businesses that do not adhere to this order could face enforcement actions, the Wolf administration said.</p>
<p>The governor's order came shortly after Allegheny County officials called on all nonessential businesses in the county to close voluntarily.</p>
<p>“Social distancing is essential as more Pennsylvanians are testing positive for COVID-19,” said Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania’s secretary of health. “By taking these steps now, we can protect public health and slow the spread of this virus.”</p>

<p><em><strong>Correction</strong>: This story’s original headline and lead mischaracterized the Wolf administration’s directive. The Pennsylvania governor ordered all restaurants and bars in Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery&nbsp;counties to end dine-in facilities, not close entirely.</em></p>
