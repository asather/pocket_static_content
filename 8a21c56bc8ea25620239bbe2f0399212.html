<h1>Kass withdraws emergency petition for injunction; lawsuit seeking damages to continue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Allegheny County woman running a controversial campaign for a Democratic state House seat in June’s primary Friday dropped her emergency request for a preliminary injunction to get her name on mailers sent to voters in the district.</p>
<p>During a five-minute telephone conference, Ryan Mergl, the lawyer for Heather Kass, notified an Allegheny County judge that the request was being dropped. A lawsuit by his client against the Allegheny County Democratic Committee and the Pennsylvania Democratic Party will continue, he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass Tuesday&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/20/Kass-lawsuit-against-allegheny-county-pennsylvania-Democrats-campaign/stories/202005200092?cid=search" target="_blank">sued the two political entities</a>. She claims that despite the fact that she followed the party’s rules, paid a $2,500 fee and won an overwhelming endorsement by the county committee, state party leaders refused to support her and ordered that her name be removed from a list of endorsed candidates mailed to voters. She claims that the party also blocked her access to a voter database called VoteBuilder.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass, of Carrick, came under scrutiny in the winter when a review of her social media history showed she had supported President Donald Trump; expressed disdain for the Affordable Care Act and criticized opioid addicts.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass apologized for those posts and said at the time that she’s “grown and learned since then.”</p>
<p>In addition to the three-count suit, which alleges breach of contract and seeks a jury trial along with damages, Ms. Kass asked for an injunction directing the committee and party to “immediately place&nbsp;Heather Kass on the mailings sent to the voters of the Pennsylvania’s 36th State House District;&nbsp;immediately send the mailings to the voters of the Pennsylvania’s 36th State House District; and&nbsp;grant Heather Kass access to VoteBuilder for Pennsylvania’s 36th State House District.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mergl, however, told Common Pleas Senior Judge Joseph M. James:&nbsp;“It’s my understanding&nbsp;that my client, at the accommodation of the county party, was included in a mailing that went out to the pertinent district. The state was not on board with that, but the county sent it out, so right now there’s no emergency. That is moot.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kass is also dropping her request for access to VoteBuilder, Mr. Mergl said.</p>
<p>Clifford Levine, a lawyer for the state party, said that he and Mr. Mergl had discussed the complaint. Asked by Judge James whether he was objecting to the emergency petition being withdrawn, Mr. Levine said,&nbsp;“Not at all.”</p>
<p>He said that he anticipates seeking the removal of the state party as a defendant in the case.</p>
<p>“The gist of the complaint really deals with the endorsement by the county,” Mr. Levine said. “At some point, we would be seeking to get out of the lawsuit itself.”</p>
<p>Ms. Kass is running for the 36th Legislative District seat left empty with the retirement of longtime state Rep. Harry Readshaw. The district spans from Carrick and Mount Washington within Pittsburgh’s city limits to Baldwin Borough and Brentwood. Ms. Kass is running against progressive activist Jess Benham, Ed Moeller and Mark Johnson in seeking the Democratic nomination.</p>
<p>Allegheny County committee members in the 36th District endorsed Ms. Kass in a 49-to-19 vote over Benham, prompting an outpouring of disbelief from others on the committee and top county Democrats, including Mayor Bill Peduto, Allegheny-Fayette Central Labor Council President Darrin Kelly and state Sens. Wayne Fontana and Lindsey Williams.</p>
<p>At the time, Committee Chairwoman Eileen Kelly insisted that she was&nbsp;bound to accept the endorsement of her committee.</p>
