<h1>Lawyer takes the case of Shylock for new look at 'Merchant of Venice'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s “The Merchant of Venice” as you’ve never seen it before, and not just because it’s a Zoom presentation.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Theater’s PlayTIme will present a new adaptation of Shakespeare’s play that challenges the idea of who is the wounded party in a dispute when one side is automatically dehumanized by society.</p>
<p>The adaptation by W. Thomas McGough, Jr., chief legal counsel for UPMC, looks anew at the Bard’s tale of anti-Semitism and justice in 1594 Venice.</p>
<p>The play is presented over two days, Thursday and Friday at 7 p.m., at <a href="https://ppt.org/ppt_home/pages/19870-playtime" target="_blank">ppt.org/playtime</a>, followed by a conversation with dramaturg Caley Chase (Huntington Theater), Post-Gazette theatre critic Sharon Eberson and Public Theater artistic director Marya Sea Kaminski.</p>
<p>“Shylock first engaged me to represent him in 2016,” Mr. McGough says of his first interaction with the play as a participant in a gala four years ago.</p>
<p>Shylock, the Jewish merchant of the play’s title, is the lender who demands “a pound of flesh,” but has the tables turned on him in the most humiliating of ways.</p>
<p>His defense, in the Bard’s words, speaks to the prejudice that ruled the day: “Hath not a Jew hands, organs, dimensions, senses, affections, passions; fed with the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject to the same diseases, healed by the same means, warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer as a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed? If you tickle us, do we not laugh?”</p>
<p>According to a press release, Mr. McGough “followed a trail of textual evidence and a novel and fascinating narrative began to emerge. The result ... allows Shylock to preserve a shred of dignity.”</p>
<p>Maury Ginsberg, star of “Indecent” at the Public in 2019, plays Shylock. “This adaptation highlights Shylock's connection to family —&nbsp;his deceased wife and his daughter. They are the motor behind who and what he is.”</p>
<p>The cast also includes Karen Baum (Portia), Patrick Cannon (Bassanio), Tony Bingham (Antonio), Alan Stanford (The Duke/Narrator), Emily Fury Daly (Jessica), Quinn Patrick Shannon (Gratiano), Olivia Vadnais (Nerissa), Ryan Patrick Kearney (Lorenzo) and, in multiple roles, Malic Maat, Michael Trimm and Marc Moritz.</p>
