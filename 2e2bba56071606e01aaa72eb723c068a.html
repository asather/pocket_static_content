<h1>Record stores will reopen Friday, but flip quickly</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With Allegheny County moving into the yellow phase, record-store browsing will return on Friday, but shoppers will have to flip a little more quickly.</p>
<p>The massive Jerry’s Records in Squirrel Hill, which has been closed since mid-March, announced Wednesday night that it will open on Friday with a limit of 10 customers at a time. Masks and social distancing will be required and they ask that you limit your shopping to 30 minutes. The owners suggest that weekdays will be better for those who want to avoid lines and maybe buy a little more time.</p>
<p>The Attic in Millvale is also opening Friday and is urging customers to make an appointment for a half-hour shopping slot, beginning at 10 a.m. Shoppers with an appointment will get priority, but others are welcome to visit the store and hope for an opening.</p>
<p>The Government Center on the North Side, which was been doing curbside pickup, will begin allowing four people in the store, including employees. It will also be allowing shoppers to make appointment.</p>
<p>The Exchange stores, Get Hip Records (North Side), Eide’s Entertainment (Downtown), Vinyl Remains (Mt. Lebanon) and other stores have yet to post their plans.</p>
<p>The DJ Connection, which opened in Bridgeville in January, will close indefinitely.</p>
<p>Says owner T.J. Harris, “The couple months of not being open and all of my DJ gigs being canceled up until July at this point was too much of a financial burden for us.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>This year’s Record Store Day, originally scheduled for mid-April, was moved to June 20.</p>
