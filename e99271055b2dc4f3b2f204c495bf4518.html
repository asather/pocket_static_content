<h1>Ben Roethlisberger eases into action; Steelers stifle Saquon Barkley</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — The Steelers do not put Ben Roethlisberger on a pitch count during a game, but they control the number of throws he makes during the week in practice.</p>
<p>That’s why he did not practice or was limited twice last week in preparation for Monday night’s game against the New York Giants. The other reason, of course, was because the Steelers had two extra days of full practice to get ready for the opener.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the Steelers were intent on easing Roethlisberger into the game against the Giants — his first since Week 2 last season when he left the game against the Seattle Seahawks in the second quarter with a season-ending elbow injury.</p>
<p>But after a tentative start Monday, he started to open up on his second possession, attempting seven passes and completing four for 47 yards. The longest was a 28-yarder down the right sideline to rookie Chase Claypool.</p>
<p>He finished the first half by completing 8 of his final 12 passes for 98 yards and two touchdowns, looking like vintage Roethlisberger by taking them 78 yards in 85 seconds for a go-ahead touchdown.</p>
<p>Roethlisberger told team officials before the game his arm felt great — same as it has for the duration of training camp when Roethlisberger reported no issues at all with his elbow.</p>
<p>They just want to be sure he doesn’t overuse his throwing arm early in the season when he doesn’t have to.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Shutting down Saquon</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers held the Giants to minus-3 yards on 12 carries in the first half and 2018 NFL rookie of the year Saquon Barkley to minus-7 yards on his first 10 carries.</p>
<p>The only time Barkley hurt the Steelers defense was when he caught a screen pass and ran for a 38-yard gain in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Barkley rushed for more than 1,000 yards in each of his first two NFL seasons, but the Steelers were intent on limiting his effectiveness in the running game. The Steelers put an emphasis on their run defense after the Bills, Jets and Ravens gashed them in the final three games last season, all losses.</p>
<p>Barkley finished Monday’s game with just 6 yards on 15 carries.</p>
<p><strong>Linemen injured</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers sustained a couple significant injuries to their offensive line in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Already playing without Pro Bowl G David DeCastro, the Steelers lost Stefen Wisniewski, DeCastro’s replacement, with a torn pectoral muscle — a potentially serious injury.</p>
<p>Also, right tackle Zach Banner, making his first NFL start at right tackle, injured his knee on Ben Roethlisberger’s final touchdown and did not return.</p>
<p><strong>Snell time</strong></p>
<p>The Steelers started the second half with Benny Snell, not James Conner, and Snell responded five 43 yards on his first five carries. Conner, who injured his ankle, had just 9 yards rushing on six carries in the first half.</p>
