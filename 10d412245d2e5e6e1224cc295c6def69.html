<h1>A Pirate, a Penguin and a Fortnite-fueled pursuit of $1 million</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates pitcher Jameson Taillon won’t pitch in 2020 after a second Tommy John surgery. Penguins forward Zach Aston-Reese had missed about a month when the NHL shut down amid the coronavirus pandemic, the result of a lower-body injury.</p>
<p>While Taillon and Aston-Reese have had some difficulty contributing to their actual teams, they’ve formed an interesting and successful virtual one during the COVID-19 crisis, joining forces to pursue a $1 million donation to charity.</p>
<p>The two are competing together in TwitchRivals SuperGames featuring Fortnite, where they started as one of 110 athlete duos and have advanced to Wednesday night’s championship round featuring a total of 20 teams — 12 that navigated the qualifying round and semifinals, plus eight late, high-profile adds.</p>
<p>One of those receiving a free pass to the finals is Steelers wideout JuJu Smith-Schuster, while Cy Young Award winner Blake Snell and Bryce Harper were also exempt from competing in the earlier rounds.</p>
<p>“I already enjoy playing video games,” Aston-Reese said by phone on Tuesday afternoon. “So to do this and be able to give back a little bit, it’s a bonus.”</p>
<p>After some practice rounds on Tuesday, Wednesday's championship round will consist of five games, Taillon said, which will be streamed via Twitch and start at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>The two have preselected the charities to where their money will go. Taillon is splitting his between the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank and Lending Hearts, which helps pediatric cancer patients.</p>
<p>Aston-Reese is playing for the Colby Cave Memorial Fund, started for the Edmonton Oilers forward who passed away suddenly on April 11 due to complications from a brain cyst.</p>
<p>As for how Taillon and Aston-Reese got together, it's a little complicated.</p>
<p>Taillon said he mentioned to his agent wanting to do some sort of video game tournament while rehabbing his elbow. The Fortnite competition was a no-brainer, as Taillon has been obsessed with the shooter-survival game since it debuted in July 2017.</p>
<p>Aston-Reese’s involvement was a little more accidental. He’s been living with fellow Penguins winger Bryan Rust and his wife, Kelsey, during this quarantine period. One night at dinner, Rust’s phone rang with an offer from someone in the NHLPA. They wanted Rust to play, but Rust thought he would get clobbered. Aston-Reese told his housemate/landlord to give them his number, and he threw his hat in the ring.</p>
<p>When Taillon was trying to find a partner, he figured it was an easy and smart move to pick someone else from Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We ran a couple games together, and he’s incredibly good at Fortnite,” Taillon said. “We had some good chemistry, advanced a couple times, and here we are.”</p>
<p>They might become closer friends, too, once their respective seasons resume.</p>
<p>"He seems really nice," Taillon said. "We’ll have link up when I’m in Pittsburgh. Some of my friends that I’ve met over the years in Pittsburgh who aren’t sports-related reached out to me. Everybody said he’s a great dude."</p>
<p>Aston-Reese is definitely better at Fortnite, both admitted, although Taillon did recover from a rough qualifying round and bounced back in the semifinals.</p>
<p>As part of the championship round, the two were actually drafted by professional gamers — same for all 20 athlete-athlete entrants — and Taillon said that enabled him to breathe a little easier.</p>
<p>“Going into [Wednesday], I’m a little less nervous, I think, just because [the pros] can kind of carry the load,” Taillon said. “I think it will be a fun experience for everybody. But the qualifiers against other athletes? Yeah, I felt some pressure.”</p>
<p>Which doesn’t happen when pitching, Taillon said. He drew the analogy of pitching at Busch Stadium for a sold-out Cardinals game, with red everywhere. Taillon isn’t nervous there because “I know I’m good. That’s where I belong.”</p>
<p>It’s different with Fortnite, Taillon said. He’s still trying to figure out where he fits on the pecking order of professional athletes.</p>
<p>“There are a ton of good players,” Taillon said. “My heart was just pounding.”</p>
<p>Literally, too. Taillon said he wore a recovery band while playing, the kind that reads your heart rate, and it was 20 beats per minute higher than normal.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Aston-Reese wasn’t as freaked out. To him, video games have long been part of life — occasionally too much if you’re talking about his college days at Northeastern.</p>
<p>As a kid, Aston-Reese was big on Nintendo 64. He and his brother, William Jr., would play Zelda for hours. Everybody would sit around and watch. Zach and his mom, Carolyn Buckheit, would square off in Tetris. Mario parties were definitely a thing.</p>
<p>For Aston-Reese, video games have become an essential part of socialization — especially now. He befriended Tyler Bertuzzi of the Detroit Red Wings through video games and felt like he knew Taillon some because they ran in some of the same Fortnite circles.</p>
<p>"I know it’s a little crazy meeting people in a virtual world, but it builds a pretty good bond before you get to meet someone," Aston-Reese said. "You can tell 'Jamo' is a really good teammate. You can tell he wants to win."</p>
<p>Another part where the athlete comes out.</p>
<p>The other day, Bryan and Kelsey Rust were FaceTiming with friends when they introduced Aston-Reese, who proceeded to give everyone a detailed description of the tournament.</p>
<p>Taillon knows the professional games who drafted teams and worried that JuJu and Co. "might be the team to beat."</p>
<p>Already Taillon and Aston-Reese have secured between $5,000-$8,000 for charity, but they’re eager to raise a lot more come Wednesday night.</p>
<p>"I can't wait," Taillon said. "We'll be ready to go."</p>
