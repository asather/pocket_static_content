<h1>Upper St. Clair spoils Fox Chapel's perfect season with statement road win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Upper St. Clair and Fox Chapel met last season, the game was played at Duquesne University after a pipe burst at Upper St. Clair High school, ruining the gym floor.</p>
<p>The teams squared off again Friday and something got ruined again.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel’s perfect season.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair, the No. 4-ranked team in WPIAL Class 6A, went into Fox Chapel and defeated the top-ranked Foxes, 61-46, in a big non-section game.</p>
<p>On a night when many games around Western Pennsylvania were postponed due to snowy weather, Upper St. Clair and Fox Chapel played in front of a large crowd in what was a playoff-like atmosphere. Head coaches from other top teams were in the crowd, as was Steelers linebacker Ryan Shazier.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel, which entered the game 20-0, looked like it would remain the WPIAL’s only undefeated team after going on a 9-0 run to take a 33-26 lead on Sam Brown’s layup with 2:55 left in the third quarter. At the time, Upper St. Clair (19-3), typically an excellent 3-point shooting team, was 0 for 12 from behind the arc.</p>
<p>“We got off to such a slow start, but our defense kept us in the game,” Upper St. Clair coach Danny Holzer said. “We really felt like eventually we would make shots. We average 74 points a game. We just said, ‘Stay the course, and whatever you do, don’t stop shooting.’”</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair didn’t stop shooting, and the shots began to fall. Andrew Casey connected on two 3-pointers and Landon Rauch knocked down one to help the Panthers go on a 11-4 run to close the third quarter and tie the score at 37-37.</p>
<p>That began what became a giant snowball, as Upper St. Clair went on an 18-2 run — Ethan Dahlem and Casey hit 3s — to start the fourth quarter. What turned out to be a 29-6 run overall propelled the Panthers to a 55-39 lead with 2:14 left.</p>
<p>“We know they’re capable of shooting 3s,” Fox Chapel coach Zach Skrinjar said. “They got some extra possessions. We kind of chased a little more than we should, going for steals. It got a few of their guys open, and they started feeling good about it, and that was a big run for them.”</p>
<p>David Pantelis, playing his third game after missing three weeks with an ankle injury, led Upper St. Clair with 16 points and also played terrific defense. Pantelis scored 16 of Upper St. Clair’s first 26 points. Casey scored 13 of his 15 points after that.</p>
<p>No team in the WPIAL has a stingier defense than Fox Chapel, which entered the game giving up just 42 points a game. The 61 points scored by Upper St. Clair was the most given up by the Foxes this season. Only twice had the Foxes even given up 50 or more. And to think, Upper St. Clair began the game 3 of 20 from the field.</p>
<p>Fox Chapel’s leading scorer, Eli Yofan, was limited to six points. Will Livingston led the Foxes with 17 points. Sam Brown (nine) was the only other Foxes player with more than six.</p>
<p>No section titles were on the line, but playoff seeding likely was. Fox Chapel was a shoe-in for the No. 1 seed had it won, but that now is cloudy. Butler now could leapfrog the Foxes. And there’s a chance Mt. Lebanon and Upper St. Clair could do the same.</p>
<p>“I could be wrong, but I don’t know how we can’t be the 3 [seed],” Holzer said. “We beat the No. 1 undefeated team on their court convincingly. And they’re really good.”</p>
<p>Added Skrinjar: “They’re going to make a decision based on however they weigh it. Wherever we’re seeded, we’ll be. We have to come with a better effort than we did today.”</p>
