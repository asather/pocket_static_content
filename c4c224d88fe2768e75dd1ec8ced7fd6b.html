<h1>Current, former Pittsburgh athletes give dads unforgettable Father's Day gifts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Break out the tissue boxes, because Father’s Day weekend brought about a new batch of current and former Pittsburgh athletes doing extremely heartwarming things for their dads.</p>
<p>First up, we have Steelers rookie Chase Claypool, who surprised his dad with a new truck for Father’s Day. The video is a bit NSFW, but it’s <a href="https://twitter.com/ChaseClaypool/status/1274850506452553728" target="_blank">highly worth checking out</a> for the reaction of the Steelers receiver’s father as the giant truck with the bright-red bow pulls up behind him.</p>
<p>Claypool is at least the fifth professional athlete with Pittsburgh ties to gift a parent with a new car since August 2019, when former Pitt receiver and current Bengal Tyler Boyd bought his mother a 2019 Range Rover. Less than a week later, Steelers receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/09/03/JuJu-Smith-Schuster-bought-stepfather-new-car-Cam-Heyward-Diontae-Johnson-Tyler-Boyd/stories/201909030124" target="_blank">got his stepfather</a> a new car.</p>
<p>The unofficial tradition continued with Pirates pitcher Chris Archer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/12/26/pirates-chris-archer-christmas-surprise-parents/stories/201912260096" target="_blank">getting his parents two cars</a> for Christmas and, most recently, Steelers running back James Conner <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/06/07/Steelers-James-Conner-surprise-father-new-truck-video/stories/202006070118" target="_blank">giving his dad</a> a new truck as well.</p>
<p>But wait, there’s more! Qadree Ollison, a former Pitt running back who now plays for the Falcons, went one step further than Claypool by purchasing a house for his dad as a Father’s Day present.</p>
<p>While you have that tissue box handy, check out the messages Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger and linebacker T.J. Watt put out for their fathers yesterday.</p>
<p>Dino Tomlin — Mike Tomlin’s son and a rising sophomore receiver at the University of Maryland — provided a little Father’s Day levity by pushing back at his dad’s assertion in an NFL video that the key to being a great father was “supporting your kids unconditionally.”</p>
<p>At this point, we might as well start taking bets on which Pittsburgh athlete goes viral making a video of themselves doing something adorable for their parents. Pro tip: The smart money is on the Pirates’ <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/10/Pirates-MLB-Draft-Ben-Cherington-Joe-Dellicarri/stories/202006100140" target="_blank">most recent first-round draft picks</a>, Nick Gonzales and Carmen Mlodzinski.</p>
