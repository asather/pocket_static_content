<h1>Because of COVID-19 concerns, AHN limits hospital visitors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Allegheny Health Network said Wednesday that it is temporarily imposing a one-visitor-at-a-time rule for patients in its eight hospitals.</p>
<p>“At a time of heightened public health concerns related to both COVID-19 and a particularly severe influenza season, it is critical that we take every step possible to protect our patients and caregivers from the risk of exposure to infectious disease,” Dr. Brian Parker, AHN’s chief quality officer, said in a press release.</p>
<p>In addition, like many hospitals in the region, AHN is asking people who are sick to not visit the hospital unless they are seeking care, and if they are seeking care for flu-like symptoms - which are similar to COVID-19 - to call ahead, first, so they can be evaluated over the phone.</p>
<p>AHN’s move comes a day after the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System said that by the end of the week it would begin screening for COVID-19 symptoms or contact everyone who tries to enter its buildings on the VA’s two local campuses in Oakland and Aspinwall.</p>
<p>Like the Pittsburgh VA, AHN is also encouraging people who want to connect with patients to consider using digital connections instead, including FaceTime or Snapchat on their phones.</p>
<p>And to further cut down on patient visits, AHN is encouraging more people to consider using its telehealth services, which AHN calls MyChart, so that people can still see and speak to a provider online without having to visit a hospital.</p>
