<p>MANCHESTER, N.H. — For the second consecutive time in a Democratic presidential primary election, voters in New Hampshire opted for political “revolution” and chose the firebrand 78-year-old U.S. senator from across state lines in Vermont to carry the party’s torch this year.</p>
<p>Bernie Sanders, who has led the field in 30 straight major polls here since early January, won the Democratic primary on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press. The outlet called the senator’s victory at 11:44 p.m. with about 93% of precincts reporting.</p>

<p>As of the AP’s call, Mr. Sanders was in first place with 26% and about 70,000 votes statewide —&nbsp;1.6% more than Pete Buttigieg, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor who finished neck-and-neck with him in last week’s Iowa caucuses.</p>
<p>Holding onto third place at 19.8% was Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, whose candidacy was propelled this past weekend thanks to what new supporters deemed a persuasive debate performance here Friday night. Since then, her campaign rose in tracking polls, pulled in a few million dollars in donations and put her in front of bigger crowds.</p>
<p>All three of the top candidates hit the 15% threshold necessary to qualify for delegates, and will split the state’s 24 pledged delegates proportionally.</p>
<p>Though it hands out a minuscule percentage of the 1,990 delegates needed to win the Democratic nomination, the New Hampshire primary has traditionally given a significant bump to its top finishers and worked to wean out the rest of the field. As the polls closed Tuesday and results started to come in, entrepreneur Andrew Yang, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet dropped out of the race.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders, in his winning campaign here, relied on the same argument he’s made in campaign stops across the country —&nbsp;and one very similar to what he preached in 2016 when he beat Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire: that the political system is “corrupt,” favors the ultra-wealthy and requires swift, immediate change from the top down.</p>
<p>Mr. Sanders took the stage to thunderous applause from his supporters shortly after 11 p.m. in the gymnasium of the Stan Spirou Field House on the campus of Southern New Hampshire University in Manchester.</p>
<p>There, he thanked voters for a “grand victory” and said it’s the “beginning of the end for Donald Trump.”</p>
<p>“The reason that we are going to win is that we are putting together an unprecedented multi-generational, multi-racial political movement,” Mr. Sanders said, “and this is a movement from coast to coast, which is demanding that we finally have an economy and a government that works for all of us, not wealthy campaign contributors.”</p>
<p>Thanking his supporters on Twitter and at a rally in Nashua, Mr. Buttigieg said New Hampshire lived by its motto, “Live free or die,” during the election.</p>

<p>“You asserted that famous independent streak and thanks to you a campaign that some said shouldn’t be here at all has shown that we are here to stay”,” Mr. Buttigieg tweeted.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg spent most of his time in New Hampshire contrasting his candidacy to Mr. Sanders’, arguing that a Sanders nomination would risk alienating a “powerful American majority” that is ready and willing to unite over a progressive platform —&nbsp;just not one that calls for a “revolution.”</p>
<p>Ms. Klobuchar took the same approach toward Mr. Sanders, and even raised her hand on the debate stage on this campus when moderators asked which candidates feared a self-proclaimed Democratic socialist leading the ticket.</p>
<p>But beyond positioning herself as a pragmatic alternative, Ms. Klobuchar pointed to her record of winning in red districts in Minnesota —&nbsp;“receipts,” she said, that should show voters that she can assemble the broadest coalition of Democrats, moderate Republicans and independents.</p>
<p>“I came back and we delivered” Ms. Klobuchar said Tuesday, according to the Associated Press. “America deserves a president who is as resilient as her people.”</p>
<p>Rounding out the top five in the primary as of the AP’s call were Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren in fourth with 9.3% then former Vice President Joe Biden in fifth with 8.4%. In the final days before the primary, Mr. Biden indicated he didn’t believe he’d do well in New Hampshire. He left New Hampshire early Tuesday to spend the evening in South Carolina instead of attending a party here.</p>

<p>Ms. Warren, in a speech to supporters across town near the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport, said she still considers herself the best candidate to unite Democrats and insisted her campaign is “built for the long haul and we’re just getting started,” according to The Associated Press.</p>

<p>In the week leading up to the first-in-the-nation primary, the candidates universally criticized Mr. Trump for his policies and his personality, labeling him a bully, a bigot and a liar whose administration has stood up for corporations and wealthy people instead of the middle class.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump got his chance to fight back at a campaign rally of his own in Manchester on election’s eve, musing aloud about the “weak” slate of candidates in a Democratic Party he said “wants to run your health care” but can’t run a caucus in Iowa. He won the New Hampshire Republican primary on Tuesday, securing more than 85% of the vote. Former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld recorded about 9%.</p>
<p>Beyond the issue of electability, Democrats also sparred with each other on campaign finance, with Mr. Sanders publicly denouncing Mr. Buttigieg and former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg —&nbsp;who’s pouring hundreds of millions of his own dollars into the later primary states —&nbsp;for being part of the “corrupt political system” he rails against.</p>
<p>On the debate stage, Mr. Sanders called out Mr. Buttigieg for welcoming money into his campaign from billionaires, saying if voters want to change America, “you’re not going to do it by electing candidates who are going out to rich people’s homes begging for money.”</p>
<p>“We’re taking on billionaires and we’re taking on candidates funded by billionaires,” he said in his victory speech on Tuesday, just minutes after his supporters chanted “Wall Street Pete” when the former mayor’s speech was shown on a screen near the stage.</p>
<p>Mr. Buttigieg has responded that to beat Mr. Trump, who is raising millions every day, it’ll take “everything that we’ve got” financially.</p>
<p>Everything that Mr. Sanders had in New Hampshire was on display Monday night in Durham, when he drew the biggest crowd of the state’s primary season for a rally that featured U.S. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez —&nbsp;who told the audience that it isn’t enough to beat Mr. Trump in November, but to have a president who will fight for economic, social and human rights once in office.</p>
<p>At polling places across the state in the afternoon Tuesday, several voters described coming to their decision in recent days, which —&nbsp;in two cases —&nbsp;benefited Ms. Klobuchar.</p>

<p>For Dunbarton resident Nora LaMarque, it came down to Ms. Klobuchar and Mr Buttigieg. What pushed her to Ms. Klobuchar was her debate performance last Friday night in Manchester, and notably, Mr. Buttigieg’s less-than-satisfactory answer to a question about race relations in his hometown.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t very clear. I think he should have been more prepared to have that kind of information, and to give the facts,” Ms. LaMarque said.</p>
<p>Ms. LaMarque said she has many friends who were locked between Ms. Klobuchar and Mr. Buttigieg.</p>
<p>In Concord, 56-year-old HR technology worker Daniel Swacha, an undeclared voter, said he decided to support Ms. Klobuchar two days ago, and if it weren’t for her, he would have voted in the Republican primary for Donald Trump.</p>
<p>“I think the rest of them are a clown show,” Mr. Swacha said of the other Democrats in the race, calling the primary a “free fest” where everyone’s trying to promise more taxpayer money to voters.</p>
<p>The remaining Democratic candidates will now head to Nevada, where caucuses will be held Feb. 22, and South Carolina before its Feb. 29 primary.</p>
