<h1>Prosecutors appeal dismissal of priest's conviction</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County District Attorney’s office is appealing a judge’s decision to toss out the conviction of a priest on charges he sexually assaulted an 11-year-old boy in 2001.</p>
<p>The appeal to Superior Court came one week after Allegheny County Court of&nbsp;Common Pleas Judge Anthony Mariani tossed out the 2019 conviction of the Rev. Hugh Lang, 89, a former superintendent of Catholic schools for the Diocese of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Judge Mariani ruled that Father Lang did not get a fair trial because the previous judge in the case, Mark Tranquilli,&nbsp;had admitted evidence that Judge Mariani said should have been disallowed. The evidence showed Father Lang had conducted Internet searches for defense attorneys in 2018 as a grand jury report into the Diocese of Pittsburgh loomed.</p>
<p>The prosecution had argued the search showed consciousness of guilt, but Judge Mariani said there could have been other reasons for the searches. The judge replaced Judge Tranquilli before Father Lang’s sentencing because the latter judge was placed on administrative duties pending investigation into conduct unrelated to this case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors will file a brief arguing to get the judge’s ruling reversed at a later date.</p>
