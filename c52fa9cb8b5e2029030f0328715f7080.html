<h1>Kevin Newman leaves Pirates game with apparent leg injury</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kevin Newman spent part of Saturday afternoon speaking with media, discussing what has been a somewhat disappointing season to this point.</p>
<p>During the Pirates’ game against the St. Louis Cardinals on Saturday evening, things got worse.</p>
<p>In the bottom of the ninth inning, with the Pirates down by one and attempting to mount a comeback, Newman stepped up with one out and nobody on. He worked the count to 2-2 against Cardinals left-hander Genesis Cabrera. On the next pitch, Cabrera threw a 97 mile-per-hour fastball down and in. It was too far in, as a matter of fact, drilling Newman on the left knee as the Pirates’ infielder attempted to kick his legs back out of the way.</p>
<p>Newman stayed down in a heap on the ground, clutching that left knee. Pirates manager Derek Shelton and head athletic trainer Bryan Housand came out to check on him, but the injury was bad enough that Newman could not walk off the field on his own, instead being helped off as he kept his left leg off the ground the entire way.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton did not have an update on Newman after the game, saying that he likely would know more before Sunday’s series finale with the Cardinals.</p>
<p>As for Newman’s teammates, Newman’s departure was, obviously, a hard thing to watch.</p>
<p>“I can’t even imagine. He got hit, 97, looked like it hit him – the sound that it made, I thought for sure something was broken,” third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes said after the game. “Just getting hit in the ninth inning like that is tough. I’m hoping he’s OK and hoping it’s nothing too serious so he can get back out there.”</p>
<p>JT Riddle pinch ran for Newman after he was carried off the field, and left fielder Adam Frazier ground into a double play to end the inning and the game.</p>
<p>Newman has struggled this season, hitting just .224 to this point in the season. On Saturday, he said how he was motivated to finish this season strong and head into 2021 with some positive momentum.</p>
<p>Now, that possibility seems to be in jeopardy.</p>
