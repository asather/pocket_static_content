<h1>Pittsburgh's Chinese community concerned about virus outbreak, seeks to help Wuhan</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Last week, Peng Cheng called a friend, a fellow Chinese immigrant in the Pittsburgh area, to ask if he was coming over to play cards, as they regularly do together.</p>
<p>“No, I don’t think we should, because of the outbreak” of the new coronavirus in China, Mr. Cheng, 55, a dentist who lives in Franklin Park, recalled.</p>
<p>“I was laughing a bit, telling him, ‘But I know you and me have not been to China.’ But I understood what he meant,” said Mr. Cheng, whose mother and sisters still live in Wuhan, including one sister who is a nurse in a hospital there.</p>
<p>“We were both worried that maybe we had met someone recently who had been to China and we did not want to get someone else sick.”</p>
<p>Since Mr. Cheng’s hometown of Wuhan —&nbsp;the epicenter of the new coronavirus outbreak that has spread fear around the globe —&nbsp;was shut down Jan. 23 by the Chinese government and cut off from the outside world in hopes of containing the virus, conversations like that have been common throughout the Pittsburgh Chinese community.</p>
<p>Those conversations have been a mixture of confusion and worry about friends and family back in China —&nbsp;who they talk to daily —&nbsp;along with a hyper-sensitive concern about ensuring that none of those who may have visited China recently —&nbsp;anywhere in China, not just Wuhan —&nbsp;not be the source of infection for anyone here in the United States.</p>
<p>“The whole community is very self-conscious now,” Mr. Cheng said.</p>
<p>Numerous Chinese-based community events have been cancelled in the last two weeks in the Pittsburgh region — from a Chinese New Year’s celebration in Squirrel Hill, to community meetings or gatherings, to exercise classes.</p>
<p>Some recent visitors to China have self-isolated themselves for two weeks —&nbsp;even though it was not required at the time —&nbsp;including friends of Mr. Cheng who returned recently from a trip to Shanghai, where there have been just 30 coronavirus cases so far.</p>
<p>“They are fine but they do not want to take any chances,” Mr. Cheng said of his friends, who did not want to be identified.</p>
<p>Not long after the Jan. 23 quarantine of Wuhan, the Chinese Physicians Group in Pittsburgh sent an email to members of the Pittsburgh Chinese community that “anyone who is coming back from Wuhan or anywhere in China should self-quarantine for two weeks,” Mr. Cheng said.</p>
<p>It was not until Friday that the Pennsylvania Department of Health advised anyone returning from a trip to anywhere in China self-isolate for 14 days. There have been no confirmed cases of coronavirus in Pennsylvania, though there have been 12 in the United States so far.</p>
<p><strong>Sending aid</strong></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Chinese community —&nbsp;and the fairly large Pittsburgh Wuhan and Hubei community specifically —&nbsp;began trying to help the community back in China.</p>
<p>On the day Wuhan was shut down, Mr. Cheng and others here <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/fundraising-from-pittsburgh---sister-city-of-wuhan" target="_blank">started a Go Fund Me campaign to raise money to help Wuhan</a>, which is desperately short on the most basic medical equipment, including surgical masks, goggles and personal protection suits.</p>
<p>They set a goal of $50,000. Early this past week they blew past that, hitting about $60,000 by Thursday between online and personal donations, though they are still taking donations.</p>
<p>The campaign started by reaching out to members of the Pittsburgh Chinese community, which wasn’t a bad place to start.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s Asian population is approaching 20,000 people —&nbsp;most of them of Chinese descent —&nbsp;nearly double the 12,000 who lived here in 2010, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.</p>
<p>A substantial number of those of Chinese descent are from Wuhan and the surrounding Hubei Province, with anywhere from 200 to 300 families —&nbsp;or more —&nbsp;from the city and province living in Allegheny County.</p>
<p>That regional-specific count comes from members of the Pittsburgh Hubei Fellow Association, an organization formed in 1998 after residents from Hubei Province —&nbsp;provinces in China are the equivalent of a state in the U.S. —&nbsp;started to realize there were an increasing number of them living in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
<p>It didn’t hurt that Wuhan, Hubei’s capital city, is a longtime sister city of Pittsburgh, and the mayor of Wuhan would regularity visit Pittsburgh, and vice versa, building up personal, cultural and economic ties.</p>
<p>With the connections between the cities, doing a fundraiser to help Wuhan felt more like a personal responsibility, said Xiaoming Li, 63, a ceramics engineering researcher who has lived in Pittsburgh for 26 years.</p>
<p>When he first came here in 1994 for a job with Downtown-based coatings company PPG, “There weren’t too many [Hubei] residents here,” he said.</p>
<p>When he and others decided to start the Hubei Fellowship group in 1998, it began with 30 or 40 families.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now we have more than 200 families” in the group, he said.</p>
<p>Also joining the push to raise funds are the Pittsburgh Chinese Cultural Center —&nbsp;known as the PCCC —&nbsp;and the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, Pittsburgh Chapter —&nbsp;known as CAST-P.</p>
<p><strong>‘You’d better stay home’</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Li, who is from a suburb of Wuhan, said his father, who is 90, two brothers and their families, still live in various suburbs near Wuhan. All have been isolated in their homes.</p>
<p>Near the beginning of the outbreak, his father had planned to return to his hometown in the country for an annual Lunar New Year’s celebration. His kids warned him against it.</p>
<p>“We told him, ‘You’d better stay home. It’s not safe,’” Mr. Li recalled. “He was upset. He really wanted to go back.”</p>
<p>Jing He, 33, a neuroscience researcher who has lived in Pittsburgh for 2½ years, grew up in a rural area about two hours north of Wuhan. His parents — who are farmers —&nbsp;brothers and cousins still live there.</p>
<p>Since even his parents’ small town is on lockdown, with no one going to work, “My parents are staying at home. They just don’t go out. They just watch TV.”</p>
<p>“I talk to my parents every day. I normally call them every week. But now I am more concerned.</p>
<p>His brother, a guard at the local prison, has been forced for the last week to live round-the-clock at the prison.&nbsp;“They were worried if a guard went out and caught the virus, they’d come back and infect the entire prison,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>‘How can we help?’</strong></p>
<p>It is those personal connections that convinced them they needed to do something to help.</p>
<p>“We know the hospitals are short of everything,” Mr. Li said.</p>
<p>“We are also thinking about our friends who have been infected, and we are concerned,” he said, noting that he knows two teachers from his university in Wuhan who have been infected already, and others he did not know as well who have died.</p>
<p>“But we also thought, ‘How can we help? What can we do to do our best?”</p>
<p>Beyond their own fundraiser, members of PCCC have been helping Brother’s Brother Foundation, a Pittsburgh-based nonprofit that promotes health and educational initiatives internationally, in setting up a separate donation of medical supplies from Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Sarah Boal, assistant vice president for disaster response and strategic initiatives for the foundation, said Brother’s Brother is working with the PCCC to send three shipments of the most-needed medical equipment to Wuhan and other regions: several thousand infection-control suits, more than 10,000 N95 masks, and more than 500,000 surgical masks.</p>
<p>It was lucky timing that the foundation “just had a bunch of supplies donated to us by a wholesaler” two weeks ago, she said, after working to get them for a couple weeks before that. That was well before anyone here knew about any outbreak in China.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PCCC members here have helped by translating customs documents, organizing free shipments on Air China to Shanghai and Beijing, and then helping organize ground transportation once wherever the equipment is needed.</p>
<p>While most of the funds the Chinese cultural groups have raised so far have come from those with direct ties to China, Mr. Li said he hopes the Pittsburgh’s relationship to that region will spur other, non-Chinese residents to help, too.</p>
<p>“We hope to reach out to the general public to say, ‘Wuhan needs your help. It’s our sister city,’” he said.</p>
