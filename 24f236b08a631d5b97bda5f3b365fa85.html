<h1>As businesses temporarily close, some places still need workers -- like grocery stores</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Amid the announcements of layoffs and temporary shutdowns at many businesses in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, some places are still hiring.</p>
<p>For instance, grocery stores are seeing unprecedented demand as they dedicate more crews to sanitizing their stores and keeping shelves stocked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Giant Eagle is partnering with the Pittsburgh Penguins and Primanti Bros. to help provide PPG Paints Arena workers and Primanti restaurant employees with temporary work, the O’Hara grocer announced Friday morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition, Giant Eagle said it is still looking “to hire hundreds of people across numerous areas of business, including in its stores, at its warehouse facilities and as truck drivers.”</p>
<p>“Supermarkets, pharmacies and fuel stations are critical community resources right now,” said Giant Eagle, Inc. president and CEO Laura Shapira Karet in a statement. “I continue to be amazed by the commitment and compassion of our Giant Eagle and GetGo team members, and thank the PPG Paints Arena workers and Primanti Bros. restaurant employees who have stepped up to help us get this important work done.”</p>
<p>Restrictions related to the virus outbreak have forced restaurants to limit business to takeout only and entertainment venues have had to halt operations.</p>
<p>The Penguins previously announced that PPG Paints Arena workers will be compensated for missed regular season Penguins games.</p>
<p>“We have a well-trained, loyal and hard-working arena workforce, and we are happy to provide priority opportunities to help them and their families during this time of need,” Penguins CEO David Morehouse said in a press release. “We worked closely with our operations partners, ASM Global and Aramark, and our service workers union leaders to help provide these jobs to over 700 arena employees.”</p>
<p>Shop&nbsp;‘n Save also has immediate openings&nbsp;“during this high-volume time” throughout its stores, according to the company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Because all of the stores are independently owned and operated, employment opportunities will vary by location, so the best place to learn the most updated information is by visiting local stores, according to the company.</p>
<p>On Friday, Dollar Tree, Inc., which operates both Dollar Tree and Family Dollar, put out a call for 25,000 full- and part-time workers at its stores and distribution centers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Whether you are home unexpectedly or are just starting your career, we have a broad range of positions to fit your needs and availability,”&nbsp;stated Betty Click, chief human resources officer of the Chesapeake, Va.-based discount chain. The company has more than&nbsp;15,000 store locations and 24 distribution centers.</p>
<p>Walmart, the largest brick-and-mortar retailer, is hiring 150,000 employees through the end of May to work in stores, clubs and&nbsp;distribution centers and fulfillment centers, according to a post on its website.</p>
<p>“These roles will be temporary at first, but many will convert to permanent roles over time. We’ve reached out to industry groups representing restaurants and hospitality to facilitate temporary roles that can be a bridge for their employees during this difficult time,” the company said.</p>
<p>“We know millions of Americans who are usually employed at this time are temporarily out of work, and at the same time we’re currently seeing strong demand in our stores,” Doug McMillon, president and CEO, wrote in the post. “We’re looking for people who see Walmart as a chance to earn some extra money and perform a vital service to their community.”</p>
