<h1>'Comfortable sophistication:' Another co-working company sets its sights on Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Another co-working provider could have its eye on the Steel City.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh is “one of the target cities” that Hana, a division of the CBRE real estate firm, is considering for future expansion, according to Jeffrey Ackerman, CBRE managing director.</p>
<p>Hana already has opened locations in Dallas, Tx., Irvine, Ca., and London. It also has spots planned in Arlington, Va., and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>In addition, it just announced a deal to partner with Silverstein Properties to open a flex space at 3 World Trade Center in New York City. The 85,000-square-foot space will be spread over two floors.</p>
<p>Mr. Ackerman said that Hana has yet to start an actual search for space in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>On its website, Hana bills itself as a flexible workspace provider that marries “comfortable sophistication with thoughtful design.”</p>
<p>At its 2 1/2-floor space in Dallas, the shared workspace featured polished wood and stone, bright ceramic tiles and high-quality furnishings, according to a report in the Dallas Morning News.</p>
<p>Amenities listed on Hana’s website include a dedicated concierge, team suites with configurable workspace designs, premium shared space, large and small conference rooms, luxurious lounge seating options and Herman Miller sit-stand desks and chairs, state-of-the-art acoustic design and sound-masking technology, interactive whiteboards, and free coffee.</p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Hana would join a growing number of co-work providers, including Beauty Shoppe, Regus, Industrious, Novel Coworking, Serendipity Labs, and ProSuites2.</p>
<p>Last October, co-working giant WeWork scrapped plans to open as much as 105,000 square feet of space in U.S. Steel Tower after it decided against an initial public offering.</p>
<p>U.S. Steel Tower also is the location of CBRE’s Pittsburgh headquarters, making it a possible candidate for Hana should it launch a search for space Downtown.</p>
