<h1>Paul Zeise mailbag: Should MLB just punt on the season at this point?</h1>

<p><em>Welcome to Paul Zeise’s weekly mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life and everything in between. You can also chat about all sports with Paul at noon Thursdays. If you want to ask a question, tweet him @paulzeise or email him at pzeise@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><em>Let’s get started:</em></p>
<p><strong>not a pirate,&nbsp;@RevD98:&nbsp;</strong>Would it just be better for baseball to cancel? Would that give them enough time to realize that they need each other? Maybe devote $ to minors and share?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I am getting to the point where I think it may be time for players and owners to punt on the season. I mean, they can’t agree on anything and don’t seem motivated get a deal done. Case in point: the players were given a proposal on Tuesday. It is Wednesday and there are no talks scheduled among the players to produce a counter offer. If there was a sense of urgency, wouldn’t this be taking place? Do they want to play or not? And do the owners want a season or not? The truth is some of the owners believe they will lose less money with no season than they will if they have to try and string together a season. There is no question that is a problem some owners are wrestling with. I would hope it is posturing and it is negotiation rhetoric and there is a deal that is coming soon. I just don’t think that is the case. I think there is a wide gap between what the owners want and what the players will agree to and this could go on for a while. And you aren’t wrong, both sides need to do their part to make a deal happen. That being said, that assumes both sides — or either side — really wants a deal.</p>
<p><strong>Marty:</strong> It has been so long since we had baseball please refresh my memory. What is the Pirates rotation when, if, baseball returns? And is it going to be good enough to give them a chance to contend?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> My guess is it will be Chris Archer, Trevor Williams, Joe Musgrove, Mitch Keller and either Steven Brault or Derek Holland. I think like everything else this year there are a whole lot of questions about that rotation. Keller has a chance to take a step forward from last year and improve dramatically. Williams has shown he can pitch better than he did last year. Archer is what he is; I am tired of this idea that his talent is supposed to enamor us any more. He is a mediocre pitcher who has never lived up to his potential. Musgrove is a competitor and should keep improving. The fifth spot is a mess. I suppose if Keller and Musgrove take steps forward, Archer finds himself and Williams returns to form from two seasons ago it could work, but that is a lot that has to go right for the Pirates to have a chance.</p>
<p><strong>Joe:&nbsp;</strong>Why do some people want QB Josh Rosen here so bad? Mason Rudolph threw for more TD passes in 10 less games than Rosen. Do you think the Steelers should sign Rosen?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Hold up: <em>one</em> person wants Rosen here, at least that I know. And Andrew Filliponi wants every quarterback here to back up Ben Roethlisberger, so why wouldn’t he also be pushing Rosen? I am fine with Mason Rudolph as the backup. I am fine with the Steelers not signing some washed up journeyman type to&nbsp;“create competition.” Rosen is also apparently a bad locker room guy, so why bring him here? I would not like that signing at all.</p>
<p><strong>Amy:</strong> Am I the only person who thinks Minkah Fitzpatrick is overrated? My husband thinks he is the best defensive player in the AFC. What do you think? He is a good player but I don’t think he is one of the Steelers’ best players.</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> Your husband is right and you are watching a different game! Fitzpatrick was the Steelers’ best defensive player last season. He really was the missing piece for that defense. He is a really special player for the Steelers and I expect him to be even better this year. He is one of the best safeties in football. If it is any consolation to you — Pete Prisco also thinks Fitzpatrick is overrated, so you are not alone. You both are wrong, but at least you aren’t alone in your thoughts.</p>
<p><strong>Thebingebreaker,&nbsp;@thebingebreaker:</strong>&nbsp;Is this a boom or bust year for Narduzzi? Lots of starters returning. A finally decently weak non-conference schedule and a coastal division that is still a mess and up for grabs? Would they make a move regardless of extension if they win less than 8 games?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> I doubt it because the pandemic has really strapped athletic departments. This needs to be a big year for Pitt, and I think it will be for all the reasons you mentioned. They look to be excellent in all three phases, they have star power on both sides of the ball and they have a ton of depth and experience. And like you said, they don’t have a terrible schedule to navigate, either. I absolutely think the Panthers will win 10 games or more this year. And if they win seven or fewer it is a disaster, but I don’t think Pitt wants to be buying out coaches any time soon, so he will survive. I don’t know that would be the wrong decision, either, as I think he would deserve at least one more year to try and get it right.</p>
<p><strong>Chad:</strong> Is "Pete from Squirrel Hill" that calls into the Nightly Sports Call seemingly every day the most annoying caller you've ever dealt with in TV or radio?</p>
<p><strong>Zeise:</strong> He is definitely on the Mt. Rushmore of annoying callers in my career, but not sure he is the worst. There is a guy, Cliff from Robinson, that is up there because it is the same schtick every time. He calls, he complains about modern day baseball players and talks about how awful the talent is and then reminisces about the days when he played softball with better players than what he is watching in the major leagues. I will give you a hint: nobody you have played softball with has any prayer of ever sniffing the big leages.</p>
