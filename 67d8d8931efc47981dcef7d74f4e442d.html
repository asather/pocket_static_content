<h1>Joe Haden on Steelers rookie Chase Claypool: 'He's going to be a problem'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A constant theme throughout the COVID-19 pandemic has been the uphill battle NFL rookies face to earn playing time due to the truncated camps and the cancellation of preseason games. Steelers coach Mike Tomlin has mentioned it quite often this summer, and veteran players have empathized with their plight.</p>
<p>After the Steelers’ first padded practice of camp, one prominent player is sounding a different tune.</p>
<p>Joe Haden, the three-time Pro Bowl cornerback, was effusive in his praise of rookie receiver Chase Claypool, who made an acrobatic catch over him Monday in the end zone.</p>
<p>“That was a really, really good play,” Haden said Tuesday morning.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t the first. Monday was the first day reporters were allowed into Heinz Field to view practice, but Haden said Claypool has been a force in the first two weeks of camp.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t even just that play,” Haden said. “He’s had a couple of plays on me this camp. I’ve been lined up on him pretty often. He’s a big, fast receiver. He’s able to adjust to the ball in the air. He’s a big body, a big deep threat with soft hands who can go up and get it. As long as he can stay healthy, I think he’s going to be a problem.”</p>
<p>Haden quote tweeted a video from the Steelers’ Twitter feed of Claypool making a catch in the end zone without a defender on him. The catch, with Claypool twisting his body in the air to grab the ball, was similar to the one he had on Haden in the end zone.</p>
<p>Haden believes Claypool might even be a part of the receiver rotation early in the season.</p>
<p>“I think he can,” Haden said. “He has impressed me — just his size, his speed, his ability to adjust to the ball in the air. And then he really doesn’t say too much. He’s just out there every day working hard, asking questions, getting the routes. He’s been doing a really good job.</p>
<p>“I think he’s a great young talent. His work ethic shows he wants to be great. He doesn’t do too much talking. He just gets after it. As long as he knows the playbook, as long as he and Ben [Roethlisberger] are on the same accord with the checks, he has all the physical attributes to be a baller.”</p>
