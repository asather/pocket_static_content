<h1>AMC movie chain set to reopen theaters in July</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>AMC, the world's largest movie chain, will activate 450 theaters on July 15, then reopen all of its more than 660 American theaters on July 24, in time for the release of Disney’s live-action "Mulan."</p>
<p>Forecasters fretted about the future of AMC when the chain reported a $2.2 billion loss in the first quarter of 2020, a result of the COVID-19 global shutdown of all gathering places.</p>
<p>The reopening announcement follows fast on the heels of rival Cinemark saying it would reopen in July as well.</p>

<p>In-person entertainment closed down in March to help stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. On Thursday evening, the website for local theaters, including the AMC Loews at the Waterfront in West Homestead, had a message that said: "Most theatres will reopen 7/15 with your health &amp; safety in mind," with a link to new "AMC Safe &amp; Clean" policies and procedures.</p>
<p>To meet safety guidelines, AMC is reducing its seating capacity, implementing new cleaning procedures, placing hand-sanitizing stations throughout its theaters and encouraging contactless and cash-free concessions, according to Variety.</p>
<p>AMC CEO and president Adam Aron told Variety that the chain could have reopened in some states in May, but "we opted to remain closed, so we could give the country time to get a better handle on coronavirus. We wanted to use this time to figure out how best to open and how to do so safely.”</p>
