<h1>Steelers should enter Day 3 with eye on offensive line, defensive pieces</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Now that the Steelers have <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/04/24/steelers-2020-nfl-draft-picks-round-2-3-chase-claypool/stories/202004240125" target="_blank">added a pass-catcher and pass-rusher</a> who can help both now and later, it could be time to add protection.</p>
<p>Chase Claypool and Alex Highsmith are in the fold, but using their only second- and third-round picks on them means the Steelers eschewed the offensive line on Day 2 of the 2020 NFL draft, their first day of action. There were plenty of options available when both selections were made, but general manager Kevin Colbert and coach Mike Tomlin instead addressed two positions where talent was thinning a bit faster.</p>
<p>So with the 18th pick in the fourth round Saturday, No. 124 overall, the Steelers can try to unearth a Day 3 offensive line gem. That's not easy, but it helps that they might be flexible on whether they look for a tackle, guard or even center.</p>
<p>Prince Tega Wanogho (6-feet-5, 308 pounds) of Auburn leads the group of tackles who remain, though converted tight end Ben Bartch (6-6, 309) of Division III St. John's (Minn.) is also intriguing. Alex Taylor (6-8, 308) is a relatively raw prospect out of South Carolina State, while Washington's Trey Adams (6-8, 318) was once a highly touted NFL prospect before being beset by injuries. The Steelers could also be intrigued by LSU's Saahdiq Charles (6-4, 321) if they overlook his off-field issues, or North Carolina's Charlie Heck (6-8, 311). Heck, whose father played 12 seasons in the NFL, would be yet another Steeler with good bloodlines.</p>
<p>Among interior linemen, Wisconsin's Tyler Biadasz (6-4, 314) and Oregon's Calvin Throckmorton (6-5, 317) can play guard or center. But the best pure guards on the board might be Clemson's John Simpson (6-4, 321), Kentucky's Logan Stenberg (6-6, 317) and Michigan's Ben Bredeson (6-5, 315). There might be no interior lineman in this draft as strong as Fresno State's Netane Muti (6-3, 315) but while his 44 bench-press reps blew away everyone at the combine, he's been unable to stay healthy throughout his college career.</p>
<p>Ramon Foster's spot on the offensive line isn't set in stone, but what the Steelers do in the draft could give some hints as to their thinking. They signed veteran free agent Stefen Wisniewski, but will he be the new starting left guard or a backup guard/center? They brought back Zach Banner on a one-year deal, but will it be him, 2018 third-rounder Chuks Okorafor or incumbent starter Matt Feiler at right tackle? Finding an offensive lineman with versatility to play outside or inside might be ideal.</p>
<p>If they continue to procrastinate on upgrading the line, there's a chance they use their two fourth-round picks on the defense. At this point, depth is most needed at inside linebacker and safety.</p>
<p>It's a surprise that Appalachian State's Akeem Davis-Gaither (6-2, 224) wasn't picked on Day 2 ahead of a couple other off-ball linebackers. Oregon's Troy Dye (6-3, 231) is another whose work in coverage is a strength and could be just what the Steelers need next to Devin Bush after cutting starter Mark Barron. Lest they feel comfortable with veteran Vince Williams playing more in the middle, the Steelers will want to try to find a rookie to compete with second-year sixth-rounder Ulysees Gilbert for more playing time.</p>
<p>That doesn't mean there won't still be a trickle-down effect on the secondary. If the Steelers intend to introduce some new sub-package defenses, it wouldn't hurt to upgrade their safety situation beyond Minkah Fitzpatrick and Terrell Edmunds. They've got the backup bangers who can play in the box in Jordan Dangerfield and Marcus Allen, but later-round prospects Kenny Robinson, J.R. Reed and K'Von Wallace are known for their coverage abilities. Robinson is a Wilkinsburg native who was dismissed from West Virginia but is now attempting to become the only player to be drafted from the (new) XFL into the NFL.</p>
<p>A bit lower on the list of needs, but still in play, figures to be running back and nose tackle. Look for the Steelers to add one or both if they really like a player who falls to them, given that neither position is valued as high as, say, wide receiver or edge-rusher. Another playmaker would be a luxury pick. Any additional defender at this point in the draft wonâ€™t be a transformative talent, but perhaps a piece of the puzzle in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Remaining Steelers picks:</strong></p>
<p>Round 4, 124 overall</p>
<p>Round 4, 135 overall (via Tennessee/Miami)</p>
<p>Round 6, 198 overall</p>
<p>Round 7, 232 overall</p>
