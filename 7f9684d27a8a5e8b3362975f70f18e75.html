<p>Canonsburg’s cancellation of its annual Fourth of July festivities due to the pandemic has drawn some mixed reaction from its residents.</p>
<p>Canonsburg officials announced late Sunday that they would have to cancel this year’s parade, fireworks display and park and pool events. The social distancing rules established by the state, they said, would make it difficult to safely hold such a large gathering and event.</p>
<p>“This decision was not arrived at lightly,” the borough’s Fourth of July Committee said in a statement.&nbsp;“We are moving our focus to the future, and wish everyone a happy and safe summer.”</p>
<p>Some residents expressed disappointment, with some so upset they called the borough’s action “ridiculous” and drastic, while others thanked the committee for making safety a priority.</p>
<p>“Absolutely a shame. The fireworks should still happen at the very least,” resident Joshuah Edwards said in response to the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/352876819436/posts/10158302306254437/" target="_blank">borough’s post on Facebook</a>.</p>
<p>“...how can Canonsburg cave to a virus that's no worse than the flu, how sad Canonsburg has caved all that s hype, never ever did I think I would see the day,” Mary Ortega said on Facebook.</p>
<p>“No better way to celebrate our freedom than being forced to stay inside for our “safety,” said another resident Chris Kelly.</p>

<p>Still others said they understood the need to cancel the parade but didn’t see why the fireworks also had to be scrubbed.</p>
<p>“Even in fields or parking lots. There’s always been distance between groups of people every year before all this nonsense,” said Adam Russell. “Don’t get me wrong, canceling the parade was the right thing to do, people are on top of each other for it, same with the swimming. The fireworks is just a slap in the face.”</p>
<p>And then there were others who supported the board’s move:</p>
<p>“I want to make it clear I am disappointed in the committee's decision and do think canceling the fireworks is a over reaction (but) I will still praise the committee for their dedication to our great town. I'm sure they think this was the best decision to make regardless of who disagrees with them,” resident Joe Sifinski said on Facebook.</p>
<p>“To the organizers: I know the decision was agonizing, and that you decided to cancel because you care about and love your community. Respect,” said Kathy Sabol.</p>
