<h1>Steelers practice report: Mike Tomlin ‘far from’ set at inside linebacker position</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the Steelers try to get caught up to where they’d be in a normal training camp, Mike Tomlin doesn't have much time for levity. But what got him laughing a bit Thursday afternoon was a question about whether the Steelers are set at inside linebacker with the four players they have there now: Devin Bush, Vince Williams, Ulysees Gilbert and Robert Spillane.</p>
<p>“No, man,” Tomlin grinned. “We’re far from it.”</p>
<p>It’s a fair ask of the head coach given that the Steelers signed just two undrafted players at that spot after releasing Mark Barron in March, and now both have been cut. They’re also trying a familiar face in a new position, asking third-year safety Marcus Allen to drop down and work with the inside linebackers Thursday in practice.</p>
<p>Bush will be out there as much as possible, with Williams not far behind, but it’s the depth that appears to be surprisingly thin, at least at this time of year when teams are carrying 80 players. When the Steelers released rookie Leo Lewis in the morning and replaced him with Jayrone Elliott, who’s more of an outside linebacker, it was a bit of a head-scratcher from a pure numbers standpoint — and perhaps further indication that the Steelers are keeping an eye on upgrading at that position eventually.</p>
<p>“We’re continuing to expose ourselves to new people and expand the potential of others. We’ve played Marcus Allen some at linebacker; he’s a guy that shows some position flexibility,” Tomlin said. “He’s playing strong safety and some inside linebacker, so that really kind of fortified our depth in that area when from a perception standpoint we might be running thin.”</p>
<p>Listed at 6-feet-2, 215 pounds, Allen has the sturdiest frame of any safety on the roster, save for maybe starter Terrell Edmunds. Even sixth-round rookie Antoine Brooks is a little more slight, but he’s busy trying to learn a safety spot anyway.</p>
<p>Allen hasn't contributed much in two seasons, but versatility is key, especially when Gilbert and Spillane have no experience outside of special teams. He struggled Thursday in a drill against running backs, getting bested four times over by a slimmer, quicker Benny Snell — but the coaches seem to be seeing what they need to of Allen in other areas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think he’s shown understanding in terms of how he’s communicated, whether it’s at linebacker or safety — his pre-snap communication skills, the way that he adjusts shows growth and development in terms of our overall scheme,” Tomlin said of Allen. “That allows him to display the position flexibility. Marcus has always had the physical skills to do both jobs. But intellectual skills, the overall understanding of the big picture allows those things and those skills to come out in a football way now.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the week, defensive backs coach Tom Bradley praised Allen’s expanded knowledge of the system and added that he’s “coming on strong.”</p>
<p>“He’s really developed. He’s one of the guys this preseason that has really come forward with his game,” Bradley said. “He’s playing faster. He understands what we are doing, and because of that, we’re going to be able to do a lot of different things with Marcus.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury report</strong></p>
<p>Wide receivers JuJu Smith-Schuster and Diontae Johnson returned to work Thursday after dealing with day-to-day injuries, while Ryan Switzer did not participate after injuring his foot during Tuesday’s practice. Also out were tight end Eric Ebron (illness), running back Kerrith Whyte (groin) and running back Anthony McFarland, who is being evaluated in the league’s concussion protocol, according to Tomlin.</p>
<p>Long-snapper Kameron Canaday also is day-to-day with a minor knee injury, so the team signed Liam McCullough, who held that role last year at Ohio State. McCullough was cut by the Raiders earlier this offseason but his presence allowed Tomlin to continue evaluating his special teams in drills Thursday.</p>
<p>On the bright side, fourth-round rookie guard Kevin Dotson began working his way back from a knee injury last week, as are running back Wendell Smallwood (shoulder) and defensive end Chris Wormley (shoulder). Up in the air is the status of Edmunds, who has been categorized by Tomlin as day-to-day but was wearing a brace on his left knee Thursday in limited activity.</p>
<p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p>
<p>• The team’s newest receiver, Ray-Ray McCloud, stood out as a kick returner in practice, rotating those duties with McFarland. McCloud also was busy taking snaps at wideout and redeemed himself from a drop by catching a 20-yard pass over the middle from Mason Rudolph.</p>
<p>• Tight end Vance McDonald caught a touchdown from Ben Roethlisberger during&nbsp;“Seven Shots,” which is a live period of 11-on-11 in a goal-line situation. McDonald also impressed with a catch in 7-on-7 work, and&nbsp;rookie receiver Chase Claypool made a diving catch for another touchdown during Seven Shots.</p>
<p>• Offensive line play was a mixed bag, with right tackle competitor Zach Banner throwing a key block on slot cornerback Mike Hilton to spring a 30-yard run by James Conner during a live period. But center Maurkice Pouncey had an errant snap — high this time, unlike his occasionally frustrating low snaps last season — that Roethlisberger managed to snag.&nbsp;</p>
