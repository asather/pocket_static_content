<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Former KQV Radio newscaster Bob Harvey died Wednesday after a short bout with stage 4 lung cancer, according to his brother Tom Harvey.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey was 75.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His brother said Friday that the long-time radio newscaster and talk show host was diagnosed only three weeks ago and was told he had six months to live. Mr. Harvey was&nbsp;“up and about” Tuesday night in the assisted living facility where he resided when he started to experience some breathing problems.</p>
<p>A tumor had surrounded his esophagus, his brother said. He died the next morning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey began working at KQV as a traffic reporter after he graduated from Point Park University in the mid 1960s which was the start of his three decade-long career with the station.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After pitching the idea of doing news from a helicopter, Mr. Harvey began taking the chopper over the city of Pittsburgh reporting live breaking news on-air, a stint that earned him the nickname&nbsp;“Captain Bob.”</p>
<p>His pilot skills earned him a small part in the 1968 film&nbsp;“Night of the Living Dead” in which his helicopter can be seen flying over the sky.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey retired from KQV in the early 90s after developing back problems, his brother said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He and his siblings spent their early years in Brookline before moving to Bethel Park where he graduated high school. Mr. Harvey eventually found a home in Mt. Washington so that he could be closer to breaking news throughout the city, his brother said. He stayed in that area before he moved to the assisted living facility last August after showing signs of dementia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“He loved the city. He could tell you anywhere in the city how to get there,” his brother said. “It was amazing everybody he knew. He’d do it all again.”</p>
<p>Jeff Roteman, who runs a KQV Radio tribute website, called Mr. Harvey a&nbsp;“very well respected man.”</p>
<p>“Bob was an incredible guy. He was old school news,” Mr. Roteman said. “He just told you the news the way it used to be.”</p>
<p>Mr. Harvey’s family will be holding a straight to burial service for him at Jefferson Memorial Park, according to Tom who currently lives in Harrisburg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The family plans on having a larger memorial service to honor Mr. Harvey when it is deemed safe to do so after the pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
