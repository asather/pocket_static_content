<h1>Penguins sign college free agent Drew O'Connor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins on Tuesday signed Drew O’Connor, the Dartmouth standout who was among the top undrafted college free agents up for grabs this spring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His two-year, entry-level deal starts during the 2020-21 season. O’Connor will report to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League on an amateur tryout contract for the rest of this season.</p>
<p>“Drew is a powerful skater with good hands, which helped him have a very good year at Dartmouth,” general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “We are very happy Drew has joined the Penguins as we feel he can help our NHL club sooner rather than later.”</p>
<p>Last week, the sophomore forward was named the Ivy League Men’s Hockey Co-Player of the Year for 2019-20 and was unanimously selected to the league’s first team. O’Connor led Dartmouth with 21 goals and 33 points in 31 games.</p>
<p>His freshman year, he scored 17 goals and was named second-team All-Ivy League. O’Connor’s 38 goals the past two years rank among the most in college hockey.</p>
<p>The New Jersey native, now 21, was perhaps overlooked in the NHL draft because he was reportedly only 5-foot-8 at 18. O’Connor is now listed at 6-foot-3, 200 pounds, blossoming into an interesting prospect with skill and size.</p>
<p>The Penguins under Rutherford <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/03/19/Penguins-NCAA-free-agents-Scott-Young-process-undrafted-college-Mackey-Thoughts/stories/201903190078" target="_blank">have been aggressive targeting college free agents</a> as a way to pump talent into a prospect pool that is drained annually as they trade draft picks and some of their better prospects in pursuit of the Stanley Cup. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/12/penguins-prospects-jason-zucker-trade-wilkes-barre-scranton/stories/202002120144" target="_blank">Look no further than last month’s trade for Jason Zucker</a>.</p>
<p>Among the college free agents the team has signed in recent years are Conor Sheary, Carter Rowney, Zach Aston-Reese, Casey DeSmith and Jake Lucchini.</p>
