<h1>Brian Dumoulin and John Marino are nearing returns, and it's not a moment too soon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A game-time decision.</p>
<p>Officially, that’s the status for injured defensemen Brian Dumoulin and John Marino when the slumping Penguins host the Ottawa Senators on Tuesday at PPG Paints Arena. Unofficially? All of the signs are looking positive.</p>
<p>The swelling on Marino’s left cheek is going down each day and he’s readjusting to wearing a full cage again. Dumoulin, who lacerated tendons in his left ankle Nov. 30, has three full-team skates under his belt and said he expects to be back at some point this week, maybe as soon as Tuesday.</p>
<p>Perhaps most telling of all, both defensemen skated with their regular defensive partners during Monday’s practice. Dumoulin was matched with Kris Letang and Marino played alongside Marcus Pettersson.</p>
<p>“It’s real encouraging to get these guys back and participating in a full capacity,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said.</p>
<p>When that “game-time” decision turns into a full go, it won’t come a moment too soon.</p>
<p>Just two weeks ago, on Feb. 18, the Penguins moved into sole possession of first place in the Metropolitan Division with a 5-2 win over Toronto. They haven’t won since.</p>
<p>Stuck on 80 points, the Penguins tumbled into third place in the Metro standings behind the Washington Capitals (86 points) and Philadelphia Flyers (83). So what’s wrong?</p>
<p>“I think it’s been different things,” Penguins captain Sidney Crosby said. “That’s probably why we’ve gone that many games.”</p>
<p>The captain is not wrong. When a team keeps finding creative, new ways to lose, there’s bound to be enough blame to go around a locker room. The power play is just 1-for-18 during the stretch. The secondary scoring is non-existent, with all eight goals coming from the Crosby and Evgeni Malkin lines. Puck luck has been brutal.</p>
<p>But the defensive corps, in particular, is near the top of the list, as the Penguins have felt the full brunt of suboptimal pairings.</p>
<p>During this six-game losing streak alone, Pettersson shouldered the blame after he contributed to two goals in a 5-3 loss in Washington. Zach Trotman, forced to play his off side, had two pucks go off him and into the net during Friday night’s loss in Anaheim.</p>
<p>But really, it starts at the top.</p>
<p>With few other options, the Penguins had been playing Jack Johnson in the top pairing with Letang. Whether you’re grading by eye test or advanced metrics, neither one has been satisfactory.</p>
<p>Before Dumoulin’s surgery on Dec. 1, Johnson averaged 17:55 minutes of ice time – mostly on the third pairing and the penalty kill – recording a solid plus-7 rating. Since the New Year, he’s been asked to play about four more minutes a game and in many more high-leverage situations, posting a minus-9 rating.</p>
<p>On Saturday in San Jose, for example, Johnson batted one goal in off his stick and contributed to another when his shot from the hash marks sailed wide to create an odd-man rush the other way.</p>
<p>Playing with Johnson has seemingly dragged down Letang’s play, as well. Letang has played a very similar amount of time with Johnson (528:21) as he has without Johnson (534:16), but the results are strikingly different.</p>
<p>According to Natural Stat Trick, the pair was on the ice for 115 of the opposition’s high-danger chances while creating just 80 together at 5-on-5. The numbers are basically flipped when Letang played with Dumoulin or Marino, as he was on the ice for 112 high-danger Penguins chances and just 70 against.</p>
<p>The Penguins can cast Johnson in a more fitting role once everyone officially returns from injury. Perhaps his numbers will look more like they did over the first two months of the season when he was a plus-7.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with Letang back next to Dumoulin, he’ll be playing next to a partner with whom he’s built great chemistry, even if it takes a couple games to get back up to speed.</p>
<p>“It’s been good this last week to try to get back with them and get up to game speed,” Dumoulin said. “Obviously pace of play is something that you need to adjust to. The best way to do that is to get into a game.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, with Marino back in the fold, he can form a pairing with Pettersson that looked promising during a small sample size. They were on the ice together for 50 high-danger chances for and 50 against, while also sticking together during penalty-killing duties.</p>
<p>That leaves Johnson and Justin Schultz to form the final pairing. At least that’s what the signs are from practice.</p>
<p>But how exactly will those defensive pairings shake out and how will they perform? You’ll have to wait until game time.</p>
