<h1>Pitt mailbag: Where would the Panthers be if Kevin Stallings didn't get fired?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: What would Pitt look like right now if Kevin Stallings were still the coach?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Once these hypotheticals start arising, and this is one of many forms of this question I’ve gotten the past week or two, you know you’re getting to a certain point in a lost season. It’s a fun thought experiment, though.</p>
<p>Let’s first get an idea of who would be on the roster. This includes players who were slated to return to Pitt following the 2017-18 season, Stallings’ signees who were released from their national letter of intent after his ouster and players who transferred out either during or after Jeff Capel’s first season.</p>
<p><em>Marcus Carr</em>: 15.4 points, 6.6 assists and 5.4 rebounds per game while shooting 33.1% from 3-point range as a sophomore at Minnesota</p>
<p><em>Parker Stewart</em>: 19.2 points, 3.8 assists and 4.6 rebounds per game while shooting 34.8% from 3 as a sophomore at Tennessee-Martin</p>
<p><em>Malik Ellison</em>: 19.2 points and 9.9 rebounds per game while shooting 52.8% overall and 15.4% from 3 as a graduate student at Hartford</p>
<p><em>Bryce Golden</em>: 7.9 points and 3.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.3% overall as a sophomore at Butler</p>
<p><em>Shamiel Stevenson:</em> Sat out this season at Nebraska. Averaged 8.5 points and 4.4 rebounds per game as a freshman at Pitt</p>
<p><em>Khameron Davis</em>: 7.1 points, 4.5 rebounds and 1.6 assists per game as a junior at Weber State</p>
<p><em>Terrell Brown</em>: 5.2 points, 3.7 rebounds and 1.6 blocks per game while shooting 52.5% overall as a junior at Pitt</p>
<p><em>Danya Kingsby</em>: 7.4 points, 2.9 rebounds and 2.1 assists per game while shooting 39.9% overall as a junior at Bradley</p>
<p>Overall, it’s a more appealing group than it looked like at the end of the 2017-18 season. Every one of those players was thrust into a difficult position at Pitt, as a team with 11 new players and seven freshmen, none of whom were top-100 recruits, tried to compete in the ACC. Predictably, it went poorly. But many of those players have found success elsewhere. Carr is one of the best point guards in the best conference in college basketball this season. After battling some injuries, Ellison emerged as a star for Hartford. Golden starts for a Butler team that spent part of the season ranked in the top five of the polls. Kingsby is contributing for an NCAA tournament-bound team at Bradley.</p>
<p>Granted, a number of these players — Stewart, Ellison, Kingsby, Davis — have done what they have at a lower level, which has to be factored into this. It’s also impossible to have a full idea of what the Panthers would look like without knowing who Stallings might have added for the 2019 recruiting class. And who knows? Had the team still struggled to piece together wins, albeit without going winless in the ACC again, some players might have gotten fed up and transferred.</p>
<p>If I had to guess, though, they’re probably among the bottom three or four teams in the ACC, which is where they are right now.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: In your opinion, what was the top reason (there are multiple I’m sure) for the late season collapse?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I would say the team’s defense slipping the way it has might be the biggest factor. While not exceptional, Pitt was a strong defensive team in the first half of the season, which wasn’t totally a product of a weaker schedule. That kept it in some games and won some contests it otherwise wouldn’t have with such an erratic offense. Now, it had been devolving a bit even before this seven-game losing streak, but it has really fallen off in that time. In those seven games, it has given up 502 points on 469 possessions, an average of 1.07 points per possession. Additionally, each of those teams has shot better than 43% in those games. Adding insult to injury? Four of those seven games came against teams ranked 140th or lower of 353 Division I teams in offensive efficiency.</p>
<p>Without that reliable defense providing it with a measure of stability on at least one end of the court, the Panthers have faltered. There are other things that have contributed to this spell, too. I do believe Capel when he says this team is tired. They look the part often, which has undeniably affected their defense. Injuries to the likes of Ryan Murphy and Eric Hamilton haven’t helped. Whether it’s indicative of larger problems, this team doesn’t seem connected and driven in the way it once did. But if I had to pick one, concrete factor, it would be the defense.</p>
<p><strong>Chad</strong>: What is Pitt’s offense? Motion? Flex? Are they actually trying to execute any plays or principles? Other than, like, maybe one high ball screen? It’s been 2 years and I still can’t tell what Capel’s offense is supposed to be.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Capel has said before that he doesn’t really have a set system and that he adjusts to his personnel. That has been true with this team this season, as well. It depends upon who is on the court at a given time. So I wouldn’t really say Pitt’s offense fits into a neat label like a motion or dribble-drive.</p>
<p>I’m not too proud to admit I’ll occasionally seek guidance from folks who know more than I do about some of the game’s tactical elements, so I reached out to my pal Stephen Gertz, who does some excellent video breakdowns for Cardiac Hill about Pitt’s execution and strategy. They ran a lot of flex early in the season. With Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens, they’ll often run pistol. With big men Abdoul Karim Coulibaly and Eric Hamilton, they’ll run horns. With Ryan Murphy, you’ll see a lot of continuity, though his minutes have declined of late, so that hasn’t been as prevalent a part of the Panthers’ offense.</p>
<p>Beyond Stephen’s insights, some of the things they try to do are evident enough in a game — dribble handoffs, high ball screens that are run with varying degrees of success.</p>
<p><strong>Michael:</strong> What 3 positive things can be taken from this season?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Justin Champagnie’s emergence and production has been the biggest of the positive developments. Au’Diese Toney’s improvement has been another. Pitt has also shown itself to be capable of beating great teams — such as Florida State and, while they’re not necessarily great, Rutgers is about to head to its first NCAA tournament in almost 30 years — or at least being competitive with them (Louisville, Duke and Virginia stand out here).</p>
<p>Beyond that, the list gets a little thin. Nobody getting catastrophically injured may honestly be No. 4, which begs the question — could you imagine where this team would be if the initial fears about Champagnie’s knee were correct and he had torn his ACL in September?</p>
<p><strong>G</strong>: If Pittsburgh got an NBA team, what should it be named?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’d love to see that happen, but given how small Pittsburgh would be for a four-team market and a lot of folks’ visceral aversion to the NBA around Western Pennsylvania —&nbsp;why that is is beyond me — I don’t think it’ll ever happen. But if it did, there’s a no-brainer of a name just waiting: the Pittsburgh Pisces. They could even sign Dr. J to a 10-day contract.</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: Greensboro, Washington D.C., Brooklyn, Charlotte. What is the best spot for the ACC tournament? Should it be a rotation or one spot every year?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: This may be an opinion rooted in ignorance — I’ve been to Greensboro, but never been there for the ACC tournament (which will change this week) — but I’m going to eliminate that from consideration right away. I didn’t grow up in North Carolina or ACC country in general, so part of this comes from that tournament in that city not having any sort of mythological quality to me. When the ACC was an eight-team league, with half of those schools in North Carolina, I’m sure Greensboro was great. But it’s now a 15-team behemoth that stretches from Boston to Miami. I’m not sure how well that works with that new setup. Just ask Jim Boeheim.</p>
<p>What to do with the ACC tournament, to me, comes down to whether you want to have it in one place or rotate it between a few of them. If it’s the latter, I think a rotation of Washington, D.C., Charlotte and Atlanta would be great. You’ll notice I didn’t include Brooklyn in there. This may be an unpopular take, but for as much as I love going to New York and watching college basketball there, it feels incredibly forced to have the ACC tournament there. Aside from the hilarious visual of Bojangles and Food Lion ads draped all across an arena that’s not within 100 miles of either of those things, there are only two ACC schools remotely close to New York and both of those, Boston College and Syracuse, aren’t within 200 miles of Brooklyn. It’s too much of a geographic outlier and it feels like a desperate attempt to recreate what the Big East had (and still probably has) with Madison Square Garden. That league playing that tournament in that venue works for any number of reasons the ACC simply doesn’t have on its side.</p>
<p>If we had to pick one place, which would be my preference as far as building an identity between a league and its tournament, I’d be inclined to say D.C. It’s sort of a geographic median between the conference’s old guard and the Big East additions. It’s in a city with a ton to do that will attract people there for reasons beyond just basketball, which was part of the appeal of the Big East tournament in New York. I’d be perfectly OK with Charlotte, too. If Greensboro were to be wiped off the ACC tournament calendar for good, Charlotte could be a nice compromise for a conference that is still very much rooted, down to its headquarters, in North Carolina.</p>
