<p>All deaths are of individuals who were over the age of 65, the county said.</p>
<p>“We extend deepest sympathies to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, and our thoughts go out to all those who have been impacted,” the county said in a statement.</p>
<p>Of the previous deaths, five included people who were hospitalized — one person in their 60s, two in their 70s, one in their 80s, and one in their 90s, officials said. One individual who died was not hospitalized; that woman was in her 70s.</p>
<p>The largest number of deaths in Western Pennsylvania was in Beaver County, where, based on Wednesday’s numbers, the state is reporting 13 deaths and 128 confirmed cases.</p>
<p>Other deaths reported in the region have been in Butler County (129 cases) and Lawrence County (37 cases), which have two deaths each; Fayette County (45 cases) and Cambria County (10 cases) have each reported a death.

<p>There is at least one confirmed case in each of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties.</p>
<p>In Allegheny County, the number of cases are broken down into the following age groups:</p>
<p>● 0-4: 2 (less than 1%)</p>
<p>● 5-12: 4 (less than 1%)</p>

<p>● 65 and over: 162 (21%)</p>
<p>Females (392 cases) have tested positive for COVID-19 more than males (367 cases).</p>
<p>That demographic information is now available as an <a href="https://tableau.alleghenycounty.us/t/PublicSite/views/COVID-19AlleghenyCounty/COVID-19?iframeSizedToWindow=true&amp;%3Aembed=y&amp;%3AshowAppBanner=false&amp;%3Adisplay_count=no&amp;%3AshowVizHome=no&amp;%3Aorigin=viz_share_link" target="_blank">interactive graphic,</a> which the county has made available to the public. Included among the information is a case information for each municipality and neighborhood in the city of Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>The elderly, especially those with underlying conditions, remain most susceptible to complications brought on by COVID-19.</p>
<p>Officials at Rochester Manor and Villa in Beaver County on Wednesday confirmed a resident at the nursing home had tested positive for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The patient was isolated in a re-opened personal care wing that the home prepared in anticipation of a case of the virus.</p>
<p>A resident at Southminster Place in Washington also tested positive for COVID-19, Presbyterian SeniorCare Network confirmed on Wednesday. The announcement comes after an employee tested positive on April 4. Tests for 46 residents and eight staff members at the home came back negative.</p>
<p>The state’s biggest COVID-19 outbreak — at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center in Beaver County — sickened at least 50 of 450 residents and killed 11 others as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania has about 700 nursing homes with 88,133 beds, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Locally, outbreaks have been reported at St. Barnabas Nursing Home in Richland, where 18 patients tested positive and two people died, and at Allegheny County’s Kane Glen Hazel nursing facility, where 18 residents and 13 staff members tested positive.</p>
<p>The outbreak at a county facility alarmed county Controller Chelsa Wagner.</p>
<p>“Since cases began to surface in Allegheny County, my office has received extremely concerning reports from Kane Centers employees that common sense precautions against the spread of the virus are not being followed,” she said in a statement. “Our attempts to gain explanation or elaboration from Kane officials have not gotten responses.”</p>
<p>At a news conference Wednesday, Allegheny County Executive Rich Fitzgerald said county officials were working hard to limit the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>“We expected that COVID-19 would affect not only county facilities, but the entire region,” he said, referred to the jail and county nursing facilities. “We’re in the middle of a crisis here.”</p>
<p>The county jail on Wednesday announced that one of its inmates tested positive for the virus. That prisoner and a cellmate have been quarantined, the county said.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the state has contracted with a nonprofit Philadelphia-area consultant who is available to operators of long-term care facilities for questions about infection control. In March, CMS began focusing on infection control measures during routine nursing home inspections.</p>
<p>Despite problems controlling the new virus in nursing homes, Dr. Levine and Allegheny County Health Department Director Debra Bogen both said Wednesday that the rate of increase in COVID-19 was not as steep as other parts of the country. Moreover, Dr. Bogen said the county’s hospital bed capacity, ventilators and other equipment were more than adequate to meet current needs.</p>
<p>But both physicians cautioned that it was still too early to stop social distancing, travel restrictions and other measures, which may be helping tamp down the rate of increase.</p>
<p>“We are cautiously optimistic about the slow rise in cases in our county,” Dr. Bogen said. “Even though we’re doing OK, we’re preparing for a surge.”</p>
