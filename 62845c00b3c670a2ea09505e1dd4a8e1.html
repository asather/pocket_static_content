<html><head><title>Fitzgerald, County Council enter new era of coexistence</title></head><body><p>Hours after he was sworn into his third and final term as Allegheny County executive, Rich Fitzgerald's name became a buzzword inside County Council's chambers Thursday night as two newly sworn-in members pledged to "shake up" the legislative body's relationship with him..</p><p>Swept into office on a wave of grassroots support from progressives, Councilwomen Bethany Hallam and Olivia Bennett watched from the dais as their past statements about Mr. Fitzgerald — that they won’t simply act as a “rubber stamp” for his legislative wishes — were amplified, and at times criticized, by their new council colleagues.</p><p>“We now have among us members who have been highly critical of us,” quipped Councilman Paul Klein, playfully pointing to Ms. Hallam. “I view that criticism as a challenge to do better — a belief that we can do better and have the capacity to do better.”</p><p>Doing his part to usher in the new era of county politics, Mr. Fitzgerald stopped by the council meeting in the county courthouse to shake hands with members — including Ms. Hallam — before leaving for a party on the South Side celebrating his swearing-in earlier that day.</p><p>It was at Soldiers &amp; Sailors Memorial Hall at about noon when he took his own oath of office, cheered on by a crowd of supporters and elected officials that included Mayor Bill Peduto and U.S. Reps. Conor Lamb and Mike Doyle.</p><p>In an inauguration speech that was as reflective as it was forward-thinking, Mr. Fitzgerald remarked that 20 years ago, when he was first elected to County Council, Pittsburgh was known as an exporter of young talent,</p><p>Today, he said, “we have turned that corner” and young people are now moving here from all over the world and staying.</p><p>“The nation and the world have finally discovered Pittsburgh,” Mr. Fitzgerald said, deeming the city’s progress less of an “overnight success” than a 30-year progression.</p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald cited transportation improvements and a focus on cultivating workforce skills as his main priorities this term, stating that he wants to ensure that as economic growth occurs in Western Pennsylvania, it grows for everyone — all the while ensuring environmental safety.</p><p>Doing this, he said, will take working collaboratively with a County Council that’s “ready to roll up its sleeves and move things forward.”</p><p>Though the council could take on a more activist bent with its new members, some members labeled the change a generational shift. Ms. Hallam is 30, Ms. Bennett is 40, and Tom Duerr, 24, another newly sworn-in member, is now the youngest person ever to serve on council.</p><p>“It’ll take time, and I don’t know what hurdles we’ll face as we work together to forge a better government,” Ms. Hallam said in a speech to the wall-to-wall audience in the council chambers. “The one thing I do know is that I won’t be able to do it alone.”</p><p>“I look forward to shaking up council with you,” Ms. Bennett said in her own speech, pointing to Ms. Hallam, her running mate.</p><p>In their first meetings as council members, Ms. Hallam and Ms. Bennett saw their choice for council president win, their rhetoric trigger commentary from several members and their wariness of a close relationship with Mr. Fitzgerald echoed by environmental activists who spoke during public comment.</p><p>They joined eight others on council in handing over the council presidency to Patrick Catena, who said he wanted to make the legislative body more inclusive and transparent.</p><p>Mr. Catena, in short remarks after the roll call vote, mentioned that the council had previously been deemed a “rubber stamp” on the chief executive, and said moving forward, he expects it to be “a collaborative effort between us and the executive branch as it has been in the past.”</p><p>“But there’s always room for improvement,” he added.</p><p>Voting for his opponent, Mr. Klein, were Mr. Duerr, Nick Futules, Anita Prizio and DeWitt Wilson, who said he couldn’t vote for someone who opposed an independent police review board.</p><p>Mr. Futules, in earlier remarks, offered a different interpretation of the newcomers’ “rubber stamp” comments, saying that he considers it to be “cooperation and moving this county forward.”</p><p>Mr. Fitzgerald, asked by reporters about his views on council’s role, said the body is “independent” and will continue to be, and that it hasn’t been a rubber stamp on his legislative suggestions.</p><p>“There’s been some things I’ve tried to push forward that didn’t get approved,” Mr. Fitzgerald said. “It’s been a good, collaborative effort.”</p><p>At the end of the council meeting, environmental activists, one by one, took the podium to publicly accuse Mr. Fitzgerald of cozying up to the petrochemical industry at the expense of public health and air quality.</p><p>The activists pledged to attend every meeting for the foreseeable future.</p><p><em>Julian Routh: jrouth@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1952, Twitter @julianrouth</em>.</p></body></html>
