<h1>Gene Collier: New book on Yogi Berra a wild ride, and that's just the index</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>“When you come to a fork in the road, take it.” — Yogi Berra</em></p>
<p>Occasionally an incoming parcel will contain a book I really don’t want to read because I’m too polite to have told a publisher or publicist, “Thanks, but no thanks.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, owing to experience, I know how to handle this.</p>
<p>First, I stare at it sheepishly, thinking it appears to be a worthy project produced with care by a writer I admire. Second, I stare at it harder and wait for the self-directed argument that begins, “Yeah, but it’s been done to death, right? Who’s got time for this?” Third, I slide it prominently onto a shelf near my work station as part of some kind of faux urbane backdrop in case I’m ever forced to appear on TV during a pandemic.</p>
<p>Once in a great while, this process fails me altogether and I end up plowing into the text for reasons not evident, and once in a greater while it’s a singularly rewarding experience I hope will go on forever. Three such instances I want to mention are David Maraniss’s “When Pride Still Mattered,” the Pulitzer winner’s biography of Vince Lombardi, Gary Pomerantz’s “Their Life’s Work,” about the ‘70s Steelers, and “The Last Pass,” also by Pomerantz, about the relationship between Boston Celtics legends Bill Russell and Bob Cousy.</p>
<p>All done to death, all re-awakened and re-imagined in ways only those gifted authors could achieve, they remain not only among the best sports books I’ve ever read, but among the best books of any genre.</p>
<p>Against this backdrop came delivery this week of “Yogi, A Life Behind the Mask,” the redoubtable Jon Pessah’s hefty project on Yogi Berra.</p>
<p>I can already say this: This book is incredible, even if you only read the index, which is about all I’ve done. Every letter is a veritable Pandora’s box of entirely unrelated American, global, and fanciful characters. It immediately manifests an ear worm of the Billy Joel classic “We Didn’t Start the Fire,”: Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Studebaker, Television, North Korea, South Korea, Marilyn Monroe. In fact, McCarthy, Nixon, and Monroe appear in the “Yogi” index, a virtual dreamscape of the weirdest possible combinations of characters. With Pessah’s book near my bed, I had a dream the other night that included Nathan Lane, Rosie O’Donnell, and former Post-Gazette assistant sports editor Terry Shields.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>Yogi Berra was many things across some 70 years of convulsing American culture, but essentially he was the catcher for the New York Yankees — the dynastic Yankees to be sure, but still just a baseball team.</p>
<p>The Yogi index belies that stature. Close your eyes and point at any of its 16 pages and you’ll land on a name you’d never expect to find in a volume such as this.</p>
<p>Randomly, starting with D: Salvador Dali, Doris Day, Olympia Dukakis.</p>
<p>Look at F after Elroy Face: King Faud of Saudi Arabia, William Frawley.</p>
<p>Under G: Clark Gable, Rudy Giuliani, Jackie Gleason, Cary Grant, and, with less incongruity, our own Dick Groat, whom Berra once called “the main clog of the Pittsburgh machine.”</p>
<p>Too many books have already been written about Yogi, a good portion of them focused on his talent for saying unintentionally inane or inappropriate things, as above. Once introduced to Ernest Hemingway and told Hemingway was a great writer, Yogi blurted, “Yeah, what paper you write for Ernie?”</p>
<p>Berra said hundreds of these things, including a deflection attempt that went, “I never said most of the things I said,” but all of it only conspired to obscure his consistent excellence as a player. Berra was, foremost, a winner. He played in 14 World Series, winning 10 times. He won three more championship rings as a coach with the Yankees and Mets. Yet he remains somehow vastly underrated as a player. According to Baseball Reference, his average season included 27 homers and 109 RBI, more in each category than the great Stan Musial (25, 104).</p>
<p>Perhaps best remembered hereabouts as the man in left field over whose head the Bill Mazeroski bomb flew on Oct. 13, 1960, Berra’s version of events further illuminates some of the greatest moments in Pirates history within these pages.</p>
<p>In Pessah’s telling, Berra shows how superior the Yanks felt to the 1960 Pirates, even after Berra’s three hits in Game 6 of the Series tied it three games apiece.</p>
<p>“Don’t write this,” he says to an Associated Press correspondent afterward, “but even if they beat us tomorrow, we’ve got a much better club.”</p>
<p>The writer asks why he shouldn’t write that.</p>
<p>“I dunno,” Berra replied. “It just doesn’t sound right for me to say it.”</p>
<p>Berra then turned to Mickey Mantle on the next stool: “Hey Mick, what do you think? Should he write what I just told him?”</p>
<p>“Hell, it’s true, isn’t it?” Mantle said. “If you don’t want to be quoted on that, he can quote me.”</p>
<p>“Ok,” Berra said, turning back to the writer. “Go ahead and quote me. Anyway, I don’t think I am saying anything critical about the Pittsburgh fellas. They deserve a lot of credit sticking in there with us. Look at them and look at us. There is no comparison. Yet here we are even, and we might even lose the thing.”</p>
<p>Yeah. Might nothin’.</p>
<p>Yogi will be gone five years in September, and if Pessah’s work further extends his legacy, no one’s going to complain.</p>
<p>Did I mention the letter ‘K’ in the index? John F. Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr., Henry Kissinger.</p>
<p>How about L: Jim Leyland, Sonny Liston.</p>
<p>And M: Joe McCarthy, Marilyn Monroe, Benito Mussolini, Edward R. Murrow, Willie Mays, and Meat Loaf.</p>
<p>Meat. Loaf.</p>
<p>I might just read this thing.</p>
