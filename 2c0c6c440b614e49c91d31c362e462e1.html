<p>NEW YORK — Mall-based retailers J.C. Penney, Kohl’s and Victoria’s Secret parent reported sales declines for the holiday season, underscoring continued challenges ahead from online rivals and other low-price competitors.</p>
<p>The sales releases, issued Thursday, come <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/01/08/Macy-s-is-closing-29-stores-after-drop-in-holiday-sales/stories/202001080122" target="_blank">one day after Macy’s reported a small decline</a> in holiday sales, though it was better than what investors feared. J.C. Penney says sales at stores opened at least a year dropped 7.5% for the November and December period. Adjusted results, including the impact of the chain’s exit from major appliances and furniture at its stores, decreased 5.3%. Kohl’s posted a 0.2% decline.</p>
<p>At L Brands, which operates Victoria’s Secret and Bath &amp; Body Works, the figure dropped 3%. The company also cut its fourth-quarter profit outlook, saying that it expects to report earnings per share of $1.85. It had previously said that it would earn $2 per share in the quarter.</p>
<p>The weak results come as overall retail sales are expected to have increased for the holidays, boosted by a strong economy. However, the divide between the winners and losers is widening. Discounters, feeling pressure from online behemoth Amazon, have been speeding up their deliveries and sprucing up their assortments.</p>
<p>Stores like T.J. Maxx, which offer deep discounts on coveted brands, also have been resonating with shoppers. But mall-based retailers have been too slow to react to the increasing competition.</p>
<p>In morning trading, J.C. Penney and Kohl’s shares both dropped around 8% while L Brands stock added nearly 2%.</p>
