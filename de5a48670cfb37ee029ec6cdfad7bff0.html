<h1>Carlynton declared forfeit winner over Sto-Rox after late game cancellation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three hours before his school was set to kick off the football season with a home game against Sto-Rox, Carlynton athletic director Nate Milsom got an email from Sto-Rox coach/athletic director LaRoi Johnson saying they were postponing the game.</p>
<p>The reason for the late news has not been made public, but it does not have to do with COVID-19. Because of that, Carlynton was credited with a season-opening win via forfeit.</p>
<p>“The cancellation was not COVID-related, so it would be treated like any other game that was canceled three hours before kickoff and be counted as a forfeit win for Carlynton,” WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman said.</p>
<p>After receiving the email from Johnson at 4:01 p.m., Milsom said he was unsuccessful in multiple attempts trying to reach Johnson. Milsom said the two finally spoke around 6:30. When reached for comment earlier, Milsom said he had no answer for why Sto-Rox was choosing not to play.</p>
<p>“That would be a Sto-Rox question,” Milsom said. “Myself nor the WPIAL have not been able to get a hold of anyone there. I’m looking at 32 Carlynton kids dressed ready to go on the field. They’re heartbroken right now.”</p>
<p>The scheduled WPIAL Class 2A Three Rivers Conference contest was the season opener for both Sto-Rox and Carlynton. Sto-Rox went 10-2 last season when it reached the WPIAL Class 1A championship game. Carlynton finished 3-7 a season ago.</p>
<p>Five WPIAL football teams were forced to postpone their season openers, all because of COVID-19 issues: Mt. Lebanon, Seneca Valley, Peters Township, Kiski Area and Serra Catholic.</p>
