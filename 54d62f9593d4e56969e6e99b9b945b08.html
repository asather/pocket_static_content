<h1>In right field, Gregory Polanco ‘working until I get that Gold Glove’</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. — Anybody who watched Gregory Polanco’s defense in right field last season might’ve grown a little frustrated.</p>
<p>Or worse.</p>
<p>Between his throws or mid-adventures when it came to PNC Park’s Clemente Wall, Polanco certainly had his share of issues. Far too often his immense talent has been obfuscated by lingering shoulder issues or the inability to make proper reads.</p>
<p>But speaking on Wednesday after the Pirates’ latest spring training loss, where Polanco played right field for the first time this spring, the 28-year-old expressed optimism regarding his ability to make defensive improvements.</p>
<p>Polanco even threw an interesting goal out there for himself.</p>
<p>“I don’t feel like I have to prove anything to anybody — just me,” Polanco said. “I have to keep working in the outfield. Now that I’m healthy, I can play with more confidence. Just be me out there. Stay aggressive and improve my defense. Every day I’m going to keep working until I get that Gold Glove.”</p>
<p>Will Polanco win a Gold Glove in 2020? Highly doubtful. But the Pirates would certainly settle for him playing around 130 games and looking serviceable out there, especially if he produces at the plate.</p>
<p>It was a relatively quiet day for Polanco, who smiled and said of right field, “That’s my place. It felt good to be back out there.”</p>
<p>Wednesday was actually big for Polanco in a couple ways. His defense was fine, as he fielded a single and caught a fly ball. But the bigger test might’ve been Polanco breaking up a double play with a hard slide into second base.</p>
<p>“That really stood out,” manager Derek Shelton said. “I think we were all a little cautious the first time he was going to take that first slide.”</p>
<p>It’s also worth monitoring a couple things with Polanco at the plate. One involves his plate discipline — how many balls he does or doesn’t chase that are out of the zone. That part has been really good thus far. Polanco has tracked everything very well.</p>
<p>He has also hit left-handers, including a lined shot off Martin Perez on Wednesday after Polanco found himself in an 0-2 hole. Polanco shortened up his swing and got the barrel of the bat on a 94-mph fastball from Perez.</p>
<p>“I stayed short and threw my hands to the ball,” Polanco said.</p>
<p>Added Shelton: “Really aggressive in a good way. … The consistency of his at-bats have stood out in a very positive way.”</p>
<p>The trick will be making sure Polanco remains confident in right, which Shelton thinks will occur the more innings Polanco logs in right.</p>
<p>“He has to play,” Shelton said. “The confidence is going to come with him being out there.”</p>
<p><strong>Injury updates</strong></p>
<p>Director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk offered a couple injury updates on Wednesday, with the biggest one being Chris Archer, who was&nbsp;scratched from his start Monday because of neck tightness but played catch on flat ground on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Tomczyk said Archer will play catch again soon, then throw a side session before they start talking about getting him back into games.&nbsp;Bottom line, it sounds like this isn’t anything serious.</p>
<p>“He has made nice strides in his recovery,” Tomczyk said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Erik Gonzalez, who broke his left foot in November, isn’t quite 100 percent, Tomczyk said. First-base coach Tarrik Brock picked up “a little bit of a limp or hiccup in [Gonzalez’] gait” during a video session, which has affected the strength and range of motion in the foot.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“We’re making sure that gets cleared before we progress him to 100-percent intensity baserunning drills, which we anticipate will happen in the near future, maybe this weekend or early next week,” Tomczyk said. “Once he does the full baserunning progression, we’ll have a conversation with [Shelton] about making a game schedule for him.”</span></p>
<p><strong>Keller’s high heat</strong></p>
<p>Mitch Keller threw 32 pitches on Wednesday, 21 of them for strikes. An especially pretty one was an 80 mph curveball that Keller used to strike out Marco Hernandez, but the more meaningful ones — at least to Keller — involved his fastball at the top of the strike zone.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Keller was pleased with his start against the Red Sox, the biggest reason being that he felt like he commanded his fastball at the top of the zone. He later said that it feels kind of unnatural to pitch up there, but he’s trying to adjust his approach because he knows he can get outs by pitching that way.</span></p>
<p>“It’s definitely an adjustment period right now,” Keller said. “I’m trying to figure out the feel of it, just getting comfortable with it. Before, a fastball at the top of the zone was a no-no. Now, the game has changed. I’m trying to utilize what’s best for me.”</p>
