<p>Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Tuesday that the Fed’s lending programs for medium-sized businesses and state and local governments would begin operating by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Powell said that while the Fed has received a “good deal of interest” in those programs, if not enough companies or state and local governments seek to borrow, the Fed would consider changes to them. That could include expanding their eligibility.</p>
<p>The chairman’s comments came before the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which is holding an oversight hearing Tuesday on the $2 trillion federal relief package approved in late March. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin is also testifying about the Treasury’s role in the government’s emergency relief programs.</p>
<p>The Fed’s Main Street Lending program, announced in March, will extend up to $600 billion in loans to companies with up to 15,000 employees. The Treasury has provided $75 billion to offset any losses from the loans, drawn from $454 billion that Congress provided Treasury to support Fed loans in the relief package.</p>
<p>Mnuchin said his department would accept losses from any Fed loans that would come out of that $454 billion. Mnuchin had previously said that the administration expected to recover all those funds. That observation had raised concerns that the Fed would adopt a cautious approach that would provide less financial support.</p>
<p>Under sharp questioning, Mnuchin also defended the administration’s support for reopening the economy in many states, which he said would be done safely.</p>
<p>Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, charged that the Trump administration was risking the lives of poorer workers in its efforts to boost the economy and financial markets.</p>
<p><strong>Payroll Protection Program</strong></p>
<p>Lawmakers from both parties have criticized the Payroll Protection Program, which initially provided $349 billion in forgivable loans to small companies but has been plagued by a host of problems. Many businesses were unable to get loans before the initial funding was exhausted. A second round of loans faced computer processing delays and a number of publicly traded companies ended up receiving money that Mnuchin demanded be paid back to the government.</p>
<p>Mnuchin said in prepared testimony that so far, the paycheck program has processed more than 4.2 million loans for over $530 billion “to keep tens of millions of hardworking Americans on the payroll.” The loans do not have to be paid back as long as the borrowing business uses 75% of the money to cover workers’ paychecks.</p>
<p>But many small firms say the terms are too onerous. To get the loans forgiven they have to rehire all their employees within eight weeks of receiving the funds, even if they have little business or work for them to do. These firms argue they may simply have to lay their workers off again at the end of the eight weeks, and have little money left to help them ramp up when business does return.</p>
<p>Mnuchin also said that the $1,200 stimulus checks from the relief package have added up to $240 billion in direct payments for millions of Americans, with a typical family of four receiving $3,400. Late Monday, Treasury said that this week it is sending out nearly four million payments on prepaid debit cards. The payments were approved in late March, though Treasury warned that it would take time to issue the funds to those without bank accounts.</p>
<p>On Monday, a separate congressional oversight panel said that the Fed and Treasury have spent very little of the $500 billion that Congress allocated to support businesses hurt by the coronavirus outbreak. The oversight panel also asked how the two agencies would evaluate the success of their programs.</p>
<p>For his part, Fed Chair Powell pledged to reveal the names and other details of the entities that borrow from the emergency programs the central bank has set up to offset the economic hit from the viral outbreak.</p>
<p>In his prepared testimony, Powell said the central bank will disclose the amounts borrowed and the interest rates it levies under its programs to provide credit for large corporations, state and local governments, and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>“We are deeply committed to transparency, and recognize that the need for transparency is heightened when we are called upon to use our emergency powers,” his testimony says.</p>
<p>The Fed had already pledged to publish the names of its borrowers from its Main Street Lending program, and some of its other lending efforts. The Main Street program, which has not yet been launched, has already attracted scrutiny from environmental groups, which charge that oil and gas drillers, most already heavily indebted, will use it as a lifeline.</p>
<p>In the 2008 financial crisis, the Fed faced widespread criticism for the opaque nature of the lending programs it launched. It has revived many of those programs to smooth the flow of credit in the current crisis.</p>
<p>Powell said the Fed will also name the companies that benefit from its two facilities that have started to purchase corporate debt, as well as its program to purchase municipal bonds and a facility that will buy securities backed by auto, student, and credit card loans.</p>
<p>The Fed chair also reiterated that central bank will use “our full range of tools to support the economy in this challenging time.” In a “60 Minutes” interview Sunday night, Powell said the Fed’s ability to support the financial markets and economy are essentially unlimited, helping to spark a stock market rally Monday.</p>
<p>In the “60 Minutes” interview, Powell also repeated his view that Congress and the Fed must be prepared to provide additional financial support to prevent long-term damage to the economy from widespread bankruptcies among small businesses and long-term unemployment. Congress has already approved roughly $3 trillion in rescue aid for individuals and businesses. But states and localities say they are in need of federal money to avoid having to cut jobs and services, and legislation to provide that money remains at an impasse in Congress.</p>
