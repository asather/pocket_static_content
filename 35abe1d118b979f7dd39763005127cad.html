<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man was transported to the hospital Monday evening after he was shot in Mount Oliver Borough.</p>
<p>Police responded to a Shotspotter alert near the 700 block of Brownsville Road around 6:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Officers found the male with gunshot wounds to his torso and legs and administered aid until EMS arrived and transported him to the hospital in critical condition.</p>
<p>Authorities said that the victim encountered the suspects in a parking lot on Brownsville Road, which led to an argument between them. One of the suspects then fired multiple shots at the victim, then the two fled in their car.</p>
<p>Shotspotter also detected shots fired near the 200 block of Alice Street around the same time. Alice Street is one block away from the 700 block of Brownsville Road, but police say it is still unclear if the two incidents are connected.</p>
<p>Police are investigating.</p>
