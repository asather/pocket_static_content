<p>ANAHEIM, Calif. — By now, Sam Lafferty is used to shuffling back and forth between the NHL club in Pittsburgh and Wilkes-Barre/Scranton. This season, the Penguins have already executed nine roster moves involving the rookie forward.</p>
<p>But as far as NHL call-ups go, Lafferty’s week might be the stuff of legend.</p>
<p>In less than 48 hours, Lafferty boarded three cross-country flights totaling more than 7,000 miles then suited up <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/27/Penguins-Kings-Western-Conference-losing-streak/stories/202002270118" target="_blank">in the Penguins’ 2-1 loss</a> Wednesday in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t too big of a deal, too surprising,” Lafferty said before Friday’s game against the Anaheim Ducks at Honda Center. “I was happy to come back.”</p>
<p>Lafferty flew with the Penguins on Sunday from Washington, D.C. to Los Angeles. Monday was the NHL’s trade deadline. After the Penguins acquired three new forwards in two separate trades that day, they sent Lafferty and Anthony Angello back to their American Hockey League affiliate in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p>
<p>The two rookies flew out of Los Angeles International Airport at 3 p.m. local time on Monday, landed late that night in Philadelphia then took a car service to Wilkes-Barre. They got in around 2:30 a.m. and several hours later suited up for practice there.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, back in Los Angeles, Jared McCann was hurting with an upper-body injury that caused him to miss Tuesday’s practice. With it looking as if McCann would be unavailable to face the Kings the next night, the team recalled Lafferty on an emergency basis. He found out around 5:30 p.m. Eastern.</p>
<p>“Honestly, it’s kind of back and forth throughout the year,” the Hollidaysburg native said. “So you kind of have to be ready for anything like that to happen.”</p>
<p>A car service drove him from Wilkes-Barre to Newark, where he got some shut-eye in a hotel. He then boarded at 7 a.m. flight back to LAX. It was still morning in Los Angeles when he got dropped off at the team hotel Wednesday.</p>
<p>One would think the 24-year-old should have been running on fumes by the time the 7:30 p.m. puck-drop rolled around out here. But he showed a surprising amount of juice, playing well in just less than six minutes of ice time.</p>
<p>“I actually felt pretty good. I don’t know,” he said. “I got in to L.A. pretty early so I picked up a few hours. It was pretty much just a normal game day from there.”</p>
<p>Yeah, sure, just a normal game day. Routine.</p>
