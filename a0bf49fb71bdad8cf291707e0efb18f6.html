<h1>Pitt, West Virginia extend men's basketball series through 2022-23</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Perhaps the most storied and bitter rival in the history of Pitt’s men’s basketball will appear on the Panthers’ schedule for at least two more years.</p>
<p>Pitt and West Virginia have signed a contract to extend their series through the 2022-23 season, tacking two years on to what was initially a four-game series that was set to end after the upcoming 2020-21 season, the universities announced Thursday. The 2021-22 game will take place in Morgantown, W.Va., before it moves to Pittsburgh for the 2022-23 contest.</p>
<p>The Panthers and Mountaineers have had 187 all-time meetings, and West Virginia is Pitt’s most-played opponent. West Virginia holds a 99-88 advantage in those games and has won each of the past four matchups, including a 68-53 victory last season at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>“The Pitt-West Virginia rivalry is one of the best in the country,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said in a statement. “Backyard Brawl says all you need to know about the intensity and energy around these games. Coach [Bob] Huggins is an outstanding coach and has built a terrific program in Morgantown. We look forward to continuing the rivalry and building on the great tradition of the Backyard Brawl.”</p>
<p>Following the schools’ departures from the Big East — with Pitt going to the ACC and West Virginia to the Big 12 — the two programs, separated by only about 75 miles, didn’t play for nearly six years, from February 2012 until December 2017. Both sides agreed to a four-game contract in 2016. The final game of that original deal will take place Nov. 13 at WVU Coliseum.</p>
<p>With the original contract set to run out after the 2020 meeting, there was some question about whether the series would continue, especially as Duquesne, once a fixture on the Panthers’ slate, has been excluded from their schedule for two consecutive seasons.</p>
<p>Pitt and West Virginia play in a number of other sports already, with the schools’ football programs set to renew their storied rivalry in 2022. When that’s combined with the history and passion between their men’s basketball programs, to say nothing of the interest a matchup between them generates during what’s otherwise a nondescript stretch of the college basketball season, it makes the series’ continuation that much more sensible.</p>
<p>“I don’t know why we don’t play every sport,” Huggins said following last year’s game. “If we played baseball every year, we’d end up having a good baseball rivalry. They’d end up drawing more people here, we’d end up drawing more people there, what’s wrong with that? That’s probably why I’m not an AD.”</p>
