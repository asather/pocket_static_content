<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The search on a property in Westmoreland County for the remains of a woman who disappeared in 2018 has thus far proved unsuccessful, police said on Thursday.</p>
<p>Police and volunteers from neighboring areas converged on the property along White Fence Lane in Unity Township on Wednesday to search for the body of Cassandra Gross of Latrobe. The property belongs to the mother of Ms. Gross’ ex-boyfriend, Thomas Stanko.</p>
<p>“We did not find human remains, but we did find a few items that we will send out for further analysis,” Pennsylvania State Trooper Stephen Limani said. “The search should conclude by this evening.”</p>
<p>Trooper Limani said on Wednesday that police received information that gave them reason to search the property.</p>
<p>No one has been charged in the case.</p>
