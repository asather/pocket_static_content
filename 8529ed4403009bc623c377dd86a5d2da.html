<h1>Pitt falters late to lose to N.C. State, 77-73</h1>

<p>RALEIGH, N.C. -- There was no mincing words for Au’Diese Toney, no delicate phrasing when it came to describing his Pitt team’s 23-point loss Wednesday against Syracuse and the feeling that latched on to each and every Panthers player in the days that followed it.</p>
<p>“It was an embarrassment,” the sophomore forward said.</p>
<p>In a strange way that’s maybe indicative of the low expectations the blowout loss to the Orange created for the rest of the season, Pitt found some relief from that agony Saturday.</p>
<p>It fell to N.C. State, 77-73, losing control late of a game it very easily could have, and perhaps should have, won. The Panthers played with aggression, focus and tenacity, looking much like the team they were for the majority of the 28 games that preceded Saturday’s. Though they ultimately lost, they controlled long stretches of the game, leading for more than 30 of a possible 40 minutes. Against the Orange, they folded. Against the Wolfpack, they fought.</p>
<p>Because of that, they found themselves in a remarkably similar position to where they were one month earlier and 22 miles to the northwest, when they lost a closely contested road game against a top-10 Duke team. In both instances, Toney played extremely well, posting the two highest-scoring games of his career. In each of those matchups, they provided some measure of hope. In the first of those, it was that they were capable of competing with one of the best teams in the country in one of the sport’s most hostile road environments. In the second, it was that they were not to be left for dead, at least not yet.</p>
<p>Yet, to Pitt coach Jeff Capel and his players, it isn’t enough. It’s notable, maybe even commendable, that it moved on from the misery that had gripped it earlier in the week. But to hyper-competitive individuals measured by wins and losses, Saturday was another loss in a season in which such setbacks have added up rapidly.</p>
<p>“I’m excited for his [Toney’s] success, but it doesn’t matter because we lost both games,” Capel said. “That doesn’t matter to me, if a guy has 20-plus points. As a program and as individuals, we have to get away from that. The bottom line is we have to win basketball games.”</p>
<p>The loss was the Panthers’ sixth in a row and ninth in their past 11 games. That slide has dropped them to 15-15, the first time they’ve had a non-winning record since Nov. 18. Additionally, it was their ninth-consecutive loss against N.C. State, with their last win coming in Jan. 2014. The past five of those losses have been close, decided by a combined 22 points.</p>
<p>Those numbers paint a disconcerting picture, both for where Pitt has been and where it is now. But the most recent of those losses, given the circumstances preceding it, offered some consolation.</p>
<p>N.C. State stood as an unappealing matchup for the Panthers, not only because of their grotesque loss fewer than three full days earlier, but because a team that has struggled on the road this season, going just 1-7 against ACC opponents, was tasked with going up against an opponent that, after a loss earlier in the week to North Carolina, was fighting desperately for its NCAA tournament life.</p>
<p>What was a potential nightmare on paper was much more favorable in practice, at least for much of the afternoon.</p>
<p>After vacillating between disastrous, frustrating and hopeless during its previous five games, Pitt turned in its best offense showing in more than a month. It connected on 47.3% of its field goals and 42.9% of its 3-pointers, and, led by 24 points from Toney, averaged more than one point per possession in a game for the first time in three weeks.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know what we were going to get tonight,” Capel said. “For me, it was exciting to see the team that we looked like for most of the season.”</p>
<p>That offensive output, however, faltered in the game’s most crucial stretch. Over a stretch of 7:51 in the game’s final eight minutes, the Panthers made only one field goal (on nine attempts). During that time, the Wolfpack outscored them, 22-8, and turned a six-point deficit into an eight-point advantage. Both in those final minutes and throughout the game, they were sunk by poor free-throw shooting, making just 15 of their 27 attempts (55.6%) after coming into the day shooting 72% from the line this season.</p>
<p>For Pitt, a team seemingly incapable of playing a full game without enduring such a drought, it was an uncomfortably familiar sequence of events.</p>
<p>“Body language, you can see it,” Capel said. “They’re frustrated. Sometimes, it affects our defense.”</p>
<p>In those instances, players feel what their coach sees. The Panthers are still a relatively young group, with three sophomores and a freshman accounting for the team’s four leading scorers, but the five players on the court for almost the entirety of the game’s final 12:29 have played a combined 327 games in their college careers, an average of about 65 each.</p>
<p>They still struggle, though, working through those moments when the shots stop falling.</p>
<p>“At times, we still have that mental lapse and still have the freshman stage going in, where we are all acting like we’re freshmen when we’re really not,” Toney said. “We should be acting more mature.”</p>
<p>When asked after the game what exactly changed with his team in the days following the Syracuse loss, Capel said he didn’t know. Little about the Panthers’ routine was altered. Aside from a weight-lifting session, they were off Thursday and had a light practice Friday, with a noon tip-off looming the following day.</p>
<p>Players could see changes elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Dudes just started trusting each other a lot more,” said forward Eric Hamilton, who had 10 points and 10 rebounds. “Dudes trusted someone was going to be there to help them. We started communicating more and stopped caring about who is taking the shot or who gets the credit as much as just listen to coach Cape’s gameplan.”</p>
<p>If Pitt can be something close to what it was Saturday for the rest of the season, short as that period of time is, it would be a positive development. It’s still highly unlikely this team, at .500, qualifies for even the National Invitation Tournament, but strong showings against Georgia Tech next Wednesday and in the ACC tournament the following week could bring an end to its current losing streak. At the very least, it could generate some small sense of contentment heading into an offseason in which changes to the team’s roster look increasingly probable.</p>
<p>The first step in that process has been completed. Something had to change after the debacle against Syracuse and on Saturday, albeit in a losing effort, it did.</p>
<p>“It was just a big wake-up call,” Toney said. “Like coach says, nobody is going to give you anything. That’s what happened. We took it for granted.”</p>
