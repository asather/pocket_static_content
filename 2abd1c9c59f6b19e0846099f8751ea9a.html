<h1>City staffs will wear masks to help prevent COVID-19 spread</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The city said it will be issuing facemasks to staff who have contact with the public. That includes police, firefighters, paramedics, animal control officers, park rangers, and personnel from the following departments: public works; mobility and infrastructure; permits, licenses and inspections; and parks and recreation.</p>
<p>The masks will be worn following recommendations issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Gov. Tom Wolf, according to a statement released Wednesday by the Department of Public Safety. They&nbsp;will help&nbsp;“reduce the amount of potentially infectious droplets expelled by the wearer, thereby protecting anyone the mask-wearer encounters.”</p>
<p>“We’ve got to model this practice for everybody else,” police Chief Scott Schubert said in the release. “If everyone does their part and wears a mask, we might be able to stop this virus even quicker.”</p>
