<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania residents will soon be able to select a non-binary gender designation option on their drivers licenses and photo identification cards.</p>
<p>PennDOT announced Thursday that gender designation options for licenses and photo ID cards include “X” for non-binary in addition to&nbsp;“M” for male and “F” for female. Customers can change their gender designation by filling out form DL-32 and submitting it in person to a PennDOT license center.</p>
<p>There is no requirement for a medical or social service provider to sign off on the change and there is no charge for the non-binary designation.</p>
<p>“Our identity documents are critical to how we navigate the world, and having an affirming and accurate ID is critical for access to employment, healthcare, housing and so much more,” said PennDOT Secretary Yassmin Gramian in a press release.</p>
<p>“Offering equitable and inclusive services for all Pennsylvanians is central to PennDOT’s mission, and I'm proud that we’re taking this step.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania is the 17th state to offer a non-binary gender designation.</p>
<p>“PennDOT is taking a very important step towards better serving Pennsylvanians of all gender identities. By removing barriers to make these changes, we are providing Pennsylvanians the agency to live their lives as their true selves,” said Rafael Álvarez Febo, Executive Director for the Pennsylvania Commission on LGBTQ Affairs in the release.</p>
<p>“Your state issued ID is quite possibly the most important identity document you use on a daily basis, it should reflect your truth,” he said.</p>
