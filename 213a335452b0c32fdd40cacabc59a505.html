<h1>Arrest by officer at Squirrel Hill farmers market to be reviewed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Office of Municipal Investigations will examine the arrest of a man by an off-duty Pittsburgh police officer at a farmers market in Squirrel Hill on Sunday, a city official said.</p>
<p>An altercation began when the man, identified in court documents as Daniel Holc, 22, approached and questioned Officer Paul Abel because the officer was wearing a mask depicting the “thin blue line” version of the American flag.</p>
<p>Following an argument, Officer Abel arrested Mr. Holc after threatening to use his Taser on him, according to a press release by Pittsburgh Public Safety officials.</p>
<p>In response to public questioning on Twitter after videos of the arrest appeared on social media, Mayor Bill Peduto’s chief of staff Dan Gilman tweeted on Tuesday that the case had been referred to the Office of Municipal Investigations for review.</p>
<p>The OMI reviews conduct violation complaints of city employees, such as police officers, firefighters and building inspectors.</p>
<p>According to the public safety release, Officer Abel was working an approved off-duty detail at the farmers market for the city’s Office of Special Events on Sunday when Mr. Holc, who was exiting the farmers market, approached him, saying that his mask was disrespectful to the American flag.</p>
<p>Officer Abel, who was speaking to a Special Events employee at the time, told Mr. Holc that “he would have to agree to disagree,” the press release said.</p>
<p>When asked to leave, Mr. Holc “became agitated and raised his voice, tried to engage the officer further about the flag, and continued to refuse to move,” according to the press release.</p>
<p>Officer Abel asked for Mr. Holc’s identification multiple times, the release said, but Mr. Holc refused, continued to block the exit and began shouting profanities.</p>
<p>“At this point the officer moved to physically arrest the male, who resisted, knocking the officer’s body worn camera into the street in the process,” the press release said. “The male continued to resist arrest so the officer told him he would use his Taser if he did not comply. At that point, the man complied and put his hands behind his back to be handcuffed.”</p>
<p>Several videos posted to social media taken by bystanders depict the latter portion of the fracas, with Mr. Holc holding up his hands as Officer Abel points his Taser at him and then detains him.</p>
<p>In the video, Mr. Holc repeatedly asks Officer Abel if he is being arrested and what crime he committed. Officer Abel eventually tells him “for failure to disperse.”</p>
<p>Officer Abel then retrieved Mr. Holc’s I.D. from his wallet and searched his backpack, where he discovered marijuana, THC edibles and drug paraphernalia, the press release said.</p>
<p>In 2008 Officer Abel was arrested after he allegedly pistol-whipped a man in the back of the head with his firearm near a bar on the South Side while he was off-duty. The gun then went off, wounding the man in his hand.</p>
<p>Officer Abel was charged with aggravated assault, reckless endangerment and driving under the influence due to the incident and was suspended without pay from the force.</p>
<p>He was cleared of all charges in June 2009 by Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey A. Manning, and his job was later reinstated after arbitration.</p>
<p>Mr. Holc is charged with trespassing and disorderly conduct, according to court documents, and also faces drug charges. His&nbsp;preliminary hearing is set for Oct. 5.</p>
