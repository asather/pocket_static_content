<h1>Cranberry moves to open parks and recreation facilities</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cranberry will open several of its parks and recreational facilities Wednesday, following Butler County’s entrance into the yellow phase of Pennsylvania’s three-tiered reopening plan, according to a township release.</p>
<p>Due to the gradual nature of reopening during the novel coronavirus pandemic, Cranberry’s Community, Graham, Municipal Center and North Boundary parks will still have certain areas closed with signage posted.</p>
<p>For example, at Community Park, the following facilities will remain closed: the athletic fields, including CP North Field; the baseball field restrooms; the kids castle playground; the Rotary Amphitheater; the Rotary and Lion shelters; and the gates to the rear of the park.</p>

<p>Several areas are open only for unstructured free play. No structured team play is permitted.</p>
<p>Details on the potential reopening of the township’s community water park are forthcoming as well as the township’s summer camp program, Camp Cranberry.</p>
<p>Township Manager Jerry Andree said the water park would be open no later than July 1 as Cranberry rushes&nbsp;“to get facilities ready under tighter sanitation and social distancing guidelines.”</p>
<p>“We may be opening earlier than that,” he added.</p>
<p>Mr. Andree said opening the water park was considered a possibility after Gov. Tom Wolf indicated outdoor community pools could reopen under the yellow phase if they followed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Other amenities to open include Graham Park’s fishing pond, dek hockey field and horseshoe pits; Municipal Center Park’s skate park; and North Boundary Park’s disc golf course. Community gardens and the Rotary dog park will also reopen.</p>
<p>Mr. Andree said the decision to partially open facilities was discussed between the department of public works, parks and recreation, and the township manager’s office, stressing that throughout the process they’ve been in communication with the board of supervisors.</p>
<p>As Butler County transitions to the green phase of the reopening plan, closed portions of the park are expected to reopen.</p>
<p>“Obviously, the public is anxious to return to the outdoors,” Mr. Andree said.&nbsp;“We’re doing our best to meet the governor’s expectations.”</p>
