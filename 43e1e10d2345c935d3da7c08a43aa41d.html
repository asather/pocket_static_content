<h1>Obituary: Robert 'Woody' Widenhofer, former Steelers assistant coach, coached all-time greats </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert “Woody” Widenhofer, a Butler native and a four-time Super Bowl-winning coach with the Steelers, died Sunday in Colorado Springs, Colo. He was 77 and died from complications from a stroke.</p>
<p>Widenhofer worked for the Steelers from 1973-83, serving first as linebackers coach and then defensive coordinator over the final five seasons of his tenure. He took over as defensive coordinator in 1979, the year the Steelers won their fourth Super Bowl title in six years.</p>
<p>Though aging in ’79, the Steelers’ defense remained one of the best in the NFL under Widenhofer’s leadership. They were fifth in the NFL in points against and fourth against the run.</p>
<p>The Steelers made the playoffs in three of his five seasons as defensive coordinator.</p>
<p>“Woody played an important role coaching our famed Steel Curtain defense when he helped us win four Super Bowls in the 1970s,” Steelers president Art Rooney II said in a statement. “He coached some of the best linebackers in NFL history during his time in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Before assuming controls of the Steelers defense, Widenhofer coached Hall of Famers Jack Lambert and Jack Ham, two cornerstones to the 1970s Steelers dynasty. He also coached the likes of Andy Russell, Robin Cole, Dirt Winston and Loren Toews, all members of a linebackers corps that helped the defense dominate the opposition throughout the decade.</p>
<p>Russell was a seven-time Pro Bowl selection and was named All-Pro in 1976. Cole was named All-Pro in 1984, one year after Widenhofer departed, but he was a mainstay on the Super Bowl XIII and XIV teams.</p>
<p>“We had talent everywhere,” said Cole, who was drafted in the first round of the 1977 draft as Russell’s replacement after he retired. “Woody was a player’s coach. He was only 34 years old when I got there. He enjoyed being around the players.”</p>
<p>It’s long forgotten, but Hall of Fame head coach Chuck Noll had three different defensive coordinators on those four Super Bowl teams. Bud Carson was the coordinator for Super Bowls IX and X. George Perles was the coordinator for Super Bowl XIII and Widenhofer for Super Bowl XIV after Perles took on the duties to be Noll’s assistant head coach.</p>
<p>“They learned from Bud, and they had their own ideas,” Cole said. “They all worked together and learned from one another.”</p>
<p>Widenhofer left the Steelers in 1984 to become the head coach of the Oklahoma Outlaws in the USFL. In his only season with the Outlaws, he was 6-12.</p>
<p>Widenhofer moved on to become the head coach at Missouri from 1985-88 and Vanderbilt from 1997-2001, with stints in between as an assistant with the Detroit Lions and Cleveland Browns.</p>
<p>His record as a college coach was 27-71-1. He was 12-31-1 at Missouri, his alma mater, and 15-40 at Vanderbilt. Even though his college teams struggled to win, his defenses ranked among the best in the SEC during his tenure at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>Widenhofer finished his coaching career in 2007 as the defensive coordinator at New Mexico State.</p>
<p>Widenhofer was born in Butler, but he was raised in suburban Detroit. He played linebacker at Missouri from 1964-67 and got his start in coaching at Michigan State.</p>
