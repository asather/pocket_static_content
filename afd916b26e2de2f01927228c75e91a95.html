<h1>In Allegheny County, new COVID-19 cases soar above 200</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time since Allegheny County reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 in mid-March, the single-day increase of new positive cases has eclipsed 200.</p>
<p>The county health department on Thursday reported an increase of 233 new cases, giving it a total 3,103 since March 14. This is the third day in a row the county has seen an increase in the triple digits.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania had an increase of 338 cases. The region’s second-highest daily increase was Westmoreland County, which reported 36 new cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“While an increase in the number of cases was expected — this is larger than expected,” Allegheny County health officials said in a news release. “The expectation is that the numbers will also significantly increase again tomorrow. Wearing masks, washing your hands and maintaining physical distance from others is absolutely essential to keep our community safe — now more than ever.”</p>
<p>Allegheny’s new cases involve individuals who range in age from 6 months to 99 years old, with the median age being 29 years old.</p>
<p>There were zero additional deaths in the county, keeping the total at 187. The state health department is reporting 188 deaths.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania saw an increase of 25 deaths, only one of which — in Beaver County —&nbsp;was in Western Pennsylvania. The statewide death toll is now 6,712, according to data from the state.</p>
<p>Data released by the county shows that there were four additional hospitalizations, bringing the total number to 401.</p>
<p>In the county briefing on Wednesday, Debra Bogen, the director of the county health department, noted that hospitalization numbers are starting to “creep up” with 13 in just the last three days. Seven of those 13 hospitalizations were people in their 20s or 30s.</p>
<p>The majority of the new cases in Allegheny County fall within two categories: people who had recently traveled outside the county, or people who had been frequenting bars and restaurants.</p>
<p>Dr. Bogen recommends a 14-day self-quarantine for people who have traveled to hot spots such as the Carolinas or various beaches in Florida.</p>
<p>The state saw an increase of 832 new cases of the virus, bringing the total to 88,074. In an effort to slow down the rise in cases, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/07/01/pa-masks-required-anyone-who-leaves-home-covid-19-cases-increase-pennsylvania/stories/202007010145" target="_blank">state made mask wearing a requirement</a> anytime someone leaves their house, rather than just inside businesses.</p>
