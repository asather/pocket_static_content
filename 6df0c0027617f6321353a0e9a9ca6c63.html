<h1>Ohio medical board: Being Browns, Bengals fan not painful enough to treat with medical pot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A proposal to ease the pain of being a Browns or Bengals fan went up in smoke Wednesday.</p>
<p>The State Medical Board of Ohio formed a four-doctor committee that met earlier today to determine if certain conditions should be added to the official list in state law that can qualify someone for treatment via medical marijuana.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the committee <a href="https://www.toledoblade.com/local/politics/2020/02/12/No-pot-relief-in-sight-for-Bengals-Browns-fans/stories/20200212139" target="_blank">chose three new conditions</a> — autism, anxiety, and <a href="https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/coping/physically/diet-problems/types/cachexia" target="_blank">cachexia wasting</a> — that will make it to the next round of consideration, according to The Blade of Toledo, Ohio.</p>
<p>That’s good news for those suffering from these afflictions, but less fortunate for the many Ohio residents who have a bad case of another condition the committee rejected (along with 12 others) for further debate: “Brown-Bengal syndrome,” as the Blade’s Jim Provance put it.</p>
<p>In addition to deciding medical marijuana was ultimately not a reasonable way to treat real issues like depression, insomnia or opioid disorder, the committee also determined that it was not a sufficient remedy for being a Browns or Bengals fan either. Many fans of those teams would probably beg to differ.</p>
<p>For anyone wondering, Ohio law currently allows for those diagnosed with 21 conditions to ask physicians for permission to seek out medical marijuana, including Alzheimer’s disease, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy or other seizure disorders, glaucoma, hepatitis C, multiple sclerosis, chronic or intractable pain, sickle cell anemia, Tourette’s syndrome and traumatic brain injury, according to the Blade.</p>
<p>Rooting for the Browns and Bengals was unanimously rejected as a potential addition to that list.</p>
<p>“Likely someone's idea of a joke, the online sports fan proposal made no attempt at scientific justification, although others might argue there’s plenty of anecdotal evidence out there,” the Blade’s Provance wrote.</p>
<p>The Browns and Bengals have had a rough few years. Cleveland went 0-16 in 2017, and had the No. 1 overall pick in that year’s NFL Draft and the next. Cincinnati only won two games last season, and will have the No. 1 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>If you combined the Browns’ and Bengals’ wins from last season — six and two, respectively — you would get the number of wins the Steelers had in 2019. Pittsburgh beat the Bengals twice and the Browns once last year, with that loss to Cleveland culminating in the now-infamous melee between Steelers quarterback Mason Rudolph and Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, who was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/02/12/myles-garrett-reinstatement-browns-mason-rudolph-helmet/stories/202002120109" target="_blank">just reinstated by the NFL</a> today after his long suspension stemming from that incident.</p>
<p>Maybe the Browns and Bengals will be competitive enough next year that their fan bases won’t have to literally petition the Ohio medical board for access to a substance that may ease their sports fan sorrow — at least temporarily.</p>
