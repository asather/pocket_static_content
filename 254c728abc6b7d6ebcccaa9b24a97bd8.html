<h1>Who opens a boutique during a pandemic?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Beth Buenaventura signed a lease March 1 to relocate her women’s boutique Fresh Nostalgia from <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/fashion/2019/10/21/Pittsburgh-fashion-new-boutiques-fashion-clothing-shopping/stories/201910210011" target="_blank">a tiny storefront tucked away on Graeme Street</a> in Market Square to a more spacious one on Sixth Street in Downtown’s Cultural District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then COVID-19 happened.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I probably could have just gone back and said,&nbsp;‘I’ve got to pull the reins on this,’ but I’m a risk-taker by nature.</p>
<p>“With all the people living Downtown, there is an opportunity to succeed,” Ms. Buenaventura says. “I’m determined to be one of those people.”</p>
<p>One in three small businesses has shuttered because of the pandemic, according to a Small Business Majority survey of 500 business owners nationwide. Nine out of 10 said the new coronavirus had negatively impacted their business in some way.</p>
<p>Yet a handful of local clothing retailers have gone ahead with expansion plans despite slumping sales and soaring unemployment.</p>
<p>Uncertainties surrounding COVID-19 didn’t cause Annä Ben­civenga to put the brakes on moving and upsizing Urbana in Oakmont. Earlier this month, the boutique moved a couple doors down to 632 Allegheny River Blvd. Previously, it split a storefront with Moonbeam Cafe.</p>
<p>“Now I have an entire storefront to myself, and the setup is really good,” Ms. Bencivenga said. “I needed my own space so I can have the amount of inventory I need to properly serve my customers.”</p>
<p>She also spruced up her e-commerce site, <a href="https://shop-urbana.com/" target="_blank">shop-urbana.com</a>, and plans to begin offering shopping by appointment in the new space in June. She said Urbana’s grand reopening will be held when Allegheny County enters the green phase, the least restrictive category of Gov. Tom Wolf’s tiered reopening plan for businesses.</p>
<p>“I want to make it really affordable for people, stuff that can transition into the fall so they don’t feel badly buying something,” Ms. Bencivenga says. “My hope is that post-COVID, people will realize they really do like going out to a physical store and interacting with people.”</p>
<p>Renee Kostas saw the pandemic as a chance to cultivate new opportunities for her clothing delivery business based in Brookline.&nbsp;In 2017, she launched Posh Local as an Instagram page and it evolved into an e-commerce site, <a href="https://www.poshlocalpgh.com/shop" target="_blank">poshlocalpgh.com</a>, a year later. Those who live locally are eligible for same-day delivery.</p>
<p>She opened a brick-and-mortar showroom last summer where shoppers could pick up orders or browse women’s clothing and accessories in person.&nbsp;From the beginning, shoppers asked: What about a men’s line?</p>
<p>“I thought adding men’s and unisex options would be a great way to expand, and with the showroom closed, it would be a good time to test the waters,” Ms. Kostas says.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, she launched the men’s business as Proper Local (<a href="https://www.theproperlocal.com/" target="_blank">theproperlocal.com</a>). It features streetwear apparel and everyday basics starting at $28. Same-day delivery is available for those who live within a 15-mile radius of the showroom.&nbsp;The goal is to add new items once a month and grow slowly from there.</p>
<p>“It’s been going pretty well,”&nbsp;Ms. Kostas says. “The COVID-19 pandemic hasn’t really slowed us down, thankfully. I’ve thought of it as a great opportunity to pivot.”</p>
<p>The women’s fashion chain Versona opened a store this month at The Waterfront in Homestead. It’s one of five stores it’s unveiling this spring in Indiana, Nebraska, Ohio and Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Versona promises to be a fun shopping experience where women can find unique, on-trend styles at a great value,” John Cato, president and CEO of The Cato Corp., said in a prepared statement. A store representative wasn’t immediately available for comment.</p>
<p>Ms. Buenaventura hopes to open Fresh Nostalgia’s doors at 143 6th St., Downtown, in June, possibly starting out with appointments only.&nbsp;When the governor’s office ordered non-essential businesses to close in mid-March, she shifted her focus to spotlighting inventory on Facebook livestreams and curating specialty boxes for Mother’s Day. She describes the shop’s aesthetic as “fashion for the creative professional.”</p>
<p>“I’ve definitely noticed my loyal customers <a href="https://freshnostalgia.com/" target="_blank">have shopped with me</a> ... and that definitely helped my sales during that month,” she says. “Now I’m trying to balance my time between that and the end stages of getting the shop ready.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Buenaventura&nbsp;had a fashion truck in storage that she is using for moving. She is considering bringing private shopping experiences to people’s homes when it’s safe to do so.</p>
<p>“Foot traffic is going to be very different Downtown for a long time,” she says. “I’m still determined to grow the brand and do what I can to really supplement that with online sales.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
