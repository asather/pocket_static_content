<h1>Sidney Crosby won't play in Vegas, but it appears his return isn't far off</h1>

<p>LAS VEGAS&nbsp;— Sidney Crosby was not in the lineup Tuesday against the Vegas Golden Knights. But given how hard he appeared to be pushing himself during his on-ice workout Tuesday morning, it appears his return isn’t far off.</p>
<p>The captain skated with injured teammates Nick Bjugstad and Justin Schultz and coaches Ty Hennes and Matt Cullen before the team’s morning skate.</p>
<p>At one point, he jokingly asked, “Do you got a defibrillator on the bench?”</p>
<p>Later, Crosby lamented how sloppy they were executing their current drill.</p>
<p>After 45 minutes, Crosby and Bjugstad made way for the Zamboni. Crosby would keep his gear on and join the rest of the Penguins for the morning skate but did not do much, watching as the guys who will suit up against the Golden Knights did line rushes and practiced special teams.</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan was asked if it was conceivable that Crosby could play on this trip. The Penguins will visit Colorado on Friday and then Arizona on Sunday.</p>
<p>“Anything’s conceivable,” the coach replied. “We’re just trying to take each day as it comes and make the best decisions to allow for the rehab process to take place. And when Sid is ready to play, we’ll insert him into the lineup.”</p>
<p>Sullivan said Crosby won’t play until “he’s comfortable and confident that he can be at his best.” The next step is practicing without contact restrictions. The team will practice Wednesday in Las Vegas and Thursday in Denver. It won’t be a surprise if he sheds the non-contract jersey one of those days.</p>
<p>Twice last week, Crosby, who had sports hernia surgery Nov. 14, practiced with the team then cautioned reporters that his return was not imminent.</p>
<p>“I just have to be able to do contact.&nbsp;… But I’m not ready for that yet,” he said Friday. “Until then, I’ll probably flip-flop between doing my own stuff [or] skating with the injured guys and going with the team, depending on the practice.”</p>
<p>It was noteworthy that one of “the injured guys” on this trip is Schultz, who has been out with a lower-body injury since Dec. 17. Sullivan said Schultz first got back on the ice Monday in Pittsburgh before the Penguins departed. A day later in Vegas, the defenseman cautiously skated for about a half hour.</p>
<p><strong>Euros awed by ‘fairy tale land’</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins arrived Monday evening and will be in town until Thursday morning. For Europeans Marcus Pettersson and Dominik Kahun, Las Vegas is unlike anything they have back home in their respective countries.</p>
<p>Pettersson, a Swede who previously played for the Anaheim Ducks, has been here a few times now. But he still calls dibs on a window seat on the way in.</p>
<p>“To have it out here in the desert, I think it’s pretty cool flying in here and you see all the mountains and the canyons. It’s crazy,” he said. “Right in the middle of nowhere there’s this crazy place, this fairy tale land. It’s a cool place.”</p>
<p>Kahun, in Vegas for the second time, isn’t sure if he would want to live here, with all the hustle and bustle. But the Czech-born German native likes visiting.</p>
<p>“It feels like it’s awake all the time,” Kahun said. “When I came from breakfast today to the bus, everybody was at the casino already and just playing.”</p>
<p>Both said they enjoyed playing here because the fans are bonkers.</p>
<p>“You can see the fan base that the Golden Knights have,” Pettersson said. “It was a great idea for the NHL to expand here and create a little bit of buzz.”</p>
<p><strong>Agozzino in Penguins lineup</strong></p>
<p>Andrew Agozzino, recalled Monday by the Penguins, was in the lineup against the Golden Knights. To open Tuesday’s game at T-Mobile Arena, he was between Alex Galchenyuk and Sam Lafferty on the fourth line.</p>
<p>Agozzino previously played one game for the Penguins this season, back in October. Well, he hardly played. He logged less than two minutes of ice time and was benched after his line allowed a goal. Afterward, the Penguins returned the 29-year-old to Wilkes-Barre/Scranton of the American Hockey League.</p>
<p>Agozzino has 14 goals and 17 assists in 35 games at the AHL level and last week was selected as Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s lone All-Star representative.</p>
<p>Lafferty, who sat out two games over the weekend due to an illness, returned to the lineup Tuesday. Joseph Blandisi was the healthy scratch up front.</p>
<p><strong>Around the boards</strong></p>
<p>Despite losing his past two starts, Tristan Jarry was in goal Tuesday, with Marc-Andre Fleury the starting goalie for Vegas. … The only tweak that Sullivan made to the lineup was the new-look fourth line. Kahun skated with Evgeni Malkin and Bryan Rust for a second consecutive game. … Kris Letang, who acknowledged he had “a bad one” in Sunday’s loss to Florida, was one of the last players off the ice after the morning skate ended.</p>
