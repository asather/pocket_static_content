<h1>Penguins on pause: The good and bad of Jack Johnson's second season in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>We need to get a few things out of the way here before we evaluate veteran defenseman Jack Johnson’s second season with the Penguins.</p>
<p>One, Johnson’s contract is not among the very worst in hockey, and it is far from crippling. Johnson had a salary of $3.25 million in the second year of his five-year pact. There were 101 blue liners with higher cap hits in 2019-20.</p>
<p>Two, advanced stats are useful but don’t paint a complete picture of a player.</p>
<p>Three, the Penguins like having Johnson around. Obviously, he’s not untouchable. His name was among those bandied about last offseason as they tried to find a deal to duck under the cap ceiling. But they feel he can be a useful, winning player when slotted properly in their lineup. Plus, character still matters.</p>
<p>Some folks will quickly dismiss that. Their minds have been made up since July 1, 2018. Johnson could dive face-first in front of a slap shot heading for a basket of kittens and they would still complain that the cute, cuddly furballs had a negative relative Corsi while on the ice with Johnson at 5-on-5.</p>
<p>All that said, yeah, performance matters, and Johnson was again a weak link on Pittsburgh’s blue line. Only Justin Schultz had a worse plus-minus than Johnson, who was a minus-1. Johnson’s advanced stats were again unfavorable.</p>
<p>The Penguins had a shot share of 47.0% with Johnson on the ice at 5-on-5, per Natural Stat Trick. That was last among Penguins defensemen and ranked 160th out of 197 qualifiers across the NHL. Opponents earned 54.7% of the high-danger chances, another figure where Johnson ranks toward the bottom.</p>
<p>And his presence on the top pair was a factor in the team’s February swoon.</p>
<p>But when the Penguins were healthy-ish and could play Johnson on their third pair, he fared OK and a bit better than his first season, even if the numbers don’t necessarily show it. He looked a tad more mobile, brought physicality to the back end and was a key cog on the league’s 10th-ranked penalty kill.</p>
<p>He also emerged as a leader while the three guys with letters on the front of their sweaters were out. Behind the scenes, Johnson was said to be a valuable resource for young Penguins defensemen John Marino and Marcus Pettersson.</p>
<p>So while he is far from a perfect player, the Penguins don’t think he is as big as a problem as outsiders who wish to march to Jim Rutherford’s house and, armed with torches and spreadsheets, demand Johnson be traded to Jupiter.</p>

<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> In the final game before the pause, a 5-2 win in New Jersey on March 10, Johnson was on the ice while the Penguins killed off a 5-on-3 power play that lasted 102 seconds. Shortly after that, Evgeni Malkin scored to put the Penguins up, 3-1, and propel them to much-needed victory.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> When Johnson and Schultz were teamed up at 5-on-5, the Penguins had a shot share of 44.5% and earned just 36.2% of the high-danger chances. Both those rates rank worst among Johnson’s partners.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Coach Mike Sullivan must decide whether to keep Johnson and Schultz together or split them up. What would be more beneficial, three balanced pairs or a top-heavy top four? Either way, it is likely Johnson will play as the team clearly doesn’t have much trust in Juuso Riikola.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Johnson, who turned 33 in January, is under contract for three more seasons. You can’t rule out a trade, especially if the cap goes down due to the financial shortfall related to the loss of NHL games. But it takes two to tango. If the Penguins want to move on, it probably won’t be easy.</p>
