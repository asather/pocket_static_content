<h1>Judge sets new deadlines for defense in trial of accused Tree of Life shooter</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The federal judge overseeing the capital case of accused synagogue shooter Robert Bowers on Tuesday imposed new deadlines next month for the defense to file pre-trial motions.</p>
<p>The defense team had filed a motion this week asking for a delay because of virus-related issues but the prosecution objected, saying the defense has had many months to prepare its case and should have to file its motions before May 30. Prosecutors said the judge has already granted seven extensions and that any further delays jeopardize the rights of the victims and the public to a speedy trial.</p>
<p>After a phone conference, U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose ordered that the defense has until June 15 to file challenges to the indictment and the government's notice of intent to seek the death penalty, including the aggravating factors in that decision.</p>
<p>Government responses are due by June 30 and replies by July 13, the judge ruled.</p>
<p>She also said any challenges to the jury selection process are due by July 20, responses by Aug. 3 and replies by Aug. 17.</p>
