<h1>WPIAL 5A roundup: South Fayette scores early, defeats Moon </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It may not have been the offensive outburst that South Fayette has become accustomed to in recent years, but considering the dearth of production the Lions had generated over the past few weeks, they werenâ€™t going to argue with success.</p>
<p>South Fayette (2-2, 1-1), which was coming off its first conference loss in nearly nine years, scored a pair of quick first quarter touchdowns and turned that early lead into a 28-13 victory against Class 5A No. 5 Moon (3-1, 1-1) in an Allegheny Six Conference showdown.</p>
<p>The Lions, who came into the game on a two-game losing streak, had not dropped three in a row since 2008.</p>
<p>South Fayette quarterback Nathan Alemeda got back into form as he completed 16 of 27 passes for 237 yards and three touchdowns, including a pair of first quarter strikes that allowed the Lions to jump out to an early lead. Moon signal-caller Tyler McGowan was solid as he got the Tigers back to within a touchdown at one point. He was 14 of 24 for 164 yards, a touchdown and an interception.</p>

<p><strong><strong>West Allegheny 17, </strong>Bethel Park 7:</strong> For a second it appeared the Black Hawks (0-4, 0-2) would end their early season slump when junior quarterback Max Blanc opened the scoring with a 60-yard touchdown pass, but the Indians (3-1, 1-1) persevered as junior Gavin Miller threw for a pair of scores. Nico Flati ground out 184 rushing yards as West Allegheny pulled out its third consecutive win.</p>
<p><strong>Franklin Regional 42, Connellsville 21:</strong> Trevor Brncic carved up the winless Falcons (0-4, 0-2) as he completed 9 of 13 passes for 137 yards and three touchdowns. Brandon Zanotto carried 15 times for 107 and two more scores to help the Panthers (3-1, 1-1) to a critical Big East Conference victory.</p>
<p><strong>Fox Chapel 36, Shaler 21:</strong> The Titans (0-4, 0-2) appeared ready to roll to their first win of the season when they opened up with a Dylan Schlagel touchdown reception, but the Foxes (1-3, 1-1), were just as eager to post their first win of the season and ripped off 29 second-quarter points. Justin Rice threw four of his five touchdown passes in the second quarter to secure the win.</p>
<p><strong>North Hills, 42, Kiski Area 20:</strong> The Indians (2-2, 2-0) rolled up 501 yards of total offense thanks in large part to senior quarterback Ethan Marker, who completed 5 of 7 for 128 yards and four touchdowns to complement a running game led by 147 yards and an 84-yard scoring run by Robert Dickerson. In addition to jumpstarting the running game, Dickerson caught three passes for 99 yards and three scores, while Liam Tracey also carried seven times for 146 yards and a score for North Hills, which lost four fumbles to the Cavaliers (1-2, 0-2).</p>
