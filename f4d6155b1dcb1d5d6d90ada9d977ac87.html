<p>Pittsburgh has plenty of idiosyncratic ways we observe a snow day. And we want to see yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snap a pic of how you’re enjoying — or maybe not enjoying — today’s snow and email it to socialmedia@post-gazette.com. Please include your name and the location of the image.</p>
<p>We’ll pick our favorites and post them on the site later today.&nbsp;</p>
