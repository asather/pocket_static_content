<h1>City closing Reservoir Drive in Highland Park to vehicles </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the weather has gotten nicer and stay-at-home orders have been lifted, more and more people have been frequenting Pittsburgh public parks.</p>
<p>In an effort to ensure that people can properly social distance as these parks get busier, the city is closing Reservoir Drive to vehicle traffic in Highland Park beginning on June 11.</p>
<p>This change — planned by Bike Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy — is to create more space for safe outdoor recreation.</p>
<p>"After months of being forced inside by the pandemic, we know Pittsburgh residents are desperate to spend more time outdoors, safely and with ample space for social distancing," Mayor Bill Peduto said in a news release. "I want to thank all our partners for their patience in making this exciting project happen."</p>
<p>Public Safety, Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority and emergency vehicles will still have access to the loop.</p>
<p>General parking will be available along Highland Avenue, and ADA parking will still be available in the lot located at the end of Farmhouse Drive.</p>
