<h1>Steelers continue with practice as scheduled as other NFL teams cancel</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers had a team meeting on Wednesday in which the Wisconsin shooting was discussed, but there was never a vote among the players whether they should cancel practice like other NFL teams are doing, quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said.</p>
<p>Prior to Roethlisberger’s scheduled Zoom call with the media, the Steelers announced practice would go on as scheduled at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>“It’s not like we voted or anything,” Roethlisberger said. “We’re going to practice at our normal time.”</p>
<p>Several NFL teams, including Indianapolis, the New York Jets, Washington, Jacksonville, Chicago and Green Bay have either canceled or delayed their practice on Thursday in response to the shooting of Jacob Blake. The Detroit Lions canceled their practice on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing for me to do is listen to my African American teammates and friends to learn more," Roethlisberger said.</p>
