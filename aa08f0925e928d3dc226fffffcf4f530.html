<h1>COVID-19 update: More than 150 new cases reported in Allegheny County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the 10th day in a row, Allegheny County has reported a triple-digit increase in new COVID-19 cases. With 158 more people testing positive for the coronavirus, the county total now stands at 4,367 cases.</p>
<p>Health officials said these new infections come from 1,632 tests that were administered between June 25 and July 7. The ages of the new positive cases range from 5 months to 90 years old. The median age is 29.</p>

<p>Western Pennsylvania saw an increase of 240 new cases. Allegheny had the highest number of new cases, and Westmoreland County had the second highest with 21 new cases.</p>
<p>Allegheny County is reporting no new deaths for Thursday, keeping the total at 196. The state is reporting 193 deaths for the county.</p>
<p>Hospitalizations increased by 12, bringing the total to 443 past or present hospitalizations since the first case was diagnosed in March. Of those hospitalizations, 168 were admitted to intensive care units and 79 required mechanical ventilation. As of Wednesday, there were 100 COVID-19 patients on ventilators statewide, according to the state health departments.</p>
<p>During a Thursday press conference, UPMC physicians said the higher levels of COVID-19 infections in recent weeks are not resulting in notably higher levels of hospitalizations or deaths.</p>
<p>Only 2% of recent infections are causing severe enough illness to result in hospitalizations, with only one-tenth of those hospitalizations (or .2% of all positive cases) resulting in death.</p>
<p>One key reason is that those becoming infected are younger people, with contact tracing showing that many of them had patronized bars or restaurants without protective gear such as face masks or have recently returned from vacations out of state.</p>
<p>In addition, data gathered during the recent resurgence of the pandemic “is showing that we have been doing a good job in protecting those most vulnerable” to severe infection, including the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions, said Dr. Graham Snyder, UPMC medical director of infection prevention and hospital epidemiology.</p>
<p>But Dr. Donald Yealy, UPMC senior medical director and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine at UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh, warned that everyone should expect “the virus will be with us for the foreseeable future.”</p>
<p>“But we are not seeing the same pattern of severeness as we did before,” he said.</p>
<p>More evidence is necessary, Dr. Snyder said, but UPMC more recently has been seeing a mutated SARS-CoV-2 strain that seems to be more infectious but less virulent than the original strain that triggered the pandemic.</p>
<p>To combat the continued surge in cases, county officials prohibited indoor dining at restaurants and said outdoor dining would be allowed with restrictions starting Friday.</p>
<p>The counties surrounding Allegheny&nbsp;— Beaver, Butler, Washington and Westmoreland&nbsp;— are all still waiting to hear if the state will place restrictions on them as well, as they have all seen a recent increase in cases.</p>
<p>Statewide, there was an increase of 719 new cases, bringing the total for Pennsylvania to 92,867. The state also saw an increase of 36 COVID-19 related deaths, none of which were in Western Pennsylvania. The current death toll for the state is 6,848, state officials reported Thursday.</p>
