<h1>Nine Pitt programs meet or exceed national academic progress rate average</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nine of Pitt’s 16 athletic programs — including football, men’s basketball and women’s basketball — had multi-year academic progress rate (APR) scores that were at or above the national average, according to numbers released Tuesday by the NCAA.</p>
<p>Implemented in 2003, APR is a measurement of a program’s ability to retain its athletes and keep them eligible. Each semester, scholarship athletes are awarded one point for remaining eligible and another point for staying in school or graduating. Rates are a calculation of a program’s performance over a four-year period, meaning the most recent numbers come from a period starting with the 2015-16 academic year and ending with the 2018-19 academic year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the Panthers’ football and men’s cross country programs received APR public recognition honors for finishing with scores that were in the top 10% of their respective sports. The former posted a score of 988, the highest in program history and 24 points higher than the national average for the sport, while the latter had a perfect score of 1,000 for the first time ever.</p>
<p>Six programs (football, men’s cross country, men’s soccer, softball, volleyball and wrestling) had scores that met or exceeded their figures from last year. The programs that matched or outperformed the national average in their respective sports were football, men’s basketball, women’s basketball, wrestling, volleyball men’s cross country, women’s cross country, softball and women’s track and field. Six programs also finished with scores that placed them among the top five teams in the ACC.</p>
<p>Single-year scores are also tallied. In 2018-19, six Pitt programs had perfect single-year APR scores of 1,000 (volleyball, men’s soccer, women’s soccer, men’s cross country, women’s cross country and women’s swimming and diving). The university’s two most prominent programs — football and men’s basketball — had single-year scores of 991 and 951, respectively, in 2018-19.</p>
<p>Barring exemptions, programs must average a four-year APR of at least 930 to be able to compete in championships. Only one Pitt program, men’s track and field, came within 10 points of falling below that threshold. Here&nbsp;are multi-year APR scores for each of Pitt’s programs, with the national average in that sport in parentheses.</p>
<p><strong>Baseball</strong> – 961 (977)</p>
<p><strong>Men’s basketball</strong> – 968 (966)</p>
<p><strong>Women’s basketball</strong> – 991 (983)</p>
<p><strong>Men’s cross country</strong> – 1,000 (982)</p>
<p><strong>Women’s cross country</strong> – 996 (989)</p>
<p><strong>Football</strong> – 988 (964)</p>
<p><strong>Gymnastics</strong> – 986 (994)</p>
<p><strong>Men’s soccer</strong> – 975 (978)</p>
<p><strong>Women’s soccer</strong> – 981 (990)</p>
<p><strong>Softball</strong> – 993 (986)</p>
<p><strong>Men’s swimming and diving</strong> – 982 (983)</p>
<p><strong>Women’s swimming and diving</strong> – 989 (993)</p>
<p><strong>Men’s track and field</strong> – 938 (974)</p>
<p><strong>Women’s track and field</strong> – 989 (984)</p>
<p><strong>Volleyball</strong> - 995 (988)</p>
<p><strong>Wrestling</strong> - 979 (975)</p>
<p><strong>Penn State</strong></p>
<p>Of Penn State’s 29 programs, 22 equaled or surpassed their multi-year APR score from the previous year. Six of the Nittany Lions’ programs (men’s hockey, women’s cross country, women’s fencing, men’s golf, women’s golf and women’s track and field) earned perfect multi-year scores.</p>
<p>Twenty programs earned perfect single-year APR scores, a group that included football and women’s basketball. It marks the first time the Nittany Lions have posted a perfect single-year score in football. The football program, at 982, was one of eight at the school with multi-year APR scores that were at least 10 points higher than the national average.</p>
<p>Penn State’s men’s basketball program had a multi-year APR score of 948, its lowest posting since the 2004-05 academic year.</p>
