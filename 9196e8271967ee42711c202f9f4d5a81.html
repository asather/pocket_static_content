<h1>Pittsburgh couple under quarantine after leaving cruise ship at center of COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Pittsburgh men are being tested for COVID-19 after disembarking from a cruise ship where at least one passenger who was on the ship died from the virus this week in Sacramento, Calif.</p>
<p>Frank Tallarico said he and his husband, Kyle Cunningham, were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship last month and began showing symptoms of the COVID-19 virus after arriving back in Pittsburgh. They were tested by the Allegheny County Health Department Wednesday.</p>
<p>Through the glass front door of his Manchester home on Thursday evening,&nbsp;Mr. Tallarico said the test results came back negative. He and his husband are still under quarantine, and Mr. Tallarico declined to speak further.</p>
<p>A second set of samples from Mr. Tallarico and Mr. Cunningham still must be processed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta before the couple are released from quarantine.</p>
<p>According to the Los Angeles Times, Princess Cruises began notifying passengers of the ship that a&nbsp;71-year-old passenger on a voyage to Mexico had died of the virus after leaving the ship. The Grand Princess and all its passengers and crew are being kept off the coast of Northern California following a subsequent trip to Hawaii, due to concerns about the virus’s spread. The passengers and crew under quarantine also were slated to go to Baja.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Tallarico and Mr. Cunningham were on the Mexican voyage, but they disembarked before the ship made its subsequent trip to Hawaii. They said they showed symptoms, and that they were tested.</p>
<p>Responding to a request for comment, Ryan Scarpino, county health department spokesman, wrote in an email: “As was indicated at the press conference on Monday, we are not providing information relative to potential cases or testing of individuals in Allegheny County. Nor would we provide any information that would violate a person’s medical privacy rights.”</p>
<p>There are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, Mr. Scarpino added, and he said the health department will inform the public of that and other updated information “as appropriate.”</p>
<p>Mr. Tallarico and Mr. Cunningham’s cases come amid rising fears of the COVID-19 virus’s spread in the U.S. On Wednesday,&nbsp;Carnegie Mellon University suspended all university-sponsored international travel until further notice because of concerns about the virus, the school’s provost said in a message posted to the school’s website.</p>
<p>“This includes all student, faculty and staff international travel for CMU-sponsored academic and research activities, such as coursework, academic and research conferences, and non-academic activities, including volunteer service trips,” Carnegie Mellon Provost James Garrett said. “In addition, we urge you to postpone personal international travel plans.”</p>
<p>Workers at the University of Pittsburgh have installed 400-plus hand sanitizer stations throughout campus, including all housing, educational and general facilities, officials said. Locations were chosen based on proximity to building entrances and exits with high pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>“Our custodians have been trained to check and refill them in their daily assignment schedule,” Pitt spokesman Kevin Zwick said in a statement Thursday. “Signs are placed at each unit to communicate the key benefits of hand sanitizing to limit the spread of germs.”</p>
<p>The university also is deploying signage on electronic screens around the university reminding students, faculty and staff of the importance of hand-washing, he said.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, Greensburg Roman Catholic Bishop Edward Malesic temporarily suspended the distribution of Communion wine from a common chalice in an effort to prevent the spread of flu and the COVID-19 coronavirus.</p>
<p>The bishop also suspended the use of handshakes or other physical contact in the exchange of the ritual sign of peace during Masses. He reminded the faithful that they are not obligated to attend Mass when sick.</p>
<p>The Greensburg Diocese said the action was in response to public health recommendations about both the seasonal flu and COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Bishop David Zubik issued similar policies earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 93,000 cases of the virus and upward of 3,200 deaths have been reported, in as many as 60 countries, beginning in China. In the U.S., 12 deaths have been reported.</p>
