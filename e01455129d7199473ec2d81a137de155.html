<h1>Jason Mackey’s Life at Home: Baseball's return offers chance to improve, focus on details</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the grace of a broken-down roller coaster reaching the platform or Cosmo Kramer, sans ribbon, stumbling and writhing his way over the finish line, we made it.</p>
<p>This week, there will be baseball.</p>
<p>This week, there will be somewhere to go, something to watch (other than old games or my computer screen during a Zoom call) and action to describe, the first few days of Major League Baseball summer camp — <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/24/pirates-spring-training-derek-shelton/stories/202006240120" target="_blank">er, spring training 2.0</a> — taking place at PNC Park.</p>
<p>The idea of the entire thing is thrilling, for a multitude of reasons that I’ve been thinking about since we learned once and for all this past Wednesday that there <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/23/mlbpa-players-will-report-health-safety-protocols/stories/202006230125" target="_blank">would be baseball this summer</a> — even if the entire process dragged on way too long and got entirely too stupid.</p>
<p>Immediately, once the deal was done, a sense of normalcy returned, the idea that days could be structured around the expectation that things would be (relatively) calm during the day, then I could go to the ballpark at night.</p>
<p>Or the fact that the conversation surrounding baseball can finally shift to pitching, fielding and timely hitting as opposed to a bunch of really rich people trying to divvy up more money than I’ll see in this lifetime.</p>
<p>But the idea of having baseball back, mixed with how unconventional things will be covering it, began to crystallize in my mind this week, forming a question: What will this entire process be like?</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>
<p>We don’t know.</p>
<p>They don’t know.</p>
<p>Nobody knows.</p>
<p>Sure, there are assumptions and expectations, like the fact that clubhouses won’t be open and everything will be done via Zoom. But where we can go and when, what we can see, if we can travel … it’s all a work in progress.</p>
<p>That’s fine, too. It’ll take time. We’ll do the best we can. But from a writing/reporting standpoint, I’m looking forward to the challenge that this year should present.</p>
<p>Too often in this business, especially on a beat, I think we become overly reliant on bland quotes and ignore other much more important components of journalism and writing.</p>
<p>Details and observation.</p>
<p>Storytelling.</p>
<p>Remembering what you know, mixing it with what you see and writing&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Sentence structure and presenting something in an artful way.</p>
<p>Any beat can become a grind, but especially baseball. It’s easy to fall into a pattern where you alternate paragraph-quote-paragraph-quote or simply feel some obligation to present whatever clichés were collected that day.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this year should require some additional creativity. It should force us to come up with different angles, to write things well, to report with our eyes and not necessarily our recording devices.</p>
<p>In normal times, one-on-one interviews for sports are king. They’re important for news, too, but I don’t think as much.</p>
<p>I’d say that 90% of people on beats in this city get along, but we compete with one another. You do that via one-on-one interviews, by not divulging your line of questioning or story topic and being able to pick at specific things.</p>
<p>You also respect one-on-one interviews — meaning don’t jump in — except for after hockey games, when everything takes place in five minutes and you need to get guys before they strip off their pads, go back to the changing room and never appear again.</p>
<p>(Pro tip: If you ever see a beat reporter at a bar, ask for his or her best dressing/locker room or clubhouse stories. Guarantee they’re good.)</p>
<p>But this season, one-on-one interviews will likely be rare, at least compared to normal times.</p>
<p>Maybe they’ll wind up being really important, too, but baseball isn’t really a quote-heavy sport; its audience, at least in Pittsburgh, is less than football or hockey and, for a few different reasons, you need more than strong quotes to make a story.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Zoom calls trumping in-person access will also eliminate the idea of “working a room,” which is reporter speak for knowing who’s where, who’s talking, who might be done talking, who’s coming back and sort of surreptitiously planning your time to juice as much as possible out of our availability time.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It’s one of my favorite things about being on a beat, but it won’t be possible&nbsp;</span><span data-mce-mark="1">this season. The strategy will be no strategy. It will be a mix of old school and new school, where it will be incumbent upon those watching the games to describe what happens, hopefully explain why it happened and also provide some next-level insight.</span></p>
<p>Perhaps it’s a little artsy one night. The next might be a stat-heavy — my apologies in advance for any numbers rabbit hole I might fall down.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But after all this time writing features and coming up with stories, I’m reminded a quote from my good friend Andrew Fillipponi, one that didn’t make <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/21/Mackey-Life-at-Home-Dunlap-Fillipponi-currency-creative-Fan-topics-features-COVID-19/stories/202006190100" target="_blank">last week’s column</a>.</span></p>
<p>“If someone hands me a coloring book right now and says, ‘Use the red crayon to color between the lines,’ I wouldn’t mind it as much because I haven’t done it in a long time,” he said. “It would be a changeup or something that I took for granted when things were normal.”</p>
<p>I’m with Andrew, at least to start. But I’m also eager for the challenge ahead, the one that should force all of us to color outside the lines.</p>
