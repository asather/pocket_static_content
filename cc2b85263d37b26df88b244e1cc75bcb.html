<p>Fifth grade students at Ross Elementary School have planted 100 trees at the township’s Sangree Park, and Eloise Peet would like to expand the program to other North Hills schools.</p>
<p>Ms. Peet, director of parks and recreation for Ross, and Isabela-Cajiao Angelelli, founder of One Tree Per Child Pittsburgh, spoke to members of the North Hills school board Feb. 5 about the program.</p>
<p>“It has been really an amazing journey,” said Dr. Angelelli, a pediatrician. “All kids get to engage and leave a legacy.”</p>
<p>Ms. Peet said that three Ross Parks — Sangree, Evergreen and Denny — “have been hit by blight,” particularly the emerald ash borer, a beetle-like insect. The township is embarking on reforestation.</p>
<p>“We could keep every kid in school busy at Sangree,” she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Angelelli said that One Tree Per Child Pittsburgh started in 2017 and is based on a program in Australia.</p>
<p>“People that live in areas where there are more trees have better physical and mental health, and kids that go to schools where there are trees do better,” she said.</p>
<p>The organization has helped more than 1,000 students plant more than 700 trees in the region, Dr. Angelelli said.</p>
<p>School board President Allison Mathis said she chaperoned her daughter’s class at Ross Elementary when they planted the trees.</p>
<p>“My daughter still goes back to visit the tree that she planted,” Mrs. Mathis said.</p>
