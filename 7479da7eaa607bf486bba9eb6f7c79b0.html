<h1>2020 Great Race canceled, but virtual option will be offered</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Great Race is following the Pittsburgh Marathon in going virtual.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizers announced Friday that the 10-kilometer distance run named in honor of former Pittsburgh mayor Richard S. Caliguiri and scheduled for Sept. 27 has been canceled as an in-person event because of the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those who’ve registered, however, have the option of completing the run at home or in other safe spaces to earn a participation medal and event shirt.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Great Race is one of Pittsburgh’s greatest traditions,” race director Brian Katze said in a statement. “Runners from all over come to Pittsburgh each year to participate in this event, and we want to make sure they still get to keep that tradition going, even if it’s not in person this year.”</p>
<p>Refunds will be offered to those who do not wish to participate. Full details of the virtual run will be announced at a later date, and registration for the virtual run opens Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Organizers also announced that the Junior Great Race scheduled for Sept. 26 has also been nixed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Earlier this month, more than 13,000 people participated in the Pittsburgh Marathon virtually.&nbsp;</p>
