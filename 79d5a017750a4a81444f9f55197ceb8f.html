<h1>Truckers 'extremely disappointed' PennDOT closed rest stops</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A national organization representing truck drivers is upset that the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation has closed rest areas and welcome centers due to the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association said Tuesday it is&nbsp;“extremely disappointed” that the state has closed the areas, where drivers stop to sleep and use restrooms. PennDOT announced Monday it was closing the areas to limit social interaction to help stop the spread of the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>“We understand this decision was likely made in an effort to limit passenger vehicle movement, interaction among travelers, and the state’s administration and supervision of these facilities during an emergency declaration,” the association said in a news release.&nbsp;“However, rest areas are vitally important to truckers, who at this time are being heavily relied upon to transport critical supplies across the country.”</p>
<p>The association said it has 7,000 members in Pennsylvania and the decision to close rest areas shows&nbsp;“a worrisome disregard for their personal safety.” It said Pennsylvania is the only state to take that step so far, but others are considering the same action.</p>
<p>“Pennsylvania is a major contributor to the nation’s economy and its location between the Northeast region and markets in the South and Midwest means countless truckers move across the state each day,” the group said. “Many of these truckers rely on the state’s rest areas to do just that – rest!”</p>
<p>Association spokeswoman Norita Taylor noted the closure comes a week after bi-partisan federal legislation was introduced to address a chronic shortage of rest areas for truckers across the country.</p>
<p>PennDOT spokeswoman Alexis Campbell said privately owned truck stops remain open and rest areas are open on the Pennsylvania Turnpike for fuel, bathrooms and parking.</p>
<p>“PennDOT’s rest areas are currently closed, but we are routinely evaluating our position relative to the effort to mitigate the impact of COVID-19,” Ms. Campbell said in an email. “We must also consider the ability of our contract cleaners to provide staffing adequate to maintain clean, safe and sanitary facilities within our rest areas while limiting the exposure risk to CMV drivers as well as staff.”</p>
<p>The turnpike announced Tuesday fast-food service and indoor bathrooms are closed at all 17 rest areas due to the virus. Fuel service and convenience stores will remain open and the turnpike has placed portable toilets at the plazas.</p>
<p>The portable toilets will be sanitized twice a day and each plaza will have two hand-washing stations, turnpike said.&nbsp;</p>
