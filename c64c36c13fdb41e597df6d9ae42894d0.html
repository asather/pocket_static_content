<h1>Mt. Lebanon cancels Fourth of July festivities, programs due to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mt. Lebanon has canceled its summer activities, as well as its Fourth of July festivities, due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The recreation staff Wednesday announced the cancellation of this year's Camp Chippeewee, Summer Playground Camp, Sportz Zone.</p>
<p>“Looking at what we do and how our residents are used to enjoying the events, in large groups, clustered together, we could not in good conscience return to those programs and ensure the participants would be safe,” said Recreation Director David Donnellan on the township website. “So much of what we do happens closer than six feet to other people. It’s just not possible to keep people apart and run the same quality programs we enjoy.”</p>
<p>Senior Lunches are also canceled until all restrictions are lifted.</p>
<p>Recreation crews are taking down the surface at the ice rink, and it will not open before August 1, depending on guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other recommendations from the state and county.</p>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon Recreation Center has been closed since March 16.</p>
<p>The Mt. Lebanon Golf Course is open for play with new rules requiring social distancing and other safety protocols.</p>
