<h1>Stargazing: A different kind of April shower</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If we get a break from the rain clouds that shower the Pittsburgh area in April, the very early morning hours between midnight and 6 a.m. Wednesday provide us with a shower from outer space, the Lyrid meteor shower.</p>
<p>Like most meteor showers, the Lyrids are the result of the Earth plowing through a debris field left over from a comet that crossed the Earth’s orbit some time ago. The comet in this case is known as C/​1861 G1, discovered by A.E. Thatcher. It last visited our neighborhood in 1861. Like many comets, its orbit is highly elongated, bringing it out nearly three times the distance to Pluto at its farthest point or apogee.</p>
<p>Meteor showers are best observed with the unaided eye, taking a broad view of the sky. While the meteors all seem to originate near the constellation Lyra, a point called the radiant, they can streak all across the sky.</p>
<p>Do not despair if clouds or your own schedule keep you from observing at the peak. The totality of the Lyrids is spread out over the span that ends Saturday. Happy meteor hunting!–</p>
