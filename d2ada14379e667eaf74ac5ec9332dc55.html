<h1>Steelers' workouts at Robert Morris gave veterans some normalcy during pandemic</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>They gathered on a soccer field in Moon Township where the locals kept the secret for a while. Far removed from their state-of-the-art facility on the South Side, where the Steelers have four outdoors fields and an indoor field, some players this summer trekked 21 miles to Robert Morris University, where they worked out on a secluded part of the campus last month.</p>
<p>According to sources, players organized the workouts on their own, and no coaches were in attendance. But veterans, including quarterback Ben Roethlisberger, simulated what they would do in a normal year during OTAs and minicamp. That included offense vs. defense drills among other activities to stay in shape during the pandemic. These workouts were after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/18/ben-roethlisberger-throwing-teammates-shaved-beard-injury-update/stories/202005180088" target="_blank">Roethlisberger and some teammates did some work</a>&nbsp;at Quaker Valley High School in May.</p>
<p>There were only five or six workouts, but they could prove important during this most uncertain NFL season. Last week, the NFL and NFLPA came to an agreement on how the league will conduct training camps during the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Steelers rookies and select first-year players reported for training camp last week and veterans will report Tuesday, but they won’t be practicing for another three weeks under the terms of the agreement the league and the players union hammered out last week. There will be a week of testing, virtual meetings and physicals followed by a week of strength and conditioning before practice begins Aug. 17.</p>
<p>In a normal year, the Steelers might have 15 or so practices and two preseason games completed by the middle of August. This year there will not be any preseason games.</p>
<p>Truncated training camps mean fewer reps, which is why these summer workouts should be beneficial, especially for teams like the Steelers.</p>
<p>It’s easy to imagine Roethlisberger, who is entering his 17th season in the league, running an informal practice. He coaches the receivers and running backs as much as assistant coaches during a normal practice on the South Side. The same can be said for a veteran-laden defense that includes cornerback Joe Haden, who has been in the league since 2010.</p>
<p>Now imagine how difficult it will be for teams with first-year quarterbacks, or first-year players at any position this season. Even for a player like Tom Brady, a six-time Super Bowl champion with the Patriots, extra work was a necessity during the pandemic because he knew time might be limited in camps this year.</p>
<p>Brady, who signed as a free agent with the Buccaneers in the spring, and some of his new teammates <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2020/05/19/tom-brady-bucs-players-take-the-field-at-tampas-berkeley-prep-exclusive-photos/" target="_blank">worked out at a Tampa Bay high school field</a> to get in some work during the pandemic. <a href="https://www.tampabay.com/sports/bucs/2020/04/20/tom-brady-was-thrown-out-of-park-by-a-tampa-recreation-worker/" target="_blank">Brady was even kicked out of a Tampa park</a> in April when the park was closed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, the <a href="https://www.nfl.com/news/nflpa-recommends-that-players-stop-private-group-workouts" target="_blank">NFL sent out a memo to teams</a> discouraging players from working out together because there were spikes in cases of COVID-19 around the country. It’s not clear when the Steelers ceased their workouts, but most veterans that don’t call Pittsburgh home were training out of town during July.</p>
<p>The Steelers have 10 of 11 starters returning on offense and 10 of 11 returning on defense. The Steelers and other teams with rosters returning intact, or almost intact from last season, will have a leg up on the competition.</p>
<p>Teams with a lot of roster turnover will be at a big disadvantage. The time to work out new kinks is the spring and in training camp, but with the offseason almost totally eliminated this year, coaches will be working overtime to get their teams up to speed by the time the season kicks off in September.</p>
<p>This year, more than ever, getting off to a good start is important. The season could be shortened at anytime due to COVID-19. Every win early in the season could mean more.</p>
<p><strong>Nice trade</strong></p>
<p>The decision to trade for Minkah Fitzpatrick last September keeps looking better and better for the Steelers.</p>
<p>They gave up their first-round pick in April’s draft to get Fitzpatrick, who earned All-Pro honors in his first season with the Steelers.</p>
<p>On Saturday, the Seahawks gave up two first-round picks to obtain safety Jamal Adams from the Jets. The Steelers, in effect, are getting two extra years of Fitzpatrick at half the price.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick was the No. 11 pick in 2018, and the Steelers control his rights through the 2022 season.&nbsp;Adams was the No. 6 pick in the 2017 draft, and the Seahawks only control his rights through the 2021 season.</p>
<p>Now factor in the importance of acquiring Fitzpatrick last season. He has almost a full year in the Steelers system and has the potential to be an even more disruptive force in the defense this season, even without the benefit of a normal offseason, while Adams will try to learn the Seahawks defense in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>Fitzpatrick had five interceptions, two forced fumbles and three fumble recoveries in 14 games for the Steelers last season. He has two career interceptions in his first three NFL seasons, with six forced fumbles and four fumble recoveries.</p>
