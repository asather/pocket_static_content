<h1>Ex-WVU professor pleads in China trip reimbursement, tax scheme</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former West Virginia University professor waived indictment and admitted Thursday to defrauding the school in a travel reimbursement scheme and filing a false tax return in connection with travel to China, the second former WVU professor to be convicted recently of actions related to work in China.</p>
<p>Qingyun Sun, 58, of Morgantown, W.Va., pleaded guilty in federal court in Clarksburg to a two-count criminal information charging him with wire fraud and filing a false return.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun, a Chinese national, was employed by the school as an associate professor and associate director of the U.S.-China Energy Center at WVU. He also acted as the governor's assistant for China affairs through WVU's development office.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mr. Sun was employed by Synfuels Americas Corp., an energy conversion technology provider of coal-to-liquids and gas-to-liquids processes located in Virginia but headquartered in Beijing.</p>
<p>The U.S. Attorney's office of Northern West Virginia said that from July 2011 to May 2015, Peabody Energy Generation Holding Co. in St. Louis paid consulting fees to an entity called Energy United LC, a consulting firm Sun created in 2005.</p>
<p>In 2015, according to court information, Mr. Sun traveled to China on behalf of WVU to prepare for a visit to China by WVU representatives and to lead a West Virginia delegation for a coal expo in Beijing. Prosecutors said he booked a coach flight and a business class flight on United Airlines for the trip, then submitted a reimbursement request to WVU for the coach flight and another to Synfuels for the business flight.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun used only the business class ticket for the trip.</p>
<p>In 2014, prosecutors said, Mr. Sun filed a joint income tax return with his wife that overstated his business-related travel expenses, many of which had been paid for by a state purchasing card or reimbursed to him by WVU and Peabody Energy.</p>
<p>Mr. Sun also did not report any financial interest or authority over a financial account in a foreign country when at the time he had many such accounts, the U.S. attorney's office said.</p>
<p>Sun agreed to pay restitution in the amount of $6,233 to WVU as part of his plea deal.</p>
<p>In March, another ex-WVU professor, James Patrick Lewis, admitted in federal court about lying to the school about taking leave to care for his newborn when in fact he was working as a paid professor in China.</p>
<p>Mr. Lewis, who had been a tenured professor of physics specializing in coal conversion technology, cost WVU about $20,000 in that scheme.</p>
<p>He resigned from the school in 2019.</p>
