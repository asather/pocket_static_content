<h1>NFL reportedly considering Saturday kickoffs if coronavirus scraps 2021 college season</h1>

<p>Could coronavirus lead to fall Saturdays without football? Possibly. But even if the college games don't return this season, the National Football League appears to be a willing substitute.</p>
<p>The NFL has had preliminary talks with broadcast partners about a potential shift of some games to Saturday kickoffs, according to a report from the New York Post.</p>
<p>Even in such a scenario the majority of NFL games would remain in Sunday, Monday and Thursday slots as per the typical schedule.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>It's a scenario that could become reality. Even as many states begin to loosen some elements of shutdowns and reopen their respective economies, the feasibility of sports and large-scale events remains murky at best.</p>
<p>The NBA has announced teams -- in states and cities that allow it -- can reopen their facilities as early as May 8, but there has been no indication about a return to games since the league paused operations on March 11.</p>
<p>Among scenarios considered would be a return to play without fans. But such a plan would be more difficult to coordinate across the entirety of the NCAA and with amateur athletes than within professional leagues.</p>
<p>If the NFL did climb into a Saturday time slot, it has much of the infrastructure in place already. The league has a history of scheduling late-season games and early-round playoff games on Saturdays.</p>
<p>The NFL was among the first of major sports leagues to coordinate an event amid the coronavirus pandemic, holding all three days of the NFL draft from April 23-25 entirely remotely.</p>
<p>On the record, the NFL is planning to play a full season though it’s uncertain what that will look like.</p>
<p>League spokesman Brian McCarthy said Thursday that since January the 2020 schedule was intended for release after the draft. It is planned for release by the end of next week, with the date for the kickoff game Thursday, Sept. 10, concluding with Super Bowl on Feb. 7 in Tampa.</p>
<p>But the league is planning several contingencies because of the coronavirus pandemic that could lead to everything from a delayed start to a late-winter Super Bowl.</p>
<p>“The schedule will come out as normal, but we’re doing reasonable and responsible planning as we always do, inside of game operations,” league executive Troy Vincent told The Associated Press on Thursday. “Based off of what we are learning from the medical community and how people are handling this domestically and abroad, we are being deliberate with reasonable and responsible planning about what can work in our environment and what we can incorporate to protect the health and safety of all involved.”</p>
<p>Empty stadiums, neutral sites and no bye weeks are among several alternatives being discussed.</p>
<p>If the season needs to be pushed back or the regular season has to be adjusted, the NFL players’ union would have to approve.</p>
