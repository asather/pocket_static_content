<h1>Allegheny County Housing Authority will move offices to McKees Rocks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Housing Authority has moved out of its Downtown offices on Stanwix Street and Fort Duquesne Boulevard — although its new office under construction in McKees Rocks isn’t yet open.</p>
<p>In the meantime, staff members are working from a combination of their homes, the authority’s Pleasant Ridge complex in Stowe and a small office on Amity Street in Homestead, housing authority officials said.</p>
<p>The move had been in the works for several years but was accelerated when the owners of the agency’s Downtown home decided to convert its 12th-floor office into condos.</p>
<p>The decision to move was driven by financial considerations, said Housing Authority executive director Frank Aggazio, and to assist the community of McKees Rocks, which invited the agency to relocate as part of an economic development project.</p>
<p>“There’s an economic development component to this,” Mr. Aggazio said.</p>
<p>McKees Rocks officials could not be reached.</p>
<p>Construction on the 20,314-square-foot, two-story office building project temporarily halted in March due to pandemic mitigation measures that stopped all construction, but it resumed May 1, said Craig Rippole, who heads Trinity Commercial Development. The site at 301 Chartiers Ave. is owned by McKees Rocks Commercial Properties LLC.</p>
<p>The agency was invited to move into the new building by McKees Rocks officials as part of a state Redevelopment Assistance Capital Program grant, Mr. Aggazio said.</p>
<p>Its new space will be smaller than the Downtown office, as less space is needed, Mr. Aggazio said. It should be ready by October, he said.</p>
<p>While McKees Rocks is less accessible via public transit compared to Downtown, Mr. Aggazio said, a survey of visitors to his agency showed more than 70% did not use transit.</p>
<p>The housing authority — which owns and manages more than 3,300 housing units and administers more than 5,000 housing vouchers — has high numbers of voucher holders in Allegheny County’s eastern suburbs and Mon Valley communities, such as Braddock, Clairton, Duquesne, East Pittsburgh, Homestead, Penn Hills, Pitcairn, Swissvale, Turtle Creek and Wilkinsburg, according to 2019 Allegheny County Housing Authority data.</p>
<p>“We know that for low-income folks, being able to access the housing authority offices is essential,” said Laura Weins, executive director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit.</p>
