<h1>Analysis: Examining the Ke'Bryan Hayes question for 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chalk it up to baseball being a business, but it sounds like Ke’Bryan Hayes, the Pirates’ top position player prospect, may wind up as a service-time casualty in the shortened 2020 MLB season.</p>
<p>While nothing is final, there’s enough smoke here to suspect that the Pirates are not interested in starting Hayes’ arbitration clock and will possibly wait a little bit before promoting him to the major leagues.</p>
<p>Is that a bad thing? Are the Pirates cheap and stupid?</p>
<p>Not totally. Before we explain some of the minutiae here, it’s worth noting that it is a reasonable strategy for the Pirates to slow-play this, especially when you consider Hayes might not be a finished offensive product.</p>
<p>(Hayes is an elite defender, gets on base and has plenty of speed, but thus far his consistency and power have been two areas where evaluators have hoped to see improvement.)</p>
<p>If the Pirates don’t open the season with Hayes as their starting third baseman — and it certainly looks like that is the route they’ll go — the question becomes this: How long will they wait?</p>
<p>Let’s work through the entire thing together.</p>
<p><strong>Super 2 status</strong></p>
<p>Surely — and sadly — you’ve heard of Super 2 status before, but let’s take a quick step back and explain it.</p>
<p>Pay structure in baseball is determined by what’s known as service time or the number of days a player spends on a big league roster.</p>
<p>Those with zero to two years of service time have salaries determined by the team, while players with three to six go through arbitration. Beyond that, free agency.</p>
<p>Super 2 involves players who have between two and three years of service time. If you’re among the top 22%, however, you get to go through a fourth time, a financial carrot that rewards contributing earlier.</p>
<p>Last year’s Super 2 cutoff was two years and 115 days of service time, the lowest it’s been in a decade.</p>
<p>The previous Pirates regime pushed back on the perception that they would manipulate a player’s service time to save money, with former general manager Neal Huntington offering some rather strong comments last June.</p>
<p>“That's probably a little overblown from some prior years,” Huntington said of the Pirates possibly manipulating service time. “I’d even say that some guys who we took criticism for not bringing them up, we then took criticism for bringing them up too early."</p>
<p>It’s not yet known how this new group will function, although Hayes could give us our first look. It’s also a bit of a different year because there will be only 60 games played over 66 days.</p>
<p><strong>The 2020 factors</strong></p>
<p>In a normal year, a full year of service time equals 172 days, meaning a player would have to spend 61 of 66 days in 2020 to earn that same amount.</p>
<p>If the Pirates want to avoid this happening with Hayes — and thus taking a step toward him becoming Super 2 eligible — they could keep him in Altoona, have him work out with their taxi squad and not call him up until July 29 or later.</p>
<p>It’s sort of a raw deal for Hayes — relatively speaking, of course — who would receive no MLB service time in Altoona and would earn his minor league salary plus a stipend of $108.50/day.</p>
<p><strong>The outlook</strong></p>
<p>What the Pirates could do here might sound brutal or cheap, but it’s actually closer to an example of general manager Ben Cherington making a responsible decision.</p>
<p>The short-term and narrow view says the Pirates should care about now, about the tossup that this season might be. Forget money; the best player should play. Well, the longer view might be more prudent, especially when it comes to a sustained model for winning.</p>
<p>Think about it like this: The Pirates could either play Hayes, ignore the future and wind up with a $3 million price tag in 2023. Or they could stall, keep his salary for 2023 well under $1 million and then go through arbitration from 2024-26, when Hayes is in his prime — and the Pirates are theoretically better.</p>
<p>The Pirates could also bypass all of this by signing Hayes to a long-term extension, but thus far there’s been no indication those talks have gone anywhere.</p>
<p>It’s also difficult for Hayes to put up meaningful, mind-changing numbers when the Pirates are limited to intrasquad work and three exhibition contests — meaning Hayes won’t have a normal spring training to force anyone’s hand.</p>
<p>So while it might infuriate the fan base to rely more on the defensively deficient Moran, which was something of a newsy item delivered by Shelton on Wednesday, an argument could also be made that right now, it’s simply not worth it to start Hayes’ clock.</p>
