<h1>Trump Taps John Ratcliffe for Director of National Intelligence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON â€” President Donald Trump announced on Friday that he intended to nominate Rep. John Ratcliffe, R-Texas, as his director of national intelligence, choosing someone he considered last summer before senior Republicans in Congress deemed him unqualified for the job.</p>
<p>Mr. Ratcliffe is a vocal supporter of the president who serves on the House Intelligence Committee. If confirmed, he would replace Richard Grenell, whom Trump put in charge of American intelligence agencies this month on an acting basis. The job has been vacant since Dan Coats stepped down on Aug. 15.</p>
<p>It is unclear whether Mr. Ratcliffe could be confirmed by the Senate. When Trump floated his name last summer, some Republicans, including Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told White House officials that Ratcliffe was too partisan for the position, according to people familiar with the discussions.</p>
