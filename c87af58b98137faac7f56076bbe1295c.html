<h1>Friendship native Wendy Willis involved in Oscar-winning ‘Hair Love’ animated short</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Watching the Oscars telecast Sunday at home with her husband and dog, there was a moment when Wendy Willis became, well, completely animated.</p>
<p>“And the Oscar goes to …”</p>
<p>“I screamed,” said Ms. Willis, 42, who grew up in Friendship and graduated from North Catholic High School.</p>
<p>Ms. Willis is head of development at Six Point Harness, the Los Angeles animation company that produced all of the animation for “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNw8V_Fkw28" target="_blank">Hair Love</a>.”</p>
<p>The seven-minute Sony Pictures Animation film, a Kickstarter-funded project that became a viral sensation, won the Academy Award for animated short. Its victory, she said, was a victory for all involved.</p>
<p>“Hair Love” was written and directed by former NFL wide receiver Matthew A. Cherry, who wrote a New York Times bestselling children’s book of the same name.</p>
<p>Zuri, a young African American girl, is trying to style her abundance of natural curls. Even with the help of an online beauty guru, she cannot tame her hair.</p>
<p>Her father, Stephen, is clearly out of his depth as he gives it a shot.</p>
<p>It’s a touching film that celebrates hair love among people of color. In addition, Stephen is a strong figure of black parenthood as he and Zuri work together to create a new style for an important occasion. He also wears his hair in dreads.</p>

<p>Mr. Cherry brought as his guest to the Dolby Theatre a young African American high school student, DeAndre Arnold. Mr.&nbsp;Arnold was told by his Texas school district that, following a dress policy change, he would not be permitted to walk in his graduation ceremony if he didn’t cut his dreadlocks.</p>
<p>“We wanted to normalize black hair,” said Mr. Cherry after he and Karen Rupert Toliver accepted the statuettes. Ms. Toliver is a senior vice president of development for Sony animation.</p>
<p>An executive at Monkeypaw, Jordan Peele’s production company, Mr. Cherry turned to Kickstarter in the summer of 2017 to raise funds for what he hoped would be a 3D animated film. He is also a director of outside projects, including ABC’s&nbsp;“black-ish.”</p>
<p>Although the original goal was to raise $75,000, by the end of the campaign $284,000 was in the coffers.</p>
<p>“They raised a lot of money, but not a whole lot,” Ms. Willis said. Her job as one of the project managers involved keeping tabs on financing. “We convinced them that 2D was the way to do it,” she added.</p>

<p>Six Point Harness kept track of production and quality control, among other challenges. Ms. Willis said, “Everyone worked incredibly hard, and we are really proud of [‘Hair Love’]. It was a labor of love. People would work their day jobs and come to 6 Point at night.</p>
<p>“It was so cool to see how people rallied to get it all done.”</p>
<p>Ms. Willis’ company has a long list of clients in film, television (“Adventure Time,” “black-ish”) and commercials (KIA automobiles). She more recently worked with her husband, Brendan Burch, on an original animation series called “Apollo Gauntlet,” which airs on Adult Swim.</p>
<p>Ms. Willis, 42, said she hasn’t spent much time back in Pittsburgh since leaving, but she does miss it. After trying classes at the University of Pittsburgh, she decided to move out to California in 1997, where she worked as an assistant to Castle Shannon native Jimmy Miller, an agent, a producer and a principal of the Mosaic Media Group.</p>
<p>From there it was New York City and a job at “Saturday Night Live.”</p>
<p>“But that was right around the [2007-08] writers strike,” Ms. Willis said, “and when that happened, the show shut down and I lost my job.”</p>
<p>She returned to Los Angeles and Mosaic, where she met Mr. Burch. “It was mostly live action [film] there, but I was always the person at Mosaic who was most interested in animation.”</p>
<p>Although the Oscars are over, there is still celebration in the works:&nbsp;“I think we’re doing a big party soon.”</p>
