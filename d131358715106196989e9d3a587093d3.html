<p>A McKees Rocks woman was arrested Tuesday after her 3-year-old was hospitalized after eating a drug-laced gummy worm and having cocaine in his system.</p>
<p>Darlena Johnson, 29, was charged with child endangerment after her toddler was taken to UPMC Childrenâ€™s Hospital of Pittsburgh with symptoms of lethargy and twitching on Jan. 14, a criminal complaint said. Ms. Johnson told police the child had eaten a gummy worm that she bought from a gas station, but then later confessed that she had bought the candy off the street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A hospital urine test showed positive results for THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), and a more comprehensive drug screen also revealed the child had cocaine in his system.&nbsp;The child has been released from the hospital in stable condition, Allegheny County police said.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Ms. Johnson is set for Feb. 18.&nbsp;</p>
