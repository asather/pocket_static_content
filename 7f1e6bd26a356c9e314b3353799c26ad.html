<h1>Westinghouse, other PPS schools get new principals</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools board has named a new principal at Westinghouse Academy 6-12 after the school’s previous top administrator took another job in the district following an alleged altercation with a student.</p>
<p>Stephen Sereda, who has served as interim principal at Westinghouse since October, will take the position full-time starting July 1.</p>
<p>“The opportunity and great responsibility to lead Pittsburgh&nbsp;Westinghouse is humbling and is an opportunity I will never&nbsp;take for granted,” Mr. Sereda said in a statement on Thursday. “I look forward to working with students,&nbsp;parents, alumni, community members and teachers to provide&nbsp;the high-quality educational experience that our kids deserve.”</p>
<p>Mr. Sereda joined the district in May 2018 as coordinator of instructional effectiveness in the Office of Professional Development. Later that year, he became an assistant principal at Westinghouse.</p>
<p>Mr. Sereda earned a bachelor’s degree in elementary education from Slippery Rock&nbsp;University, a master’s degree in education from Ashford University, and a Pennsylvania administrator K-12&nbsp;certification from California University of Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Sereda took over the school after its previous principal,&nbsp;Bernard Taylor Jr., was placed on administrative leave after being accused of abusing a student.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV reported in September that Javonda Thomas said the incident with Mr. Taylor occurred after her 14-year-old daughter got into a fight with another girl.</p>
<p>When a school guard broke up the fight, Ms. Thomas told KDKA, Mr. Taylor grabbed the girl by the collar, dragged her down the sidewalk and up cement steps, and then slammed her onto the floor inside the school. She said&nbsp;her daughter, who was in eighth grade, injured her back.</p>
<p>The district initiated an investigation into the incident, but the findings were not released.</p>
<p>After the investigation, Mr. Taylor moved to the&nbsp;the district’s Office of School Performance&nbsp;and became principal of special assignments.</p>
<p>The school board also announced it appointed principals at three other schools.</p>
<p>Michael Perella, who began his Pittsburgh Public Schools career in 1998 as a teacher at Reizenstein Middle School, will be the principal at Westwood K-5. Mr. Perella has&nbsp;served in multiple leadership positions around the district, including principal at Whittier K-5, Concord K-5,&nbsp;Roosevelt PreK-5 and King PreK-8.</p>
<p>Additionally, David May was appointed as principal of the Gifted Center, and&nbsp;Edward Littlehale was named principal at Fulton K-5.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the appointments will be effective July 1.&nbsp;</p>
