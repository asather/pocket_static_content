<h1>Westmoreland County fires deputy director of election bureau</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With the Nov. 3 election just over a month away, Westmoreland County commissioners have fired the county’s election bureau deputy director&nbsp;this week.</p>
<p>Westmoreland County Commissioner Douglas Chew confirmed with the Post-Gazette on Thursday night that Scott Sistek, who served as the deputy director for over a month, is no longer a county employee as of this week. Mr. Chew said he had been on suspended paid leave, then suspended unpaid leave and has now been removed from his position this week.</p>
<p>Both Mr. Chew and fellow county Commissioner Gina Cerilli declined to comment on the exact reason for Mr. Sistek’s departure, citing personnel matters.</p>
<p>In August, Mr. Sistek was appointed the deputy director of the county’s election bureau after the department’s director, Beth Lechman, resigned in July. Mr. Sistek is currently the mayor of New Stanton after the former mayor Ronald Echard died in early September.&nbsp;His term expires on Dec. 31, 2021, according to New Stanton’s official website.</p>
<p>Mr. Chew stated that Mr. Sistek’s departure was not a political move.</p>
<p>“There is nothing political about any hirings or resignations or terminations we do at the courthouse,” Mr. Chew said.</p>
<p>As Mr. Sistek’s departure has left a vacancy for the position, Mr. Chew said the commissioners have not yet found a new candidate for the job nor have an exact timeline of when the position would be filled.</p>
<p>Despite the opening, Mr. Chew said he has&nbsp;“110% faith” in current election bureau director&nbsp;JoAnn Sebastiani and does not believe Mr. Sistek’s departure will impact operations.</p>
<p>“As far as impact, I don’t see any reason that a vacancy here — whether short or long — would have an impact on our ability to follow the letter and spirit of the voting statutes.” Mr. Chew said.</p>
<p>Mr. Chew said the county has contracted with a&nbsp;“fully staffed” third-party vendor to handle the bulk of the mail-in and absentee ballots and their processing.</p>
<p>“[The county election bureau’s] essential responsibility is to get the list of requested ballots to this company every day at the end of the business day and the next day their machines and processors will run the copies, run the insertions into the envelope and to directly deliver them to the sorting facility post office in Allegheny County,” Mr. Chew said.</p>
