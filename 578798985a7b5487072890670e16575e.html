<h1>Represent all</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In my humble opinion, I think the November election is a black-and-white election. On one side, I see the forces of Donald Trump, a performer, trying to make our country a dominant white-male society, as it was in the past.</p>
<p>On the other side, I see Joe Biden, a legislator, representing people of every color and background, who want to expand the application of civil rights for all in this country, the future.</p>
<p>This election will be decided by how many people of all backgrounds want to fulfill the promise of our Constitution and vote.</p>
