<h1>Korry Myers, Johnny Crise lead Highlands to WPIAL championship</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The previous time the Highlands High School boys basketball team won a WPIAL championship was in 1995. So the Rams celebrated the silver anniversary with some gold.</p>
<p>The WPIAL placed gold medals around the Rams’ necks after they won the WPIAL Class 4A championship Saturday afternoon, 72-54, against Belle Vernon at Petersen Events Center.</p>
<p>Twenty-five years ago, Highlands beat Blackhawk for the WPIAL title on a shot with 6 seconds left by Greg Koprivnikar. But this time, it wasn’t nearly so hard for the Rams to bring the championship trophy back to Natrona Heights. This one was basically over in the third quarter when Highlands broke open a close game and led by as many as 23 points in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Highlands (22-3), the No. 1 seed, rode the one-two punch of seniors Johnny Crise and Korry Myers. Crise, a 6-foot-6 forward who plans to play football at Penn State next year as a walk-on, had 23 points and 15 rebounds, along with a few dunks. The marksman Myers had 18 points, all on 3-pointers.</p>
<p>“This is definitely a great feeling because the past couple years we came so close,” Crise said. “To finally get here and show what we had, it’s just a great feeling to come out on top.”</p>
<p>Myers became a WPIAL champ one day after his cousin, Tess Myers, won her fourth championship as a starter on the North Catholic girls team. Korry Myers’ shooting torched Belle Vernon’s zone defense, one game after he didn’t get many shots against Blackhawk in the semifinals. He made 6 of 9 3-pointers in the first three quarters against Belle Vernon.</p>
<p>“[Blackhawk] face-guarded me the whole game,” Myers said. “So we said going into this game that the gun, in essence, was full and ready to go. And it came out.”</p>
<p>Sparked by sophomore point guard Devin Whitlock, Belle Vernon (19-7) took a 22-20 lead in the second quarter in its first championship game appearance since 1978. But Highlands outscored the Leopards, 12-2, the rest of the half to take a 32-24 advantage. Highlands carried the momentum into the second half, going on a 14-5 run to take a 46-29 lead. Belle Vernon never got closer than 11 points the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Myers said his eyes widened with pleasure when he saw Belle Vernon come out in a zone defense. Highlands coach Tyler Stoczynski said, “We’ve gotten a mix of defenses this year. When teams zone us, it actually helps us a little bit because it makes us play more like a team. With the zone, it’s really a truly team effort and it’s not a one-on-one thing. We were ready for it, guys stepped up and made shots. That’s senior leadership right there.”</p>
<p>While Belle Vernon had trouble slowing down Highlands, the Leopards’ other biggest problem was shooting. They made only 33% of their shots (12 of 36) in the first three quarters. Belle Vernon finished only 38% (20 of 53) from the field, 16 percent (4 of 25) from 3-point range. Highlands, meanwhile, shot 59 percent (27 of 46).</p>
<p>Whitlock led the Leopards with 25 points. Senior forward Mitch Pohlot had 10 points and 11 rebounds.</p>
<p>“We couldn’t put the ball in the hole,” Belle Vernon coach Joe Salvino said. “When you can’t score against a team like that, it takes its toll sooner or later.”</p>
<p>Stoczynski brought Highlands a title in his eighth year as coach.</p>
<p>“Basketball has to be fun and today is the funnest day of basketball that there is,” Stoczynski said. “We’re going to enjoy this, sleep in and we’re going to start getting ready [for the PIAA playoffs] on Monday.”</p>
