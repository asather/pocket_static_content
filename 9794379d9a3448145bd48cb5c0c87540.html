<h1>Defensive decline continues as Penguins lose to the Sabres</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After Thursday’s no-show in Toronto against the run-and-gun Maple Leafs, Mike Sullivan acknowledged the Penguins in recent weeks have lacked the commitment to defense that made them so tough to beat in December and January.</p>
<p>The coach doubled down a day later after a practice at PPG Paints Arena.</p>
<p>“I do think our overall team defense needs to be stingier,” Sullivan said then. “I wouldn’t pinpoint a respective zone. ... I think it’s the full sheet of ice.”</p>
<p>About 24 hours later, Sullivan fumed on the bench as he watched his players make critical errors in all three zones while handing out a 3-0 lead to the Buffalo Sabres before the first beer was spilled in the PPG Paints Arena bleachers.</p>
<p>The Penguins were unable to recover, ultimately losing, 5-2, to the Sabres.</p>
<p>Zemgus Girgensons scored just 14 seconds in after Evgeni Malkin lost the puck behind the net and Kyle Okposo found Girgensons alone in front. With 13:12 left in the first period, Kris Letang coughed up the puck at his blue line, leading to a Sam Reinhart breakaway. He popped a shot over Tristan Jarry’s blocker.</p>
<p>Four minutes, two more breakdowns and one ping off the post later, a frustrated Malkin shattered the stick of Girgensons in the offensive zone, putting the Sabres on the power play. Jack Eichel whipped a shot past Jarry to make it 3-0.</p>
<p>As the Sabres celebrated and fans at PPG Paints Arena murmured, Sullivan took his timeout, using the full 30 seconds to give the Penguins a tongue-lashing.</p>
<p>Given their steady rise up the standings, their recent defensive lapses had largely been overlooked by those outside the organization. But Sullivan’s anger has been simmering since the Penguins returned from the All-Star break Jan. 31.</p>
<p>In their 10 games since, seven times now the Penguins have surrendered 10 or more high-danger scoring chances in a game, per NaturalStatTrick.com. They had just seven such showings among the previous 39 games before the break.</p>
<p>“Our team’s at its best when we are defending up the ice with our puck pursuit and making it hard for teams to come through the neutral zone with any sort of speed or continuity,” Sullivan said Friday. “I don’t think we’ve been as good.”</p>
<p>He added: “When we spend time in the offensive zone, whether we have the puck or we don’t, it’s an indication that we’re on top of our game. I don’t think we’ve controlled territory as much as we’re capable of the last few weeks.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t help that the Penguins are without Brian Dumoulin and John Marino, two of their top four defensemen, though they could return soon.</p>
<p>The Sabres reached double digits in high-danger chances in the second period.</p>
<p>They pulled away from the Penguins in the third period. Jeff Skinner got position on rookie Sam Lafferty and poked a pass through Jarry’s pads. Then, Eichel scored another power-play goal with another wicked wrister to put them up, 5-1.</p>
<p>Malkin got a measure of redemption with a pair of goals. The first came in the second period when he picked up a loose puck, danced around a defender then snapped a shot inside the post. He slid in his second in garbage time.</p>
<p>The Penguins had dominated the Sabres in recent years. But the Sabres, whom they hosted in their opener, have won both games in Pittsburgh this season.</p>
<p>The Penguins will visit the rival Washington Capitals on Sunday before heading out west for games in Los Angeles, Anaheim and San Jose later in the week.</p>
