<h1>Summer opera company reschedules for the fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh is home to two opera companies, Pittsburgh Opera and Pittsburgh Festival Opera. The larger Pittsburgh Opera typically mounts up to six productions in a year during the fall, winter and spring.&nbsp;The latter hosts a summer festival in July that includes concerts, full productions and workshops for aspiring singers.</p>
<p>With COVID-19 closing down summer festivals around the country, Pittsburgh Festival Opera has faced a difficult decision on whether to cancel its festival or try to salvage some of the programming. In the hope that the fall will bring about more relaxed restrictions, the company has bumped two of its operas — Wagner’s “Siegfried and Gotterdammerung in Concert” and “Virgula Divina” by composer Karen Brown and librettist Jessica Lanay into the fall. The company’s other two productions, Leoncavallo’s “Pagliacci” and Adamo’s “Lysistrata” have been rescheduled for the summer of 2021.</p>
<p>“Of course we don’t ever want to put anything on top of another performance in the fall and we planned this carefully,” said Marianne Cornetti, a world-renowned singer and the artistic director of Pittsburgh Festival Opera.</p>
<p>Additionally, the company’s June gala has been postponed indefinitely. The young artist portion of the festival has been moved online. The program will culminate in a virtual performance, and the company is currently exploring possibilities for screening the finale concert.&nbsp;Ms. Cornetti said that artists contracted for the summer will receive at least a portion of their fee.</p>
<p>Ticket holders and subscribers are entitled to a full refund, or they can donate the cost of the ticket to the company for a tax credit. Email <a href="mailto:info@pittsburghfestivalopera.org" target="_blank">info@pittsburghfestivalopera.org</a>&nbsp;for more information.</p>
