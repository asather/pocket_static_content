<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joe Hughes, local district director of organizing for the International Union of Painters and Allied Trades, leads a rally Friday through PPG Plaza in Downtown. The rally was to&nbsp;protest a digital service owned by PPG that matches paint contractors with commercial paint jobs. The union — which is asking consumers to boycott PPG brands. including Glidden, Olympic and Pittsburgh Paints — said the service is an “Uber-like” platform that threatens to lower wages and safety standards for painters and related workers in the finishing trades.</p>
