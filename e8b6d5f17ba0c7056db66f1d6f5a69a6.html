<h1>Riverhounds SC's home opener gets national broadcast slot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Riverhounds SC’s national television schedule is continuing to grow.</p>
<p>The club announced Thursday that its home opener slated for July 22 against Indy Eleven will air at 7 p.m. on ESPN2. It will be the Riverhounds’ first game at Highmark Stadium since their playoff loss in November and the first regular season pro sports game or match held in Pittsburgh since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns in March.</p>
<p>Fans will not be permitted for the contest, and the club is working with health and government officials at the state and local levels to determine when they might be welcomed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A national broadcast for the season opener at Louisville City FC on July 12 was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/soccer/2020/06/30/pittsburgh-riverhounds-fc-louisville-city-espn2-usl-championship/stories/202006300117" target="_blank">announced earlier in the week</a>. That match will also air on ESPN2 at 5 p.m. No other USL Championship team has been scheduled for as many national TV appearances so far.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The rest of the <a href="https://www.riverhounds.com/game-schedule" target="_blank">Riverhounds’ schedule</a> was announced later Thursday. Their 16-game slate will include three matches each against Hartford Athletic, Loudoun United FC, New York Red Bulls II and Philadelphia Union II, the other members of their regional division aimed at reducing travel during the pandemic. The top two teams in the division will qualify for the playoffs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The televised games are two of the four that will be played outside of the division. The others will come in a rematch against Indy Eleven on Aug. 15 and St. Louis FC on Aug. 22.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The regular season is schedule to end Oct. 3 with a home matchup against Philadelphia.&nbsp;</p>
