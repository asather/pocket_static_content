<h1>Women charged with throwing things at police during protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh police have charged two women with riot, striking a police animal, throwing a projectile and disorderly conduct during a protest in East Liberty on Monday, according to criminal complaints filed Thursday.</p>
<p>The complaints allege that the two suspects, Abigail Rubio and Natalie Lewis threw water bottles from a fourth floor apartment balcony at Essex House Apartments on Centre Avenue at police during a protest over the death of George Floyd on Monday. The bottles did not strike the officers.</p>
<p>The women have denied the accusation and claim that police are attempting to intimidate them after they shared video of police firing an irritant at peaceful protesters. Police have said they were firing beanbags and sponge rounds because officers saw a group of protesters breaking storefronts and throwing projectiles at officers.</p>
<p>Police say they have video evidence that identified Ms. Rubio and Ms. Lewis as the women on the balcony, according to the complaints.</p>
