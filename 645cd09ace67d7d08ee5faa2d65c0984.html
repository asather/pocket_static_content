<h1>Tree of Life Rabbi Myers speaks out against racism following death of George Floyd</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The&nbsp;Tree of Life/Or L’Simcha Congregation on Monday said it is “horrified” by the murder of George Floyd whose death came at the hands of a Minneapolis officer last week and has since sparked national outrage and protests.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to its Facebook page Monday, Rabbi Jeffrey Myers decried racism and called for everyone to work harder to&nbsp;“obliterate” it.&nbsp;Tree of Life was one of three Squirrel Hill-based congregations that suffered the worst anti-Semitic attack in U.S. history in October 2018.</p>
<p>“We reach out to our African-American friends in this time of pain as our country grieves his death and condemns the scourge of systemic racism,” the statement reads. “... Racism in every form must be stopped.”</p>
<p>Rabbi Myers quoted the late Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s book “Strength to Love,” and called for the elimination of “H in our lives.” He previously said he stopped using the word&nbsp;“hate” due to the weight of its offensiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“‘Darkness cannot drive out darkness, only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate, only love can do that.’ All of us have the capacity to love more especially at a time like this. If we all did just one thing out of love to eliminate racism, that would be a great start,” Rabbi Myers said.</p>
<p>A medical examiner on Monday classified Mr. Floyd’s death as a homicide, stating his heart stopped as police restrained him and suppressed his neck, which was seen in a viral video that has sparked protests across the nation over the weekend. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with third-degree murder in Mr. Floyd’s death, and three other officers have been fired.</p>
<p>Bystander video showed Mr. Chauvin holding his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, despite the man’s cries that he could not breathe, until he eventually stopped moving.</p>
