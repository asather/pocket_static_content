<h1>Basketball hightlights: Thomas Jefferson, Trinity guards eclipse 1,000-point milestone</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Both Thomas Jefferson senior guard Alyssa DeAngelo and Trinity senior guard Riley DeRubbo eclipsed the 1,000-point plateau Monday when the two teams met to battle for second place in Class 5A Section 1.</p>
<p>And when the dust settled, it was the Hillers who finished directly behind undefeated Chartiers Valley after the first half of the section slate.</p>
<p>DeRubbo finished with a game-high 20 and Courtney Dahlquist scored seven of her 13 in the fourth quarter as No. 2 Trinity (10-2, 6-1) broke open what was a tight game at halftime and rolled to a 61-50 victory over No. 3 Thomas Jefferson (10-4, 5-2) in their first meeting of the season.</p>
<p>DeAngelo finished with nine points to give her 1,003 in her career, but only had two points in the second half. Graci Fairman led the Jaguars with 16.</p>
<p>DeRubbo now has 1,002 points in her career.</p>
