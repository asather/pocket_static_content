<h1>State Department of Health cites three area nursing homes for deficiencies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The state Department of Health announced Saturday it has issued sanctions against 10 nursing homes, including two provisional licenses, for problems from inspections last year.</p>
<p>Sanctions against homes in Western Pennsylvania include a provisional license for the&nbsp;Twin Lakes Rehabilitation and Healthcare Center in Westmoreland County and fines against two others.</p>
<p>Although concerns have been raised about nursing homes because a large number of the state’s deaths from COVID-19 have occurred there, these inspections occurred before the pandemic and have nothing to do with the virus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Twin Lakes, in Greensburg, was cited following an inspection Aug. 8 and also was fined $8,750. In a 113-page report, an inspector cited problems that included allowing an inappropriate patient to self-medicate, not storing and labeling medication properly and dirty kitchen facilities.</p>
<p>A provisional license means the facility has failed to correct items found during an inspection and it can be inspected every six months rather than yearly. After three provisional licenses, a facility can be closed.</p>
<p>The agency also fined Baldwin Health Center $7,500 after a Sept. 22 inspection for medication that wasn’t marked appropriately and for not maintaining a proper infection control program, among other things.</p>
<p>Uniontown Healthcare and Rehabilitation Center was fined $13,750 following an Oct. 7 inspection for not providing proper monitoring for at least one patient injured in a fall.</p>
<p>Overall, fines for sanctions at 10 homes across the state totaled $93,500. The facilities all have agreed to pay the fines.</p>
