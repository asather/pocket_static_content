<h1>Western Pa. golfers still have some options to play</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Unlike their neighboring states, public golf courses and driving ranges in Western Pennsylvania have complied with Gov. Tom Wolf’s order to shut all non-life-sustaining businesses.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean all golfers here cannot find places to play.</p>
<p>Some private clubs, even though they have closed their pro shops and dining areas, have been allowing members to walk and play their course. It remains to be seen if that will change with the governor’s latest stay-at-home decree and his rejection of a request from the state’s golf associations to allow their member clubs to stay open.</p>
<p>Also, public and resort courses in Ohio and West Virginia have not been ordered to shut down and remain open for play, meaning some facilities in northeastern Ohio are likely to be flooded with golfers from Western Pennsylvania as long as Gov. Wolf’s order remain in effect.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine informed the Northeast Ohio Golf Association on Monday that all golf courses in their state can remain open, even though he issued a stay-at-home order a day earlier. However, some Ohio courses are getting mixed signals from the government and have elected for now to shut down, popular places such as Firestone Farms in Columbiana, Ohio and Reserve Run in Poland, Ohio.</p>
<p>All that has done is create confusion among the local golf community. Not only are other nearby states allowing their courses to remain open, but Pennsylvania has allowed parks to remain open, as well as encourage biking and walking as much-needed fresh-air activities, so long as social distancing is practiced. So why not golf?</p>
<p>“We feel like it’s an activity people can do and be outside and there’s different things we can do so they don’t have to touch things,” said Travis Lindsay, owner of Birdsfoot Golf Club in Freeport. “We felt we could help the community with mental health. It’s a needed service we can provide.”</p>
<p>Lindsay closed Birdsfoot even before Gov. Wolf’s issued his non-life-sustaining business order on Friday. Cranberry Highlands Golf Course, which is owned by the municipality, also shut down before then. Olde Stonewall Golf Club in Ellwood City had not yet opened to the public, though it did allow its members to play.</p>
<p>Many of the courses that had remained open took a number of measures to ensure the health of golfers and their own workers. That included having golfers book their tee times online and paying with a credit card; also, they removed such things as flagsticks and bunker rakes from the course. Some places kept the flagsticks but told golfers not to remove them. Others raised the plastic white cup inside the hole 2 inches above the ground and considered any putt to hit the elevated cup as good.</p>
<p>“We were taking all the precautions,” said PGA professional Sam Depe III, who owns Hickory Heights Golf Club in Bridgeville. “We pulled all our flagsticks, took the rakes out and we hosed down all our carts with industrial cleaner, top to bottom, after every round. And if someone wanted to ride in a cart by themselves, we would accommodate them as much as possible.”</p>
<p>“Golf course owners were calling each other, figuring out what to do,” Lindsay said. “Truth is, everybody wants to do the right thing and help as much as they can. All the golf course owners want to do whatever it takes to be safe. We want people to be able to come and feel good about it.”</p>
<p>Even going to a driving range and hitting balls is not an option. Popular spots as Scally’s, Cool Springs, Vietmeier’s, Ironwood and the Robert Morris University Golf Dome have all closed.</p>
<p>Country-club golfers have not faced the same restrictions. While all private clubs have closed their pro shops and dining areas, in some instances members are still allowed to walk and carry their bags. That was the case at Oakmont Country Club — one of golf’s most storied and famous venues — though caddies are not provided and have been told to stay at home. That could change with the governor’s latest order.</p>
<p>One of the exceptions is the Club at Nevillewood in Collier, which has told its members they are not allowed on the course. Nevillewood petitioned the governor’s office to allow members to walk and carry their own bag, citing doctors and medical personnel at the club who extol the exercise and mental-health benefits of golf. The request was rejected.</p>
<p>That hasn’t affected other areas of the eastern seaboard. Resorts such as Kiawah (S.C.) Island, site of the 2021 PGA championship; and PGA National in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., site of the PGA Tour’s Honda Classic, remain open for play. Same with the Stadium Course at TPC Sawgrass in Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla., which only 10 days ago canceled the Players Championship after the first round. Many of the daily-fee courses in Myrtle Beach, S.C., a popular spring destination, remain open.</p>
<p>Golf has been affected at all levels, including the professional tour.</p>
<p>The Masters (April 9-12) and PGA Championship (May 14-17), the first two majors of the season, have already been postponed and no future date has been determined for reschedule.</p>
<p>Uncertainty still surrounds the U.S. Open (June 18-21) at Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, N.Y., because of its location in Westchester Country, one of the hardest-hit areas for COVID-19.</p>
<p>The PGA Tour has canceled seven tournaments through the AT&amp;T Byron Nelson Classic on May 10 after deciding to shut down the Players Championship, its flagship event, after one round. The tour has also shut down its other sanctioned tours — Champions, Korn Ferry, Latin America — as well.</p>
<p>The two main local organizations — Tri-State PGA, which represents club professionals; and Western Pennsylvania Golf Association, which governs amateur golf — have been affected by the shutdown. The Tri-State section has already postponed four of its events in April; the WPGA does not start its tournament schedule until May 12, but the 36-hole qualifier for the U.S. Women’s Open on May 5 at Shannopin and the local 18-hole qualifier for the U.S. Open on May 6 at Butler are subject to adjustments by the United States Golf Association.</p>
<p>Those two organizations, along with the Pennsylvania Golf Association and the Philadelphia Golf Association, wrote letters to Gov. Wolf and state lobbyists seeking to solicit exemptions for courses to remain open. Those requests were denied.</p>
<p>But there was some good news. The governor’s office did inform the organizations that all landscape and course maintenance operations are considered “essential services,” meaning courses are allowed to have their grounds staff cut grass and maintain the layout well enough so that little work has to be done when they can finally reopen.</p>
<p>“Nobody wants the grass to grow out of control,” said Olde Stonewall course superintendent Rich D’Ambrosio.”We do things this time of year that gets us through the summer. It’s definitely good that we can go out and get some things done, just to keep things manageable. You can’t just flip a switch and, boom, we’re open, the course is ready to go if we weren’t able to touch anything.”</p>
<p>So far, courses in the tri-state area have not felt an economic impact because play this time of year is generally slow anyway because of wet, spring weather. What’s more, the mild winter gave some public facilities a chance to open in January and February and generate early revenue. Typically, those are months where courses would have snow or frost problems.</p>
<p>The financial crunch will come later if and when large groups or outings start canceling their events scheduled for the spring because of COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The majority of golf outings in our area, like your area, aren’t scheduled until after Memorial Day,” said PGA professional Jimmy Hanlin, who owns two courses — Little Mountain and Stonewater — in northeastern Ohio. “But it’s coming.”</p>
