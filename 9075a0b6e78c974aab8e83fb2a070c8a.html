<h1>Scott Township pool to open for 2020</h1>

<p>After a motion to open the Scott Township Pool died in a 4-4 vote on June 9, Scott commissioners at Tuesday’s meeting voted 4-3 to open the township’s pool for the summer. The tentative opening is set for July 7.</p>
<p>Commissioners Stacey Altman, Eileen Meyers, Thomas Castello and Angela Wateska voted in favor of opening the pool. Dave Calabria, Kathy Gazda and Bill Wells opposed. Former commissioner Paul Abel resigned last week after comments he made at a previous meeting directed toward Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine.</p>
<p>Ms. Meyers made the motion at the meeting to open the pool. The board had been set to ratify the closure of the pool, but the motion on the agenda was amended by Ms. Meyers to instead open the pool.</p>

<p>In her motion, she made the stipulation that the pool would only open provided the township was able to find enough lifeguards. Additionally, the pool would close by the third week of August.</p>
<p>“If we can’t get the lifeguards, it’s not going to open,” Ms. Meyers said.</p>
<p>Co-parks and recreation directors Kelli Watson and Steph McFerron said they would start looking for lifeguards immediately.</p>
<p>“I was not in favor of opening the pool for fear of the virus. My main concern was the safety of residents,” Mr. Calabria said.</p>
<p>Township manager Denise Fitzgerald said it will take nearly a week to fill the pool and added that the township will lose money this year by opening it. In a typical year, the pool costs about $383,000 to operate.</p>
<p>When the pool opens, it will only be open to Scott residents and those residents will have to sign up for a time slot each day online and sign a waiver. There will be four time slots per day with one hour of cleaning per Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines between each time slot. The pool will also be split up into three zones with 75 people permitted per zone.</p>
<p>The pool’s bucket, slides, diving boards and other structures will be closed as well as the concession stand. A COVID team will be hired along with the lifeguards; the COVID team will be responsible for monitoring social distancing and cleaning and disinfecting.</p>
