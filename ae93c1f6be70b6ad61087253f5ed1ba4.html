<h1>Peters council clears way for development on Venetia Road</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A public hearing was held prior to the Monday Peters Township Council meeting to receive comment about a proposed office/​warehouse development on 1.86 acres at 430 Venetia Road.</p>
<p>The owner of the property, Five Hundred Nineteen Properties LLC, of Canonsburg, filed a conditional use application with the township in order to develop the parcel into space for local plumbing and electrical contractors.</p>
<p>The site is currently zoned West Venetia Road Mixed-Use Corridor, and office/​warehouse is conditional use in that zoning district.</p>
<p>Up to three buildings consisting of about 4,000 square feet each are proposed for the site.</p>
<p>Some of the conditions the developer must meet to move forward include the installation of a sprinkler system in the building and a fire hydrant outside. Additionally, the exterior front and rear facade must be faced with brick, stone or other suitable material, not just metal.</p>
<p>No one from the public commented during the hearing.</p>
<p>The matter will go to the township’s planning commission and then back to council for a final vote.</p>
<p>Other business:</p>
<p>Council approved a settlement agreement with Edward and Susan Courtney concerning a structure at 214 Valley Brook Road. The settlement, handed down in Commonwealth Court on Jan. 13, states Mr. and Mrs. Courtney have 60 days to demolish the long-vacant building and are solely responsible for removing debris from the property.</p>
<p>Council approved the purchase of a Ford Explorer from C. Harper for use by the chief of police at a cost of $39,329. The vehicle will replace an existing police car.</p>
<p>Council also voted to amend the township’s personnel manual to create two new jobs — fire captain and media specialist.</p>
