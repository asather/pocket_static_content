<h1>Court deals blow to robocallers </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Supreme Court struck a blow for consumers by upholding a law banning robocalls to cellphones. The July 6 decision won’t stop robocalls; what it will do is make clear that regulators and prosecutors can go after the worst offenders.</p>
<p>As a further bonus, the court struck down an exception that allowed robocalls from organizations trying to collect debt owed to the federal government.</p>
<p>With the new tools and certainty about the law, the Federal Communications Commission should further crack down on those annoying, time-consuming calls.</p>
<p>Political consultants challenged the robocall law because they hoped to further bombard people with robocalls advocating for candidates and issues. The consultants took the position that the ban on <em>any</em> robocalls was illegal as a violation of free speech. Of course, they also pointed out they were being treated differently than callers trying to collect a federal debt.</p>
<p>The court agreed that political calls were being treated differently. Instead of throwing out the law and allowing all robocalls, though, the justices instead threw out the exception for federal government debt collecting. The law banning robocalls to cellphones remains in effect.</p>
<p>While the court’s ruling was based on a 2015 law banning robocalls, the ruling bodes well for an update to the law championed by the current administration. The ruling makes it almost certain that the new law, if challenged, will stand.</p>
<p>In December, President Donald Trump signed a law allowing increased fines for violation of robocalling laws. The new law allows a $10,000 fine for each call and directs the FCC to go after robocalling operations. Also in the new law is a requirement that phone companies identify and block calls from spoof numbers — numbers that seem to be from a legitimate business or government operation but are not.</p>
<p>There are billions of robocalls made every year. And before the current pandemic, the FCC estimated hundreds of thousands of robocalls each day to Americans over the span of less than five minutes.</p>
<p>The FCC must use the law, and the certainty about the law provided by the Supreme Court, to put illegal robocall operations out of business.</p>
