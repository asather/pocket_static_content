<h1>Man leads police on chase through East McKeesport, crashes on bridge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man is facing charges after leading police on a short vehicle chase through East McKeesport and into Wilmerding overnight, police said.</p>
<p>Vincent Strader, 47, whose hometown was not specified in court documents, is facing several felony and traffic charges after fleeing a traffic stop Tuesday around 8:39 p.m. in the 700 block of Fifth Avenue in the borough, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>The driver of a black Chevy Malibu, later identified as Strader, made an “erratic stop” in the middle of the road on Fifth Avenue when police initiated the stop, the complaint said. Police approached the car and asked him to pull over into a nearby parking lot when he fled.&nbsp;Reasons for initiating the traffic stop were not made clear in court records.</p>
<p>Strader sped away in his vehicle — rounding a curve on Fifth Avenue before turning onto the Patton Street Bridge and eventually crashing into a concrete lane divider, the criminal complaint said. Strader, a convicted felon for prior gun charges, drove erratically and reached speeds up to 90 mph during the chase, police said.</p>
<p>He attempted to flee on foot toward Middle Avenue in Wilmerding after crashing but was eventually apprehended. Just prior to being captured, an officer saw him pull what appeared to be a weapon from his waistline and throw it over the Patton Street Bridge, the complaint said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dive teams assisted in finding the object, which turned out to be a holstered pellet gun.</p>
<p>Strader is charged with reckless driving, carrying a firearm without a license, fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer, resisting arrest, railroad protection/vandalism, and other traffic violations.&nbsp;He is currently being held at the Allegheny County Jail.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for July 2 before District Judge&nbsp;Roxanne Sakoian Eichler.</p>
