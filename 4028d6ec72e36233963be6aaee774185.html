<h1>Pirates mailbag: What could the Pirates get in return for Adam Frazier?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Mike Persak’s Pirates mailbag where we’ll answer all your burning questions. Reach Mike on Twitter @MikeDPersak or email him at mpersak@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><strong>Channing Ewing:&nbsp;</strong>What are your thoughts on the season so far? Can the Pirates make a run?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>I love the optimism. My thoughts on the season so far are that the results are what I expected, the way they’ve come about are not.</p>
<p>I thought the offense would be pretty good this year. They’ve started to turn it around recently, but overall, they have struggled.</p>
<p>I thought the bullpen would be decent. It has absolutely not been decent.</p>
<p>I thought the starting rotation would be the weak spot, and lo and behold, that’s been arguably the strongest position group the Pirates have had this year.</p>
<p>As for whether or not they can make a run? Sure, they could. Anybody can. It would require Kyle Crick and Keone Kela returning and being good, Mitch Keller and Joe Musgrove doing the same, JT Brubaker and one of Derek Holland, Steven Brault or Chad Kuhl bumping back to the bullpen to solidify that unit, and the offense staying healthy.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of requirements. The one preseason hunch I did have right was that the Pirates’ depth was not very good, meaning their margin for error was probably small. I think you’ve seen that. With all the injuries they’ve incurred, the backups leave something to be desired in many cases.</p>
<p>So I’m not predicting they make a run. I think they’ll be competitive in games because that starting pitching does seem to be a real asset, but I don’t think the Pirates will have much staying power.</p>
<p><strong>Collin Murphy (@c_murph02):&nbsp;</strong>This season is a wash for the Pirates already. What roster moves the rest of the way would encourage you for next year/the future?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>There we go. To hell with optimism!</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound like a broken record, but I want to see the Pirates call up Ke’Bryan Hayes, Jason Martin, Jared Oliva, players of that ilk.</p>
<p>How long it will take the Pirates to be good, in my opinion, depends on this next group of prospects. The Pirates need to begin figuring out exactly what they have in these players.</p>
<p>Granted, I don’t think a firm answer will materialize from the 30 or so games they’d play in 2020, but game action this season means more readiness for next season, and you can get a clearer picture then.</p>
<p>At the very least, it doesn’t do these players, who are right on the cusp of the majors anyway, much good to spend all year in Altoona.</p>
<p><strong>bus (@rhunt45):&nbsp;</strong>When will we be good</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>I’m always good.</p>
<p>The Pirates, on the other hand, are not always good. But they could be!</p>
<p>Building off that last answer, if you look at the next few years, you can squint and see an infield consisting of some combination of Ke’Bryan Hayes, Nick Gonzales, Oneil Cruz, Kevin Newman and Liover Peguero. Jason Martin, Jared Oliva, Travis Swaggerty, Sammy Siani in the outfield. You can imagine Jameson Taillon, Mitch Keller, Quinn Priester, Brennan Malone, maybe Carmen Mlodzinski in the starting rotation.</p>
<p>There’s some talent there. For all those prospects to pan out to their fullest potential is unlikely, but to know for sure whether they have or not, you’ll probably have to wait until 2023, maybe beyond.</p>
<p>Obviously the players on the current roster aren’t all bad, so they can be good before that if the chips fall in the right place. To me, though, 2023 seems like a fair aiming point for some substantial turnaround.</p>
<p><strong>Zach Szklenski (@ZachSzklenski)&nbsp;</strong>How much do you think they’ll be able to get for [Adam] Frazier?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>Ah, the trade deadline. I have absolutely no idea what to expect this season. I don’t think anybody does. General manager Ben Cherington said he thinks the conversations between teams about trades will be just as prolific as ever, but the actual trades themselves? Who knows.</p>
<p>As for Frazier, I’m not too sure there will be a trade made for him at all. Cherington implied that none of the Pirates are out of trade conversations, so that’s something, but the question to me is how much interest there will be in Frazier. He is controllable, with two more years of arbitration eligibility. That’s a plus. He’s also a good defensive second baseman, and his track record suggests he’ll hit much better than his current .200 batting average and sub-.600 OPS.</p>
<p>The team that might make the most sense as a trade partner could be the San Diego Padres. They are good, squarely in second place in the NL West. Their second baseman, Jurickson Profar, has not been good. Their farm system is exceedingly strong, too. Maybe that makes them more willing to make a trade now.</p>
<p>Either way, with whatever team shows interest in Frazier, the return is tough. There isn’t much recent history in terms of trades for second basemen at the deadline. Even if there was, I’m not sure it would be applicable to this season. What I will say is that I think it’s easy to get a bit overzealous when predicting returns. You see a good defender and career .275 hitter and assume that’s good enough for a potential contender to send away a top-three prospect. That’s not how it normally works.</p>
<p>To me, Frazier seems like a player who could get back a top-10 prospect, but not a top-5 one, in a farm system, along with a younger, perhaps less proven, prospect. That would be the general bar I’d set.</p>
<p>If the Padres were interested, the Pirates should ask about catcher Luis Campusano. I don’t know if the Padres would part ways with him, but hey, it doesn’t hurt to ask.</p>
<p><strong>nowitsdark (@nowitsdark2)&nbsp;</strong>What detergent do they use to clean the uniforms?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Persak:&nbsp;</strong>What a ridiculous question. Quite obviously, those pearly white home jerseys could only be that clean if the Pirates were using Tide.
