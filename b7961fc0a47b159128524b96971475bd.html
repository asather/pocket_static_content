<h1>Gateway's Olivia Livingston, North Allegheny's Rick Mihm continue WPIAL swimming domination</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Olivia Livingston has always thought about her swimming career in moments.</p>
<p>Not in actual wins. But for every moment she can effectively shave off her best time to keep improving and getting better.</p>
<p>Over the last four years, the Gateway senior and Louisville recruit has captured titles and both set and reset records.</p>
<p>Some of those standards will stay on the books for a few years before the next phenom comes along. But there are a few of her records will never be broken.</p>
<p>They can only be tied.</p>
<p>In the final individual heat of her WPIAL career, Livingston swam a 50.15-second 100-yard freestyle — slightly off her 2017 record time of 49.53 — to edge South Fayette senior Abbie Duncan by 1.37 seconds to become the first swimmer since Gateway alumna Michelle Chow (1983-86) to win the event all four years.</p>
<p>“It’s just insane. I never really thought that I would be able to do something like this,” Livingston said. “I kind of didn’t realize until after ninth and 10th grade because I had no idea when I came here in ninth grade that I would do what I did.”</p>
<p>Livingston also won the 50 freestyle for the fourth time on Thursday in the first session of the WPIAL Class 3A finals at Pitt’s Trees Pool, which gives her eight individual titles in her career. With her win in the 100 freestyle she also tied Penn Hills alumna and WPIAL Hall of Fame member Melanie Buddemeyer as the only swimmers ever to win eight individual titles in their careers.</p>
<p>“It’s just insane that I could be put into the same category as people like Melanie and I’m really blessed,” Livingston said. “It’s just so crazy because, like I said, I never I would be able to do something like this when I was younger. I’d always say I wanted to do things, but deep inside I had doubts and, when I did it, it’s just amazing I can do things like this and commit to the place that I did.”</p>
<p>North Allegheny senior Rick Mihm wanted to close out his WPIAL career by knocking Tigers alumnus Jonathan Buerger’s name off the top of the rolls in the 500 freestyle. It didn’t shake out that way, though, as the 2009 mark of 4:27.01 still stands as the oldest Class 3A boys record as Mihm touched the wall in 4:31.91 to beat Butler junior David Bocci by 4.65 seconds to become a three-time champion in the event.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t feeling that great and in this meet in general, so my training is going well for this meet because I’m trying to go down for states because that’s what I’m resting for,” Mihm said. “I was a little disappointed with the time, but I got the win and, at this meet, that’s really all that matters.”</p>
<p>With the win, Mihm becomes just the second boys swimmer in the last 30 years — Jerry Koller of Bethel Park in the 50 and 100 freestyles from 1994-96 is the other — to win two events three consecutive times in his career. He also won the 200 individual medley each of the last three WPIAL meets.</p>
<p>“I really haven’t stopped and thought about it,” said Mihm, a Stanford recruit. “It’s definitely a blessing to win so many events and represent my team, family and it’s been a good run.”</p>
<p>Though Mihm didn’t get the record in the 500 freestyle, Seneca Valley’s Owen Blazer beat Upper St. Clair grad Jack Fitzpatrick’s year-old mark of 48.20 in the 100 backstroke with a 47.83. Blazer also won the 100 butterfly on Thursday.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair, though, had a record-breaker of its own as junior Josh Matheny shaved 0.27 off his 2019 mark in the 100 breaststroke to win his third title in the event with a 54.43.</p>
<p>“It’s nice I broke my own record, but it’s always nice to know you’re faster than you were last year,” Matheny said. “It’s just the little steps now, perfecting walls and all that stuff.”</p>
<p>North Allegheny’s girls only had one individual winner in Molly Smyers, who took home her third title in the 500 freestyle. But the Tigers also won the 400 freestyle relay and, in doing so, took home the Class 3A team title for a WPIAL girls record 12th consecutive season, 422-242, over second place Mt. Lebanon.</p>
<p>They came into the meet tied with Oakland Catholic, which had won 11 straight in Class 2A from 2000-10.</p>
<p>“Obviously it’s pretty exciting for the program and we made a lot of history in the past week with our divers going 1-2-3 for the first time and winning our 12th in a row,” North Allegheny coach Patrick Wenzel said. “It’s a major accomplishment and I’m just amazed at how this specific girls team came together as a team and they crushed it this weekend.”</p>
<p>North Allegheny’s boys also won for the ninth consecutive season, this time 380-252 over Seneca Valley, which extends the school’s WPIAL all-sport mark for concurrent boys and girls championships to nine.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty awesome and we’ve been lucky to be blessed with talent on both sides, we developed it as best we can,” Wenzel said. “Every year the boys keep that mentality, they west their goals really high, they want to win and they train for it.”</p>
