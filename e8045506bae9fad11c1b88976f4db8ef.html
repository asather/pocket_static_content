<h1>Tests detect legionella at 4 Fox Chapel Area schools</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Officials with the Fox Chapel Area School District said tests has found “elevated levels of legionella” in the water at four of its schools.</p>
<p>The impacted schools are Fox Chapel Area High School and three elementary schools —&nbsp;Fairview, Kerr, and O’Hara.</p>
<p>“In preparation for the beginning of the school year, the district tested the water in all six of its buildings, as well as at the field house, on August 13,” a letter from superintendent Mary Catherine Reljac on Friday said. “This was an important process, since the buildings had been closed for a longer period of time than usual.”</p>
<p>Legionella, the bacterium that causes Legionnaires’ disease, can grow when buildings are left dormant for an extended period of time, as many schools have been shuttered since mid-March due to the coronavirus pandemic, according to the health experts.</p>
<p>The district received the test results on Friday, showing the higher levels of legionella, and contacted the Allegheny County Health Department for guidance.</p>
<p>Reljac said the district still plans on reopening its six schools on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said an epidemiologist from the health department “shared that it was safe for students and staff to use the water for washing their hands, using the restrooms, and to continue food service operations as normal.”</p>
<p>As a precaution, the schools will provide bottled water and students are being asked to bring their own water from home.</p>
<p>“It is unlikely that our cold drinking water is affected,” the district said.</p>
<p>Legionnaires’ disease is a&nbsp;severe form of pneumonia.&nbsp;Most cases can be cured with antibiotics, and Legionnaires’ cannot be spread from human to human contact.</p>
<p>Although legionella can infect a home’s plumbing, most outbreaks happen in large buildings where more complex water systems allow it to grow and spread more easily.</p>
<p>To prevent the bacteria from taking hold, water systems are regularly cleaned and disinfected. Scalding water also can help eradicate the bacteria, which find protection by hiding in the scale and film inside old pipes.</p>
<p>Based on guidance from the health department and a microbiologist from a local testing company, the Fox Chapel Area School District said it has started taking the following steps at each of its schools and at the field house:</p>
<p>▪ Heat the water to 160 degrees.</p>
<p>▪ Drain the water system through all outlets, faucets, and spigots.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>▪ Refill and flush the system again.</p>
<p>The district said it plans to conduct follow-up testing Monday morning.</p>
