<h1>Some shoppers say senior hour at Giant Eagle is counterproductive</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In an effort to limit risk and exposure to seniors, several grocery store chains, including Giant Eagle and Aldi, have begun opening <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/food/2020/03/18/grocery-store-hours-food-shopping-coronavirus-Covid-19-giant-eagle-walmart-taget-shop-n-save-whole-foods-kuhns/stories/202003180098" target="_blank">an hour early on certain days</a> to allow the high-risk group to shop separately from the general public.</p>
<p>Giant Eagle spokesman Dick Roberts, who was at the&nbsp;Market District at the Waterworks Shopping Plaza near Aspinwall on Monday,&nbsp;said many seniors were&nbsp;“very complimentary” about the shopping hour.</p>
<p>“It was busy, but normal shopping hours have settled down since that first panic rush,” he said.&nbsp;“I wouldn’t be surprised if this settled down.”</p>
<p>Some of the seniors disagreed. Because of the busyness, they said they felt less secure than during normal hours.</p>
<p>“It was debaucherous,” said Robert Scalio, 70, of Cheswick, who drove himself to the Waterworks Shopping Plaza just before it opened at 6 a.m. “Concentrating us all in at one time just made it worse I think. People rushed in like, I don’t know, animals.”</p>
<p>Giant Eagle will continue providing the seniors-only hour on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays.</p>
<p>Mr. Scalio, who lives alone and was a bit disgruntled because his favorite coffee cake was out of stock, said he’ll shop at normal hours from now on. He believes in common sense precautions like wiping down the bars of shopping carts and maintaining social distance, but he said he he’s frustrated by the panic buying of certain items.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing to worry about as long as you’re not sucking somebody’s face,” he said. “If you feel sick call your doctor. Just take smart precautions.”</p>
<p>Linda Ahlstedt, 72, also visited Giant Eagle on Monday morning. She compared the rush to Christmas shopping.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t feel very safe,” she said. “Everybody was trying to maneuver their carts to be 6 feet apart from each other. I don’t think there were any fewer shoppers than there would normally be, and having them all be going in at the same time seemed packed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Roberts said that the traffic this morning was less than during normal hours.</p>
<p>Ms. Ahlstedt, who lives with her husband in Aspinwall, said she’ll likely order delivery through the inexpensive grocery delivery service Instacart from now on. She said Giant Eagle also delivers groceries for a small fee ($6), though this can take up to a week.</p>
<p>For seniors who are food insecure, a number of local programs like Meals on Wheels and the Allegheny County Area Agency on Aging are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/corona2020/2020/03/22/pittsburgh-food-banks-coronavirus-meals-on-wheels-beaver-greene-mercer-westmoreland-washington-county/stories/202003170104" target="_blank">continuing to work</a> to provide meals during the quarantine.</p>
<p>At the Giant Eagle, which recently announced $10 million in bonus pay for employees working through the COVID-19 pandemic, workers stood guard over toilet paper and paper towels, and Ms. Ahlstedt said that many shelves remained empty.</p>
<p>When asked whether she was worried about running out of any essentials, she listed just one item:</p>
<p>“Wine.”</p>
