<h1>Ben Cherington discusses the possibility of calling Pirates' prospects up to the majors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It is natural, during a season like the Pirates are having, for fans to begin looking to the future.</p>
<p>The 2020 team is 4-17. Any hopes of a successful season seem much closer to fantasy than reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So the question becomes: Who can help?</p>
<p>While there could be some glimmer of hope for a player coming over in a trade or a free agent signing after the season, the more imminent possibility on that front would be prospects.</p>
<p>And the Pirates do have options there. Third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes is at their alternate training site in Altoona. Outfielders Jason Martin and Jared Oliva and reliever Blake Cederlind are there, too.</p>
<p>The Pirates have needed help in the majors already due to injuries, but those four, along with a handful of their other highly ranked prospects, have yet to make their debuts.</p>
<p>“More generally, [it’s] very clear that we need to be investing in young players and young player development and that includes playing time at the major league level,” general manager Ben Cherington said Friday. “I would expect that to continue to happen, likely increasingly over the remaining time of this season and the next several weeks.”</p>
<p>Hayes and Cederlind seem to be the most obvious choices for a call-up to the big leagues sooner rather than later, since both are highly rated and were thought to have a chance at making the opening day roster. They were invited to join the Pirates at PNC Park for summer camp, but both tested positive for COVID-19 and never participated in team workouts.</p>
<p>But now they’re healthy. Both are training in Altoona. The Pirates want to be careful with their prized prospects, ensuring that they are fully prepared to join the roster before they do.</p>
<p>“I think we’ve seen already in the big leagues this year, certainly on the pitching side but a little bit on the position players side, too, that a Major League Baseball game brings with it physical challenges that are different than practice. If you’re not fully ready for that, guys can get banged up with injuries. Hopefully those are short-term and small things, but sometimes they can be bigger, so we want to be careful about that.”</p>
<p>Cherington isn’t willing to give a specific date, but he did say it’s different this season, in that fewer games give them less time to decide when it is the right time to call up the prospects.</p>
<p>“The length of the season, maybe a little bit, If you have an idea about, ‘We'd like to get some playing time for a specific guy,’ in a normal year there's more time to figure that out,” Cherington said. “This year, it's less time. That impacts a little bit, more so than the outcomes would impact it.”</p>
<p>None of this means that the Pirates are wasting time with Hayes, Cederlind and players of their ilk. They have used their traveling taxi squad — a group of up to five players not on the active roster who go on road trips in case of an injury — to reward their prospects.</p>
<p>Oliva, for instance, went with the team to Cincinnati earlier this year. That series was cut short by a positive COVID-19 test from a Reds player or staff member, but while he could, Oliva received some big-league instruction and went through the daily routine with the Pirates.</p>
<p>In Altoona, they are still working out and facing live pitching, too. The problem is that it’s unclear how effective those methods are for the players.</p>
<p>“On the position player side of things ... one of the things that we’ve been challenged by and trying to figure out is how to replicate a nine-inning baseball game, just from the physical load that it requires to play a nine-inning Major League Baseball game,” Cherington said. “The amount of time you’re on your feet, the amount of stops and starts and running, etc. How do you replicate that without an actual nine-inning game? We’re trying to be creative with that to try to replicate that.”</p>
<p>For some of the Pirates’ prospects in Altoona, any instruction they get is a large step forward. Infielders Liover Peguero and Nick Gonzales are 19 and 21 years old, respectively. Neither have faced the quality of pitching in Altoona before. For them, that might be good enough to qualify as a good season of development.</p>
<p>For those closer to the big leagues, though, the next step may simply be to play in the big leagues.</p>
<p>Cherington knows this, too. At the same time, he is in the business of evaluating the players currently on the Pirates’ roster.</p>
<p>That makes the equation more difficult than simply letting the young guys play, in his mind. Still, as Cherington said, there will be call-ups this season. It’s only a matter of time.</p>
