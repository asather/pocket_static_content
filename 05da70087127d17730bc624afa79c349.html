<p>The Allegheny County Police Department’s Homicide Unit is investigating&nbsp;a two-vehicle crash Tuesday afternoon that killed a driver and closed a portion of state Route 8 in Hampton, according to county police.</p>
<p>The collision between a gray 2008 BMW sedan and a blue 2007 Chrysler minivan occurred around 1:30 p.m. in the area of state Route 8 and Mt. Royal Boulevard. The two drivers, injured in the crash, were transported to local hospitals. There were no other vehicle occupants.</p>
<p>The 77-year-old man driving the minivan died at the hospital while the 35-year-old driving the BMW is in stable condition.</p>
<p>An investigation from county collision reconstructionists and homicide detectives&nbsp;showed the BMW was traveling south on state Route 8. A witness said the vehicle was moving erratically.</p>
<p>The BMW, crossing the middle line, struck the minivan at a high rate of speed.</p>
<p>Route 8 is closed from&nbsp;Wildwood Road Extension to Mt. Royal Boulevard, a stretch through the middle of Hampton.</p>
<p>The investigation is ongoing, and police are consulting with the district attorney’s office to determine if any charges are warranted.</p>
