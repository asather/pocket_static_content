<h1>City League fall sports get the go-ahead from Pittsburgh Public Schools</h1>

<p>One more sprint. That’s all Brashear football players had left to run at the end of Wednesday’s practice at Cupples Stadium. But as worn down as many of them might have been, that final run was perhaps the most cheerful they have ever experienced.</p>
<p>“We were doing sprints when our coach said the season is on, and everybody just went crazy,” sophomore Ta’Mere Robinson said.</p>
<p>There will be football and other sports played in the City League this fall, and for many students and coaches, that was cause for celebration.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools voted, 9-0, against a proposal that would have postponed sports until at least Nov. 5. The season will advance despite Pittsburgh Public Schools voting unanimously July 31 to hold the first nine weeks of classes remotely because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>First the PIAA. Then the WPIAL. Now the City League. Wednesday’s decision comes after the PIAA last Friday gave schools the OK to begin their seasons, going against a recommendation from Gov. Tom Wolf that school and recreational sports be postponed until Jan. 1. The WPIAL followed the PIAA’s lead, and nearly all of its member schools have chosen to participate.</p>
<p>Uniontown and Summit Academy announced their decisions to opt out of football earlier this month, and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette high school sports staff reached out to all 117 football-playing schools in the WPIAL this week to ask&nbsp;about their school’s choice on participating. As of Wednesday evening, a total of 110 schools have decided to play all fall sports. Five schools are proceeding as if they will play, conducting practices this week, but will make final decisions in the next few days. They are Freeport, Quaker Valley, Woodland Hills, Shady Side Academy and Southmoreland.</p>
<p>“You can’t have all these people in the state and surrounding areas, all these schools deciding to play, and then tell our kids the season is going to be postponed,” said Allderdice football coach and athletic director Jerry Haslett. “And this isn’t about City League athletics. This is about City League kids getting an opportunity to better themselves.”</p>
<p>Wednesday’s result was a bit of a surprise. A lot of doubt was cast when Pittsburgh Public Schools recommended Aug. 6 to postpone fall sports until Jan. 1. Westinghouse football coach Donta Green even said Tuesday that it was “highly unlikely” there would be fall sports. However, several school board members said during Wednesday’s meeting that, while initially being against fall sports, their opinions had changed in recent weeks.</p>
<p>So, on an 80-degree afternoon, why the 180-degree turn? Some of the credit goes to board member Bill Gallagher, who Haslett said might have changed the minds of five members himself. Fellow board members Sala Udin and Kevin Carter pointed to Gallagher as helping them understand the situation more fully. Gallagher is no stranger to City League athletics. He led the Perry football team to seven league championships in 13 years before retiring after the 2013 season.</p>
<p>“I think people realize that we can do this safely,” said Gallagher. “And we have so many people helping us. You see other sports have been going on all summer in Western Pa., and we have the rules. So if people don’t follow the rules, the program gets shut down. Our kids deserve a chance, a hope that we can pull this off. Everyone else is playing, and we think we can, too.”</p>
<p>Also playing a significant role were players and coaches who voiced their opinions publicly in support of fall sports over the past few weeks, a factor that was pointed out by Udin. Allderdice’s Eric McClung, Robinson and teammates Kameron Cheatom and Daquan Griffin were among those vocal on social and traditional media. Haslett and Brashear football coach Don Schmidt submitted letters in support of playing that were read during a Pittsburgh Public Schools public meeting held Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>“I was of the opinion that we should not go forward with fall sports until I heard the impassioned pleas from students-athletes and from their parents and from other community members,” Udin said. “I need you to know that your participation in the public hearing affected us. It affected me. And I also want you to know that you had a very strong advocate on the board in Bill Gallagher, who knows the athletic system in Pittsburgh Public Schools like the back of his hand.”</p>
<p>McClung, a senior, was proud of the fact that he and his peers unified and made an impact through their words.</p>
<p>“Everybody knew what we had to do,” McClung said. “Our coaches told us that they have to hear our voices. Everybody buckled down. I reached out to players from other schools. We wanted everybody’s input. It was make or break. We were trying to get everything out there and make it impossible to ignore us.”</p>
<p>Added Schmidt: “I’m very proud of them. We know the kids are going to use social media. I always tell them to use it responsibly and not do anything stupid. They were speaking from their hearts. If they were not allowed to play, that would hit them hard. Without a season, we would have had to really keep an eye on kids. They did a good job and I’m happy it helped.”</p>
<p>Six teams play City League football — Allderdice, Brashear, Carrick, Perry, University Prep and Westinghouse. Wednesday’s decision also impacts other fall sports. While the City League has remained firm in its desire to remain its own district in football, some schools compete in the WPIAL in soccer, field hockey and girls tennis.</p>
<p>“I think it was the right decision,” said Obama Academy boys soccer coach Pantelis Papazekos. “I testified in the public hearing Monday in support of fall sports and I’m glad to see that the board took mine and all of the other students, coaches and parents opinions into consideration.”</p>
<p>Some teams have been participating in summer conditioning, while others put workouts on hold to see which direction Pittsburgh Public Schools would choose to go. Thus, schedules might have to be adjusted in order for teams to comply with PIAA regulations. City League athletic director Karen Arnold said she will soon be in touch with schools, the PIAA and WPIAL executive director Amy Scheuneman to discuss future plans. The first City League football game is scheduled to be played Sept. 10 between Westinghouse and University Prep.</p>
<p>“We are going to have to change some things around because clearly we could have already started had COVID not been here at the beginning of August, so there are going to be some changing of dates,” Arnold said. “We do have some teams that play in the WPIAL, and that is something that is going to have to be looked at in terms of adjusting those schedules, as well.”</p>
<p>There was some trepidation among some City League football coaches as Wednesday’s meeting approached. Some even said they believed a fall sports postponement could have led to the demise of a league that has been playing football for more than a century.</p>
<p>But when school board president Sylvia Wilson asked for a vote on what was dubbed Item 8.09, each of the members decided there will be no demise on their watch. And because of that, those associated with a proud league feel reinvigorated.</p>
<p>“We still have to continue being safe,” Robinson said. “But it’s nice not having to worry about not playing football.”</p>
