<h1>ICE: Newly enrolled international students whose classes are online will not be allowed to come to U.S.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Newly enrolled international students will not be able to come to the U.S. to study in the fall if their classes are taught entirely online, according to guidelines issued Friday by Immigration and Customs Enforcement.</p>
<p>The new guidance draws a harsh line between international students who are already studying in the U.S. and those who were going to arrive for the first time in the fall.</p>
<p>It says that students who were already actively studying in the U.S. last spring as the pandemic shut down campuses would be allowed to stay, even if their courses would be entirely online. But those who had not yet arrived would not be permitted to come to the U.S. unless they took at least one in-person class.</p>
<p>The guidance comes after the Trump administration threatened to send international students home and strip them of their student visas if they were going to study entirely online in the fall. The administration backtracked on that threat after Harvard, MIT and other universities, plus a number of states, sued, saying the move to bar international students was cruel, reckless, arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<p>Normally, international students are required to take most of their classes in person. But the rule had been lifted in the spring because of the pandemic. In-person classes are going to be scarce this fall, even at those universities that are offering a mix of in-person and online classes.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Harvard anticipated the latest guidance and said that it would not be able to welcome about 200 first-year undergraduates to campus. About 250,000 international students plan to enter the U.S. for the coming academic year, either as new or returning students, according to the American Council on Education, a trade group.</p>
