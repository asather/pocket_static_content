<h1>Recovery of Marines killed in Iraq was slowed by unforgiving terrain, general says</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Capt. Moises Navas and Gunnery Sgt. Diego Pongo were the two U.S. service members killed Sunday in Iraq&nbsp;while accompanying Iraqi security forces during a mission to eliminate an Islamic State stronghold in a mountainous area of north-central Iraq, military officials said Tuesday in a statement.</p>
<p>Navas was a Special Operations officer&nbsp;from Germantown, Md., and&nbsp;Pongo was a critical skills operator&nbsp;from Simi Valley, Calif.</p>
<p>The two men, both 34, were assigned to 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, a Special Operations force with headquarters at Camp Lejeune, N.C.</p>
<p>The deaths, the first in combat for the U.S. military in Iraq since August, were announced as the tight-knit Marine Raider force marked the fifth anniversary of a helicopter crash off the coast of Florida that killed seven Raiders and four Louisiana National Guardsmen.</p>
<p>The Marines were killed during an operation with Iraqi forces on an IS hideout near Mahkmour, about 45 miles outside the city of Irbil. IS fighters were entrenched in a tunnel complex, U.S. military officials said.</p>
<p>Details of the effort to recover the remains of two elite Marine Raiders killed in Iraq came into better focus Tuesday, with a top U.S. general saying that unforgiving mountain terrain and concern for the safety of other U.S. service members dragged the mission out for more than six hours.</p>
<p>Marine Gen. Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie, the chief of U.S. Central Command, told the House Armed Services Committee that commanders monitored the operation on Sunday hour by hour and did everything they could in a challenging environment. Four other Americans were wounded in the operation.</p>
<p>“It’s some of the worst terrain in the world,” McKenzie said. “There’s no way to do it faster than we did it.”</p>
<p>At the Pentagon, a senior U.S. military official, Navy Rear Adm. William Byrne, told reporters that the terrain was “vertical.”</p>
<p>“That in itself made it extremely difficult,” he said. “It was a high-threat environment. We knew that going in, and we took the appropriate precautions going into a high-threat environment.”</p>
<p>Byrne said the military is reviewing the incident, as The New York Times reported Monday night.</p>
<p>The Times also reported that the forces called in to recover the Marines included some members of the elite Delta Force, a likely indication of the difficulty of the mission.</p>
<p>On Monday, Iraq’s elite Counter-Terrorism Service announced it had conducted a raid a day earlier on an IS encampment in the Qarachogh mountain range.</p>
<p>Sunday’s operation began around 7 a.m., when warplanes struck areas of the Qarachogh mountains, according to witnesses quoted by Rudaw, an Iraqi Kurdish news channel. Four helicopter gunships pressed the attack on three different sites in the mountains, before soldiers rappelled from the helicopters.</p>
<p>The clashes involving U.S. troops and Iraqi forces took place in a cave complex. Twenty-five IS militants were killed and nine tunnels and a training camp were destroyed.</p>
<p>There were few other details, but an Iraqi officer who requested anonymity to be able to discuss operational matters said four of the Americans were also wounded.</p>
<p>“The [IS] fighters popped out of one entrance and killed the two Americans. They dragged their bodies into the cave complex,” he said.</p>
<p>A contingent of U.S. forces then stormed the area to recover the bodies; four of their members were wounded.</p>
<p>“It was a big firefight, one of the most intense we’ve faced in this period,” he said.</p>
<p>Iraq’s anti-terror force said the firefight ended early Monday morning.</p>
<p>The commanding officer of the Marine Raider Regiment, Col. John Lynch, said in a statement released Tuesday that Navas and Pongos were “intelligent, courageous and loyal,” dedicated leaders who were “on the path to be our organization’s leaders in the future.”</p>
<p>Lynch said that Navas had a wife, daughter and three young sons, while Pongo had a young daughter.</p>
<p>Lynch recalled that Pongo had a larger-than-life personality and brought his mother to a Marine Corps birthday ball last fall and “outdanced the rest of us on the dance floor.” He was trained as an advanced sniper, a foreign weapons instructor and a combat marksmanship leader, and was fluent in multiple languages, Lynch said.</p>
<p>Navas, often called “Mo,” was born in Panama and grew up in Maryland on the outskirts of the nation’s capital. He “cherished his time watching his children play sports,” Lynch said. Navas was trained as a scout sniper, martial arts, instructor and combat diver, and recently had been selected for promotion to major.</p>
<p>The death of the U.S. soldiers comes amid tensions between Iraq and the U.S. over American troops’ presence in the country after a January strike that killed Maj. Gen. Qassem Suleimani, the top Iranian commander. The U.S. has some 5,200 service members in Iraq, the Pentagon says, along with an unspecified number of contractors.</p>
<p>Suleimani’s assassination was seen by many politicians as a gross violation of Iraq’s sovereignty and sparked renewed calls for the U.S. to leave the country. Joint anti-IS operations between Iraqi security forces and the coalition were suspended for a time. Col. Myles Caggins, spokesman for the coalition in Iraq, said joint missions between Iraqi and U.S. forces had restarted mid-February.</p>
<p>In August, the Pentagon declared the death of Gunnery Sgt. Scott A. Koppenhafer, who was assigned to 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, Marine Forces Special Operations Command. He was killed in enemy small arms fire during a raid on IS militants in northern Iraq.</p>
<p>IS, whose militants once controlled a full third of both Syria and Iraq, lost the last of its putative caliphate last year. Since then, its members have found refuge in remote areas of both countries, including the Qarachogh mountains.</p>
