<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf will extend a moratorium on evictions for nonpayment of rent through Aug. 31.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf's office announced Thursday he had signed a new executive order that protects renters as well as protecting homeowners from foreclosure until the end of next month.</p>
<p>A previous executive order had been <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/05/07/Pa-will-extend-eviction-foreclosure-protections-to-July-10-covid-19/stories/202005070135?cid=search" target="_blank">set to expire on Friday</a>, but <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/07/08/end-eviction-moratorium-advocates-promote-aid-renters-landlords-pennsylvania/stories/202007060072" target="_blank">a number of legislators and advocacy groups had called for it to be extended</a>.</p>
<p>The primary program to aid renters and landlords, as well as homeowners in need of mortgage assistance, only started taking applications Monday and would not have been able to start distributing funds prior to Friday.</p>
<p>“I am taking this action to help families know they will have a roof over their heads and a place to live while all of us fight the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Mr. Wolf in a statement accompanying the order. “It takes one more burden off of people who are struggling and ensures that families can remain in their homes so they can protect their health and wellbeing.”</p>
<p>The order does not forgive any money that is owed.</p>
<p>When the moratorium had been set to expire Friday, a number of housing organizations had warned there could be a wave of months' worth of evictions at once, exacerbated by pandemic-induced double-digit unemployment.</p>
<p>“Extending the eviction moratoriums protects thousands of Pennsylvanians who are working to recover losses sustained during the pandemic shutdown,” Phyllis Chamberlain, executive director of advocacy group the Housing Alliance of Pennsylvania said in a statement.</p>
<p>“Pushing the date back addresses the incongruous timing between when evictions could resume and the availability of assistance through the CARES funding,” she said, referring to the fact that much of the aid to struggling residents just became available Monday is expected to take several weeks to reach people.</p>
<p>The largest source of aid to renters and homeowners is $175 million in federal CARES Act funding, which is being administered through the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.</p>
<p>“Today’s action protects those who are one paycheck away from homelessness and further supports Pennsylvania’s recovery efforts by stabilizing the housing sector,” Ms. Chamberlain said.</p>
