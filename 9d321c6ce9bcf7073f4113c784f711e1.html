<h1>Pirates takeaways: Erik Gonzalez has changed the infield calculus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Josh Bell would’ve been a perfectly fine prediction.</p>
<p>Bryan Reynolds, too.</p>
<p>But among the players any logical person would’ve pegged to be the Pirates’ most consistent offensive performer nearly two-thirds of the way through the 2020 season, not a blessed one of them could’ve possibly called Erik Gonzalez.</p>
<p>Yet here we are, after another two-hit game from Gonzalez during a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/09/06/Pirates-vs-Reds-9-6-20-Erik-Gonzalez-Geoff-Hartlieb-Chad-Kuhl-Frazier-Shelton/stories/202009060180" target="_blank">come-from-behind, 3-2 victory</a> over the Reds on Sunday at PNC Park, the infielder’s sacrifice fly bringing in the winning run to salvage a series split with Cincinnati.</p>
<p>Gonzalez is hitting a team-best .289. He also leads the Pirates in hits (33), extra-base hits (14), doubles (10) and RBIs (18) while thrusting himself into an every-day role on the left side of the infield, either at shortstop or third base.</p>
<p>“He’s been outstanding,” manager Derek Shelton said. “We’ve talked about opportunities and this being a meritocracy. He deserves to play.”</p>
<p>Shelton and Gonzalez have also talked about the various adjustments the 29-year-old native of Puerto Plata, Dominican Republic, has made to his swing, most notably engaging his lower half more while not starting out as upright.</p>
<p>The fixes came and went early on, but Shelton said Gonzalez has been locked in since the Minnesota series in early August, when he played three of the four games in the home-and-home affair and collected five hits in 11 at-bats, two of them doubles.</p>
<p>“Since that time,” Shelton said, “he’s been our best player.”</p>
<p>Shelton will get no arguments here. Gonzalez, the former Cleveland Indian, has certainly been the Pirates’ most consistent offensive performer, as he has gone back-to-back games without a hit just once all season — and not since Aug. 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the two hits Gonzalez picked up Sunday extended his hitting streak to eight games, during which he’s batting .387 (12-for-31). As a result, Gonzalez has started 17 of the last 19 games and 23 of 26, enabling him to make start-to-start adjustments and unlock some of his power.</p>
<p>“You can make adjustments when you play every day,” Gonzalez said. “That’s very important to me.”</p>
<p>Gonzalez, suddenly, has become very important to the Pirates, something few would have thought possible when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/04/19/Starling-Marte-Erik-Gonzalez-leave-Friday-s-game-vs-Giants-after-collision/stories/201904190140" target="_blank">a collision with Starling Marte</a> resulted in Gonzalez losing his starting job last season to Kevin Newman.</p>
<p>Now, the infield picture is much more muddled, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.</p>
<p>Ke’Bryan Hayes needs to play. The Pirates have made that much clear. It also appears that Adam Frazier, who has a 10-game hitting streak, has put himself in a better place, the result of a shorter swing path.</p>
<p>Newman remains a mystery. He leads the Pirates with six errors this season, and he’s hitting just .241/.288/.302 — hardly enough to cement an every-day spot at this point.</p>
<p>But the emergence of Gonzalez has less to do with everyone else and more to do with a player who many probably projected to start the season in Altoona after a quiet spring training and summer camp.</p>
<p>It was nowhere near plausible that Gonzalez would emerge as the Pirates’ best hitter, although as we’ve learned, expecting the expected is just flat-out stupid in 2020.</p>
<p>“The consistency of his at-bats and even his defense has been up a tick,” Cole Tucker said. “I don’t know how much that has to do with health, and this is the guy we’ve had all along. It’s really showing up, and it’s showing up every day.”</p>
<p><strong>Smart Hayes</strong></p>
<p>Hayes can field and hit. We knew this. He can also run the bases, the latest example coming in the ninth inning Sunday.</p>
<p>Second and third, nobody out. Contact play on, meaning Hayes breaks from third for home as soon as the ball is hit. Newman hit a broken-bat tapper back to pitcher Raisel Iglesias, which isn’t great.</p>
<p>But Hayes smartly recognized it, went back to third and got himself in a rundown, buying enough time to allow Newman to motor to second, keeping a pair of runners in scoring position.</p>
<p>“We’ve talked about Hayes doing a lot of good things,” Shelton said. “The thing that stood out to me the most is the baserunning. He stays in the rundown, does a nice job, gives us the opportunity for the infield to stay with a five-man and give us the opportunity to win.”</p>
<p><strong>Slider time</strong></p>
<p>Sunday’s win had a lot to do with the Pirates bullpen, and justifiably so. That group covered six innings and didn’t allow a run after what Shelton called a “back-down start” for Chad Kuhl, where he was limited to 65 pitches.</p>
<p>Shelton’s reasoning was trying to keep the workload light for someone coming off Tommy John surgery.</p>
<p>The quickest of those innings might’ve belonged to lefty Sam Howard, who worked a 1-2-3 sixth. Howard has been an interesting study this year.</p>
<p>After making his season debut Aug. 2 in Chicago, the Pirates basically told Howard that he was going to live and die by his slider. They weren’t kidding.</p>
<p>He was throwing it 62.8% of the time entering Sunday’s game, and opponents were hitting just .154 against it.</p>
<p>“It was almost eye-opening that when hitters are sitting fastball in fastball counts that, if I can throw my slider in the zone, then it plays,” Howard said. “I never knew I could throw my slider this much and have it be effective.”</p>
