<h1>Rent relief program halts in much of Pa., though continuing in Allegheny County </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Renters and landlords in need of COVID-19-related aid can continue to apply for rental assistance in Allegheny County, though elsewhere in the state a rental assistance program has had to stop accepting new applications, despite not having distributed millions in available aid.</p>
<p>“We were just too anxious about the needs in the county to wait for the state,” said Abigail Horn, deputy director for the Office of Community Services at Allegheny County’s Department of Human Services.</p>
<p>The county is using its own federal CARES Act funds to supplement the program and pay up to $2,000 in monthly assistance to qualifying tenants and their landlords to prevent evictions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://phfa.org/pacares/" target="_blank">state’s CARES Rent Relief Program</a>, which did not start accepting applications until July, aimed to assist renters — and their landlords — who had lost income due to COVID-19-related closures and who needed funds to pay their rent and remain housed.</p>
<p>Early on, however, officials and housing advocates pointed out <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/08/28/program-aid-renters-Allegheny-County-landlords-applications-funds-Pa-housing/stories/202008280116?cid=search" target="_blank">the program was off to a slow start statewide</a> in distributing aid due to a number of factors, including a complicated application process, a requirement that tenants be 30 days in arrears, bureaucratic delays such as a bottleneck verifying an applicant’s unemployment status with the state, and a reluctance by some landlords to participate in some parts of the state because of the program’s $750 monthly cap on assistance. The state program expired on Wednesday.</p>
<p>As of Thursday, Allegheny County had received 6,116 tenant applications to the program, 3,285 landlord applications and made 291 payments totaling $903,802. The 291 approved payments could also include future months of rent that haven’t been paid out yet, as well.</p>
<p>Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs said the program has picked up momentum in processing applications in recent weeks.</p>
<p>A few other counties are continuing to accept new applications, but elsewhere in the state, the program is no longer taking new applicants, said Bryce Maretzki, director of policy and planning at the Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency.</p>
<p>Counties can continue to process the 27,000 applications they have that are partially complete, he said.</p>
<p>New applicants can be accepted if legislators act to extend the program.</p>
<p>“The ball is fully in the hands of the legislature. We have given them all of our input and thoughts as to what we would include and recommend as to changes,” he said.</p>
<p>Of the $150 million allocated rental assistance, counties had disbursed a little over $4 million through the end of August. PHFA had disbursed an initial $50 million to counties in July.</p>
<p>It is unclear if the legislature will act to extend the program’s deadline elsewhere.</p>
<p>House Bill 2868 would increase the maximum assistance amount, extend the program’s application deadline through Oct. 31, as well as make a number of other changes advocates have suggested to make the program run more smoothly and distribute millions in aid allocated by the legislature to those in need.</p>
<p>The bill was supposed to get a final vote in the state House Thursday, but the House’s voting session was canceled Thursday morning after a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/10/01/GOP-lawmaker-s-positive-COVID-19-test-cancels-voting-session/stories/202010010148" target="_blank">member’s positive COVID-19 test</a>.</p>
<p>A spokeswoman for the Senate’s Republican majority could not be reached about the bill’s prospects in that chamber.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, has said <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/25/Gov-Wolf-can-t-extend-eviction-moratorium-asks-Legislature-to-act/stories/202008240074?cid=search" target="_blank">he supports making changes to the program to get relief to those who need it</a>.</p>
<p>Housing advocates and some landlords have been asking for changes to the program.</p>
<p>“The Housing Alliance has partnered with the PA Apartment Association and we agree that these changes are needed immediately,” said Phyllis Chamberlain, executive director of the Housing Alliance of Pennsylvania. “I’m disappointed that the legislature did not act more quickly. There are still too many households that are unemployed and are struggling to pay their rent. The program, as it was written, did not provide enough incentives to landlords who have to agree to accept program funds.”</p>
