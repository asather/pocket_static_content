<h1>Pitt-Notre Dame observations: Defensive breakdowns, glimmers of offensive hope and more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NOTRE DAME, Ind. — It wasn’t quite like the viral clips of LeBron James rattling off specific plays in sequence — displaying what some might dub a photographic memory — but in the lower level of Purcell Pavilion Wednesday night, Jeff Capel demonstrated something close to it.</p>
<p>Over the course of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/02/05/Pitt-basketball-Notre-Dame-ACC-Justin-Champagnie-John-Mooney-TJ-Gibbs/stories/202002050182" target="_blank">Pitt’s 80-72 loss to Notre Dame</a>, the Panthers’ coach had seen his team’s usually reliable defense get shredded for the second time in the past three games. The statistics painted an ugly picture — 1.19 points per possession allowed, seven made 3-pointers in the first half — but to Capel, those miscues and shortcomings were manifested in moments, ones that he rattled off as he diagnosed what went so wrong for Pitt.</p>
<p>“To start the game, their first one came because we were in rotation,” Capel began after being asked about the defense’s lapses. “We doubled the post. We didn’t do a good job of rotation.”</p>
<p>But there was more.</p>
<p>“They got I think two in transition where we just backed up on [Prentiss] Hubb, one off a ball screen and roll where we didn’t get to Hubb on time,” Capel continued. “Fourteen, Nate — I can’t pronounce his last name [Laszewski] — he hits one where we forget the scouting report and know that he’s in the game at the five and we’re not to him, then we foul him on the next one.”</p>
<p>The Panthers’ defensive struggles were perhaps best exhibited in snapshots, the kind that came immediately to Capel’s mind after the game — a late switch, a good shooter getting too much room to shoot and any number of other mistakes.</p>
<p>The night began with Pitt doing what many teams have tried to against the Fighting Irish — limit forward John Mooney, the team’s leading scorer and rebounder who is putting up the kind of numbers in both categories that haven’t been seen in college basketball since Blake Griffin at Oklahoma more than a decade ago (back when Capel was the Sooners’ 34-year-old head coach).</p>
<p>In the opening minutes, the Panthers tried double-teaming Mooney, but Notre Dame, with an offense predicated on constant ball movement, found opportunities away from its star big man. Only about three minutes into the game, Mooney received the ball on the low post, was doubled and kicked it out to teammate Rex Pflueger, who initiated a series of passes around the perimeter to open players — with Pitt still recovering —- that ended with a T.J. Gibbs 3.</p>

<p>At the under-16 media timeout seconds later, Capel scrapped the plan. The Panthers were no longer going to double the post, opting instead to play the Irish straight up.</p>
<p>Their difficulties wouldn’t end there, though.</p>
<p>Just as he had been the previous season, when he poured in a season-high 23 points in a loss at Pitt, Laszewski was a matchup problem for the Panthers. At 6-foot-10 with a nice outside stroke not accurately reflected by his 32.6 percentage from deep, the sophomore forward was a prominent part of Pitt’s scouting report, but those instructions, at times, were disregarded. Within one minute late in the first half, Laszewski twice took advantage of Eric Hamilton’s defensive slip-ups, first when he backed too far off of him and allowed him to bury an open 3, followed by him playing Laszewski too aggressively on the next possession and fouling him on a 3.</p>
<p>Hamilton was pulled after the foul and played just 4:16 the remainder of the night. The miscues against Laszewski weren’t limited to him, though, as Justin Champagnie lost track of him on an inbounds pass that pushed Notre Dame’s lead to 12 with about 14 minutes to play.</p>
<p>“It can be a difficult matchup, especially when he’s at the five,” Capel said. “But we have to be there. You have to know what you’re doing, you have to know who you’re guarding and you have to know the difference.”</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, Pitt fared well when Laszewski and the 6-foot-9 Mooney were on the court together, even if it occasionally led to a mismatch like when Laszewski was able to post up on the 6-foot-3 Xavier Johnson and draw a foul.</p>
<p>The two forwards were on the court together for 12:53. In that time, the Irish scored just 17 points on 18 possessions, a sharp drop-off from the 63 points it scored on its 49 other possessions. For someone like the 6-foot-6 Champagnie, who had to spend time guarding each of them, it presented any number of challenges.</p>
<p>“They’re all older,” Champagnie said. “They all have experience. The moves are down pat. [Mooney] is big. He’s pretty strong. It’s what he does. That’s his game, just backing down. I’m not really used to that because I’m used to guarding like the four man who can normally just pop out, dribble and shoot. It was a task today. I’ve just got to look at this game and change and do the right thing the next time.”</p>
<p>A couple of the game’s more decisive defensive errors came late in the first half, when Hubb made two 3s in the final 69 seconds of the half, accounting for six of his nine points on Wednesday. The second of those came right before the halftime buzzer, when Notre Dame got out in transition off a missed Champagnie 3. Respecting a potential drive to the basket, Johnson backed several feet off of a charging Hubb, who took advantage of that space and pulled up to bury a 3 right before the buzzer, sending Notre Dame into the break up nine.</p>
<p>Taken together, those plays resulted in a defense that allowed an opponent to average more than 1.1 points per possession for the third time in the past five games after not surrendering that average in any of its first 18 contests.</p>
<p>“These are things we can control as far as knowing the scouting report and what we’re supposed to do,” Capel said. “We didn’t do a good job of that.”</p>
<p><strong>Promising flashes</strong></p>
<p>Though the final numbers — 41.9% shooting, 42.1% from 3, 72 points on 67 possessions — weren’t entirely reflective of an offense that struggled to function at times, Pitt did find success in certain areas against Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The Panthers even looked strong at times against a zone defense, a look that has been the source of many offensive woes for it this season. On their first nine possessions against the zone, they came away with 12 points. They did so by finding Champagnie in the high post and allowing Johnson to dribble penetrate into the zone to find open players like Terrell Brown for easy finishes.</p>
<p>Early on, they were also aided by an aggressive mindset that allowed them to get eight free-throw attempts in the opening 8:43 against a team that prevents opponents from getting to the line more than any other Division I program this season. Pitt capitalized on those opportunities, too, making seven of the eight attempts to account for more than one-third of its first 19 points, as it built a six-point lead.</p>
<p>It wasn’t sustainable, though. The Panthers attempted just eight free throws the remainder of the night, as Notre Dame took better care of the ball and limited the transition opportunities that had led to some of those early fouls.</p>
<p>“I thought we adjusted and were really poised,” Irish coach Mike Brey said. “We were confident that, eventually, offensively they probably couldn’t stay with us.”</p>
<p><strong>Numbers of note</strong></p>
<p><strong>2.4:1</strong> -- Johnson’s assist-to-turnover ratio in Pitt’s past six games, with 36 assists and 15 turnovers. In his team’s six games before that, he had 31 assists and 23 turnovers.</p>
<p><strong>5 —</strong>&nbsp;Times in Pitt’s past 12 games that Brown has finished with at least three blocks. He had three in the loss at Notre Dame.</p>
<p><strong>4 —</strong>&nbsp;Number of times in Pitt’s past five games it has allowed a team to shoot better than 43% against it. That happened only four times in its first 18 games.</p>
