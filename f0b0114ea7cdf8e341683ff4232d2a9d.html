<h1>Ben Cherington expects Gregory Polanco to rebound … in Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Perhaps it’s what he had to say given the contract situation, but Pirates general manager Ben Cherington had a couple of interesting thoughts on Gregory Polanco while meeting with local reporters over Zoom on Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>While Cherington said he believed that Polanco — who turned 29 on Monday — was capable of bouncing back from a brutal 2020 season, the heavier statement was that Cherington expects that to happen in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“He's still really young and at a point in his career where there's no reason to think that he can't be a really good player again,” Cherington said. “I would expect him to be. I look forward to him doing that in a Pirates uniform next year.”</p>
<p>Saying it’s been a tough year for Polanco is putting it mildly. Consider:</p>
<p>• Polanco was slashing just .142/.192/.308 entering Tuesday’s game in Cincinnati. Among MLB hitters with at least 100 plate appearances this season, only Gary Sanchez (.127) of the Yankees has been worse.</p>
<p>• Polanco had struck out 40.5% of the time. Only Miguel Sano (43.0%) had whiffed more frequently, but you can probably cut the Twins’ designated hitter some slack because he’s also slugging .537.</p>
<p>• The Pirates right fielder had 53 strikeouts compared to 17 hits, meaning he’s striking out more than three times as frequently as he gets a hit. Only Sanchez (54 strikeouts against 15 hits) had fared worse.</p>
<p>It’s been popular to say that Polanco has hit the ball hard, and that’s not wrong. Among MLB hitters with at least 100 plate appearances, his average exit velocity of 93 mph ranked 12th.</p>
<p>But it’s also true that Polanco hasn’t hit the ball anywhere near enough; he had just 69 Batted Ball Events (BBE), which was five fewer than Cole Tucker, who had 22 fewer plate appearances than Polanco before Monday’s game.</p>
<p>Off the field, the big issue for the Pirates and Polanco remains his contract. He’s due to make $11 million in 2021, after which the Pirates can buy him out for $3 million or pay him $12.5 million for the 2022 season.</p>
<p>In other words, they don’t really have a choice on Polanco unless they’re able to find a suitor for him this offseason.</p>
<p>“He’s healthy, feels good physically. He’s moving around well. He’s strong,” Cherington said. “He's hitting the ball really hard when he makes contact, which is encouraging. His swing decisions are not different from when he's been successful. He's missing on some fastballs. I'm not sure anyone can say exactly why that is.”</p>
<p>Cherington also talked about how, given how much time Polanco has missed throughout his career, the lack of continuity as a result of COVID-19 may have affected him more than other players.</p>
<p>“It’s been a choppy road, just as far as being out there, for him,” Cherington said. “But I'm really encouraged about all those other things — the strength, the way the ball’s coming off the bat, how he’s moving.</p>
<p>“Nobody doesn't want to perform; certainly, he doesn't. He's coming in here every day, getting back after it with his work and has been a good teammate.”</p>
<p>It’s stating the obvious that the Pirates need Polanco to figure it out over the final two weeks.&nbsp;On one hand, because they need all the help they can get right now. But also in the unlikely event that it could make Polanco marketable to other clubs this offseason.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">Kela likely done</span></strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Cherington isn’t the type to give definitive, set-in-stone answers on anything. But with two weeks left in the season, it certainly sounds like Keone Kela has thrown his last pitch as a Pirate.</span></p>
<p>Kela has not pitched since Aug. 21, which was his third outing of the season. Since then, he’s been out with right forearm discomfort. The right-handed reliever will be a free agent after the season, and he’ll almost assuredly head somewhere else.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">And while Kela has been throwing, it does not sound like he’s able to do that 100%, which would likely ruin any plans the Pirates might have of using him over their remaining 14 games.</span></p>
<p>“The answer is I don’t know for sure,” Cherington said when asked whether Kela will pitch again this season. “I believe that he’s going to be fine. The thing that he felt is something he will recover from. I’m confident of that.</p>
<p>“But until he feels fully confident in being able to throw his curveball as hard as he always throws it to be able to have success, it’s not going to make sense for him to go out there. At this point, the calendar’s starting to work against us a little bit. If the calendar lasted another month, then I’d feel a little differently about it.”</p>
