<h1>Pirates lose final exhibition game with Indians, but aren't worried about results just yet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Derek Holland understands what onlookers will take away from his start on Wednesday.</p>
<p>In the Pirates’ exhibition game against the Cleveland Indians, Holland pitched three innings. He threw some good pitches, but he knows that what jumps out, chiefly, from the outing were the pitches that didn’t end up where he wanted them.</p>
<p>That includes the first inning, when the Indians strung together three hits and two runs, though only one of them was earned. It also includes the third inning, when Indians first baseman Carlos Santana ripped a solo home run down the left field line, just inside the foul pole.</p>
<p>Holland understands that people will look at his final line: three innings, three runs — two earned — in a 5-3 Pirates loss, and think it was a rough one. He doesn’t share that feeling, though.</p>
<p>“I know the one thing that’s going to come up is people are going to talk about the runs that were scored. I’m not worried about that,” Holland said. “This whole last thing was just to make sure everything’s where it needed to be. I thought everything was really good. I thought I had good action, a lot of weak contact. Working with [catcher Jacob Stallings], that was our second time throwing together. I think that was huge too, having the same connection we needed to have a good relationship back there.</p>
<p>“Overall, I think everything was where it needs to be heading into it.”</p>
<p>That is, generally, how players must approach these exhibition games. Holland felt good about how he worked the outside of the plate well, acknowledging that he got beat on some pitches, but that he wasn’t concerned overall.</p>
<p>It is similar to how the Pirates fared as a team. The six relievers used pitched well, limiting the Indians to just four hits and two runs in the final six innings of play. First baseman Josh Bell hit a mammoth home run in the bottom of the first. Left fielder Bryan Reynolds drove in a run too.</p>
<p>Those are all confidence-building plays, to be sure, and the things the Pirates will take away in hopes of ensuring the regular season gets going on the right foot.</p>
<p>Similar to Holland’s Wednesday stats, though, many will see the negatives just as much as the positives: the three home runs the Indians hit, the error that allowed a run to score in the first inning, the loss.</p>
<p>To combat that, personally, Holland has chosen to let any negative press fuel him.</p>
<p>“Trust me, I'm a big reader,” Holland said. “I see what's going on. I've seen somebody ... made a comment about me and [pitcher Steven Brault] and somebody else, telling us that this is a terrible rotation, ripping us apart. We love that. Please keep doing it. Keep ripping us apart, keep telling us that you think we suck and all that. I love it, and so do those guys. I promise you, you're feeding the fire. Love that.”</p>
<p>If Holland is to be believed, that goes for the whole team, too.</p>
<p>“We've got a great vibe and we're not going to let that get destroyed by someone not liking what we're doing,” Holland said. “We're having fun, we're enjoying ourselves. ... People aren't picking us to do anything, and I can tell you right now, that clubhouse loves that mentality right now. Loves that nobody wants us to win, nobody is picking us to win. We're going to go out there and we're going to do everything we can each and every game to give the fans what they deserve.”</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton says he hasn’t addressed outside noise with his team, saying that he has told players to ignore it as much as they can.</p>
<p>As far as the exhibition games in total, the Pirates will ignore the hard results, too. These games are more about getting players up to speed than it is about the statistics themselves.</p>
<p>At the same time, Wednesday was the last opportunity to play a game that doesn’t matter. There are still some roster decisions to be made tonight and tomorrow morning to finalize the Opening Day roster. Beyond that, the preseason is finished.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Pirates will play the St. Louis Cardinals. The game will count. The Pirates can prove what they can do starting then.</p>
