<h1>Civic group proposes improvements to Mon Valley transit options</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburghers for Public Transit is recommending two corridors for Bus Rapid Transit-like improvements to provide better public transportation to the Monongahela Valley.</p>
<p>The civic group is calling for extending&nbsp;the Martin Luther King Jr. East Busway to Monroeville and improving service on the 61C McKeesport bus route. Both would use municipal streets with a combination of exclusive bus lanes and queuing lanes at intersections to give buses first priority at traffic signals.</p>
<p>The preliminary recommendations will be presented for public feedback at 6 p.m. Thursday at Pittsburgh Mennonite Church on South Braddock Avenue, Swissvale. The group expects to finalize recommendations next month.</p>
<p>“We want to make sure the recommendations match the vision of the communities,” said Josh Malloy, a community organizer with PPT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The group decided to develop its own proposal for improving transit in the Mon Valley after Port Authority’s initial plans for Bus Rapid Transit between Oakland and Downtown Pittsburgh called for eliminating some service and requiring other routes to end in Oakland. Those cuts, later called off, would have followed severe reductions in those communities — some of them among the poorest in the county —&nbsp;when the agency had serious financial problems in 2011.</p>
<p>Using a $47,000 grant from the Heinz Endowments and working with two consultants, the group met with the public and municipal leaders throughout the valley to discuss transit needs. Their goal was to develop a less-expensive alternative to a Port Authority study that called for extending the East Busway from Swissvale to East Pittsburgh at an unlikely-to-be-funded price tag of $549 million.</p>
<p>In Mr. Malloy’s mind, they have succeeded. He said the recommendations likely would cost tens of millions of dollars, not $549 million, and include two corridors rather than one.</p>
<p>On the north side of the Monongahela River, instead of extending the busway along the Norfolk Southern railroad corridor, buses would use exclusive lanes or priority at traffic lights to pass through Rankin, Braddock, East Pittsburgh and Turtle Creek before following James Street to Monroeville Mall, the Miracle Mile Shopping Center and Forbes Regional Hospital. That would connect those suburbs with major employment centers.</p>
<p>On the south side of the river, the plan calls for greatly improving the efficiency of the 61C bus route with exclusive bus lanes and priority at traffic lights. That would improve connections for riders in McKeesport, Duquesne, Whitaker, Munhall and Homestead.</p>
<p>Mr. Malloy said the plan also calls recommends that municipalities improve sidewalks and other connections such as local bus stops and would encourage major employers whose workers would benefit from improved transit to help offset some of the costs. Local officials&nbsp;“for the most part” have reacted positively to the group’s approach, he said.</p>
<p>“There is overall support,” he said.&nbsp;“Everyone wants better transit.”</p>
<p>So far, Port Authority has expressed an interest but hasn’t committed to including the proposal in the 25-year plan it is developing. Regardless, Mr. Malloy said, the community group believes its process has shown the agency the value more community involvement as it develops transit projects.</p>
<p>“We’re very excited to be moving forward,” he said.&nbsp;“I think this whole process is changing how transportation plans can be developed for the community, with participation at the beginning rather than after decisions have already been made.”</p>
