<p>The Keystone State Games and the Pennsylvania Senior Games have been canceled due to the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual events, sometimes described as a state Olympics for athletes young and old, would have drawn thousands of athletes and their family members to Luzerne County July 22 to Aug. 2. But&nbsp;James J. Costello, executive director of&nbsp;Keystone State Games Inc., announced Wednesday evening that all events have been canceled due to state mandates and social-gathering recommendations.&nbsp;"Our priority is the safety and well-being of our game participants, sponsors and volunteers, and we believe this is the best decision.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said&nbsp;organizers had anticipated having 5,500 to 6,000 participants (athletes, coaches, officials and coordinators) and about 10,000 participants total with all of the events the organization has had to cancel including its gymnastics championship, AAU district track and field meets and AAU area 2 track and field national qualifiers.&nbsp;“We are working very hard to implement new programs that we can run in the fall and are working on a virtual program to keep our athletes engaged.”</p>
<p>Those replacement events that are tentatively planned for fall in several locations include a&nbsp;PA Senior Sports Festival &amp; Health &amp; Fitness Expo in Lancaster; a&nbsp;Keystone Ice Hockey Invitational Tournament in Pittston; a&nbsp;Keystone Games Virtual 5K /10K Run; a&nbsp;High School Baseball Showcase in Moosic; a&nbsp;PA Pickleball Championship in Dallas; a&nbsp;Keystone Golf Championships and Captain N Crew Tournament in Wilkes-Barre; and a&nbsp;Keystone Open IFH Championship in Luzerne County.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Details are to be posted at <a href="https://www.keystonegames.org" target="_blank">www.keystonegames.org</a>. And athletes who already have registered will be reimbursed by the same method by which they paid.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since they started in 1981, according to organizers, the Keystone Games have attracted more than 500,000 participants.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Luzerne County has been hard hit by the novel coronavirus and is still in the red phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s statewide reopening plan.&nbsp;</p>
