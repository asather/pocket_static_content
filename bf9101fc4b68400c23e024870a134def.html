<h1>Art Rooney II says Le'Veon Bell 'experience' won't impact Steelers' use of franchise tag</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers aren’t going to let a bad experience with Le’Veon Bell affect their decision to use a franchise or transition tag on outside linebacker Bud Dupree.</p>
<p>Team president Art Rooney II said the situation with Bell, who skipped training camp in 2017 and sat out the entire 2018 season after receiving the franchise tag, was an isolated incident and will not impact what the Steelers do with Dupree, who is an unrestricted free agent.</p>
<p>After two years of wondering if and when Bell would report to the team, the Steelers decided to wash their hands of the continuous uncertainty and parted ways with their All-Pro running back 11 months ago. He signed a long-term deal with the New York Jets.</p>
<p>“I don’t think that affects the way we think about franchise tags or anything at this point,” Rooney said. “We had one, I’ll call it unusual experience, and I think it was that — an unusual experience.”</p>
<p>Bringing back Dupree, who is coming off his best NFL season, is <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2019/12/30/bud-dupree-contract-steelers-linebackers-t-j-watt/stories/201912300071" target="_blank">a “high priority” for the Steelers</a>, according to coach Mike Tomlin. Rooney agreed with that assessment during an interview last week. And they intend to do that by using the franchise tag, which would cost them approximately $16 million in 2020, based on a salary cap of $200 million.</p>
<p>The Steelers cannot place the franchise tag on Dupree until Feb. 25, which is also the first day of the NFL Combine in Indianapolis. They then have two weeks, or until March 10, to use the tag. If they don’t, Dupree is free to sign with another team and will likely command a premium price as an edge rusher who can sack the quarterback.</p>
<p>“When you look around the league, people use the franchise tag, and sometimes it works to help get a contract done,” Rooney said. “Sometimes it’s a short-term solution, but for the most part, it’s what’s helped teams keep players on the field.”</p>
<p>It is unlikely the team will try to sign Dupree, 26, to a long-term deal because that money is being earmarked for a big contract for Pro Bowl outside linebacker T.J. Watt, who has one year and an option remaining on his rookie deal. But they can still keep him around for at least one more season, maybe two, with a franchise tag.</p>
<p>The Steelers elected to use a fifth-year option on Dupree that cost them $9.2 million in 2019, hoping the move would also serve to motivate their former No. 1 draft pick. He responded by posting a career-high 11½ sacks, leading the team with 16 tackles for loss, finishing second with four forced fumbles and third with two fumble recoveries.</p>
<p>Dupree teamed with Watt to have 26 sacks, the most by a Steelers outside linebacker tandem since James Harrison (16) and LaMarr Woodley (11½) combined for 27½ in 2008.</p>
<p>The Steelers do not want to disrupt that production. And they are not going to let what happened with Bell impact the process.</p>
