<h1>Pittsburgh Mills’ Cinemark movie theater to permanently close</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Movie theaters throughout Pennsylvania have been closed for almost two months now as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to make public gatherings in those spaces unsafe. Even when they eventually are deemed eligible for opening, though, one local theater will remain shuttered.</p>
<p>The Cinemark 18 theater in Frazer Township’s Galleria at Pittsburgh Mills shopping center announced Monday that it will be closing for good soon, a company spokesman confirmed to the Post-Gazette. The national movie theater chain said that this decision wasn’t spurred by COVID-19 closures affecting the company’s economic prospects.</p>
<p>“This closure is normal course of business and the result of the careful and ongoing review of our theatre fleet,” read an emailed statement from the company.</p>
<p>There is no official closing date yet for Cinemark 18, though the company also indicated in its statement that the Pittsburgh Mills location’s lease is close to expiring.</p>
<p>The expected closure of the location in northern Allegheny County will leave four Cinemark theaters&nbsp;in Western Pennsylvania: Cinemark Monroeville Mall; Cinemark Robinson Township; Cinemark North Hills in McCandless; and Cinemark Center Township Marketplace in Beaver County.</p>
<p>The movie theater industry as a whole has been hit hard by the forced closures of the last two months. Cinemark is the country’s third-largest movie theater franchise, and its finances have been in such disarray that it <a href="https://deadline.com/2020/05/cinemark-delays-filing-quarterly-report-amc-entertainment-exhibition-coronavirus-1202929913/" target="_blank">opted to delay reporting them</a> for the quarter that ended in March until June 11 at the earliest, Deadline reported.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is slowly allowing some businesses throughout the state to open. Allegheny County will move from a “red” designation to “yellow” starting on Friday, which will allow certain businesses —<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2020/05/10/Western-Pennsylavania-drive-in-movie-theaters-opening-COVID-19-pandemic/stories/202004300158" target="_blank"> like drive-in movie theaters</a> — to begin generating revenue again.</p>
<p>Standard movie theaters, however, will remain closed in both red and yellow counties for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>The theater chain is owned by Cinemark Holdings, which is based in Plano, Texas.</p>
