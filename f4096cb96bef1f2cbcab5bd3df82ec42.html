<h1>'The Drake guys': Pitt's Charlie Partridge and N.C. State's Dave Doeren racked up miles and memories</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Phil Bennett couldn’t believe his eyes.</p>
<p>It was 6 a.m. on a Friday during spring camp when Bennett parked his car outside the football offices at Amon G. Carter Stadium in Fort Worth, Texas. Back in 1997, about a decade before he’d join Pitt’s staff, Bennett was the defensive coordinator at TCU.</p>
<p>“TCU has a gate you have to unlock to get to your office,” Bennett said in his Texan tongue before pausing. “I look up and they’re there. I was just about floored. I’m sitting there in my car like, ‘Well damn, there are my Drake guys.’ ”</p>
<p>His “Drake guys” were three eager graduate assistants from the small private school in Iowa, one that features a non-scholarship Football Championship Subdivision (formerly Division I-AA) football program — a program that will be well-represented at noon on Saturday at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>Charlie Partridge, Pitt’s defensive line coach and associate head coach, was one of the “Drake guys” waiting for Bennett at TCU’s gate. So was N.C. State head coach Dave Doeren, who will lead his Wolfpack against the Panthers this week. The third was Chris Ash, Rutgers’ former head coach who’s now the defensive coordinator at Texas.</p>
<p>The three of them — Partridge, Doeren and Ash — went to Drake University, played together, coached together and learned first-hand how many miles it takes to drive from Des Moines to Big 12 country.</p>
<p>To Stillwater, Okla., it’s 507 miles down Interstate 35. To Norman, it’s 556. And to where they are now, well, that’s too high to count.</p>
<p>“Our spring breaks, we would pick a highway, and we figured out who was in spring ball. We would cold call the offices and say, ‘Can we come watch practice? Can we sit in on as many meetings as you’ll let us sit in on?’ ” Partridge said. “We were just hungry to learn. ... The three of us just had this weird, unique connection, and we were trying to get everything we could from any coach that would let us talk to them.”</p>
<p>“Anything to learn ball, we did together,” Doeren added. “Charlie’s not just a guy who’s a friend or colleague. He’s like a brother to me.”</p>
<p>Former Drake head coach Rob Ash, no relation to Chris, deserves some credit for facilitating the relationship between Saturday’s rivals.</p>
<p>After his senior season in high school, Partridge was a 5-foot-10 nose guard without a home. Signing day came and went without any scholarship offers. But thankfully for the Plantation, Fla., native, Rob Ash identified him at a small-college recruiting fair, well after the major prospects faxed in their letters of intent.</p>
<p>The fair was set up at a south Florida high school, with high school coaches from around the area sitting at round tables, ready to pitch their overlooked players. The Division I-AA coaches worked the room, chatted, secured film and watched tape in classrooms throughout the school.</p>
<p>The next day, it was the Division I-AA coaches sitting around the tables. They told the high school coaches whom they were interested in, and the players showed up with their parents to chat with the coaches. That’s how Partridge met Rob Ash.</p>
<p>“He was one of the strongest players we’ve ever recruited,” Drake’s 18-year coach said. “He could bench press 400 pounds as a high school senior. He was short, but he was extremely strong. That attracted us to him: His strength and then his personality, of course.”</p>
<p>Partridge wasn’t getting any football-related financial aid. Drake played (and still plays) in the non-scholarship Pioneer League, along with Dayton, Valparaiso, San Diego and a wide array of otherwise unconnected schools. Still, an opportunity at the next level was enough for Partridge to pick Drake.</p>
<p>Doeren, a tight end, chose the Bulldogs a year before Partridge. Chris Ash, a defensive back, did the same a year after Partridge. The trio became friends on the team and reunited on Rob Ash’s staff shortly after.</p>
<p>Rob Ash said he got in the habit of bringing back former players who had an interest in the profession. Drake’s head coach had only two full-time assistants, so the rest of the position groups were manned by novices who just wanted a chance.</p>
<p>Doeren, Partridge and Chris Ash started as GAs at Drake in ’95, ’96 and ’97, respectively — a less-than-glorious job with less-than-glorious pay. Partridge and Doeren roomed together, while Chris Ash lived at the Drake fieldhouse for about a month after getting the gig. Doeren and Partridge mowed grass on campus when they weren’t poring over coaching manuals and whatever else they could their hands on.</p>
<p>“I can recall working late and seeing those guys in the office,” Mike Mahon, Drake’s former sports information director said. “You just wondered where they’d be five years from then. I mean, they had a passion and love for the game of football.”</p>
<p>And it showed on the odometer of Partridge’s car. Those spring break trips — to the likes of Manhattan, Kan., and Lincoln, Neb., not Cancun or Daytona Beach — shaped their early coaching careers.</p>
<p>Drake didn’t hold spring camp, so the trio crashed on friends’ couches across the Great Plains and Texas and picked the brains of head coach after head coach, coordinator after coordinator. Doeren made an impression on Oklahoma defensive play-caller Bill Young, who went to USC in 1998 and hired Doeren as a grad assistant. And all three shocked Bennett at TCU.</p>
<p>The well-traveled coach was familiar with Drake and its program after a three-year stint as Iowa State’s defensive coordinator. So when the up-and-coming coaches arrived in Fort Worth on a Thursday in 1997, Bennett took them out for beers and pizza.</p>
<p>They were up late when Bennett told them he gets to the stadium early. TCU had a scrimmage scheduled Friday, and he’d be in the office no later than 6:30 a.m. Sure enough, “the Drake guys” were waiting at the stadium gates as he pulled up.</p>
<p>Friday night, Bennett took them out again, this time for beers, BBQ and talking ’ball. Again, they were up late. And again, the next day, Partridge, Doeren and Chris Ash beat Bennett to Amon G. Carter Stadium.</p>
<p>“As much beer we had and as much BS’ing we did, I thought they’d come in dragging right before lunch. But they had a purpose,” Bennett said. “And I know it’s easy to say it now, but I told everyone who would listen: I saw it when they were graduate assistants at Drake ...</p>
<p>“I’m not surprised, not a lick, that all of them have had such tremendous careers.”</p>
<p>Rob Ash loved it when Doeren, Partridge and Chris Ash came back from those spring break road trips. They had fun, “the same way anyone in their early 20s would have fun,” Partridge said. But they returned to Des Moines energized, eager to share everything they picked up along the way.</p>
<p>That commitment, that uninhibited desire to learn served the trio well. Doeren went off to USC in 1998. Partridge became a GA at Iowa State the same year. And Chris Ash joined Partridge in Ames in 2000, when Partridge became the Cyclones’ director of football operations.</p>
<p>They all split off shortly after that. But in 2006, Doeren was brought in to be Wisconsin’s co-defensive coordinator under head coach Bret Bielema. He was later promoted to be the Badgers’ full-time play-caller in 2008, when Partridge joined from Pitt to coach the defensive line. In 2010, Chris Ash was hired by Wisconsin as its defensive backs’ coach, and the trio was — improbably — reunited.</p>
<p>“I always told them, getting a job is always a matter of network and knowledge,” Rob Ash said. “You’ve gotta have a network to get an opportunity, and you’ve gotta have the knowledge to land the job.”</p>
<p>“The Drake guys” had both. In their only year together in Madison, they produced the Big Ten’s third-best defense, as J.J. Watt and the 2010 Badgers went 11-2 and appeared in the program’s first Rose Bowl in a decade.</p>
<p>Doeren’s success at Wisconsin earned him the first head coaching job of the bunch. In 2011, he was hired by Northern Illinois with the help of Christian Spears, Pitt’s current deputy athletic director who served in the same role at the MAC school. Doeren won 23 games in two seasons and took the N.C. State gig in 2013.</p>
<p>That’s when Partridge and Chris Ash left Wisconsin, following Bielema to Arkansas. But in 2014, Partridge started his three-year tenure as Florida Atlantic’s head coach, and Ash was hired by Ohio State — his leaping off point to the Rutgers job.</p>
<p>Four years ago, Drake was the one of only eight schools in the country that could claim three Football Bowl Subdivision coaches as alumni.</p>
<p>“It seems like it was yesterday that those guys were at Drake,” Mahon, the Drake SID, said. “When you’re a grad assistant, you’re not in it for the money with the hours you put in. But when you get your reward, you never forget your roots. And that’s the nice thing about those guys.”</p>
<p>Rob Ash knows that better than anyone.</p>
<p>The former Drake and Montana State coach throws a party at the American Football Coaches Association convention every year. It started three decades ago as four or five guys having drinks. But in recent years, it’s turned into an event, with Rob Ash’s 100-person coaching tree — Partridge, Doeren, Chris Ash included — passing through and sharing stories.</p>
<p>Some have reconnected after their time at Drake. Some coach at rival schools.</p>
<p>Rob Ash swears that he doesn’t root for one former protege over another. He’ll stay neutral when Pitt and N.C. State face off. But regardless of Saturday’s outcome, Rob Ash will watch proudly, knowing both Partridge and Doeren successfully navigated an unforgiving business together — whether they were on the same staff or not.</p>
<p>Partridge and Doeren are still close. The former roommates lived across the street from each other at Wisconsin. Their wives and children are friends. And they talk frequently, every couple weeks at least.</p>
<p>Both coaches kept their separation this week. But Partridge and Doeren acknowledged that they look forward to seeing each other after Saturday’s game — a noteworthy pitstop on the path of two coaches, who spent their early days in the industry racking up miles and memories.</p>
<p>“Honestly, when we were all kind of going through that process as young coaches, I don’t know if I ever knew that I would get a chance as a head coach like I did,” Partridge said. “But you knew Dave was going to get that shot. ... He made me better, and I know he’s going to have his team ready to play this week.”</p>
<p>“As a coach, I think he’s one of the best. What he’s done with that defensive line there, what he did with our D-line at Wisconsin, I think he’s very, very good at what he does,” Doeren said of Partridge. “He’ll continue to do great things at Pittsburgh or wherever else he ends up down the road. Because he’s a really good person and a good football coach.”</p>
