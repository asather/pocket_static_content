<h1>Penn State adds 4-star athlete Ken Talley to 2022 class</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State hasn't allowed the lack of a 2020 season to stop the momentum in 2022 recruiting.</p>
<p>Ken Talley, a four-star athlete who played linebacker/defensive end at&nbsp;Northeast High School in Philadelphia, became the sixth player of the Nittany Lionsâ€™ 2022 class when he committed Tuesday.</p>
<p>Talley is the third in-state recruit in the class, joining four-star offensive tackle Drew Shelton from Downingtown and three-star quarterback Beau Pribula of York. Talley is the first defensive player to join the class. Four-star tight ends Holden Staes and Jerry Cross from Atlanta and Milwaukee, respectively, and four-star receiver Kaden Sanders from Ohio round out the group.</p>
<p>Talley chose Penn State over Arizona State and Tennessee.</p>
