<h1>Storm likely to bring 1-3 inches of snow and could impact tomorrow's morning commute</h1>

<p>A winter storm is expected to bring rain and accumulated snow beginning overnight Thursday and into Friday evening.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service is forecasting 1 to 3 inches of snow for much of the Pittsburgh area, but said some areas may see up to four inches.</p>
<p>Jared Rackley, a meteorologist at the Coraopolis-based weather agency, said a low-pressure system moving southwest to northeast through the region will bring the heaviest snow between 2 a.m. and 9 a.m.</p>
<p>Mr. Rackley said the snow will be the wet type.</p>
<p>"The good news is that the roads are still warm," he said. "At least initially, it will accumulate on the trees and grass. The question is, ‘how fast is it going to fall?’ "</p>
<p>Icy roads are a possibility in the morning, but more so as the day progresses, Mr. Rackley said.</p>
<p>"There's will definitely be the possibility of slick spots during the morning commute, but we'll see how that plays out," he said. The bigger concern will be in rural areas surrounding Allegheny County. "Especially on untreated roads," said Mr. Rackley.</p>
<p>In a statement, Stephen G. Shanley, the county's public works director, said the county will deploy 26 salt truck with plows beginning at 2 a.m. Friday to "provide constant coverage until the precipitation stops and county roadways are clear."</p>
