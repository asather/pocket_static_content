<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A group of a students, parents and other activists on Wednesday used a Pleasant Hills parking lot to protest police brutality and racism.</p>
<p>Several dozen people, many of them students in the West Jefferson Hills School District, arrived around noon and stood in the lot at the Southland Shopping Center. At the shopping plaza, the business, including an LA Fitness and Five Below, were boarded up.</p>
<p>In addition to protesting the death of George Floyd, a black man killed by Minneapolis police officers while in custody, the group also condemned a video -- made by middle school students in the district -- mocking Mr. Floyd's death.</p>
<p>Hillary Williams, the leader of the protest, started the event.&nbsp;“Your students are crying,” she said. “They are hurting.”</p>
<p>Protesters formed a circle and students from Thomas Jefferson High School stood in its center.</p>
<p>Zyan Barrett, a junior and president of the multicultural student union, spoke to the crowd.</p>
<p>“I stand here to voice the pain, injustices and inequalities that we face everyday," he said. "We have endured the pain of silence for far too long.”</p>
<p>Police were present at the event and police tape was used to block of a section of the lot for the protesters.</p>
<p>“This is the first time a lot of these young people have excercised their right to protest, and we just want to make sure that they’re safe and that we support them," said Pleasant Hills police Chief Brian Finnerty.</p>
<p>“Other people show up to these things to cause violence and distort the message of the protest, so we’re working to make sure that doesn’t happen today,” he said.</p>
<p>About a half-dozen men who were openly carrying firearms at the shopping center.</p>
<p>They said that they were not counter-protesters, but were there to protect the businesses.</p>
<p>The protest remained peaceful.</p>
<p>“When people destroy businesses in their communities, they don’t realize they’re putting their neighbors out of work, their friends out of work," said one of the men, who identified himself as Alan B. "We’re here to prevent that from happening.”</p>
