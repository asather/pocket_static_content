<h1>Rochester wins rematch for second consecutive Class 1A girls title</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>History doesn’t always repeat itself, but it’s starting to feel that way in Class 1A.</p>
<p>Top-seeded Rochester (24-1) rallied back from an early deficit against West Greene for the second year in a row to capture its second WPIAL girls basketball championship Friday afternoon at Petersen Events Center with a 59-43 win. The Pioneers (24-1) made it to the title game for the third consecutive year, but all three trips have resulted in silver medals.</p>
<p>Rams sophomore guard Corynne Hauser led all players with 17 points, while senior forward Jasmine Mack finished with 15 points and 10 rebounds. Junior point guard Jersey Wise scored a team-high 16 points for West Greene in the defeat.</p>
<p>Rochester pulled out a 62-56 win against the Pioneers in last year’s title game, and the Rams rumbled through their regular season schedule with only one loss — a two-point defeat vs. Class 4A semifinalist Central Valley. With virtually every key contributor returning from last year’s title-winning team, Rochester’s return to the championship game was no surprise.</p>
<p>West Greene, on the other hand, lost three 1,000-point scorers from last year’s team — yet somehow managed to put together an undefeated regular season on its way back to the championship game rematch.</p>
<p>The Pioneers used a 9-2 run to open up an early six-point lead, then junior point guard Jersey Wise used a timely steal and score after a 3-pointer by sophomore guard Katie Lampe to give West Greene a 15-8 lead.</p>
<p>After another 3-pointer by Wise, Hauser drained a buzzer-beating 3-pointer from the corner at the end of the first quarter to make it an 18-15 game.</p>
<p>Another steal and score by Wise gave the Pioneers a 26-21 lead midway through the second quarter, but that’s when the Rams made their run. First, junior guard Alexis Robison nailed with a 3-pointer in the corner, then a fast-break layup by her sister, Mekenzie, tied the game at 26.</p>
<p>Senior guard Bethany Barto then made a put-back after a missed 3-pointer to give Rochester a 34-28 advantage into the break.</p>
<p>Mack made a layup to open up the second half, then Wise followed with a long-range jumper for West Greene. Back-to-back layups by Alexis Robison and Hauser gave the Rams a 42-32 lead midway through the third quarter, but the Pioneers trimmed it to 42-36 going into the fourth.</p>
<p>Mekenzie Robison opened up the final quarter with a 3-pointer, then a put-back by Mack stretched Rochester’s lead back to double digits at 47-36. A pair of baskets by Wise and sophomore guard Anna Durbin cut it to 47-40, but the Rams responded with four buckets in a row to open up a commanding 55-40 lead on their way to the victory.</p>
