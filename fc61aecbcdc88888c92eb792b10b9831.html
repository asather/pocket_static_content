<h1>Retail robotics firm Berkshire Grey to expand Pittsburgh presence</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Berkshire Grey, a technology company working on automated machines for the retail and e-commerce industries, has plans to expand.</p>
<p>The Lexington, Massachusetts-based company, with a<strong>&nbsp;</strong>research and development office in Washington’s Landing, announced it had received $263 million from a Series B funding round Tuesday. It plans to use the funds for “global expansion, acquisitions and team growth,” according to a press release.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey’s most recent funding comes from Tokyo-based SoftBank, Khosla Ventures and Canaan in Menlo Park, Calif. and New Enterprise Associates in Chevy Chase, Md.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey plans to add to its Pittsburgh team but could not release any hiring targets, said vice president of marketing Pete Blair.</p>
<p>The company, founded in 2013 and operating in “stealth mode” until December 2018 as it developed its machines, offers a suite of robots to help retailers move more efficiently through processes like packaging goods to be shipped out for orders or unloading and restocking shelves.</p>
<p>The process starts with small robots, called FlexBots, that move around a warehouse autonomously, picking up bins and objects and moving them closer to larger robots. Those machines have long arms that can move objects through the next step, like placing them onto a conveyor belt.</p>
<p>The bots use machine perception, or a type of artificial intelligence that allows computers to “see” — to figure out how to pick up the object. In a way, it works like a human, readjusting and learning more about the different types of objects as it goes.</p>
<p>Berkshire Grey said its customers optimize labor picking costs by 70% to 80% and improve throughput by 25% to 35%.</p>
<p>The funding announcement comes at a time when retail and e-commerce markets are turning to robotics as a way to increase productivity by supplementing the role of its human employees.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Walmart announced it planned to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2020/01/13/Bossa-Nova-robots-Walmart-NCR-stocking-CMU-technology/stories/202001130095" target="_blank">deploy 1,000 robots from Bossa Nova</a>, a San Francisco-based company with offices in the Strip District. The robots travel stores, scanning shelves and alerting employees of low inventory, mispriced items or other things that have gone awry.</p>
<p>Seattle-based Amazon operates hundreds of thousands of robots to move inventory around fulfillment centers. One day, it hopes to develop a fully electric delivery system that uses autonomous robots to get packages to customers.</p>
<p>In 2012, Amazon acquired Kiva Technologies to integrate robots into its facilities — a move that led Mr. Wagner to start Berkshire Grey, he <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2018/12/12/bershire-grey-amazon-pittsburgh-boston-robotics-cmu-e-commerce-retail-delivery-online-shopping/stories/201812100028" target="_blank">told the Post-Gazette in a 2018 interview.</a><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The acquisition showed him the market potential for automating warehouse processes for e-commerce and logistics customers.</p>
<p>“Amazon invested heavily in technology,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2018/12/12/bershire-grey-amazon-pittsburgh-boston-robotics-cmu-e-commerce-retail-delivery-online-shopping/stories/201812100028" target="_blank">Mr. Blair said in an earlier interview.</a> “You can almost classify them as a technology company first, and all of traditional retail is realizing that and running in a certain direction.”</p>
