<p>Daniel Dae Kim says he has tested positive for the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“Ready for a fight? I am.” the actor and Lehigh Valley native tweeted Thursday. “Yesterday I was diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the #coronavirus,” Kim added.</p>
<p>The actor, who grew up in Bethlehem, Pa., is best known for his TV roles on “Lost” and “Hawaii Five-0.” He’s found additional success with his production company’s ABC-TV series “The Good Doctor,” about a young surgeon with autism. The hit program features one of the most diverse casts on network television.</p>
<p>The 51-year-old Freedom High School graduate had been working in New York City last week on the NBC medical drama “New Amsterdam” and returned to his home in Honolulu on Sunday.</p>
<p>Born in Busan, South Korea, Kim spent the better part of his early life growing up in the Lehigh Valley. He attended Palmer Elementary School and Easton Middle School, then East Hills and Freedom High School in Bethlehem.</p>
<p>Kim is the latest high profile celebrity to have tested positive for the virus. Earlier this week, actor Idris Elba said he tested positive and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson remain in isolation after being discharged from an Australian hospital following their coronavirus diagnosis.</p>
<p>For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.</p>
<p>Kim in an Instagram video message said, “Looks like I’ll be OK, but I wanted to share my journey with you in the hopes that you find it informative or helpful. Hope you all stay safe, calm, and above all, healthy.”</p>
