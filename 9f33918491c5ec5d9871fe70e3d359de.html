<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Trust “Sesame Street” to comfort and delight kids in a time of the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Sesame Workshop, the nonprofit behind the iconic children’s program on HBO and public television, began a free “Caring for Each Other” initiative last Friday.</p>
<p>Its goal is not only to help with and explain the pandemic to youngsters — but there are bundles of fun online learning activities as well.</p>
<p>A statement on <a href="https://www.sesamestreet.org/caring" target="_blank">SesameStreet.org/caring</a> notes: “Your friends at Sesame Street are here to support you and your family during the COVID-19 health crisis. We understand that these are very stressful times; our daily lives have been disrupted, and we are all coping with uncertainty. As we create a new sense of normalcy, it’s important that we take care of ourselves, so that we can best care for our children.</p>
<p>“This site provides content and resources you can use with your family to offer comfort and spark playful learning activities. Children thrive with structure in their lives and they learn best through play, even in everyday moments like mealtimes and morning and evening routines. We hope the content and resources help you and your family breathe, laugh and play together! And remember — they are not prescriptions you have to follow, but ideas you can use to spark other playful learning moments.”</p>
<p>Elmo provides an introduction video, where he says he’s “at home with his mommy and his daddy and his goldfish, Dorothy!”</p>
<p>“It’s hard to be away from all your friends,” says the shaggy red Muppet, adding, “We’re going to have a lot of virtual fun together.”</p>
<p>The site, sesamestreet.org/caring provides interactive and downloadable activities, games and art for kids, episodes of the program, and a guide for parents that includes a de-stress suggestion that works for people of all ages: don’t overload on media about the pandemic.</p>
<p>A Sesame Street link to its <a href="https://www.sesamestreet.org/newsletter" target="_blank">newsletter</a> can be found on the site as well.</p>
