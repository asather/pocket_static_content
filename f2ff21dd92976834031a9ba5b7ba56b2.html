<h1>Aliquippa school board president charged with threatening students</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The president of the Aliquippa School Board has been accused of threatening to stab two students at the city’s junior/senior high school with a pair of scissors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police on Monday charged Aileen Gilbert, 69, of Aliquippa, with two counts each of terroristic threats, simple assault and harassment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Feb. 4, a police affidavit said, Ms. Gilbert entered a classroom at the school and&nbsp;“a disagreement took place” between her and two female students.</p>
<p>“During that disagreement [Ms. Gilbert] picked up a pair of scissors with a pointed metal tip and threatened the two females that she would stab them with the scissors if they did not tell her their names,” the affidavit said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A teacher entered the classroom after hearing the commotion and asked Ms. Gilbert why she was in the classroom. The affidavit did not say if Ms. Gilbert gave an answer.</p>
<p>The students, 12- and 13-year-old girls, went to the school office after the incident and spoke with the vice principal, who tried to get them to settle down. The vice principal said one of the girls was crying.</p>
<p>The affidavit said the girls told investigators “that they were afraid at the time of the incident” and believed that Ms. Gilbert was going to stab them.</p>
<p>Ms. Gilbert posted $10,000 unsecured bond on Monday. She was scheduled to have a preliminary hearing March 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Neither Ms. Gilbert nor her attorney could immediately be reached Tuesday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
