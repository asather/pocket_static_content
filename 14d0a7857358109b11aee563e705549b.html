<h1>Pa. Turnpike to raise tolls 6% in January, add 45% surcharge for most non-E-ZPass drivers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike’s baker’s dozen of annual toll increases will come with a special treat next January for motorists who don’t use the prepaid E-ZPass: a 45% surcharge for processing Toll-By-Plate arrangements.</p>
<p>The increase unanimously approved without discussion by the Turnpike Commission Tuesday for all motorists will be 6% — whether they pay using E-ZPass or have a photo taken of their license plate and receive a bill in the mail. Right now, it costs passenger vehicles $44.20 for a cross-state trip using E-ZPass and $61.80 for those who use Toll By Plate.</p>
<p>But in addition to the increase, those who don’t have E-ZPass and receive a bill in the mail will pay a 45% surcharge to cover processing the payment and help the agency balance its books.</p>
<p>The surcharge will not be added to six locations where motorists pay a separate fee: the Gateway Toll Plaza near the Ohio border; Beaver Valley Expressway; Turnpike Route 66 near Greensburg; the Findlay Connector near Pittsburgh International Airport; the Delaware River Bridge at the New Jersey border; and the Keyser Avenue and Clarks Summit toll plazas on the Northeastern Extension.</p>
<p>The change will mean the most common toll for a passenger vehicle will go from $1.50 to $1.60 for E-ZPass customers and from $2.50 to $3.90 for Toll By Plate, including the surcharge. For&nbsp;a Class-5 tractor trailer, it will increase from $12.20 to $13 for E-ZPass and from $17.30 to $26.60&nbsp;for Toll By Plate, including the surcharge.&nbsp;It will also mean a bill for a $50 toll will include a surcharge of $22.50.</p>
<p>It will be the 13th straight year the Turnpike has raised tolls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s a big change for Toll-By-Plate customers, who had been paying the same rate as cash customers who already were charged a higher fee than E-ZPass users. The Turnpike initially suspended cash payments at the start of the pandemic in March to reduce contact between motorists and toll takers, but in May it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/06/02/Pa-Turnpike-permanently-going-cashless-immediately-500-toll-collectors-losing-jobs-layoffs/stories/202006020113" target="_blank">decided to go cashless on a permanent basis</a>.</p>
<p>As a result, the agency is in the process of laying off about 500 people whose work involved collecting or processing cash tolls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a news release, CEO Mark Compton said the surcharge is needed to cover the higher cost of processing and mailing bills since it switched to all-electronic tolling.&nbsp;The agency would prefer all motorists use E-ZPass.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The new Toll-By-Plate rate reflects the higher costs the commission incurs to process the toll and collect payment — a pricing approach used by tolling agencies across the nation to cover the costs of administering AET systems,” he said. “This balanced approach allows us to maintain a lower rate for those choosing a payment method that is less costly to manage, while those who choose a pricier payment option absorb those costs.”</p>
<p>Overall, about 86% of Turnpike motorists use E-ZPass. Now, the 14% who don’t will pay the higher toll plus the 45% surcharge. Collecting that additional charge could be a challenge for the agency, which only collects about 65% of those mailed bills before sending them to a collection agency.</p>
<p>In December, the Turnpike reported that the projected toll increase for 2021 would be 6%, but if the state Legislature allowed the agency’s $450 million annual payment for public transit to reduce to $50 million as scheduled after 2022, those increases would drop regularly until they reached 3% in 2028.</p>
<p>But that was before the COVID-19 pandemic in March gave the turnpike a severe financial blow, dropping&nbsp;traffic by more than 50% and revenue by more than 40% for two months compared to the previous year. Traffic last week still was down 23.5% and revenue was off 30.1% compared to the same period in 2019.</p>
<p>The agency says it has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/transportation/2020/05/12/PennDOT-Pennsylvania-Turnpike-COVID-19-push-bacck-projects-roads-bridges/stories/202005120111" target="_blank">lost about $160 million in revenue since March</a> and has projected it cold lose several hundred million before traffic returns to pre-pandemic levels.</p>
<p>The board also passed a new operating budget of&nbsp;$426.2 million for the year that began June 1, down slightly from about $432 million last year.</p>
