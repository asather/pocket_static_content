<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PennDOT announced Friday that changes will occur on several major projects next week.</p>
<p>Northbound I-579, Uptown, will close for beam setting between the Centre Avenue Exit and the Bigelow Boulevard overpass from 7 p.m. to 6 a.m. nightly from Tuesday until May 30.</p>
<p>A single-lane restriction will simultaneously occur on southbound I-579 on each night of the closures.</p>
<p>The work is part of the $29.34 million “Cap” project sponsored by the city of Pittsburgh and the Sports &amp; Exhibition Authority, to create a structure spanning I-579 to link Downtown with the Hill District.</p>
<p>Also on Tuesday, a traffic switch will occur on the Elizabeth Bridge.</p>
<p>A long-term single-lane restriction will be implemented northbound for crews to conduct cable replacements on the bridge.</p>
<p>The work is part of the $31.1 million Elizabeth Bridge Rehabilitation Project, which also includes steel repairs, concrete deck and barrier replacement, expansion dam replacement, bearing repairs, and more.</p>
<p>Wednesday through next Friday, crews will do&nbsp;milling and paving operations on West Carson Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Single-lane restrictions on Route 837 will occur between the Smithfield Street Bridge and the West End Circle from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. each day. Only minor work with short-term restrictions will occur during the overnight hours.</p>
<p>The work is part of a $6.06 million improvement project.</p>
