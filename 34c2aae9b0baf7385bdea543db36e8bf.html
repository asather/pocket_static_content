<h1>Disciplinary court denies Tranquilli's request to be paid during suspension</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Court of Judicial Discipline on Thursday denied a request by suspended Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Mark Tranquilli that he be paid while on suspension.</p>
<p>The board denied his request in a one-line order. Judge John Foradora dissented, as he has before, on the grounds that Judge Tranquilli has not been charged criminally.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli had argued previously that his suspension without pay should be reversed because he did not have a chance to defend himself against an ethics complaint filed by the Judicial Conduct Board.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli was reassigned to administrative dues in February after multiple allegations of misconduct, including making racist statements about a juror.</p>
<p>Following an investigation into those comments, the conduct board filed a complaint against him with the Court of Judicial Discipline, which suspended him without pay on Aug. 26.</p>
