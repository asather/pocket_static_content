<h1>Gov. Wolf revises list of which businesses qualify as "life-sustaining," delays enforcement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Friday updated a list of which businesses must close their physical operations to stop the spread of COVID-19 and delayed enforcement of the closures.</p>
<p>The governor’s order, which went into effect Thursday evening and now begins enforcement Monday at 8 a.m., says all&nbsp;“non-life-sustaining” businesses should stop their physical operations and work remotely if possible.</p>
<p>Businesses in accounting, payroll administration and tax preparation are now permitted to keep physical locations operating, as are insurance-related businesses, according to a new list from of the governor.</p>
<p>Insurance agencies and brokers are not to conduct in-person sales, however.</p>
<p>All natural resources and mining industries are also&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/03/20/Coal-industry-argued-life-sustaining-Wolf-corsa-Consol-CNX-Energy-Transfer-Shell-cracker/stories/202003200111" target="_blank">now to remain in operation</a>. The original list released on Thursday stated those involved in forestry, logging and mining were to shut down their in-person facilities.</p>
<p>The announcement was met with <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/03/20/coronavirus-COVID-19-Gov-Tom-Wolf-non-life-sustaining-businesses-small-business-NFIB-waivers/stories/202003200130" target="_blank">confusion from workers and business owners</a> as to what qualifies as life-sustaining when many businesses are part of a complex supply chain.</p>
<p>If business who have been told to cease physical operation believe they are life-sustaining, they can fill out a <a href="https://expressforms.pa.gov/apps/pa/DCED/Waiver-process-keeping-physical-locations-open" target="_blank">waiver</a> arguing that they must remain in operation.</p>
<p>The waiver from the&nbsp;Department of Community &amp; Economic Development asks questions about how businesses meet the definition of life-sustaining, if they have a plan to “meet CDC recommended guidelines to maintain employee safety” and how many employees must be on-location to provide critical work.</p>
<p>The new list was updated following&nbsp;“conversations with businesses, stakeholders and individuals,” according to a release from the governor’s office.</p>
<p>Enforcement of the closures was originally supposed to begin on Saturday, but was delayed due to a&nbsp;high volume of waiver requests, a release from the governor’s office said.</p>
