<p><strong>Mike White</strong>: What’s going on? Well, there has been some notable basketball coaching moves lately, the WPIAL has released realignments for basketball, baseball and softball ... and PIAA board of directors meeting is Wednesday. Although I will tell you there will be no major announcements from meeting about startup of sports and the future. Still too early for that, says PIAA director Bob Lombardi. So there is plenty to discuss. Let’s get with it.</p>
<p><strong>George</strong>: At what point here does the WPIAL need to make a decision about when the football season will start? There’s not going to be a vaccine by late August and the virus still be here then so...what a brutal decision that will be. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, first off, it’s the PIAA’s decision. And beyond that, it’s more the Governor’s decision. PIAA board of directors meeting is Wednesday, but there will be no major announcements on start-up of sports. But why does PIAA have to make a decision on fall sports now? It’s way too early. I think we would all be better off if people in charge of things stop making predictions about things three months down the road. YOU JUST DON’T KNOW. PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said much more will be known probably in late June or early July. What’s wrong with waiting to make decisions when more facts are known?</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: It is inconceivable that the PIAA cannot see the disparity between boundary and non-boundary schools in basketball. As evidenced by the recent all-state teams, 36.4% of girls and 62.4% of boys all-state teams were comprised of players from non-boundary schools. Non-boundary schools comprise less than 10% of all schools that participated in basketball. If this disproportionately isn’t evidence enough that non-boundary schools are rostering all-star teams, I’m not sure what is. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Geez Todd, you’ve really hit on a subject that has never been talked about. First off, all-state teams deal with the best players. It doesn’t matter if they’re from a public or Catholic school. And people can complain all they want, it is NOT going to change. PIAA has no interest in separation public and private/Catholic. It’s not going to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Realist</strong>: Any news on baseball? Lots of rumors about moving it to fall sport, or pushing to May start and playing into June. Move to fall might also indicate revenue producing football is questionable for fall...and better financially to move it to spring? What are you hearing and your thoughts? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I will have story on this later today. All I can tell you is that spring football is not something the PIAA even plans to consider.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Mike, if kids are back in school this fall but there are still regulations against large gatherings, even a few thousand or so, seems to me for football, schools could just sell tickets in limited amount to maintain say 50% of capacity plus bands and cheerleaders and still have decent semblance of atmosphere? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, they could do that. I sat in on a video meeting of ADs last week, and they discussed how there are even computer programs out there that will map out a social distancing stadium for you. Seriously. Imagine that.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: Everyone can yell and scream, but I actually like that the WPIAL is letting 5 teams in from sections of 8 in hoops. 5/8 is still 62% of teams and in some sections 4/6 or 4/5 will get in. Especially the Beaver County hoops section is entitled to an extra spot as Central Valley ended up as the odd man out this year. Your thoughts on this? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You’re speaking of WPIAL decision yesterday to let basketball sections with eight teams have five playoff qualifiers. Sections with seven or less will continue to have four. This will only affect three sections last year. The impetus for this change came from 6A girls the past two seasons. 6A girls teams complained - and rightly so. 6A girls had two eight-team sections and only four from each were taken to the playoffs. Meanwhile, 6A boys had three six-team sections and four from each section made the playoffs. It wasn’t equal - and the 6A girls teams had a legit complaint.</p>
<p><strong>Wpial hoops fan</strong>: Mike, your suppose to be a big time high school sports writer and didn’t even mention derose‘s name as a candidate? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Just slap my knuckles with a ruler now. But there were a number of candidates I didn’t mention.</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: Your sarcasm is appreciated. I know people have talked about this forever. That is my point. The blind eye that the PIAA turns to the lack of equity is amazing. How can they have the best intentions in mind for all student athletes when one group is given a different set of rules to play by. You made my point for me. The best players are on the all state teams and the best players are going to private schools. Thus creating all star teams that are able to compete against public entities that have boundaries. I know this is a losing argument in the eyes of the PIAA and the private school enablers, but it needs to be said. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It has been said - nine thousand times. But even if the majority would like to see it, that doesn’t mean it will happen. The thing is, the majority on the PIAA board of directors aren’t calling for separation. So nothing will change.</p>
<p><strong>Realist</strong>: Another baseball related...the 2 game series schedule in section play is great to eliminate stud pitchers running the table in the section. What about playoffs then? While a best of three might not be feasible for every round perhaps a double elimination tournament format would further level playing field and lead to best “team” advancing. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: The WPIAL baseball committee proposed three-game series for the semifinals and championships. WPIAL turned down the proposal. For the past few years, the WPIAL has tried to schedule at least two rounds of playoffs in days close to each other so that the No. 1 pitcher can’t pitch as much. Heck, I remember a number of years where the No. 1 pitcher worked the quarterfinals, semifinals and finals. That was absurd. No baseball tournaments, college or Little League, can that happen. I kind of like the three-game series ideas, but I think you have to think of rainouts at that time of year - and it might not be cost effective. Just think of the championships. Six classes with three-game series. That’s a lot of games. But I’m in agreement with you, I’d like it.</p>
<p><strong>CV Fan</strong>: Chartiers Valley Girls were on pace to tie or break the State win record of 64-0. Now they will need 7 wins, and lost a key player in McConnell, do you think they can still break the record? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, they have four starters back who were sophomores last year. Megan was the one who made things go. Call me crazy, but I think Char Valley still might be pretty good and yes I think they will break record.</p>
<p><strong>NorthSouth</strong>: Do people come up to you at games and introduce themselves by their “Chat” screen name and expect you to remember every question they’ve ever asked on here? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Ahhhhhh, no.</p>
<p><strong>Alive</strong>: Mike, you think it’s possible we have some sports going in the fall, like golf, tennis, soccer but not football, bc of ease of virus transmission in those “contact” sports? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Golf already is in fall. So is girls tennis. This has been talked about, but like I said earlier. PIAA is not even considering football in the spring.</p>
<p><strong>D9 Dave</strong>: Hear the PIAA might entertain an adjustment to the Mercy Rule lowering it from 40 points to 30 points in basketball. Your thoughts on a Mercy Rule in general for high school sports. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have no problem with mercy rule. It’s good. And how about we meet halfway and make it 35?</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: I think the PIAA missed the boat on the decision to schedule 2 game series to avoid the number 1 pitcher pitching against the same team twice. That decision should have been made in softball. How many instances have there been where a team has 1 girl who pitches every game all year. I know that there are no limits on innings a softball pitcher can pitch, but seriously 1 pitcher pitching every game. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You can’t compare softball and baseball. Apples and oranges. Yes, they are similar but pitching makes them totally different sports. Pitching a softball is totally different on arm than baseball. But I’m with you on the pitcher dominance in softball. The game on the high school level is dominated too much by the pitcher. However, I will say this. You don’t see pitcher dominance as much since the pitching rubber was moved back.</p>
<p><strong>Hoops lover</strong>: 2 questions, The WPIAL has moved TJ and Trinity out of the toughest section in Girls Basketball (5A Section 1). Your thoughts on that move? CV, TJ, or Trinity could have all been section champs in that or any section, do you think that will help the teams or hurt them with the lose of that competition? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, geography might have had a little to do with sections alignments. But why would it hurt these teams by playing in a different section?</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Knowing, writing, and considering your history of not being a big Dan DeRose fan do you think he was a good hirer for North Allegheny basketball? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, not quite sure what “not big Dan DeRose fan” means, but Dan did a great job at Penn Hills. Won 100 games in five years. That’s pretty impressive. I would expect him to do very well at North Allegheny.</p>
<p><strong>D9 Dave</strong>: Do you think the PIAA will entertain playing high school sports in the fall with no fans or a limited number of fans in attendance? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They might have to consider it. But again, it’s still too early to make these predictions. You can’t predict things three to four months down the road and what things will look like. I think we’ll be able to know a lot more and be able to plan more come late June and early July.</p>
<p><strong>NA Fan</strong>: Hi Mike, Do you see a world in which Dan DeRose and Devin Carney can coexist? What a duo that should be <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, as far as I know Devin Carney is still a student at Butler High School. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: As for previous question, you hear some rumblings about Shelton Carney possibly being an assistant coach at North Allegheny. But let’s just stick to facts right now. That has not happened.</p>
<p><strong>Alive</strong>: Possible that some counties in West Pa get back to HS open gyms and sports, sooner than Allegheny county?? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: This is a matter that the PIAA will address at tomorrow’s meeting. There are going to be areas in Western Pa. that will be ready and cleared to get back to having high school sports workouts. But there will be areas in eastern Pa. that won’t be cleared. I don’t think the PIAA will take an “all or none” approach. I think schools in areas that have been cleared will be allowed to start workouts, even if other schools can’t.</p>
<p><strong>Rams Fan</strong>: Are there no rumblings about the PR job or do you not want to answer? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don’t know much about it. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey, that’s about it for now. Let’s talk again next Tuesday. Everyone, be good.</p>
