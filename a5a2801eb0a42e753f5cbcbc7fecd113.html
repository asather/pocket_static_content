<p>Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC made it clear in a 5-0 win against Hartford Athletic at Highmark Stadium that it is the top dog in the USL Championship’s Group F in this shortened 2020 season.</p>
<p>Ryan James and Ropapa Mensah each scored two goals, Anthony Velarde converted a penalty kick and Danny Vitiello earned his fourth shutout of the season as the Riverhounds extended their shutout streak to 393 minutes.</p>
<p>With the win, Pittsburgh (9-3-1, 28 points) also clinched a playoff spot for the third consecutive season under the helm of Bob Lilley, pulling nine points clear of Hartford in Group F. Never before in club history has the team made the playoffs in three consecutive seasons.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds next travel to Loudoun United for a matchup at 6:30 p.m. Saturday. It’ll be their last road context of the regular season before closing with two matches at home.</p>
