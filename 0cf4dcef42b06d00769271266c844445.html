<h1>Pittsburgh-area incumbents appear set to win nods for new terms in Pa. Legislature</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Incumbent state legislators appeared to be ahead in a number of local state House and state Senate races, as of late Tuesday evening, according to unofficial results.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Senate District 43</strong></p>
<p>Jay Costa, the state Senate's Democratic leader, appeared to have a substantial lead over challenger and first-time candidate Bill Brittain in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/30/Business-owner-and-political-novice-challenging-state-Senate-Democratic-leader-in-primary/stories/202005260074" target="_blank">Democratic primary for Senate District 43</a>, according to unofficial results Tuesday.</p>
<p>Both men are from Forest Hills.</p>
<p>Mr. Costa, 62, is the Senate's top Democrat and one of the most prominent from Western Pennsylvania in Harrisburg politics.</p>
<p>Mr. Brittain, 38, co-owns Shadyside Nursery.</p>
<p>The district includes part of Pittsburgh’s South Side, East End, a number of eastern suburbs and parts of the Mon Valley. There is no Republican candidate on the November ballot.</p>
<p><strong>Senate District 37</strong></p>
<p>In the Republican contest for the 37th District, small business owner Devlin Robinson had a lead over Sewickley Council President Jeff Neff. That doesn't include any results from Washington County, which were not available Tuesday evening. Mr. Neff <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/01/Sewickley-council-president-Jeff-Neff-photographed-with-militia-retains-office/stories/202005010156" target="_blank">faced calls to resign his post </a>&nbsp;after being photographed with armed militia members at an April protest.</p>
<p>The winner of the race will face incumbent Democrat Pam Iovino in November.</p>
<p><strong>House District 12</strong></p>
<p>Daryl Metcalfe, who has built a reputation as one of the most conservative and combative members of the House, cruised to an easy win in the Republican primary.</p>
<p>Mr. Metcalfe, of Cranberry, defeated another Cranberry resident, Scott Timko. Mr. Metcalfe is seeking his 12th term.</p>
<p>Mr. Timko is an Air Force veteran and a small business owner. He stressed in his campaign that he could represent conservative values without being as polarizing as the incumbent.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Mr. Metcalfe prevailed in the closest general election in more than a decade when he defeated Democrat Dan Smith by more than 16 percentage points. Mr. Smith was unopposed for the Democratic nomination.</p>
<p>The district includes Cranberry, Clinton, Forward, Middlesex and Penn.</p>
<p><strong>House District 19</strong></p>
<p>Jake Wheatley of the Hill District easily won the Democratic primary Tuesday in House District 19.</p>
<p>Mr. Wheatley, 48, is serving his ninth term and more than doubled the vote total of his challenger, Aerion Abney. He also defeated Mr. Abney, a former member of his staff, in 2016 and 2018.</p>
<p>No Republican will be on the ballot in November.</p>
<p>The district includes the Hill District, North Side, South Side, Allentown, Hazelwood, Downtown, Knoxville, Beltzhoover, Manchester, Arlington and parts of Oakland.</p>
<p><strong>House District 20</strong></p>
<p>Incumbent Adam Ravenstahl was trailing in a tight race for the Democratic nomination against newcomer Emily Kinkead, but with mail ballots postmarked Tuesday allowed to be received until June 9 the race was too close to call.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenstahl, 35, of Ross is the brother of former Pittsburgh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl. He took office in a special election in 2010 and is serving his fourth full term.</p>
<p>Ms. Kinkead is a North Side resident and attorney who received her law degree from the University of Pittsburgh. She had received endorsements from progressive Democrats such as Allegheny County Councilwomen Bethany Hallam and Olivia Bennett and Pittsburgh Council members Erika Strassburger and Bobby Wilson.</p>
<p>Mr. Ravenstahl couldn’t be reached for comment but Ms. Kinkead’s campaign released a statement.</p>
<p>"As of right now we do not have enough information on the in-person vote totals and remaining mail-in ballots to discern a winner,” the statement said. “This in combination with Governor Wolf's order extending the time available for return of mail-in ballots gives us a potentially ambiguous scenario for the next couple days."</p>
<p>No Republican filed in the race so no one will be on the ballot to oppose the winner in November.</p>
<p>The district includes Pittsburgh neighborhoods North Side, Strip District, Polish Hill and Lawrenceville as well as suburbs Avalon, Bellevue, West View and part of Ross.</p>
<p><strong>House District 28</strong></p>
<p>It appears Rob Mercuri will lead the Republican charge <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/05/31/Political-upstarts-Mike-Turzai-Republican-primary-28-House-District-North-Hills/stories/202005310017" target="_blank">to replace state Rep. Mike Turzai, the state House speaker who is retiring after nine term</a>s.</p>
<p>Mr. Mercuri, 38, is a vice president and financial risk manager for the PNC Financial Services Group and a West Point graduate who deployed to Iraq after 9/11. Mr. Turzai endorsed him hours after he announced he was retiring.</p>
<p>He had more than twice as many votes as challengers Michael Heckmann, who spent the past two years as a member of Mr. Turzai’s staff, and Libby Blackburn, who is serving her third term as a member of the North Allegheny School Board.</p>
<p>“We really feel good about the results so far,” Mr. Mercuri said. “I look forward to helping to unify the Republican Party as we head into the fall. We have really big shoes to fill with Speaker Turzai leaving.”</p>
<p>Mr. Mercuri said he expects to use his financial skills as the state begins its economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“I look forward to being a part of it,” he said.</p>
<p>The winner faces Democrat Emily Skopov, a nonprofit head who lost to Mr. Turzai two years ago.</p>
<p>The district covers Bradford Woods, Franklin Park, McCandless, Marshall and Pine.</p>
<p><strong>House District 30</strong></p>
<p>State Rep. Lori Mizgorski’s Democratic challenger in November remains up in the air.</p>
<p>Ms. Geiger-Schulman is a former teacher and staff member for a state representative who serves as public policy director for for an educational nonprofit, Trying Together. She lives in Hampton.</p>
<p>Lissa Geiger-Schulman held a slight lead over Marc Attisano late Tuesday but said the race still was too close to call because of mail ballots that may not be counted for a week.</p>
<p>Mr. Attisano is a former prosecutor and defense attorney who lives in O’Hara.</p>
<p>Ms. Mizgorski, of Shaler, is seeking her second term and was unopposed Tuesday.</p>
<p>The district includes Shaler, O’Hara, Hampton, Fox Chapel and Richland.</p>
<p><strong>House District 32</strong></p>
<p>Tony DeLuca appeared to easily win the Democratic nomination for his 20th term in the state House.</p>
<p>Mr. DeLuca, 82, of Penn Hills defeated Erin Vecchio, the Penn Hills School Board president and longtime DeLuca rival who also lost two previous efforts.</p>
<p>Voting in the municipality was extended to 9 p.m. by court order for the precinct at Penn Hills Public Library because dozens of voters were still in line to cast ballots when the poll should have closed at 8 p.m.</p>
<p>No Republican will be on the ballot in November.</p>
<p>The district includes Penn Hills, Verona, Blawnox and parts of Plum and O’Hara.</p>
<p><strong>House District 34</strong></p>
<p>State Rep. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/29/Summer-Lee-Chris-Roland-Democratic-candidates-34th-House-district-pennsylvania-primary/stories/202005290071" target="_blank">Summer Lee appeared set to win over challenger Chris Roland</a>, a North Braddock councilman and Allegheny County Park Department supervisor in the Democratic contest for House District 34.</p>
<p>The race was seen as a contest between the party's progressive and moderate wings. Ms. Lee, of Swissvale, is a first-term legislator who has vocally championed progressive causes and is also the first black woman elected to Harrisburg from the region.</p>
<p><strong>House District 36</strong></p>
<p>Candidate Jessica Benham, of the South Side, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/05/28/pa-state-house-district-36-jessica-benham-heather-kass-mark-johnson-ed-moeller/stories/202005280084?cid=search" target="_blank">leading in the Democratic primary for the 36th House District</a>&nbsp;late Tuesday, followed by Baldwin Councilman Ed Moeller.</p>
<p>The four-way race to replace retiring state Rep. Harry Readshaw — the incumbent for more than two decades — was extremely contentious and was also partly a contest between the party's progressive wing and more conservative old guard.</p>
<p>The district includes a number of south Pittsburgh neighborhoods such as Carrick and Mount Washington, as well as South Hills suburbs like Baldwin Borough and Brentwood.</p>
<p>Candidate Heather Kass won the Allegheny County Democratic Committee endorsement process in February — despite past social media comments bashing Obamacare, praising President Donald Trump and other posts many said didn't stand for the Democratic party's values.</p>
<p>Her endorsement was one of a number of controversial committee endorsements that led to inter-party strife, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-state/2020/02/17/Allegheny-County-Democratic-Committee-endorsed-candidates-Pennsylvania/stories/202002170097" target="_blank">scrutiny of the endorsement process</a> and calls for the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/02/24/Rep-Austin-Davis-resigns-vice-chairman-Allegheny-Democratic-committee/stories/202002240102" target="_blank">Allegheny County Democratic Committee chairwoman, Eileen Kelly, to step down</a>.</p>
<p>Ms. Kass later filed a lawsuit against the committee, alleging that despite winning the endorsement, the party failed to provide her with assistance in her campaign.</p>
<p>Ms. Benham, of the South Side, co-founder of the Pittsburgh Center for Autistic Advocacy, ran as the progressive candidate in the race.</p>
<p>The winner of the primary will face Republican AJ Doyle in the general election.</p>
<p><strong>House District 44</strong></p>
<p>In the Republican primary, incumbent Rep. Valerie Gaydos, of Aleppo, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-local/2020/05/27/Pennsylvania-44th-district-state-House-Valeri-Gaydos-Bob-Doddato/stories/202005220103" target="_blank">a Republican serving her first term in Harrisburg, was leading repeat challenger Bob Doddato, a North Fayette Township supervisor</a>, as of late Tuesday. The winner will face Democrat Michele Knoll in the November general election. The district covers a number of northern and western Allegheny County suburbs.</p>
<p>Both the state House and Senate have Republican majorities, Democrats hope to capture one or both chambers in the November general election.</p>
