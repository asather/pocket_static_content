<h1>Low-income riders not happy Port Authority will return to fare collection June 8</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Public transit is as essential as housing and utilities to low-income people and if there can be no evictions or utility cutoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic then Port Authority shouldn’t reinstitute fares, either.</p>
<p>That was the primary message Friday from more than two dozen speakers who told the authority board during an online meeting the agency shouldn’t reinstitute full fares for low-income riders when it resumes fare collection June 8. The agency had suspended fare collection in March when it began having riders enter the rear door of vehicles for social distancing during the health emergency, but it is supposed to resume front entry on Monday and fare collection one week later.</p>

<p>Many of the advocates urged the authority to either continue free fares or offer reduced fares to riders who have an Electronic Benefit Transfer card given to people who receive state assistance. Following its policy, the board listened but didn’t respond to the comments and Chairman Jeffrey Letwin and CEO Katharine Eagan Kelleman weren’t immediately available after the meeting.</p>
<p>Laura Wiens, director of Pittsburghers for Public Transit, said the speakers were there to&nbsp;“sound an alarm” about the “irreversible” damage reinstituting fares could cause for low-income riders. She also encouraged the authority to do more to prevent buses from passing riders because they are too full due to limiting capacity for social distancing.</p>
<p>Helen Gerhardt, an advocate with Lawrenceville United, said public transit is part of&nbsp;“the basic health and well-being” of the community.</p>
<p>“[Charging bus fares] will make it so much harder to get to work,” she said.&nbsp;“You have a responsibility not to hurt classes of people.”</p>
<p>Many of the speakers suggested the agency use a portion of the $141.75 million it has available from federal stimulus money to continue reduced fares. It’s not clear whether that is an allowable use of the federal money, which was earmarked to replace funds lost due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>Rider Jessica Benner of Friendship said low-income riders are the largest group that has continued to ride during the pandemic because they have essential-but-low-paying jobs. The authority’s ridership has dropped as much as 80% during the health emergency and could drop more if full fares are resumed, she said.</p>
<p>Ann Sanders of Just Harvest, a nonprofit that works to address hunger in Allegheny County, said her agency has dealt with many families that have had no income for the past two months and need transit to get food and medical care. That won’t change soon, she said.</p>
<p>“In the next 10 days, people aren’t going to be able to afford fares,” she said.</p>
<p>Alisha Grishman, who pays half fare as a rider with a disability, said she sympathizes with other low-income riders.</p>
<p>“Nobody has been hit harder than the people living under the poverty line,” she said.&nbsp;“Low-income people need to have access to a reduced fare.”</p>
<p>Rider Barb Warwick said offering a reduced or free fare to low-income riders shouldn’t have to wait for a fare study scheduled to be done by the end of the year.</p>
<p>“You know riders are hurting,” she said.&nbsp;“Just do it. Get it done.”</p>
