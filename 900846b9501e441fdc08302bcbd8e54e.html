<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The board of the Allegheny Intermediate Unit on Monday named a new executive director.</p>
<p>Robert Scherrer, the superintendent of the North Allegheny School District, will take over the regional public education agency on July 20.</p>
<p>Mr. Scherrer also has served as North Allegheny’s acting superintendent and assistant superintendent for K-12 education.</p>
<p>“I am&nbsp;ready to open the next chapter in my career and lead an organization with the reputation, influence and&nbsp;expertise of the Allegheny Intermediate Unit,” Mr. Scherrer said in a statement. “Through this process, I have had the opportunity to interact&nbsp;with the board and members of the executive leadership team and I see their passion around supporting all&nbsp;students in our region. I am excited and prepared to work closely with the entire AIU community as we&nbsp;create a compelling future for the organization.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The AIU is a taxpayer-funded agency that provides specialized services to the county's 42 suburban school districts as well as non-public, charter and vocational-technical schools.</p>
<p>The agency said Mr. Scherrer will begin a&nbsp;“comprehensive entry plan” when he takes office that will allow him to&nbsp;“become immersed in the organization, and position himself as the catalyst to developing a&nbsp;thoughtful, ambitious course of continued growth and improvement at the AIU.”</p>
<p>Before going to North Allegheny, Mr. Scherrer was the principal at Pittsburgh Science and Technology Academy and Taylor Allderdice High School in the Pittsburgh Public Schools.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Scherrer also was an assistant principal and co-principal for curriculum in the Woodland Hills School District and an assistant principal at Peters Township High School. He began his career in education as a secondary educator at Baldwin High School.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Scherrer will take over for&nbsp;Rosanne Javorsky, who had been serving as interim executive director since July 2018. Before that, Linda Hippert was the AIU’s executive director from 2009 to 2018.</p>
<p>Ms. Javorsky will remain as interim director until Mr. Scherrer takes over. She will then return to her previous position as assistant executive director for teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Mr. Scherrer will have an annual salary of $205,000.</p>
<p>“The board is thrilled to have landed Dr. Scherrer, and we are very excited to bring him into the organization,” AIU board president Debbie Beale said in a statement. “With his broad and diverse leadership and&nbsp;educational experiences, a demonstrated passion for students and families, and a thorough understanding of&nbsp;our region, we believe Dr. Scherrer is an excellent fit for the AIU. We also recognize that Allegheny County&nbsp;has a vibrant educational culture that presents Dr. Scherrer with an opportunity to thrive by working closely&nbsp;with other educational leaders, policy experts, and thought leaders throughout the state and the nation.”&nbsp;</p>
