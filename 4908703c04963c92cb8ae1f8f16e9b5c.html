<h1>WPIAL 2A-1A roundup: Fort Cherry surprises No. 4 Rochester</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Home hasn’t been sweet to Fort Cherry in recent years. But the host Rangers (2-3, 2-3) rallied late to stun WPIAL Class A No. 4-ranked Rochester on Friday night, 21-19, thus sending shock waves through the Big Seven Conference standings.</p>
<p>Maddox Truschel’s 10-yard touchdown run with 47 seconds remaining proved to be the winning points for Fort Cherry. Truschel finished with 95 yards rushing and two touchdowns on 17 carries. The junior quarterback also completed 10 of 16 passes for 152 yards.</p>
<p>The Rangers won their first home game since defeating Carlynton August 31, 2018. It snapped a home losing streak of nine games while sending the Rams (4-1, 4-1) to their first defeat of the season. Rochester’s loss means No. 3-ranked Shenango has sole possession of first place in the Big Seven Conference.</p>
