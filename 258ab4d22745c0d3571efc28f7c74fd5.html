<h1>Auditor general race still undecided; Lamb says results 'encouraging'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Controller Michael Lamb closed out election night with overwhelming support from Allegheny County in his Democratic primary bid for Pennsylvania Auditor General, but with mail-in ballot results delayed across the state, a winner is not clear.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb, whom voters elected for a fourth term in November, received nearly 80% of the 139,511 votes cast in his home county Tuesday to become the party’s nominee for the Commonwealth’s top fiscal watchdog.</p>
<p>But results from the Southeastern part of the state, where Mr. Lamb’s biggest threat is based, had yet to report the majority of votes by the end of the night.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday signed an executive order extending the time frame for mail-in and absentee ballots to be received and counted in Allegheny, Dauphin, Delaware, Erie, Montgomery and Philadelphia counties, giving until 5 p.m. on June 9 for tabulation to be completed. Ballots must have been postmarked no later than June 2. A court ordered an <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/live/pa-2020-primary-election-philadelphia-live-updates-results-20200602.html" target="_blank">extension for Bucks County</a> as well on Tuesday, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
<p>Statewide, Mr. Lamb trailed former Philadelphia Deputy Mayor Nina Ahmad in the 8 p.m. hour, but as Allegheny County tallied and reported results — with 99% in three hours after the polls closed —&nbsp;Mr. Lamb pulled ahead by nearly 14 percentage points overall with just over 48% of voting districts across the state.</p>
<p>“To see those kind of numbers come in a race where we were outspent 3-to-1 is encouraging,” Mr. Lamb said on a 10 p.m. Zoom call with campaign staff a news media. “We will continue to watch these numbers come in tonight and through the next couple of days, and we’ll see where we are. Right now I think we’re feeling pretty good, but we got a lot to still look at.”</p>
<p>With only&nbsp;34% of the results reported from Philadelphia County just after 11 p.m., Ms. Ahmad held a 50% lead over Mr. Lamb, according to state election figures.</p>
<p>Ms. Ahmad said she was&nbsp;“feeling pretty good” as well about those figures, but that&nbsp;“it’s sort of a little too early to say too much.”</p>
<p>“We’re waiting for our Philadelphia numbers to come in, there were long lines in some places,” she said.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Ms. Ahmad has run in a statewide election; she lost a 2018 Democratic primary bid for&nbsp;lieutenant governor in a crowded field.</p>
<p>Mr. Lamb said that he was counting on voter turnout in his home county to be in his favor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Allegheny County turned in a very heavy vote today compared to other counties across the state,” he said.&nbsp;“All we know is anecdotal, and it sounds like their turnout was low to moderate, and our turnout was maybe a little better than theirs.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>With 48% of votes counted statewide, Christina Hartman, of Lancaster, pulled in 11.4%; State Rep. Harry Conklin, of Rush, stood at 10.2%; Tracie Fountain, of Harrisburg, at 8.3%; and Rose Davis, of Smithfield, at 8%.</p>
