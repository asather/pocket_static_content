<h1>Ohio to close K-12 schools, ban mass gatherings as 5th coronavirus case confirmed in state</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS — Amid coronavirus concerns, the state of Ohio is banning gatherings of 100 people or more in confined spaces and closing K-12 schools for at least three weeks beginning at the close of school Monday.</p>
<p>Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine announced the new steps to combat the spread of coronavirus Thursday. They come as the country’s major sports leagues suspend their seasons, NCAA conferences cancel end-of-season tournaments, and local government institutions begin restricting access to places like courts system and municipal buildings.</p>
<p>But no mitigation measures are likely to be more disruptive to the lives of average Ohioans than the governor’s intention to close all K-12 schools—public and private. The announcement has left some parents scrambling to make arrangements for babysitters and others wondering where children who rely on schools for meals and other services will turn to for help.</p>
<p>“I find it stressful to try to figure out babysitting and we only have three days to figure it out,” Veronica Gifford, 30, who has an 11-year-old son at Wayne Trail Elementary, told The Blade Thursday while sitting outside her school.</p>
<p>Ms. Gifford is also concerned about what the next announcement will bring and how bad the situation will get.</p>
<p>“It makes me wonder what’s going on,” she said. “What’s going to be next? Stores? Jobs? And for how long?”</p>
<p>Kelly Baker, a stay-at-home mom of six, has been preparing for weeks for this possibility with extra grocery shopping, and she plans to keep the kids at home.</p>
<p>She’s also preparing for the possibility she may have to parent alone for a couple weeks because her husband is a Maumee firefighter. If he’s exposed and quarantined, “I’m on my own.”</p>
<p>Their kids are 11, 10, 9, 8, 7 and 4.</p>
<p>“We were forced to prepare,” she said. “I’m glad I did.”</p>
<p>John Bender, 67, was picking up his 10-year-old granddaughter and said he’s not pleased by the looming school closure. Because he’s retired, he said he’ll likely watch her while the schools are closed, but he doesn’t believe that coronavirus is as dangerous as being reported.</p>
<p>At Toledo Public Schools, northwest Ohio’s largest district and the district with the most students who receive free and reduced-price meals, Deputy Superintendent Jim Gant said officials are discussing methods to ensure students continue to receive meals during three-week shut down recommended by the governor.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said students in the state will have an “extended spring break” starting after classes Monday. The state will then review the situation at the end of the three-week period.</p>
<p>“We know this is disruptive, but we have to do this if we’re going to slow this down,” Governor DeWine said.</p>
<p>“Unless a child has a medical problem, the risk of death is not very high, but children are carriers,” he added.</p>
<p>The closure does not necessarily apply to after-school sporting events which are already subject to the governor's order prohibiting spectators. Schools will have to make those decisions, Mr. DeWine said.</p>
<p>He said attempts will be made to continue providing food to low-income students who rely on schools to provide free or reduced-cost lunches. That may mean having to ask the federal government for approval to provide such meals without having students come to the school to eat them.</p>
<p>The news comes as the state reported it now has five confirmed cases of the coronavirus infection that has killed 38 people in the United States.</p>
<p>Department of Health Director Dr. Amy Acton signed an order banning gatherings of more than 100 people Thursday afternoon. That would include a theater, auditorium, arena, large conference room, stadium, or other enclosed spaces as well as parades, fairs, and festivals.</p>
<p>The order does not include normal airport operations, bus stations, medical facilities. religious gatherings like church, weddings, and funerals, or gatherings for the purpose of exercising free speech.</p>
<p>It also does not include shopping malls, typical office environments, factories, restaurants, and other venues where patrons would typically not be elbow to elbow.</p>
<p>Mr. DeWine said police will not be standing outside businesses and restaurants counting the number of people inside.</p>
<p>“If we see rampant violations, will will certainly have to take steps,” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton said the number of infections can be expected to double every six days, but that efforts to curtail mass gatherings and hopefully prevent school children from carrying the virus home to their grandparents may allow the state's health-care system keep pace with its spread.</p>
<p>“...community spread says that at the very least 1 percent of our population is carrying the virus in Ohio today,” she said. “We have about 11.7 million people, so the math is over 100,000. That just gives you a sense as to how this virus spreads.”</p>
<p>The virus has caused mass cancellations over the past 48 hours, prompting sports leagues like the NBA, MLB, and NHL to suspend contests indefinitely, and art and entertainment venues to cancel concerts.</p>
<p>College athletic conferences such as the Big Ten and the Mid-American Conference canceled post-season basketball tournaments. The Ohio High School Athletic Association followed suit Thursday, postponing athletic tournament events.</p>
<p>The first cases of coronavirus in Ohio — three individuals from Cuyahoga County who had traveled recently — were announced Monday. A fourth case, the first believed to be “community spread,” was announced Wednesday. The fifth case is a 55-year-old male from Trumbull County.</p>
<p>In addition to the five confirmed cases, the state is investigating 52 more cases.</p>
<p>Governor DeWine said the state is also working on banning all outside visitors at nursing homes.</p>
<p>Attorney General Dave Yost said he talked with representatives of 15 major Ohio retailers about shortages and potential price gouging.</p>
<p>“In recent days we've started to see anecdotal reports of long lines to buy toilet paper and hand sanitizer being unavailable out there on store shelves, or boiled water in some places....,” he said. “You don't need to go panic-buy things. Supply chains are OK...We've been assured that they are confident they can keep up with ordinary demand.</p>
<p>“They've also told me they have frozen prices or maintaining existing prices and not allowing the law of supply and demand to artificially raise their profits,” Mr. Yost said.</p>
