<h1>Chartiers Valley girls defeat Hollidaysburg, set new WPIAL record with 57th consecutive win</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Chartiers Valley made history Wednesday night in its PIAA second-round playoff game against Hollidaysburg, but Colts coach Tim McConnell didn’t want to talk about it.</p>
<p>In fact, according to McConnell, he wasn’t even aware of it.</p>
<p>“I haven’t even thought about it. Haven’t even talked about it. It hasn’t been addressed,” McConnell said. “I’m not even sure what record you’re talking about, because all we care about right now is trying to get to Hershey. That’s the record we want.”</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley (27-0) advanced to the PIAA Class 5A quarterfinals with a 55-38 win against the Golden Tigers (18-8) at Greensburg-Salem, and the Colts set a new WPIAL record in the process by winning their 57th consecutive game. North Catholic set the previous record of 56 consecutive wins from 1987-89.</p>
<p>Senior point guard Megan McConnell, who scored 16 points in the win, was just as oblivious as her father when told of her team’s achievement.</p>
<p>“We don’t really talk about that,” Megan said. “I had no idea. We just survive and advance. Our third goal is to make it to Hershey and win a state championship, so that’s all we’re focused on right now.”</p>
<p>Star sophomores Aislin Malcolm and Perri Page combined with McConnell to score 47 of Chartiers Valley’s 55 points in the win. Page scored 12, while Malcolm finished with a team-high 19. Sophomore point guard Marin Miller scored a game-high 22 points to lead the way for Hollidaysburg.</p>
<p>“It feels amazing,” Malcolm said about the consecutive wins record. “I couldn’t be here without my team. We’re always there for each other and we focus on one game at a time, so now we’re just focused on Saturday.”</p>
<p>Early on, it looked like the Golden Tigers might just give the Colts all they could handle, as they started out the game on a 7-0 run and led, 15-11, at the end of the first quarter. But Chartiers Valley ratcheted up the intensity on defense and found its rhythm on offense while opening up the second quarter on an 11-0 run to take a 22-15 lead.</p>
<p>Megan McConnell picked up her third foul of the game with 7:34 remaining in the second quarter, but Tim never even thought about taking her out of the game. She rewarded her father’s trust by making it through the remaining three quarters without getting whistled for another foul.</p>
<p>The teams continued to trade buckets as time wound down in the second quarter. Miller scored all nine of Hollidaysburg’s points in the second quarter, giving her 14 points at the half, but the Colts still took a 30-24 lead into the break.</p>
<p>One of the biggest keys to Chartiers Valley’s success in the game was its offensive rebounding, and that was never more evident than the opening possession of the third quarter, when the Colts pulled down four offensive boards before Hallie Cowan finally converted a putback.</p>
<p>Megan McConnell then hit a pair of 3-pointers to stretch Chartiers Valley’s lead to double digits, and the Colts never looked back from there. They led, 45-30, after three quarters, and took the air out of the ball for much of the final quarter on their way to a historic 55-38 win.</p>
<p>“[Hollidaysburg] did a nice job,” Tim McConnell said. “They came out ready, they were hitting shots, they were excited. But there was no panic. We’re a good team and we know what we have to do.</p>
<p>“We stayed the course, and I’m just excited that we won.”</p>
<p>Chartiers Valley will now face section rival Thomas Jefferson (20-7) for the fourth time this year in the PIAA Class 5A quarterfinals on Saturday.</p>
<p>“We know going into Saturday that we can beat that team, so I think if we just play our game, we’ll be fine,” Megan McConnell said.</p>
