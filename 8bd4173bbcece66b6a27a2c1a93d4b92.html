<h1>Obituary: George Zeh had a deep dedication to family and humor</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When George Zeh thought of a gag to play on his family, he committed to it.</p>
<p>One summer, the Darlington native read every sign on the highway between here and Rehoboth Beach, Del. Seven and a half hours. Every. Sign.</p>
<p>Another time, he locked his niece, Lori Kreshon, in the basement — though only after warning her he’d do it when she went down to get something out of the freezer. He didn’t let her back up despite her pleas. She ended up having to climb out of a basement window to escape his teasing. And this was only about 10 years ago.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeh’s sense of humor may have been tough to appreciate in the moment. Now, though, it cracks up Ms. Kreshon as she fondly remembers her uncle, who died of COVID-19 on April 23 at Brighton Rehabilitation and Wellness Center. He was 84.</p>
<p>“We joked the other day because we said: ‘Oh, my God. He’s going to be reading every sign in heaven,’ ” Ms. Kreshon said with a chuckle from her current home in Lebanon, Tenn.</p>
<p>George was one of Theodore and Isabel Zeh’s five children and was born and raised in Darlington, where he lived most of his life.</p>
<p>As a young man, he made quite a name for himself as a member of Juniata College’s football team, which in 1955 rose to national prominence with an undefeated regular season and appearance in the 1956 Tangerine Bowl, now known as the Citrus Bowl.</p>
<p>Future NFL coach Chuck Knox was an assistant at Juniata at the time, and Mr. Zeh was always proud to have played for him as his career took him to prominent roles in the NFL.</p>
<p>He graduated in 1958 with a degree in business and accounting and returned to Beaver County, where he had his first brush with a scary disease. A bout with spinal meningitis kept him in the hospital for about a year.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he became one of the first to beat it, and after some grueling rehabilitation that required him to re-learn how to walk and talk, he was able to live a mostly normal life.</p>
<p>Mr. Zeh worked a few jobs, including one in banking, before his disease. Afterward, he started a career on the assembly line at the Greif Brothers Company.</p>
<p>A heart attack forced his retirement in 1993, at which point he became a staple of family and community life. Vacations to Rehoboth and the family cottage in Geneva, Pa., were highlights, but he was easy to find at the more mundane events for his 13 nieces and nephews, too.</p>
<p>Around Darlington, he’d ride his bike and was known to stop at the Brighton Hot Dog Shoppe. He also made great use of a hammock in his front yard.</p>
<p>“He just loved to people watch,” said Ms. Kreshon, who lived next door with her mother. “And he would wave to anybody.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/faces-of-covid-19/" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/04/15/faces-of-covid-19-stories-behind-local-lives-lost" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>And that front yard? It was spotless, as Mr. Zeh took a meticulous approach to yard work and deputized younger members of the family to pluck every dandelion that popped up. Camping was also one of his favorite hobbies.</p>
<p>In 2013, he moved to Lakeview Personal Care in Darlington, where he made a dear friend in roommate Rudy Antinossi, before moving to Brighton in November for an elevated level of care, which Ms. Kreshon is adamant that he received.</p>
<p>As of Wednesday, Brighton <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/west/2020/04/29/Brighton-Rehabilitation-and-Wellness-Center-owners-COVID-19-Beaver-nursing-home/stories/202004290150" target="_blank">has seen more than 50 deaths</a> since the COVID-19 outbreak began, and many have been angered particularly by a lack of communication from the facility.</p>
<p>That was not Ms. Kreshon’s experience. She said she was in regular contact with the staff throughout her uncle’s up-and-down final days that included an extended fever and a rally that lasted for about a week before his breathing became shallow.</p>
<p>Workers helped Ms. Kreshon, her daughter and granddaughter, Bailey — who was particularly close with Mr. Zeh — speak with him via FaceTime in his last couple of days. She said he died with two aides holding his hand and praying with him.</p>
<p>“That kind of compassion and care from them … ” Ms. Kreshon said through tears. “They didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p>“I just said, ‘You guys don’t even know how much that means to us, because we can’t be there. And the stuff you face every day going back into that nursing home, knowing what you’re walking into, and you still go there because of how much you care about your residents? That says the world to me.’ ”</p>
<p>The family hopes to have a service for Mr. Zeh’s interment at Sylvania Hills Memorial Park in the next month if possible.</p>
<p>One of Ms. Kreshon’s nieces is also gathering photos to set to music to preserve the memory of a man who left an enduring impression, not just with his memorable attempts to make those closest to him laugh, but his ability to be there for everyone in his large family.</p>
<p>“If anybody needed anything, he would help them with it,” Ms. Kreshon said.</p>
