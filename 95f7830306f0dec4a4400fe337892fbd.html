<h1>Pittsburgh plans weekend pothole blitz</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you have a favorite Pittsburgh pothole, the city wants to hear from you.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh public works crews will take advantage of pretty good weather this weekend and conduct a pothole patching blitz. In a news release, the city said crews will work from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. Saturday and Sunday to fill potholes throughout the city and could add Monday if more work needs to be done and the weather cooperates.</p>
<p>Tim McNulty, spokesman for mayor Bill Peduto, said the city is reaching out to employees to see how many want to work overtime over the weekend.</p>
<p>“We don't have an exceptionally large number of pothole complaints filed so far this year, but the hope is to use the good weather to get ahead of the usual start to pothole season,” Mr. McNulty said.</p>
<p>Mr. McNulty noted the crews will be using cold patch to repair the potholes, which often is a temporary repair. That’s all that is available because asphalt suppliers haven’t started making hot material yet.</p>
<p>The National Weather Service forecast calls for sunny skies Saturday and Sunday and highs of 44 and 58, respectively.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The city recommends residents report potholes by calling the city’s 311 center or filling out an online <a title="311 service request form" href="https://pittsburghpa.gov/311/form" target="_blank">form requesting service</a>.</p>
