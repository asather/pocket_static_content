<h1>Route 51 in Moon to remain closed as hillside continues to shift</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Route 51 in Moon will remain closed indefinitely while a contractor removes unstable rock from the face of a hillside that partially collapsed last week, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation said Tuesday.</p>
<p>The road, known locally as McGovern Boulevard, has been closed in both directions since late Jan. 1 after rocks let loose and fell onto the highway. The closure is between Purdy and Stoops Ferry roads, where about 14,000 vehicles travel daily.</p>
<p>“PennDOT’s geotechnical engineers determined that the slide on Route 51 in Moon Township continued to move over the weekend,” PennDOT spokeswoman Yasmeen Manyisha said in a statement. “In the interest of public safety, our team determined some of the rock must be removed from the hillside. As the rock sits on private property, the Department is currently in the process of obtaining authorization from the property owner to take action.</p>
<p>“There is no estimate on how long the road would be closed. However, we do not foresee the road reopening this week.”</p>
<p>Ms. Manyisha said engineers don’t have an estimate of how many tons of rock will have to be removed to stabilize the hillside. PennDOT will have a private contractor that is on retainer to the department remove the rocks.</p>
<p>PennDOT’s recommended detour advises drivers to use Flaugherty Run Road to avoid the closure. From Flaugherty Run, motorists can take a right onto Brodhead Road and another right onto Laurel Road back to Route 51.</p>
