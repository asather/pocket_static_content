<h1>With a new contract in hand, Cam Heyward believes he has 'another gear to hit.' </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cam Heyward had all but prepared himself that this season would be his final one in his hometown. Talks between the Steelers and his agent, Michael Perrett, broke off last week. At that point, the idea that he would get a new contract before the regular season begins seemed about as likely as 2020 being ranked among the best years of the century.</p>
<p>“Man, to be honest with you, 48 hours ago, I was thinking something different,” Heyward said Monday afternoon after practice. “It’s a testament to a lot of people that this got done. There was a lot of doubt for a good bit. I’m glad to say it got done.”</p>
<p>Heyward reported to the Steelers’ South Side facility on Sunday morning with the contract still very much in doubt. At 8 a.m., he met with team president Art Rooney II, and that meeting jump-started negotiations that would eventually lead to Heyward agreeing to a new deal that can be worth up to as much as $75.1 million if he plays until 2024.</p>
<p>“We were going back and forth for a good bit,” Heyward said. “When it got done, we were like, ‘Wow, we’re spent.’ This took a lot of work to get done. There was a time when I thought it was dead. I was getting ready for my farewell tour.</p>
<p>“I’m a very emotional person. Quietly, I was trying to distance myself a bit. I had to prepare myself for the day I wasn’t going to be a Pittsburgh Steeler. I had to prepare myself that this was my last ride.”</p>
<p>Talks between the Steelers and Perrett began three weeks ago, right about the time Heyward said via a Zoom call with reporters that “it takes two to tango” when he was asked about the progress of negotiations.</p>
<p>“We started three weeks ago, and then talks broke off,” Heyward said. “I didn’t think we’d get there. On Sunday morning, me and Mr. Rooney got to talking. I understand it’s a family business. I wanted to be a Pittsburgh Steeler, and I’m glad he made that happen for me.”</p>
<p>Heyward talked at length about having to earn all of the money that is included in the contract. He was a rookie in 2011 when Aaron Smith played out the final year of his career. He also learned behind Brett Keisel, another veteran on the defensive line, who blocked Heyward from reaching the starting lineup.</p>
<p>Heyward believes he has less mileage than most 31-year old defensive linemen because he barely saw the field during his first two seasons. He played a little more than 500 snaps combined in 2011 and 2012.</p>
<p>“Brett has been telling me I haven’t hit my prime yet,” Heyward said. “When I was talking to Art yesterday, I told him I feel like I have another gear to hit. I played behind those guys for so long, I still feel like I’m in my late 20s.”</p>
<p><strong>Depth chart released</strong></p>
<p>Mike Tomlin unveiled his depth chart for the first week of the season, and the starting right tackle job remains undecided.</p>
<p>Tomlin lists Zach Banner or Chukwuma Okorafor as his starter. He did the same thing at tight end with veterans Vance McDonald and Eric Ebron and at kickoff returner with rookie Anthony McFarland and Ray-Ray McCloud.</p>
<p>Tomlin has to provide a depth chart under NFL rules, but don’t read too much into it. At inside linebacker, the top backups behind Devin Bush are Marcus Allen or Ulysees Gilbert. Sean Davis, who signed with the Steelers on Sunday, is the top backup at free and strong safety.</p>
<p><strong>Pierre pumped</strong></p>
<p>James Pierre, a cornerback from Florida Atlantic, is the only undrafted free agent to make the 53-man roster. He credited veteran corners Joe Haden and Steven Nelson for helping make such great progress in a truncated training camp.</p>
<p>“They taught me the playbook,” Pierre said. “They taught me a lot. I talked a lot with Steve. I leaned on both of them a lot.”</p>
<p>Pierre, who stands 6-feet-2 and weighs 185 pounds, has played only outside corner with the Steelers, but he said he played in the slot in college and is capable of performing those duties as well.</p>
<p>“Whatever coach wants me to do, I’ll do,” he said.</p>
<p><strong>Third center in the mix</strong></p>
<p>J.C. Hassenauer was promoted to the 53-man roster late last season when Maurkice Pouncey served his two-game suspension for fighting. Still, it seemed like a long shot that he would make this year’s 53-man roster after the Steelers signed Stefen Wisniewski to become the top backup at guard and center.</p>
<p>But with starting right guard Dave DeCastro nursing a lower-body injury a week out from the season opener against the Giants, the Steelers decided to keep an extra interior backup for now.</p>
<p>Hassenauer said on Monday that DeCastro remains with the team on the practice field and in meetings.</p>
<p>The Steelers don’t have to release an injury report until Thursday this week, but Tomlin said late last week that he expected DeCastro to practice at some point this week.</p>
