<h1>Technology has been pivotal for Pirates during COVID-19 outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pirates director of sports medicine Todd Tomczyk typically traverses PNC Park and keep tabs on players himself. Maybe that means watching a rehabbing outfielder go through baserunning drills. Or a pitcher throw a side session. In the hours before games, home or away, Tomczyk never lacks for things to do.</p>
<p>These days, thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, Tomczyk’s life is quite different.</p>
<p>Tomczyk walks less. He’s become way too familiar with FaceTime, Zoom and Skype, though he does appreciate how they help personalize interactions with players. Even Instagram has offered updates, as Tomczyk explained Wednesday that he caught something Gregory Polanco posted recently where the right fielder was pulling bricks and throwing rocks.</p>
<p>“Our belief is that the shoulder is strong,” Tomczyk deadpanned.</p>
<p>The Pirates are hopeful their handling of the COVID-19 outbreak, at least from a baseball perspective, is similarly solid.</p>
<p>Not only with the guys who have been rehabbing injuries, but with the entire team, Tomczyk and his staff are using this time to keep tabs on guys — ensuring they’re staying safe, receiving the right biomechanical support and maybe even getting a little better.</p>
<p>“It’s been fun,” Tomczyk said. “It’s been fun, and it’s been frustrating at times.”</p>
<p>There have been three phases to the Pirates’ in-season/offseason program.</p>
<p>The first involved daily check-ins with players on potential symptoms, especially if there was a chance they were around anyone who tested positive for COVID-19. Next came surveying each player’s living situation to learn what they had available and tailoring training toward that.</p>
<p>Step No. 3 has been watching those workouts and staying up to date, so when baseball does resume, neither side is starting from scratch.</p>
<p>“What we’ve learned is that the one-on-one — FaceTime, Zoom, Skype, whatever means we have — interactions are way more powerful and impactful than a phone call,” Tomczyk said. “They’re way more powerful and impactful than a text message. Just that personal interaction is going a long way. I know the players are appreciating that. I know our staff appreciates the connectivity that we are having with our players during this time.”</p>
<p><strong>Individual updates</strong></p>
<p>Tomczyk also updated the status of several players, three of whom have been working out at Pirate City in Bradenton, Fla.:</p>
<p>• Steven Brault is in the “advanced stages” of his rehab from a left shoulder strain and doing “some throwing-like activities,” Tomczyk said, primarily via plyometrics and a medicine ball.</p>
<p>The Pirates shut Brault down for at least two weeks back on March 2 after he felt some discomfort during a Feb. 28 outing against the Orioles. Brault has not thrown since, and Tomczyk outlined the reasons why it’s taken this long.</p>
<p>“It’s twofold,” Tomczyk said. “One, in this pandemic, we’re unfortunately afforded some time. Two, the team — the group as a whole, from pitching coaches to our informatics group, to our medical staff to our strength and conditioning staff — wanted to address certain things that — and Steven did, as well — we could refine in his lower half and certain areas that we could potentially tweak in the upper half to ideally avoid this happening again.</p>
<p>“This time afforded all of those specific areas to address those deficiencies, to make sure and give him the best opportunity to come back stronger.”</p>
<p>Translation: The Pirates wanted to use this time for Brault to build up strength in other areas.</p>
<p>• Clay Holmes is about seven weeks removed from a left foot fracture, and he is throwing again. Subsequent testing has shown the bone is healed, Tomczyk said, while Holmes’ ground-based training has been ramped up. He’ll throw off a mound next week.</p>
<p>“Very encouraging sign with Clay, as he’s building back his arm and preparing his arm for whatever season lies ahead,” Tomczyk said.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Tomczyk said that Brault and Holmes are “a little ways away from being deemed healthy." And, as long as they’re getting one-on-one treatment at Pirate City, the plan is for them to stay there.</p>
<p>• Jameson Taillon, the third Pirates pitcher working out in Bradenton, recently completed one of two prescribed active-rest periods in his return from a second Tommy John surgery. The break from throwing lasted approximately one week, Tomczyk said, and Taillon resumed throwing this week.</p>
<p>“He continues to refine his mechanics and build arm strength,” Tomczyk said. “So far, so good.”</p>
<p>• Polanco was healthy throughout spring training, even though manager Derek Shelton eased him back into a regular workload. Nevertheless, it has to be an encouraging sign that Polanco’s shoulder feels good considering Tomczyk said this past December that it would likely require some sort of management and care for the rest of his career.</p>
<p>“We are watching video of him throwing, both short and distances that stretch it out that an outfielder needs to do,” Tomczyk said. “Very encouraged with how Gregory is taking advantage of his time.”</p>
