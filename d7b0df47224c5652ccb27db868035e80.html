<h1>Dick’s Sporting Goods to furlough workers starting April 12</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods is planning to furlough an unspecified number of employees starting April 12 due to the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“As we all know, our economy has ground to a halt. There are no high school or community baseball or softball games, no lacrosse games, no track and field events. Schools, health clubs and businesses throughout the country are closed, including our 800+ stores,” the Findlay-based retailer said in a statement posted on its website.</p>

<p>“As the impact of this virus continues to grow, it is increasingly evident that our stores are not going to re-open to public access anytime soon,” the company said Tuesday afternoon. “We will continue to serve our communities via our digital channels and through Curbside Contactless Pickup at our Dick’s Sporting Goods and Golf Galaxy stores, where permitted.”</p>
<p>The sporting goods chain said it will provide pay through April 11 and benefits throughout the furlough.</p>
<p>Dick’s Sporting Goods had already enacted a temporary, graduated payroll cut for employees who are eligible for bonuses. That decision included Ed Stack, chairman and CEO, and Lauren Hobart, president, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/03/25/Dick-s-Sporting-Goods-executives-to-take-pay-cut-during-covid-19-pandemic/stories/202003250079" target="_blank">who will receive no salary</a>, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. They will continue to receive benefits.</p>
<p>“For now, until our stores are fully re-opened, small teams within our stores, distribution centers and corporate office will continue to work, following social distancing practices,” the company stated. “Many of these teammates, including our executives, will work at reduced wages to help us through this crisis.”</p>
<p>As of Feb. 1, the company operated 726 Dick’s Sporting Goods and 94 Golf Galaxy stores and it&nbsp;employed about 15,300 full-time and 26,300 part-time employees.</p>
