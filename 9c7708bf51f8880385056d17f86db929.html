<p>On the eve of an expected vote, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto is urging the city’s Urban Redevelopment Authority board to approve plans for the new First National Bank headquarters at the former Civic Arena site.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto’s statement comes a week after the URA board delayed a vote, saying it needed more time to review the terms.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Penguins responded last week by announcing that they were halting all development activities at the 28-acre lower Hill District site.</p>
<p>“I urge the URA board to approve this critical next step, and move this long-promised development forward,” Mr. Peduto said in a statement released Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The plans set for a vote tomorrow not only include a new headquarters for First National Bank but represent an extraordinary $200 million investment in the heart of Pittsburgh that will help brace our local economy in a time of great need.”</p>
<p>In the statement, Mr. Peduto noted that FNB, as part of a community benefits deal, also has agreed to advance $8 million in funding to be used for development in other parts of the Hill and another $3 million for Hill-related housing.</p>
<p>The money would be repaid through Local Economic Revitalization Tax Assistance program tax abatements and parking tax diversions related to the construction of an 850-space parking garage on another part of the site.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto said some of that upfront cash could be used to support a half dozen development projects being proposed in the middle Hill District as a means of helping revitalize the Centre Avenue corridor,</p>
<p>The vote also could lead to the next step in the creation of a First Source hiring center that could provide jobs to Hill residents, he said, as well as minority hiring commitments.</p>
<p>“This entire site will be providing good paying union construction jobs. The proposed agreement also includes a commitment to long-term career-building jobs on the site to provide Hill District residents with family sustaining wages to rebuild the middle class,” the statement read.</p>
<p>The Penguins declined comment Wednesday on the mayor’s statement.</p>
<p>Sam Williamson, URA board chairman, had no immediate comment, saying he had yet to see the statement. He noted that the board would be discussing the issue Thursday and “we’ll make a decision.”</p>
<p>The 26-story office tower would be built on the lower west end of the arena site closest to Downtown. It would be anchored by FNB, which plans to move its headquarters there from the North Shore.</p>
<p>The project is seen as a catalyst for the entire arena development, one that is proposed to include 1,420 units of housing, 810,000 square feet of office space, 190,000 square feet of retail, a live music venue, a food hall and a hotel.</p>
