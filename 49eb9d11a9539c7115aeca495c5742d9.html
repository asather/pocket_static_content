<h1>Allegheny County sheriff's deputies sent home after possible exposure to COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Fifteen Allegheny County sheriff’s deputies were sent home with pay after possible exposure to the coronavirus through another deputy on Wednesday, chief deputy Kevin Kraus confirmed Thursday.</p>
<p>A deputy with the county sheriff’s department reportedly came to work Wednesday after having taken off sick the day before. While there, he told a supervisor he felt symptoms of COVID-19, Mr. Kraus said. The deputy was concerned he might have contracted it through his son’s girlfriend. She had been around his son after recently returning from a trip to Spain, Mr. Kraus said.</p>

<p>“Over the weekend, the deputy was out of town and the girl came to visit his son at his home in the Pittsburgh area,” Mr. Kraus said. “When he got back, he learned that she was there, and that she had not been tested. He had concerns and notified a doctor, who initially told him not to come in.”</p>
<p>It was not immediately clear if the girlfriend experienced any symptoms, and the deputy was never in her presence, officials said. “No one has been exposed to anyone who has tested positive,” according to Allegheny County Sheriff William Mullen.</p>
<p>The unidentified deputy interacted with 15 other deputies in the sheriff’s office Downtown for nearly 12 minutes Wednesday, Mr. Kraus said. Of the 15 deputies, none have shown any symptoms of COVID-19 or reported having any. They also have not been tested. Their absence has not negatively affected police operations, Mr. Kraus said.</p>
<p>The department later learned that sending the 15 deputies home may not have been completely necessary, according to Mr. Mullen.</p>
<p>The sole deputy has been tested and is currently waiting for results from a North Side medical facility. The county sheriff’s department would not confirm which facility the deputy was tested at, but said doctors have ordered him to quarantine for 14 days.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Test results are expected back within 3 to 4 days, Mr. Kraus said.</p>
<p>“We sent the other deputies home strictly out of an abundance of caution,” Mr. Kraus said, steering away from saying the deputies were self isolating. The department expects to have them back&nbsp;“as soon as possible,” he said, pending protocol by the department and tests results for the lone deputy.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health on Thursday confirmed about 52 new positive cases of COVID-19 in the state, bringing the total to nearly 200. The number of confirmed cases in Allegheny County was 18 as of Thursday, according to the Allegheny County Health Department.&nbsp;</p>
