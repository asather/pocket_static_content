<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Section play in hoops ends this weekend. Pairings announced next Tuesday. Second football signing date is tomorrow. Much we can talk about. Let's start.</p>
<p><strong>Perrytowne crew</strong>: Mike....I saw the schedule for North Hills next year in football. Do you think the former AD gave them a tough and rigorous schedule based upon not wanting to look like she is playing favorites? I mean that is a real gaunlet of opposition outside the already formidable talent in that section. The Indians might only be guaranteed/a lock 3 to 4 wins next year. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Really? Please. They matched up teams in non conference game based on competitiveness. Many teams have tough non conference games. Nothing to do with playing favorites.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: What's the deal with the crazy Section 2 in 4A? Blackhawk could win the section with a record around .500. If they win the section outright, they have to be a top 4 seed right? What do you do with the other teams in that section as I still feel that the final four could be (a longer shot than past years) all from Section 2? I feel like there are 7 teams overall who could legitimately win 4A! <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: The Blackhawk thing is crazy, isn't it? I don't ever remember seeing a team go winless in non-section games and then win a section title. Yes, Blackhawk will get a top 4 seed if they win section. Final 4 all from that section? I guess it could happen, but Highlands, Knoch and Uniontown all are pretty good. I don't think a total final four of teams from the Blackhawk section. I'll say two.</p>
<p><strong>WPGBB</strong>: Hi Mike, how do you think 6A Girls basketball seeding shakes out 1-8? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I think top 4 pretty easy. Either NA or Bethel No. 1 and the other No. 2. Mt. Lebanon 3-4. From there, a lot of even teams.</p>
<p><strong>Ace O’Malley-Scheuneman</strong>: Mr. White, Would the heirarchy of the WPIAL ever consider going back to two referees for basketball? The quality is really lacking almost to a point where it is embarrassing. In some cases it’s hard enough to find two qualified individuals, three just doesn’t ever happen. Thank you. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: So, you think officiating quality is lacking and needs to be better -- and you're suggesting taking one official away from the game and go with two? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. You want better officiating so let's take another set of eyes away.</p>
<p><strong>Whike Mite </strong>: Mike, What is the process for nomination, voting and induction into the WPIAL Hall of Fame? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: The committee asks schools to nominate people from their own school. Committee members can also suggest a person. I used to be on the committee but no longer am.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Mike, unlike football, interesting that classification status means little in basketball? Last weekend, NC thumps pretty good CC team, Vincentian knocked off LP(that one really surprised me) and Cornell lost by a couple to QV. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, basketball totally different than football. Size isn't as much of a factor in basketball classes as it is in football. And remember, two good players can make a world of difference in basketball, where it takes many more in football.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Previous question about classifications was mine. One more, McKeesport dropping to 4A in football should give TJ a legit challenger to their dominance don’t you think? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, McKeesport will be a factor in Class 4A.</p>
<p><strong>Basketball Fan</strong>: Mike, if you had to put money on the 6A playoffs right now, who you going with? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not ready to pick a winner yet. See how this week plays out. I think there are five teams right now that could win it.</p>
<p><strong>B-Baller</strong>: North Allegheny vs North Hills with the playoffs on the line! What will decide this game? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Whatever team scores more points. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Ahhh seriously, probably who shoots the ball better. Sounds simple, but true.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: South Allegheny Boys BB...How good are they really? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Haven't seen them yet, so it's hard to say. I know people who have. Are they as good as Lincoln Park or North Catholic. I don't know if I'd go that far, but apparently they're pretty good. What makes a difference for South Allegheny apparently is 6-5 Omar Faulkner. SA has other good players but this kid averages 15, 10 boards and 4 blocks. Not many 3A teams have an inside player like that who can affect a game with his shot blocking. Nice to see a team that hasn't had much success having a really good year.</p>
<p><strong>B-Baller</strong>: What is your opinion on the influence of coaching vs quality of players to the success of a basketball team? The best teams typically have really good players and the worst teams do not. I have seen coaches who are considered to be excellent lose a lot when they don't have the players. Is coaching overrated? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No, coaching is not overrated. Especially in high school. But you are exactly correct. I think there are definitely good coaches out there who don't do much because they just don't have the talent. Over the years, it's amazing how much better of a coach you are with good players. The good ones take average to not-so-good players and make their teams at least competitive.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Fiedler</strong>: Moon Girls basketball coach firing: <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What about it?</p>
<p><strong>SewHoopster</strong>: Based on the current playoff standings (12 teams already made it) for Boys Class 4A, who is your final 4? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Not ready to say yet. See how this week plays out.</p>
<p><strong>Howard Stern</strong>: You have started to hear about many younger coaches in the NFL taking the game in a new direction (also the old buy Andy Reid finally got one). Are there any "young" (maybe under 40 years old) football or basketball coaches in the WPIAL that you have noticed that could be poised for a long career of success? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I'd have to think about that one.</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Fiedler</strong>: I would hope the residents, parents and coaches of moon township sports would attend the next Moon school board meeting and ascertain whether present and future coaches' job security of Moon District sports will not be affected by the whims and opinions of school board members and/or parents. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't know. I reported the story last week. Maybe we don't know the whole story but the coach gave her side. I do know that before this ever happened, she had told a few that there were a few people out to get her. Parents I mean. Like most schools, Moon says can't comment because it's a "personnel matter." Funny, though. I've dealt with some schools over the years that will at least give some kind of comment, even if it's generic. So we don't know full story and probably never will. I just agree with the coach. If they wanted to give her a penalty, give her a one or two game suspension. But to fire her? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: But the Moon situation should come as no surprise. Tick off the wrong people and you've got trouble. Remember, it takes only five people to not like you. That's how many votes a school board needs.</p>
<p><strong>4A2 fan</strong>: Talent in 4A2 boys is spread around. Couple of us from different schools came up with players who could legitimately be on all-section teams. If only 10 are selected, five will not be chosen unless there are ties. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Explain yourself. What is 4A2?</p>
<p><strong>yinzaaaaaa</strong>: Mike, predictions 4-8 6A GBB, as mentioned 1-4 pretty easy, what about the rest? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: You're pretty persistent. I'll go USC, Seneca, Baldwin, Fox Chapel</p>
<p><strong>Show Time</strong>: Mike - who has turned in the top coaching performances for boys and girls in 2019-20? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: There are many, many, many. Tony DiCenzo at South Allegheny. Gotta look at him. Skrinjar has Fox Chapel undefeated. But there are numerous others.</p>
<p><strong>Corner of 5th and Neville</strong>: I have some very influential alumni friends who are less then impressed with the way things are unfolding this season - I mean losing to North Catholic? They shouldve given Mcconnell what he wanted maybe he comes over next year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Complain, complain, complain. Chuck Crummie won like 2,000 games, but he wasn't good enough. Gotta get rid of him. New coach Brian Urso has Central at 12-9, 5-4 in section. They have won five of eight. They could finish second in section if they beat Pine-Richland tonight. Central has defeated Mt. Lebanon (No. 3 in 6A), Penn Hills (No. 1 in 5A) and Pine-Richland (No. 5 in 6A). They've played few other top teams tough. But apparently that's not enough. You know, Central was 5-17 last year? Now they're 12-9. And OK, I'll be honest. Did you ever think that maybe there isn't exactly a ton of talent on that team? Some decent players. Sarson does some good things. But Central isn't going to beat the top teams on talent alone. And did you ever think that maybe North Catholic might be better than Central? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: And one last thing. Tim McConnell isn't going to Central. Why would Brian Urso leave a college job for a high school job and leave after a year?</p>
<p><strong>Buddy Fiedler</strong>: Will the Moon Township parents/residents attend the next school board meeting and get a real answer to Coach pwell's firing?? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't know. I don't have the Moon parents "to do list" handy.</p>
<p><strong>Hoop Junkie</strong>: What do you think of Boys Baskeyball section that contans Mt Lebo. Every year it seems that Peters Twp underperforms...why do you think this happens consistently? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I don't know if they underperform. They were 16-8 last year. Won a playoff game. Almost beat Pine-Richland in quarterfinals. When you have Mt. Lebanon and Upper St. Clair in your section, it's not easy.</p>
<p><strong>North side Jim</strong>: Who's the biggest competition for OLSH boys to get to state finals this year? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Well, it would be shocking if OLSH didn't win WPIAL. But hey, they only beat Laurel, 66-63, recently. So they will get challenged. As far as rest of state. Well Bishop Guilfoyle beat them in semis last year and Guilfoyle is 16-1 this year. Couldersport from District 9 also seems decent but you wonder sometimes about Dist. 9 teams. Eastern part of state still has Math Civics &amp; Sciences and others.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: What's your take on the Moon firing ? Is it another McCurry/Render thing or is it legit ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: We discussed it some above. Moon administrators apparently had their reasons, even if you don't feel they're legit. Apparently, they had backing of school board also. Remember, administrators sometimes don't go against school board member wishes? Why? Because they're worried about keeping their job. Not saying that happened here. But it has in other cases.</p>
<p><strong>4A2 fan</strong>: Social media, we talk to each other. We came up with 15 names of players who would be legitimate all-psection players. Usually only two teams are selected. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: What classification are you talking about? Boys or girls?</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: If you were the Moon coach would you pursue legal action ? I would <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No. If they don't want me, so be it. Although it does damage your reputation.</p>
<p><strong>4A2 fan</strong>: WPIAL 4ASection 2 <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, a number of good players. But it isn't the first time a number of good players are in a section. At Post-Gazette we pick five player all section team. What we've always done. Coaches vote. So be it.</p>
<p><strong>Georgie</strong>: Hi Mike, I have a couple boys playing multiple sports in high school. I saw that Rachael Martindale from NA was the PG Softball Player of the Year and has gone on to play basketball at Akron. Are you aware of any boys that were the POY in one sport and played a different sport in college. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Rachel Martindale tore her ACL at Akron and is done for the season. Sad to hear that. As far as players of the year playing another sport? Terrelle Pryor comes to mind right away. He was our player of the year in hoops in 2008.</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong>: Your reaction to NA Football not scheduling any WPIAL non-conf games? Pine-Richland said they want to play them but NA is ducking them. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Don't like it. I know it helped WPIAL in scheduling because it made for even number of teams. Just my opinion, but they should've been given at least one non conference game like everyone else. Early January when WPIAL had meeting with coaches/ADs, they put up a sample schedule. Tentative. It had NA playing Pine-Richland. WPIAL said that schedule was not final but it's what they had at the time. Obviously, it changed. NA AD Bob Bozzuto says he doesn't want to play 5A schools. Doesn't do any good for a team like NA.</p>
<p><strong>Mr.rox</strong>: How good is sto rox?they started out slow but now won 10 in a rox? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: They're pretty good. Could make some playoff noise but I don't see how OLSH doesn't win Class 2A.</p>
<p><strong>Bingo</strong>: How would you compare WPIAL basketball now to how it was 10 years ago? Is competition/talent trending up or down? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: About the same. We haven't had many Division I players for decades. This isn't just now. But we had two top 100 players in country here recently in Puff Johnson and Ethan Morton. Certainly it isn't tremendous but I don't think it's really any different than 10 years ago. Now it's definitely different than 30 years ago and before.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Who are your dark horses in boys and girls 6A's and should I go ahead and buy a ticket to see Char Val at the Pete ? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Char Valley boys and girls are in 5A, so if you buy a ticket to see 6A finals, you will not be seeing Chartiers Valley.</p>
<p><strong>Will McBride </strong>: Bethel Park has one of the best gyms in WPIAL, any reason why they don't host basketball playoff games <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I really don't know the answer to that. That has been asked before. I'm not sure. But I agree with you. Great gym. Remember, schools have to want to host games. WPIAL can't make them.</p>
<p><strong>6A</strong>: Mike, who gets in? Norwin? Connellsville? Latrobe? All of them? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Depends on what happens tonight and also Friday. Bottom line is Norwin is in tonight if they beat Penn-Trafford. Norwin can still make it with a loss. Latrobe plays at Hempfield Friday. That still might mean something.</p>
<p><strong>Central defender</strong>: 5th and Neville sounds like a Crummie fan and a Crummie spokesperson. The Crummies and crew were well past their sell by date. They Left the cupboard bare and this staff still have a better record than last year. It was a dumpster fire and now better....Mike, if Central beats Pine tonight, where would you think they would seed for playoffs? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: There wasn't a whole lot in the cupboard last year at Central, either. To me, I think they've done well this year.</p>
<p><strong>Zman</strong>: Do you think Jeffress kid is good enough to make immediate impact at the ACC level? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: I have never seen a full game of his in person. Only highlights. And from reports of people who have seen him play. He's very good. Depends on what you believe is "immediate impact?" Does that mean averaging 13-14 a game as a freshman? I don't see that. But he can play.</p>
<p><strong>6A</strong>: When does the WPIAL lay out the Section alignments for next season? (basketball) <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: It will be a while. Probably not until after state playoffs. This year is unlike other years because of the new PIAA competition formula, where teams have to move up in class if they go far two years in a row and have a transfer. There are a few WPIAL teams that could affect. But you won't know until after state playoffs. That's why they delay.</p>
<p><strong>Moon man</strong>: Let's not forget Moon had Jeff Ackerman. All he did was win three WPIAL titles and a PIAA title. After a couple of down years, he was let go. I was told parents complained he was too tough. There have been other Moon coaches in less visible sports who had success and were let go when the administration changed. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yes, Ackermann won three WPIAL titles. Had a few down years and then was let go. Not the same AD or administration now.</p>
<p><strong>6A</strong>: Mike, have you ever been to Fayette County? My guess is no. We got a great wing place in Bud Murphy's and a pretty decent hoop team in Uniontown... We're located on the other side of Westmorland County... <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: No, where is Westmoreland County anyway? And Uniontown is in Fayette County.</p>
<p><strong>Parent of bball player</strong>: The firing of Coach Powell was unjust and you got the story correct. It was a few parents of kids who did not play as much and had a few board members in their pocket. Now that the job will be open in the spring who do you think might apply? Why would anyone even want that job just to deal with parents like that? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Someone will want it. There's always someone willing to take a job.</p>
<p><strong>City League</strong>: That old central coach doin a nice job at the dice. Went to see them and they have some good players, surprising that Balinsky left all <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Devin Crummie doing an excellent job at Allderdice. Buddy Valinsky left because he wanted to coach in the WPIAL. He flat out said it. There are still some good players at Allderdice also.</p>
<p><strong>Hooper</strong>: No talk about the dice lately. Went to see them and they got some talent back, hard to believe their coach left alma mater and all those kids for worse talent and school <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Read the above question.</p>
<p><strong>Hoop LUV</strong>: Isn't the assistant (now head coach) at Moon the daughter of the QV boys coach? If so good blood line in coaching. I bet she will get it? <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Yep, Megan Mastroianni. Daughter of Mike. I know Jody Powell hopes Megan gets the job. <br> <strong>Mike White</strong>: Hey that's it for now. See y'all next week. Tuesday at 11 a.m.</p>
