<h1>Robert Ferrante to get hearing on one appellate issue</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The former University of Pittsburgh researcher <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/2015/02/04/Ferrante-sentenced-to-life-in-cyanide-poisoning-of-wife/stories/201502040175" target="_blank">convicted of poisoning his wife</a> will have a hearing over just one of the claims he raised in his appeal for ineffective assistance of counsel: whether he knowingly waived his right to have the case heard by an out-of-county jury.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Jeffrey A. Manning dismissed all other claims by Robert Ferrante in a 23-page opinion filed on Monday.</p>
<p>Ferrante and defense attorneys William Difenderfer and Wendy Williams initially asked that his case be heard by a jury chosen from outside of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>However, on Sept. 2, 2014, during an in-chambers conference, the defense said Ferrante was waiving an out-of-county jury.</p>
<p>In his amended post-conviction relief petition filed in December, appellate attorney Chris Rand Eyster said Ferrante was coerced into having an Allegheny County jury hear his case, and that the reasons were because Judge Manning raised concerns about the increased costs of an out-of-town jury.</p>
<p>In his opinion, Judge Manning said he recalled that, during the September 2014 discussion that Ferrante’s trial attorneys represented to the court that their client agreed to move forward with a local jury. And then, Judge Manning continued, Ferrante was brought into the courtroom and questioned about his decision to withdraw the request for a change of venire. The judge included a footnote in his opinion referencing a Sept. 2, 2014, Post-Gazette article that said Ferrante answered the judge’s questions on the issue and waived an out-of-town panel.</p>
<p>However, no transcript of any such proceeding can be found, and the court reporter who transcribed that hearing has died.</p>
<p>Judge Manning ordered the prosecution to file an answer to the defense petition within 30 days, and he will then schedule a hearing.</p>
<p>All other issues raised by Ferrante relative to ineffective assistance of counsel during the trial were dismissed by the court.</p>
