<h1>Sunny Jim's Tavern falls victim again to fire in Kilbuck</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A police officer patrolling in the area spotted smoke pouring out of Sunny Jim’s Tavern in Kilbuck Monday night and alerted emergency crews.</p>
<p>Firefighters responded to the local landmark in the 200 block of&nbsp;Camp Horne Road around 9:50 p.m.</p>
<p>Ohio Township Police Chief Joe Hanny said there were no injuries.</p>
<p>“One of our officers was actually patrolling in the area and pulled over when they noticed smoke coming from the building,” Chief Hanny said. “Part of the building is over top of a creek, so we assume that's where the fire may have originated.”</p>
<p>The cause and extent of damage from the fire were not immediately clear.</p>
<p>It’s not the first time the eatery was damaged by fire. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/north/2008/07/24/Sunny-Jim-s-owners-pledge-to-reopen-after-fire/stories/200807240397" target="_blank">In July 2008</a>, a refrigerator compressor sparked a fire inside Sunny Jim's that heavily damaged all three levels of the building, including an upstairs apartment. The restaurant didn’t reopen for several months.</p>
<p>Sunny Jim's sits on a tree-lined portion of Camp Horne Road about a mile from the Avonworth pool and can hold up to 200 people. It had also been damaged in the 2004 floods in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, but was able to return to full operation in a matter of days.</p>
