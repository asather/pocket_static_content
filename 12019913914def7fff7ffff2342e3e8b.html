<h1>Troy Hill felon described as Nazi-obsessed to plead guilty to federal gun charge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Troy Hill felon who was the target of an FBI raid on his house in January that prosecutors said turned up a trove of guns and Nazi memorabilia is set to waive indictment Wednesday and plead guilty to a gun possession charge that will put him in prison.</p>
<p>Dennis Alan Riggs, 50, had been set to plead last month before U.S. District Judge Robert Colville but it was pushed back until tomorrow. The judge will conduct the hearing by video, the Riggs participating from jail.</p>
<p>Riggs' lover, retired federal judge Karl Alexander of Grove City, previously pleaded guilty to buying an AR-15 for him and is awaiting sentencing.</p>
<p>Riggs is not allowed to have weapons because he's a felon. Alexander, now also a felon, admitted to being a straw buyer for Riggs in purchasing the assault weapon for him at a Washington County gun shop.</p>
<p>Riggs was with Alexander when they bought the gun, according to Alexander's plea, and paid him $789 for it.</p>
<p>Alexander said Riggs had been asking for him years to buy the gun for him but he didn't because he was still a sitting judge, presiding over Social Security Administration cases in West Virginia. After he retired, he finally agreed to make the purchase.</p>
<p>The two men were in a long-standing romantic relationship and spent weekends together at Riggs' house, which Alexander had bought.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh FBI's joint terrorism task force raided Riggs' house on Jan. 22 and found the AR-15 and six other firearms, all but one loaded. Agents also found ammunition, knives, daggers, and hundreds of bottles of alcohol.</p>
<p>Agents said at a detention hearing that the house was festooned with Nazi imagery and pictures of Hitler. A video on his cell phone also showed him in Nazi garb, making the sieg heil salute and loading and unloading the AR-15, according to testimony.</p>
<p>The phone also contained images of Riggs with other guns, a video of the 2019 mosque massacre in New Zealand and a picture of the killer in the 2015 mass shooting at a black church in South Carolina.</p>
<p>Prosecutors made it clear at the hearing that they feared Riggs was a potential mass shooter.</p>
