<p>All Roman Catholic bishops in Pennsylvania have waived the obligation for Catholics to attend Mass in the near future due to the coronavirus, but Masses will continue to be offered for those who do choose to attend at least in Southwestern Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>And in the Diocese of Pittsburgh, Bishop David Zubik&nbsp;is urging parishes with Lenten fish fries to provide the food take-out only, with no eat-in option, to reduce the potential spread of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Roman Catholic bishops met via conference call and agreed to waive the attendance rule.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf has recommended there be no gatherings of 250 people or more statewide.</p>
<p>He urged religious leaders to exercise discretion in their decisions, unlike Kentucky’s governor, which asked churches to cancel worship and received varied responses in that state.</p>
<p>Worship services remain scheduled over the weekend under <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/faith-religion/2020/03/02/Pittsburgh-Bishop-David-Zubik-suspends-communion-wine-personal-contact-coronavirus-COVID-19/stories/202003020133" target="_blank">the limits imposed earlier in the epidemic</a>, such as not providing communion wine so that people don’t have to share a common cup and avoiding handshakes and hugs during the ritual sign of peace at Mass.</p>
<p>Also, Catholic schools and religious-education classes in Pittsburgh will remain open “to the extent possible,” he said.</p>
<p>But non-essential Pittsburgh diocesan gatherings are canceled as of next Monday, Bishop Zubik said. Those include listening sessions the bishop planned to hold around the diocese, along with a youth event called&nbsp;“Arise” and meetings on parish mergers.</p>
<p>The bishop said plans about upcoming confirmations are being evaluated.</p>
<p>Fish-fry organizers should consult with local health departments on best practices, he said.</p>
<p>As with Pittsburgh, in the neighboring Catholic Diocese of Greensburg, Bishop Edward Malesic dispensed with the obligation to attend weekend Mass but is maintaining its schedule of Masses.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Catholics are obligated to attend Mass except when sick or under certain other circumstances. But these not being normal circumstances, the bishops are waiving the requirement.</p>
<p>“The Eucharistic celebration is at the heart of the faith and our communal worship,” said Ellen Mady, chancellor for the Pittsburgh diocese.&nbsp;“It’s also central to how we come together for the Lord’s Day.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>In related news, at least two large congregations&nbsp;</p>
<p>the Church of the Ascension, a large Anglican church in Oakland, has suspended worship for the next three weeks. It plans to livestream services, but the parish rector, the Rev. Jonathan Millard, noted the decision is difficult.</p>
<p>“While as Anglican Christians we place the highest value on meeting together to share Word and Sacrament, there are times when the mandate of our Lord to ‘love our neighbors as ourselves’ supersedes the mandate to gather together physically,” he wrote to parishioners. “With the potential for rampant community spread of the Coronavirus, now is such a time.”</p>
