<h1>Pirates reliever Kyle Crick will have ‘driving force’ in hugely important season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The 2019 season was certainly one to forget for Pirates reliever Kyle Crick. What followed, however, was much, much worse, as Crick endured a pair of tragedies he hopes to use as motivation in 2020.</p>
<p>Starting Dec. 30, 2019, the 27-year-old Crick lost his twin brother Kevin after he died from a fall resulting in a cervical injury while vacationing in Cancun, Mexico. Then on May 15, 2020, Crick’s father (Reggie) passed away at age 69.</p>
<p>As Crick looks to bounce back in 2020, he knows that he will undoubtedly have a little company when he’s on the mound.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a driving force,” Crick said. “Tragic things happen in peoples’ lives. You have one of two choices. You can go forward and move on positively, or you can stay stuck and in a tough place.</p>
<p>“As far as when I take the mound, it’s in honor of people now. It’s a little different than just getting on and trying to get people out. I feel like I have a couple more guardians looking over me now.”</p>
<p>But even if he might be pitching with a heavy heart, the Pirates also need Crick to pitch effectively, especially considering that closer Keone Kela will start the season on the 10-day injured list.</p>
<p>Manager Derek Shelton said Friday that the Pirates will take a by-committee approach to closing games, but that’s sure to involve Crick, a key setup man in the bullpen and the most experienced of its (remaining) back-end arms.</p>
<p>Crick was not as consistent as he would’ve liked last year. Although he had a 2.04 ERA over his first 19 appearances (17 2/3 innings), Crick pitched to a 6.61 ERA in his final 33 outings (31 1/3 innings), watching his home runs allowed jump from zero to 10.</p>
<p>Free passes were also a problem, as Crick’s year-over-year walk rate went from 9% in 2018 to 15.5% in 2019.</p>
<p>A big reason for Crick’s struggles was tipping pitches, as the right-hander became too predictable and opposing hitters started sitting on his slider in fastball counts, thus negating what is otherwise a tremendous pitch.</p>
<p>After a rotten offseason, Crick believes the struggles he encountered in 2019 — which also include a clubhouse fight with Felipe Vazquez and an altercation with bullpen coach Euclides Rojas — are finally behind him.</p>
<p>“That’s kind of the game we’re in — constantly evolving,” Crick said. “You just kind of evolve with it, or it passes you by.”</p>
<p>The Pirates need that evolution from Crick because the bullpen they once thought might be a strength suddenly doesn’t look like one, the result of losing Kela for unknown reasons and the fact that Edgar Santana will miss the entire season after testing positive for steroids.</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez and Michael Feliz have fared well at times in setup roles, but they’ve struggled plenty, too. Neither is anywhere near Crick when it comes to pure stuff. Nick Burdi might be, but injuries have limited him to just 10 career innings.</p>
<p>Which means that more responsibility will fall on Crick, even if it’s not necessarily thinking about a change in role, an entrance song or anything like that.</p>
<p>“It’s all gonna come down to consistency,” Crick said. “If you’re throwing zeroes up consistently, you deserve to be in a high-leverage role.”</p>
<p>A shift to the closer’s role, even if it’s temporary or matchup-based, could force Crick to adjust his routine, although he said that will take time. He’s also confident that the Pirates’ bullpen will be fine despite two key losses.</p>
<p>Crick has experienced no issues with his surgically repaired finger, and his sweeping slider has looked nasty as ever during the live sessions he’s had in summer camp.</p>
<p>So as much as Shelton might want to believe closing will be group thing until Kela returns, Crick made a great point: If he’s able to pitch like he did in 2018 — a 2.39 ERA in 60 1/3 innings with 65 strikeouts and 23 walks — the Pirates will find a way to utilize that effectiveness in the most important part of the game.</p>
<p>Just don’t start making any sort of celebratory video.</p>
<p>“If I come out and I throw up 20 zeroes in a row, then maybe we can talk about a video and stuff like that,” Crick said. “But it’s all about performance here, and it’s all about results. When that happens, we can talk more about songs and videos.”</p>
<p><strong>Monday’s schedule</strong></p>
<p>Trevor Williams will start Monday when the Pirates travel to Cleveland to play the Indians at Progressive Field. He’ll be followed by JT Brubaker, Feliz, Crick, Rodriguez, Chris Stratton and Robbie Erlin. Mike Clevinger will get the ball for Cleveland.</p>
<p><strong>Roster additions</strong></p>
<p>Similar to spring training, the Pirates brought up four players from Altoona for Saturday’s game: shortstop Oneil Cruz, catcher Andrew Susac, outfielder Jason Martin and first baseman Will Craig.</p>
