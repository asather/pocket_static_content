<h1>Andean Condor egg stops developing at National Aviary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite the efforts of the National Aviary’s Andean condors, the egg that <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/outdoors/2018/04/06/Andean-condors-egg-National-Aviary-endangered-species/stories/201804060125" target="_blank">Lianni and Lurch have been incubating since early April</a> has stopped developing, and there will be no chick.</p>
<p>“This is an unfortunate but not uncommon outcome,” said the aviary in a&nbsp;“sad-to-report” statement at 9:22 a.m. Wednesday.&nbsp;“The egg, though it did not successfully hatch, is a promising sign for Lianni and Lurch. We are very hopeful for their future breeding success.”</p>
<p>The mango-sized egg laid by Lianni, 36, was due to hatch in early June. Lurch, 49, her breeding partner since 2017, took turns sitting on the egg in a nest located in an outdoor exhibit.</p>
<p>The 25-pound birds with 10-foot wingspans, and other birds, can be viewed by the public while most of the North Side facility is closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The egg was important because in the wild condors are&nbsp;“critically endangered” in Ecuador and&nbsp;“threatened” in much of their range in other South American countries.</p>
<p>Lianni earlier produced four chicks at the National Aviary with her former partner, Rhodan, and three of them were released in the wild, when grown, in Columbia and Venezuela.</p>
<p>Lurch also has a proven track record. He produced three offspring at other facilities.</p>
