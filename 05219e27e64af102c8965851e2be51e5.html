<p>Heinz Field will not host fans for Steelers and Pitt football games in September, both programs announced Thursday, citing guidelines from local health officials.</p>
<p>The Steelers will go without fans for their first two home games, Sept. 20 against the Denver Broncos and Sept. 27 against the Houston Texans.</p>
<p>“Over the last several months we have been communicating with public health officials and the NFL on plans for fans to safely attend games this season,” read an email to season ticket holders Thursday. “We obviously know and greatly appreciate the dedication of our fans and your strong desire to attend games this season. Unfortunately, given the current conditions and state orders, we will not be able to welcome fans to Heinz Field at this time, and so we have determined that we will not be hosting fans for the first two regular season home games.”</p>
<p>The Steelers’ next home game after that is Oct 18 against the Cleveland Browns, but no decision has been made yet about allowing fans at Heinz Field for that division rivalry.</p>
<p>Rooney said he is disappointed to have to make the move.</p>
<p>“As we have prepared for the 2020 season, we have continuously followed the guidance of public health officials to ensure the safety of our fans, as well as our players, coaches and staff,” Rooney said in a statement. “And we understand and appreciate the dedication of our fans who want to attend games this season. That is why it is disappointing to announce that we will not be able to host fans for our first two home games in September.</p>
<p>Pitt will have three home games impacted by the decision. The Panthers are slated to open their season on Sept. 12 against Austin Peay, followed by conference games versus Syracuse and Louisville on Sept. 19 and Sept. 26, respectively.</p>
<p>Athletic director Heather Lyke said the department will “remain in communication with the appropriate agencies and continue to explore the possible fan attendance” for games beyond September.</p>
<p>After the early September homestand, Pat Narduzzi’s Panthers are scheduled to host three ACC opponents: N.C. State on Oct. 3, Notre Dame on Oct. 24 and Virginia Tech on Nov. 21.</p>
<p>“Although we are disappointed for our loyal and passionate fans, the Panther Pitt student section and especially our student-athletes’ families and friends, the University of Pittsburgh respects and understands the guidelines set forth by state and county health officials,” Lyke added.</p>
<p>For those with paid September tickets through the athletic department, Pitt is offering three options: “Re-invest, rollover or refund.” Ticket holders can transfer the ticket cost to the Panther Club as a 100% tax deductible gift with certain club perks. Fans can also roll over any 2020 football ticket payments to the 2021 season or request a refund.</p>
