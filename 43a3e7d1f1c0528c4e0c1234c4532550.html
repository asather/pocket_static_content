<h1>State centers have first COVID-19 case among residents</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After going four months into the COVID-19 pandemic without a single resident of the state’s four state centers for people with intellectual disabilities testing positive, the leaders of the Pennsylvania Department of Human Services were understandably pleased with the result.</p>
<p>“I am proud to say that none of the 680 individuals who live in the state centers have tested positive for COVID-19,” Human Services Secretary Teresa Miller said during prepared remarks just last week during a June 30 press conference. “That’s a testament to the hard work of state center employees who diligently implemented new protocols to keep the virus out of those facilities.”</p>
<p>But Monday, a state Department of Human Services spokeswoman said a resident tested positive just this past Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>In addition to the positive case at Ebensburg, three state center employees have also tested positive for COVID-19 at some point during the pandemic, according to Kevin Dressler, director of Pennsylvania’s Office of Developmental Programs, a division of Human Services that includes the state centers. The state would not say where those staff members worked, and the state does not include staff COVID-19 data in its <a href="https://www.dhs.pa.gov/providers/Providers/Pages/Coronavirus-State-Facility-Data.aspx" target="_blank">online update of all four centers, which include only resident data</a>.</p>
<p>The state would not provide additional data on those state employees’ cases, either, and would not say whether the Ebensburg employee who tested positive may have infected the resident who tested positive.</p>
<p>“To protect the privacy of individuals and the confidentiality of personal health information, DHS cannot disclose any additional information about individuals who have tested positive for COVID-19,” state spokeswoman Erin James said in emailed answers to questions.</p>
<p>The state has never previously announced that staff tested positive.</p>
<p>Asked why, Ms. James wrote that it was never announced because “[public] announcements are not a part of any required protocol.”</p>
<p>However, Jeanne Weaver, president of the Ebensburg Center advisory board, said she was told just this past Friday that an aide at Ebensburg tested positive recently.</p>
<p>“I was upset when I was told that” a staff member had tested positive, she said,&nbsp;“because we’ve gone 16 weeks without any cases and I know they’re doing everything they can to keep residents and staff safe.”</p>
<p>Gregory Smith, president of the advisory board at White Haven State Center, said he was told back in March that an employee at White Haven had tested positive then, and that was the only staff member to test positive there.</p>
<p>State Rep. Lee James, R-Venango/Butler, who has been fighting to keep the centers open after the state announced plans to close two of them, said he had not heard from the state about the positive COVID-19 test result among residents before a reporter called.</p>
<p>“But I guess it’s not a complete surprise,” he said, given how pervasive COVID-19 has been across the state. “We’ve been battling this for going on something like four months.”</p>
<p>He said he had heard about some employees being asked “to go home” after they appeared to have some symptoms when they showed up for work, but nothing about any staff members testing positive. His district includes Polk State Center in Venango County.</p>
<p>Even if three state center staff members tested positive, he said, “three out of four months? I can’t do the math right now, but that’s a pretty low percentage.”</p>
<p>“I think the state centers are doing it right,” he said, noting that the centers have been regularly screening staff members for COVID-19 symptoms and being cautious if a resident has to leave the building for any reason by isolating them when they return for up to two weeks.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller said last week that because of the success of keeping COVID-19 out of the centers the state was going to relax some restrictions on visitations and outside activities for residents.</p>
<p>Now, because of the cases at Ebensburg, Ms. James wrote, “We will monitor and evaluate the situation at Ebensburg Center before determining when we can reduce current restrictions that are in place. We will only reduce restrictions after careful consideration.”</p>
<p>The state said it is in the process of testing all residents at Ebensburg now and intends to test all residents in all four centers by the end of this week.</p>
<p>Ebensburg Center, located in Cambria County, is one of four remaining state centers for people with intellectual disabilities in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>The center has 193 residents on its 70-acre campus in Cambria Township, near the borough of Ebensburg. What was called Ebensburg State School and Hospital opened in 1957, and at its peak population in the 1970s it served more than 1,200 residents.</p>
<p>Last year, state Human Services officials announced <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2019/08/14/Closure-Polk-State-center-White-Haven-State-intellectually-disabled-venango-luzerne/stories/201908140079" target="_blank">plans to close two of the four centers</a>, Polk in Venango County and White Haven State Center in Luzerne County, which would leave just Ebensburg and Selinsgrove State Center in Snyder County remaining.</p>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2019/09/04/polk-center-pa-closing-institution-intellectual-disabilities-venango-county-dhs/stories/201908280135" target="_blank">disability groups favor closing the centers</a>, which are large institutions, and transitioning residents to smaller, more community-based group homes. Pennsylvania has closed a number of such centers over several decades as public opinion has shifted away from such large facilities, along with the legal rights of people living in institutions and the disability rights movement. They argue more community-based settings can provide a better quality of life.</p>
<p>But local and state legislators, and the family members of many center residents have fought to save them, along with their unionized employees, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/02/12/Pennsylvania-Tom-Wolf-vetoes-bill-Polk-Center-closure-intellectual-disabilities/stories/202002120112" target="_blank">saying their facilities provide a safe environment</a> for people with serious disabilities and medical needs.</p>
<p>Following the Polk and White Haven closure announcement by state officials, legislators in Harrisburg passed a bipartisan bill that would have put a five-year moratorium on any state center closures. Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/social-services/2020/02/12/Pennsylvania-Tom-Wolf-vetoes-bill-Polk-Center-closure-intellectual-disabilities/stories/202002120112" target="_blank">vetoed the bill in February.</a></p>
<p>A group of mostly Republican House members, including Rep. James, last month — citing what were then zero positive cases of COVID-19 at state centers — said they were still working to convince other legislators to change their votes and override the governor's veto of Senate Bill 906.</p>
<p>Mr. James said he is still battling to keep the centers open.</p>
<p>“These are some of the most vulnerable folks in our society and to be closing the centers down and be putting pressure on their loved ones to find a way to put them into the community was wrong from the state,” he said Monday.</p>
