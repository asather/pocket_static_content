<h1>Market Square ice house to raise funds for heating bills</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Market Square looks a little different this week, as workers clad in winter gear put the finishing touches on a 1,000-square-foot ice house to help raise money for those struggling to pay their heating bills this winter.</p>
<p>The structure sits at the center of the square, and was covered in tarps Wednesday to protect it from cracking in the sun. Outside, workers pieced together a white picket fence. Inside, two workers constructed a table, first gluing the ice pieces together by spraying the joints with water, then sanding the surfaces and polishing them.</p>
<p>The ice house is part of the Dollar Energy Fund’s sixth annual Cool Down for Warmth fundraiser, powered by Dynegy energy, which will take place from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m on Thursday and Friday.</p>
<p>The event hopes to raise funds for utility assistance grants and spread awareness for those in the region who can’t afford their heating-related utilities.</p>
<p>Chief executive officer of Dollar Energy Fund Chad Quinn said the event, chilly as it will be, is a way to “spread the warmth” to neighbors in need.</p>
<p>The multi-room ice house stands 20 by 50 feet, constructed with 249 ice blocks, each weighing 300 pounds. Maestro Gourmet Ice began laser cutting the blocks in September. On Monday, three trucks transported the ice to the site where workers began placing blocks individually, packing the area in between each block with snow.</p>
<p>Beginning on Thursday, visitors can explore the ice house, take pictures at the ice selfie wall, and receive giveaways including gloves and restaurant coupons.</p>
<p>Radio station 3WS will provide music and its Jonny Hartwell will be in attendance.</p>
<p>On Friday at noon, members of the University of Pittsburgh football team will be in the ice house for a ticket giveaway for the men’s basketball game against Georgia Tech on Feb. 5.</p>
<p>Attendees can purchase soup in the Bowls for Warmth Soup Tasting for $10 and contribute to donation baskets. All proceeds will receive a dollar-for-dollar match from partnering utility companies.</p>
<p>In addition to donating onsite, community members can donate online or by texting COOLDOWN to 41411.</p>
<p>The event has raised $840,000 and helped more than 2,400 households in Western Pennsylvania since it first kicked off in 2015, organizers said.</p>
<p>The Dollar Energy Fund, the largest hardship fund in the state, said all funds will be used to help families directly rather than for company overhead.</p>
