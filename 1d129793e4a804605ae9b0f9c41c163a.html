<p>In a campuswide email Monday morning, dean of students Heather Black said Ms. Eckelberry “made a great impact within the [softball] program in her short time and we will miss her very much.”</p>
<p>Ms. Eckelberry was officially hired as a part-time assistant coach in January after working as a volunteer coach during the fall, according to university officials.</p>
<p>In a press release issued by Gannon University, Ms. Eckelberry’s alma mater, Gannon softball coach Michelle Wiley said: “When I think of Katie, I always smile because she had such a beautiful soul and such a passion for life and softball. She was an amazing student, teammate, athlete, sister, daughter and most recently coach. She had such a positive impact on everyone she came in contact with.”</p>
<p>Allegheny County homicide detectives and the department’s Collision Reconstruction Unit reported that it appeared a Jeep Cherokee crossed the center line and struck the Hyundai Elantra driven by Ms. Eckelberry. The Jeep’s driver, also 23, was critically injured.</p>
<p>Ms. Eckelberry was born in Akron, Ohio, and most recently lived with her parents in Canton, Ohio. She graduated from Gannon with a bachelor’s of science in 2018, and then graduated from Gannon with her master’s of physician assistance science in 2019, according to an online obituary.</p>
<p>In the Gannon University statement, Ms. Wiley said, “She was a perfect example of a successful student-athlete. She was one of the hardest workers that I have ever known both on and off the field. She pushed herself and her teammates to get better every day.”</p>
<p>A moment of silence will be held in Ms. Eckelberry’s honor at the women’s basketball playoff game on Monday at 7 p.m. in Chatham University’s Athletic &amp; Fitness Center, and Tuesday night at the men’s basketball playoff game at 7 p.m. at the same location.</p>
<p>Funeral services will be held at the Queen of Heaven Church in Uniontown, Ohio, on Friday.</p>
