<h1>Allegheny County updates guidelines for likely arrival of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department on Wednesday updated its guidelines and recommendations it hopes will minimize the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>So far, cases of the disease have yet to appear in the region, but the new measures are made "in light of the probability that the county will have presumptive positive cases."</p>
<p>The county is encouraging the most vulnerable groups — the elderly, those with underlying medical conditions, and those that are currently sick — to follow these steps to prevent the spread of the virus once it inevitably arrives in Western Pennsylvania:</p>
<p>● Avoid large events and mass gatherings, as well as other settings where you would have close contact (within six feet) with a large group of people.</p>
<p>● Continue proactive hygiene measures such as washing your hands frequently, covering coughs and sneezes with a tissue, and frequently cleaning highly-touched surfaces.</p>
<p>● Stay home if you are sick and call your primary care provider to discuss next steps.</p>

<p>The health department said it "will continue its surveillance and containment measures, which include issuing orders to separate potentially sick individuals from non-sick individuals as necessary."</p>
<p>For businesses in the region, the health department issued the following reminders:</p>
<p>● Encourage sick employees to stay home</p>
<p>● Emphasize cough and sneeze etiquette and hand hygiene</p>
<p>● Perform routine cleaning of frequently-touched surfaces and objects</p>
<p>● Provide disposable wipes for employees to use on frequently-touched surfaces.</p>
<p>Once a positive case of COVID-19 has been confirmed, the county said there will be a coordinated effort with state and federal health agencies "to implement procedures to mitigate additional exposure."</p>
<p>Those procesures may include additional social distancing tactics such as school closures and postponing large gatherings, the county said.</p>
<p>As of 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, there were 15 cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania. Thirteen are presumed, two are confirmed.</p>
