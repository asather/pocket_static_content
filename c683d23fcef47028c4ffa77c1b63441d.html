<h1>Keith C. Burris: Portrait of a lady, and us</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>See­k­ers look for teach­ers. They sit at the feet of those who can teach them some­thing about how to live.</p>
<p>My Un­cle Tom, at whose feet I sat for a time (ac­tu­ally we sat in deck chairs on a high-rise bal­cony drink­ing gin), was an old test and fighter pi­lot with an eye for char­ac­ter and de­tail. He called me “lit­tle grass­hop­per” when I was in col­lege.</p>
<p>But I want to tell you about an­other per­son who taught me, and did so for 21 years, never once in di­dac­tic fash­ion.</p>
<p>Her name was Eliz­a­beth Ellis, and she was my boss, men­tor, friend, life coach and mas­ter teacher for all those years, at the Jour­nal In­quirer news­pa­per, in Manchester, Connecticut.</p>
<p>Betty died last week at the age of 92.</p>
<p>The first thing she taught me was to be in­de­pen­dent — to steer my own path and not to be in­tim­i­dated. I never saw or heard her worry about “what peo­ple might say” or think.</p>
<p>She had a world­view. I would call it Roosevelt lib­er­al­ism, but this world­view was as prac­ti­cal and sub­ject to em­pir­i­cal test­ing as it was prin­ci­pled. She was an in­tel­lect, but she did not live in the world of ab­strac­tion. She lived in the world of the pos­si­ble.</p>
<p>An early les­son in her in­de­pen­dence and prag­ma­tism was the case of two young, in­ex­pe­ri­enced cops shoot­ing and kill­ing a man who was high and charged at them, threat­en­ing to take them out. He had a knife, but was oth­er­wise un­armed. I wanted to ham­mer the cops in an ed­i­to­rial. I wanted to say their lives were never at risk and they should have shot the guy in the foot or leg. And, any­way, their su­pe­ri­ors should not have sent two green cops on this call. These were not un­rea­son­able po­si­tions.</p>
<p>Betty qui­etly asked me some ques­tions: Had I con­sid­ered the di­lemma from the young cops’ point of view? How long did they have to think? What in­for­ma­tion did they have? What did I know about the size, dis­tance and dis­po­si­tion of the man who came at the cops? And, most dev­as­tat­ingly, had <em>I</em> ever tried to shoot some­one in the foot or leg? Had I ever been in a sit­u­a­tion re­motely sim­i­lar? Did I know any­one who had?</p>
<p>This was my les­son in em­pa­thy, with side tu­to­ri­als in bal­ance, skep­ti­cism and judg­ment.</p>
<p>I never thought of Betty as a re­li­gious per­son. But she was a deeply sen­si­tive per­son and a pro­foundly Jew­ish per­son. Hence her in­nate sense of justice and un­der­stand­ing. I never once saw her get emo­tional or sen­ti­men­tal, but she walked me through the death of my father, and the long ill­ness and death of my mother, as no one else did — with the blessed as­sur­ance of the psalm­ist. Or maybe just a mom.</p>
<p>She once told me that a news­pa­per should be a place where a per­son could go when he has ex­hausted all other op­tions — the pa­per should be the re­course of last re­sort.</p>
<p>The third thing I learned from her was a sense of fun. Yes, she re­garded jour­nal­ism as a high call­ing. But there is no sense in own­ing or pro­duc­ing a daily news­pa­per, she thought, if you don’t have some fun — af­flict­ing the com­fort­able as well as com­fort­ing the af­flicted. Every day.</p>
<p>And we did have fun. We laughed a lot and rat­tled a lot of cages. And we reg­u­larly sur­prised peo­ple. And formed no per­ma­nent al­li­ances. (We didn’t en­dorse in po­lit­i­cal races.)</p>
<p>We took the work se­ri­ously but our­selves not so much. We had a feisty lit­tle news­pa­per. At one time, when such things were pos­si­ble, the JI was the fast­est-grow­ing pa­per in New En­gland. The pa­per’s motto was: “We tell it like it is, some­body has to.” Betty set the tone and tenor. She was rightly called, in her JI obit, “the soul” of the pa­per. She drew the bound­aries and let us all roam within. She never stopped be­ing a fan of good jour­nal­ism or good writ­ing and she was lav­ish with praise when she thought any one of us reached the top. But oc­ca­sion­ally she would in­tone, al­ways with a wry smile, “Re­mem­ber, it’s my sand­box.”</p>
<p>She rel­ished be­ing the un­der­dog and she loved a good fight. She adored jazz and the­ater and she liked cock­tails, and sen­tences, that packed a punch. Her wit was sharp and dry and her com­po­sure eclipsed the truth that she was ac­tu­ally tough as nails. But she was also, in ev­ery sense of the word — a word in un­for­tu­nate re­treat these days — a lady.</p>
<p>And when I say tough, I re­fer not only to things she en­dured in life — loss, pain, the ruth­less­ness of age — but a cer­tain men­tal tough­ness about the world. She was an old-fash­ioned pro­gres­sive, but there was noth­ing of what we would to­day call “woke” about her. Not one ounce of pre­cious­ness or vir­tue sig­nal­ing. And when I think about her I won­der if we have lost all rigor, both in our pro­fes­sion and in our so­ci­ety. What would she think about an en­tire econ­omy shut down; a whole so­ci­ety shel­ter­ing in place, ad in­fin­i­tum?</p>
<p>Maybe that it is good we are start­ing to re­open Amer­ica; good that we are start­ing to come out. Maybe she would say that risk is part of life and we take a risk ev­ery time we leave the house or turn the key in the car. And who wants to live in a so­ci­ety where you can’t shake hands or hug your kid or visit your aging mother or your new­born grand­daugh­ter? Life is risk. And ei­ther you risk or you live by fear. Eliz­a­beth Ellis took risks. It seemed to me she was never afraid.</p>
