<h1>Anthony Lubrano seeks return to Penn State board of trustees</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Anthony Lubrano, the Paoli financial advisor who in many ways become the voice of alumni resistance to the widespread condemnation of Penn State and its longtime head football coach Joe Paterno in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sex abuse scandal, announced Friday he wants to return to the Penn State board of trustees.</p>
<p>Mr. Lubrano has qualified for a ballot spot in this spring’s balloting for three alumni-elected trustee seats, and he said in an interview with PennLive that he will run on a slate with current alumni incumbents Jay Paterno, the longtime coach’s son, and Alice Pope, a professor at St. John’s University in New York.</p>
<p>There is one additional candidate on the ballot, Jeffrey Ballou, who works as a news editor with Al Jazeera.</p>
<p>The top three vote-getters will serve three-year terms, beginning in July.</p>
<p>Mr. Lubrano first joined the board in the aftermath of the Sandusky scandal in 2012, serving two terms in which he led a minority faction on the board that pushed back strenuously against the findings in Louis Freeh’s report on the university’s role in and responsibilities for Sandusky’s crimes, and NCAA penalties and other consequeces that flowed from it.</p>
<p>That minority was rarely successful within the board room, but the issues they raised and the pressure they kept up certainly helped lead to an early rollback of NCAA sanctions on the Penn State football program.</p>
<p>Mr. Lubrano left the board in 2018 after two terms, but he said Friday that he’s rested and ready for another tour of duty.</p>
<p>This time, he said, he and his colleagues will still want to tackle some unfinished business from the Sandusky scandal, to include work on continuing to debunk Mr. Freeh’s findings that senior leaders at Penn State didn’t deal properly with Sandusky issues that they knew about in order to protect the football program.</p>
<p>That is a subject of continued debate among Penn Staters and the larger college football world, and one that the majority of the board recently signalled anew that it hoped to move on from.</p>
<p>But Mr. Lubrano stressed he is more than a single-issue candidate, and he argued that his past experience on the board will let him be able to hit the ground running on other issues ranging from budgetary concerns to making sure that Penn State remains accessible to the children of middle- and working-class Pennsylvanians.</p>
<p>“There’s work to complete and there’s new work to do,” he said Friday.</p>
<p>Biographical information and position statements from each candidate will be posted March 15 on the Penn State trustees web page, and voting will run from April 10 through 9 a.m., May 7.</p>
