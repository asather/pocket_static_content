<h1>Tuned In: TV news sweeps ratings rise during COVID-19 crisis</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Year-to-year Pittsburgh TV stations generally saw their newscasts ratings rise during May sweeps as one would expect during a global health crisis. The one time period with year-to-year ratings erosion for some stations? 5 and 6 a.m. Maybe more people sleep in during a pandemic.</p>
<p>In household ratings, KDKA-TV ticked up at 5 a.m. but saw ratings decline at 6 a.m. Numbers were also down for WPXI-TV and WTAE-TV at 5 and 6 a.m. Rank order remained the same: WTAE first, WPXI second, KDKA third.</p>
<p>But beyond that time period, household news ratings increased for all stations in all time periods. The only notable decline: Third-place “Ellen” at 4 p.m. on WTAE opposite news on KDKA (No. 1 in the time period) and “Judge Judy” on WPXI (No. 2).</p>
<p>The 6 p.m. half-hour was an especially tight race with KDKA and WTAE essentially tied for first in household ratings.</p>
<p>Ratings released Thursday by Nielsen include both household ratings that reflect a measure of overall popularity and demographic ratings that are the basis for setting advertising rates. TV commercials are generally sold on demos, which can be sliced and diced in assorted ways (men, women, age, income), but viewers ages 25-54 are one of the key demographics used to sell ads in a newscast.</p>
<p>In the demos, newscasts’ trajectories generally mirrored the household ratings with demographic ratings for noon, evening and late news all on the rise for all stations’ newscasts compared to May 2019.</p>
<p>Weekday mornings, WPXI saw its demo ratings tick up at 5 and 6 a.m.</p>
<p>KDKA had first-place demo wins at noon, 4, 5 and 6 p.m. WPXI came in first at 5 a.m. and 11 p.m. (and was a hair’s length behind KDKA in the 6 p.m. half-hour). WTAE was first at 6 a.m.</p>
