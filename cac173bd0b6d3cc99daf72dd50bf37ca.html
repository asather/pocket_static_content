<html><head><title>Pitt falls to Wake Forest, 69-65</title></head><body><p>If Pitt’s first 13 games proved what an unpredictable team it is, its 14th reaffirmed that label that much more.</p><p>This time, the team’s roller-coaster nature was exhibited in what may well be its most deflating loss of the season.</p><p>Against a Wake Forest team that is projected to be one of the weakest in the ACC this season, the Panthers squandered a double-digit first-half lead and failed to convert on multiple chances to retake the lead in the final minute, falling to Wake Forest, 69-65, Saturday at Petersen Events Center.</p><p>It was their fourth loss in a row to the Demon Deacons, with those games being decided by a combined 16 points.</p><p>Ryan Murphy, after coming off the bench the previous two games, started and played his best game in weeks, pouring in a team-high 18 points while making seven of his 12 shots and four of his six 3-pointers. Three other players -- Trey McGowens (12 points), Justin Champagnie and Xavier Johnson (11 apiece) -- finished in double figures for the Panthers (10-4, 1-2 ACC).</p><p>Without sophomore forward Au’Diese Toney, who was nursing an elbow injury he suffered in practice earlier in the week, Pitt’s rebounding suffered, as did its depth. Wake Forest outscored the Panthers by a 32-5 margin in bench points. Forward Ismael Massoud, who entered the day averaging just 3.4 points per game, scored a season-high 14 points for the Demon Deacons (8-5, 1-2).</p><p>Behind 15 unanswered points, Pitt started its 2020 ACC schedule as well as it could have, getting out to a 22-6 lead barely nine minutes into the game. In that time, the Panthers made nine of their 16 shots, with Murphy, who made five of his first six shots, accounting for 12 of their points.</p><p>The euphoria only lasted so long. Once that lead was built, Pitt’s offense, between a lack of ball movement and some questionable, low-percentage shots, stagnated. After scoring 22 points in the opening 9:12, it had just eight in the final 10:48, making only three of its final 17 shots and, at one point, going 4:51 without a point.</p><p>With that, what had been a 16-point cushion disappeared after a 3-pointer from Andrien White tied the game 22 seconds into the second half. What had looked like it would be a blowout in the game’s early stages became a tight, back-and-forth contest, though the Demon Deacons, following a questionable foul call against Johnson on a contested 3, made two of three free throws to go up by eight, 59-51, with 7:35 remaining.</p><p>In a moment when it would have been easy to fold, with momentum against them, as it had been since the opening 10 minutes, the Panthers fought back. Pitt went on a 12-4 run, getting points from five different players, to tie the score at 63 with 4:16 remaining.</p><p>Trailing by a single basket, the Panthers had three chances in the final 29 seconds to take the lead or tie the game, but failed on each occasion. The last of them, a layup attempt from McGowens with one second remaining, was swatted away by Wake Forest’s Olivier Sarr.</p><p>Pitt failed to score in the game’s final 3:06.</p><p><em>Craig Meyer: cmeyer@post-gazette.com and Twitter @CraigMeyerPG</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/04/Pitt-falls-to-Wake-Forest-69-65-basketball/stories/202001040040</original_url>
