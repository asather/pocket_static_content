<h1>WPIAL boys basketball championship preview: Games have historical significance</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The storylines for the WPIAL boys championships are many, and a number of them are tied to history.</p>
<p>The six championships will be played Thursday through Saturday at Petersen Events Center and it’s hard to remember so many title games with such historical significance. The championships have everything from teams trying to make history to some that already have had historical playoff runs.</p>
<p>Here are the history lessons for Thursday’s games:</p>
<p>• Lincoln Park plays North Catholic in the Class 3A championship and Lincoln Park is only the fourth team to make it to a WPIAL title game five consecutive years. The Leopards are trying to become only the 10th team to win three championships in a row.</p>
<p>• Vincentian meets Cornell in the Class 1A title game and Vincentian is trying to win one more title before the school is history. Vincentian announced Tuesday that the school will close at the end of the school year. This isn’t the first time that a school has made it to a championship in its final year of existence. Lawrenceville Catholic lost to Duquesne in the 1986 Class 1A final and Lawrenceville Catholic closed that year.</p>
<p>And now the history lessons for Friday’s title games:</p>
<p>• Laurel Highlands plays Mars for the Class 5A championship (9 p.m. tipoff) and Laurel Highlands is in a title game for the first time since 1972. The previous time Laurel Highlands won a championship was 1968 when the Mustangs defeated Donora before 8,664 at the Civic Arena. Will Robinson, one of the best WPIAL players in the 1960s, scored 35 points, just two shy of what was then the WPIAL championship record.</p>
<p>• Mars is trying for three consecutive titles. Only nine other teams in WPIAL history have won three in a row.</p>
<p>• There isn’t much history tied to the Class 2A final between Our Lady of the Sacred Heart and Sto-Rox (5 p.m. tipoff), other than Sto-Rox is trying for its ninth WPIAL title, which would tie the Vikings for the sixth-most in league history.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And now Saturday’s history lesson:</p>
<p>• Highlands plays Belle Vernon for the Class 4A championship (1 p.m. tipoff). Both Highlands and Belle Vernon have only one championship in school history. Highlands’ came in 1995 while Belle Vernon’s came all the way back in 1978 when the Leopards knocked off Norwin, 62-58, in front of 8,908 at the Civic Arena. Guard John Russell scored 25 points in the game.</p>
<p>• In the Class 6A final, Butler meets Mt. Lebanon in a rematch of last year’s championship game. The WPIAL championships have been around for more than 100 years and this is only the fifth time that the largest classification final will be a rematch. One of the other times, coincidentally, was 1914-15 when Butler played Peabody.</p>
<p>Now here is a look at the title games Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Class 6A</strong></p>
<p>The path to The Pete has been vastly different for these two teams. Mt. Lebanon (18-6) has breezed to two playoff wins by scores of 70-48 and 48-32. Butler has won its two playoff games in double overtime (78-76) and overtime (83-78).</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon defeated Butler in last year’s championship game, but Butler defeated Mt. Lebanon, 75-71, earlier this year.</p>
<p>This game could be pleasing to watch. Most likely you won’t see possessions lasting 30 seconds or more. Butler’s one-two punch of guards Ethan Morton and Devin Carney has been tremendous in the playoffs — Morton has 64 points in two games and Carney has 57. Morton now has 2,144 career points, good for 23rd in WPIAL history.</p>
<p>But Mt. Lebanon’s Jake Hoffman has 62 points in two games. A key might be the “other players” for both teams.</p>
<p>“We can leave a legacy here as seniors, if we win two championships in a row,” Hoffman said.</p>
<p>Morton said, “Mt. Lebanon plays so hard and well together. It’s going to take a big effort to hopefully pull out a win. It’s going to be a fun matchup for sure.”</p>
<p><strong>Class 5A</strong></p>
<p>This will be a new experience for Laurel Highlands (16-8), playing in a WPIAL title game for the first time in 48 years. But it will be a different experience facing a player like any other in the WPIAL.</p>
<p>Mars’ Michael Carmody, a Notre Dame football recruit, is a 6-foot-7, 290-pound senior who averages 19.2 points and 19.6 rebounds. In two playoff games, he has 50 points and 42 rebounds for the Planets (19-5).</p>
<p>“He’s going to be really close to averaging 20 points and averaging 20 rebounds. When’s the last time somebody in the WPIAL did that?” said Mars coach Rob Carmody, Michael’s father. “And everybody knows. It’s not like people are surprised when it happens. It’s coming. You know it’s coming. It’s just unbelievable by him.”</p>
<p>But Rob Carmody believes guard play will be key in this game. Laurel Highlands is led by freshman phenom point guard Rodney Gallagher, who averages 22.1 points a game.</p>
<p><strong>Class 4A</strong></p>
<p>It is no surprise that Highlands is in the championship game. The Rams (21-3) are an experienced, talented, senior-dominated team that was ranked No. 2 by the Post-Gazette at the start of the season. But who could’ve predicted Highlands would be playing Belle Vernon in the title game?</p>
<p>Belle Vernon (19-6) was 8-15 last year, but now the Leopards have a chance at winning a title. Sophomore guard Devin Whitlock, who transferred from Monessen, leads Belle Vernon in scoring at 20 points a game. But can Belle Vernon slow down a Highlands team that is led by the trio of seniors Luke Cochran (17 ppg), Korry Myers (16 ppg) and Johnny Crise (13 ppg)?</p>
<p>Joe Salvino is in his second year as Belle Vernon’s coach after 34 seasons at Monessen. He won six WPIAL titles at Monessen and could become only the fourth coach in league history to win seven.</p>
<p><strong>Class 2A</strong></p>
<p>Sto-Rox (18-6) meets Our Lady of the Sacred Heart (23-1) at 5 p.m. Friday in a matchup of the top two seeds in the tournament. You won’t see either team holding the ball. Don’t look for long possessions.</p>
<p>OLSH, the No. 1 seed, averages 76.5 points a game, second best in the WPIAL. Second-seeded Sto-Rox averages 71.6 points a game and during the Vikings’ current 15-game winning streak, they have averaged 75.7.</p>
<p>OLSH features one of the best one-two scoring punches in the WPIAL in decades. Sophomore guard Jake DiMichele averages 29 points a game and junior Dante Spadafora, a do-it-all junior point guard, averages 22.</p>
<p>Sto-Rox is a little familiar with OLSH. Sto-Rox played in the same section as OLSH from 2016-18. Sto-Rox was 5-17 and 6-16 during those two seasons.</p>
<p>“I just hope we don’t come out with too much aggression because we’ve wanted this game for two years,” Sto-Rox coach Ryan Hughes said. “They thumped us when we were in their section. Last year we didn’t get a chance to play them. Now we get a chance to play them to see how far we’ve come.”</p>
