<h1>Distance guides everything now: lessons from utility workers on the new workplace</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>If you want a glimpse into what work will look like when the “nonessentials” return, there’s a group with insider knowledge. The “essentials” who’ve kept the lights on and the gas flowing during the shutdown.</p>
<p>People like Josh Ewing, a senior underground splicer for Duquesne Light, whose past few months of isolating from most of his colleagues and social distancing even with his six-person crew may be a kind of new normal for all of us.</p>
<p>As a utility worker and a board member of his local International Brotherhood of Electric Engineers union, Mr. Ewing had a front-row seat to how his job protocols were being rewritten in the age of COVID-19.</p>
<p>He used to show up for his 6 a.m. shift and check in with his foreman. Now, he arrives at his work base — one of just a few workers allowed at each location — to find either a paper packet or an e-mail with the day’s instructions.</p>
<p>Gone are the days of his crew huddling over a map to parse circuit information. A job that involves more than one person crawling through a manhole to access underground wires now requires what might seem like modern-day medieval armor.</p>
<p>“From day one, when this started, the number one goal was to work in isolation,” Mr. Ewing said. It was an adjustment, he said.</p>
<p>Redundancy isn’t always a positive term in business lingo. Often, it’s a dog whistle for layoffs after a merger. But when employers have to plan for potential falling dominoes of infections throughout their organizations, there are lessons to be drawn from an industry where redundancy always has been a virtue: utilities.</p>
<p>Duquesne Light, the Downtown-based electric utility that serves customers in Allegheny and Beaver counties, split up its crews, spread them out over different locations, rented extra cars so each crew member could have a dedicated vehicle, and staggered shifts to avoid contact.</p>
<p>“The thought process there is if someone got sick, it would only affect a minimum amount of people,” Mr. Ewing said.</p>
<p><strong>Sequester at work?</strong></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the country, including in New York and in California, some utilities and power plants have chosen groups of workers to sequester at work or in RVs nearby to prevent their most critical operators from getting infected.</p>
<p>National Grid, a utility that serves New York State and parts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island, said it sequestered some 200 workers in offices across its territory.</p>
<p>PJM Interconnection LLC, the Valley Forge-based grid operator that coordinates the flow of electricity to 13 states including Pennsylvania, also is sequestering groups of control room operators.</p>
<p>Nuclear power plants have been stocking up on beds, linens, toiletries and food supplies to prepare for possible sequesters of healthy, critical workers for up to two months, according to remarks by Maria Korsnick, president of the Nuclear Energy Institute, to Reuters.</p>
<p>So far, none of the local utilities nor the Beaver Valley nuclear power plant have sequestered workers. Instead, they’ve developed isolation protocols that are likely to serve as models for businesses beyond the energy sphere.</p>
<p>At Beaver Valley, for example, access to critical areas has been even further restricted than before the pandemic, said Jason Copsey, a spokesman for Energy Harbor, the Akron-based company formerly known as FirstEnergy Solutions, which operates the power plant.</p>
<p>The federal nuclear inspectors assigned to the plant who typically work on location are working remotely and coming into the facility occasionally for inspections.&nbsp;</p>
<p>One of the two units at Beaver Valley was recently shut down for refueling —&nbsp;a 25-day scheduled outage where the plant typically swarms with workers who are checking, repairing and swapping out components.</p>
<p>One employee tested positive for COVID-19 in the beginning of the outage, Mr. Copsey said, and eight other workers in “direct contact” with the impacted employee were “identified, interviewed, and quarantined.”</p>
<p>None reported symptoms and everyone, including the worker who tested positive and has recovered, is back at work.</p>
<p>Beaver Valley, along with other nuclear power plants, also requested a number of waivers from nuclear regulators to postpone some inspection activities that would put workers in close contact with each other.</p>
<p><strong>Suited like astronauts</strong></p>
<p>The Peoples Natural Gas call centers that once buzzed with activity are mostly silent now. The North Shore-based gas utility has nearly all of its customer service operators answering calls from their homes. The few who don’t have the technology at home, are seated far enough apart to be strangers inside three different buildings.</p>
<p>Distance guides everything now. Peoples workers still are replacing distribution main lines on city streets but, for now, they aren’t replacing customers’ service lines in order to avoid coming into contact with residents.</p>
<p>The service lines belong to property owners but Peoples has agreed to replace old ones when it upgrades its own infrastructure. Barry Kukovich, a spokesman, said the utility will go back to areas where that practice has been stopped when the health crisis eases “and those will be the first people” on the list.</p>
<p>Technicians called to homes for gas emergencies are suited up like astronauts, Mr. Kukovich said. But the group most protected consists of 10 gas controllers and two supervisors.</p>
<p>These specialists typically sit in a control room around the clock watching screens that show how Peoples’ system of pipelines and facilities is running in real time.</p>
<p>They’ve been split into two locations so if one group is compromised, there’s no cross contamination.</p>
<p>So far, with the exception of a few positive cases early on in the pandemic, Peoples has been spared outbreaks, Mr. Kukovich said.</p>
<p>At Duquesne Light, “a&nbsp;limited group of critical employees still report to Duquesne Light’s Operations Center, where they’ve separated into multiple teams and two different work locations,” spokesman Matt McDonald said.</p>
<p>Some of the most critical workers have been told to work from home or reassigned to other duties to avoid the possibility of coming into contact with the virus, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. McDonald said he couldn’t say what roles these workers perform because of security concerns, only that the utility is&nbsp;“taking extra precautions to especially protect a small number of employees fulfilling highly skilled roles within our field operations and operations center organizations.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ewing, the Duquesne Light electrical worker who now talks to his co-workers through a mask, said he expects “nonessential” workers soon will be able to relate to his new work environment.</p>
<p>For those who are still at home and see his crew out and about, he asks a favor:&nbsp;“Please stay back.” At least 6 feet.</p>
