<h1>Riverhounds will not have fans at first home match of August</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Riverhounds SC’s match against Philadelphia Union II on Saturday at Highmark Stadium will again be contested without fans in the stands, the club said Monday.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds left the door open for fans to return to Highmark Stadium midway through the season, initially announcing that no fans would be present for home games in just July, pending re-evaluation. The Riverhounds only had one such home match: a 1-0 loss to Indy Eleven on Wednesday.</p>
<p>“The club is working closely with the state of Pennsylvania and local government and health officials to determine the ability to accommodate fans in future home games following this Aug. 1 date,” a team statement said. “The safety and well-being of players, coaches, employees and fans are Riverhounds SC’s first priority.”</p>
<p>A team spokesman said a decision for the Aug. 8 home fixture against New York Red Bulls II has yet to be made. The spokesman also said there have not been any positive COVID-19 cases for the Riverhounds since the pandemic began.</p>
<p>The Riverhounds opened their season July 12 with a 3-1 win over Louisville City FC, in front of a partially filled Lynn Family Stadium in Kentucky. The announced game attendance was 4,850, compared to the nearly 12,000 fans the new stadium can hold. In the Riverhounds’ other two road matches — against Philadelphia and New York — no fans were allowed inside the venue.</p>
<p>The USL Championship, the second tier of soccer in the U.S., has left decisions on fan attendance up to the individual clubs and local governing bodies. It’s a different approach to what most other professional sports leagues are doing around the country. There is no bubble, isolating teams in one location, such as with the NBA, MLS or NWSL.</p>
<p>Several professional, semi-professional and college teams in Pennsylvania have submitted plans to have fans return to games, the state health department said July 17. At the time, a Riverhounds spokesman said the team is “continuing to work closely with state and local government and health officials to determine our ability to accommodate fans for future home games.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Allegheny County announced 180 new coronavirus cases on Monday — the fifth straight day with a triple-digit increase in positive cases.</p>
