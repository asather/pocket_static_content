<h1>Curtain drawn? New York global investor may be Westinghouse buyer</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In a deal that has been cloaked in secrecy, it now appears that a New York-based global investor specializing in undervalued and distressed properties just might be the new owner of the Westinghouse Electric headquarters in Cranberry.</p>
<p>The name of Fortress Credit Advisors LLC emerged in a $135 million mortgage document relating to the sale filed in the Butler County recorder of deeds office Friday.</p>
<p>Fortress Credit is listed as the principal place of business for CF Cranberry LLC. According to public documents, CF Cranberry is a subsidiary created by former Westinghouse property owner Columbia Property Trust.</p>
<p>Columbia Property then sold CF Cranberry and several other subsidiaries related to the property to the new owner. But neither Columbia Property nor the Jones Lang LaSalle real estate firm that represented the seller and recruited the buyer has divulged the name of the owner since the sale was announced Jan. 17.</p>
<p>At first, it was thought that the buyer could be from outside the country based on state corporation bureau records listing CF Cranberry’s citizenship as foreign.</p>
<p>But it turned out that foreign, in the bureau’s lingo, simply means the company was formed outside of Pennsylvania. CF Cranberry was created in Delaware.</p>
<p>At the time of the sale, JLL described the buyer as an “institutional investor” but provided no other detail.</p>
<p>Fortress Credit certainly would fit that description. It appears to be related to Fortress Investment Group, which is based at the same New York City address.</p>
<p>According to its website, Fortress’ credit business has invested more than $100 billion since it was launched in 2002. It states that it “is focused on investing globally, primarily in undervalued assets and distressed and illiquid credit investments.”</p>
<p>Fortress Investment Group describes itself as a “leading, highly diversified global investment manager with approximately $41.5 billion of assets under management” as of Sept. 30.</p>
<p>A spokesman for Fortress could not be reached for comment. Spokespersons for Columbia Property and JLL declined comment.</p>
<p>The emergence of Fortress Credit caps a week of suspense surrounding the transaction. The deal was structured through the sale of subsidiaries created by Columbia, making it difficult to determine the real buyer behind the transaction.</p>
<p>Still unsettled is what accounts for the difference between the announced $180 million sales price and the $145.4 million price listed in the deed transfer report.</p>
<p>The discrepancy could cost Cranberry Township and the Seneca Valley School District each $175,000 in deed transfer taxes and the state $350,000.</p>
<p>At the $145.4 million price, Cranberry and the district are scheduled to receive $727,000 each in transfer taxes and the state $1.4 million. The township and the district each split 1% of the 2% tax and the state gets 1%.</p>
<p>Jerry Andree, township manager, said he may ask the state Department of Revenue to look into the discrepancy between the announced price and the listed price.</p>
<p>“We just want a better understanding of why there is a difference in the two reported numbers,” he said.</p>
<p>He noted that the secrecy surrounding the sale and the way it was structured have raised concerns.</p>
<p>“When you’re not transparent, you wonder what’s going on,” he said.</p>
<p>Completed in 2009, the 823,979-square-foot Westinghouse property houses executive offices and research and development and support functions as well as amenities such as a bank branch, a cafeteria and tennis, basketball and volleyball courts.</p>
<p>Since 2007, the property owner has been receiving abatements on township, school district and Butler County real estate taxes as part of a strategic development area created by the state to keep Westinghouse in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>In 2006, officials calculated that the taxes abated amounted to about $1.3 million annually. Mr. Andree has said that figure would have increased over the years but did not have a current number. The Westinghouse property will be back on the tax rolls in 2022.</p>
