<p>The Peduto administration is proposing to eliminate the off-street parking requirement for single-family rowhouses.</p>
<p>Developers are currently required to include one off-street parking space per single-family attached home.</p>
<p>The reason for the proposed zoning code change, which will be introduced during Tuesday’s City Council meeting, is to&nbsp;“increase pedestrian safety and lessen reliance on automobiles,” according to the administration’s announcement Monday.</p>
<p>“This change will enhance what makes many of our historic neighborhoods so special, and it will encourage more people to walk, help people using baby carriages and wheelchairs to navigate sidewalks, and help residents get to know their city and their neighbors by foot,” Mr. Peduto said in a press release Monday.</p>
<p>Examples of new rowhouse-style development can be found in the North Side, South Side and Lawrenceville where there are vacant lots and “a lot of existing rowhouse fabric,” said Andrew Dash, acting director of the city’s Department of Planning.</p>
<p>“What we’re seeing is the city’s parking requirements are forcing a garage condition at the first floor because these are densely packed urban neighborhoods with small lots, where the buildings are right up on the sidewalk,” Mr. Dash said.</p>
<p>On-street parking is then lost to curb cuts for driveways, he said, causing a&nbsp;“privatization of on-street parking.”</p>
<p>The proposal requires several steps, including a report and recommendation from the city’s Planning Commission, a public hearing, and City Council approval.</p>
