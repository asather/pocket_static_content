<h1>Pittsburgh metal on the move: Code Orange at Coachella; Lady Beast and others at Headbangers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh metal bands have big travel plans this year.</p>
<p>Code Orange, which is expected to release the follow-up to 2017’s Grammy-nominated “Forever” in 2020, will make its Coachella debut at the prestigious festival in Indio, Calif. (April 10 and 17). Both of those days are headlined by the reunited Rage Against the Machine.</p>
<p>The hardcore/metal band, formed at Pittsburgh CAPA in 2008, will also play Epicenter 2020 at the Charlotte Motor Speedway in North Carolina (May 1); Welcome to Rockville in Maryland (May 8); and the Sonic Temple Festival in Columbus, Ohio (May 15). All three of those dates are with Metallica headlining.</p>
<p>In the more old-school metal mode, Lady Beast and Icarus Witch will represent Pittsburgh and Ironflame will represent West Virginia at the Headbangers Open Air Festival in Germany on July 23-25. Tom Kiefer of Cinderella, Pentagram and Vicious Rumors are among the marquee bands on those bills.</p>
<p>“It's very difficult for metal bands from the U.S. to get on these [European] fests without the help of a booking agent or a record label,” said Deborah Levine, singer for Lady Beast, which has released its recent albums on European labels.&nbsp;“I just asked and promised we would kick ass and they said yes! We couldn't be more excited to also share the experience with Icarus Witch and Ironflame.”</p>
<p>Lady Beast, which has a new album coming out in March, will host the second annual Metal Immortal Fest at Mr. Smalls in Millvale on June 20.</p>
