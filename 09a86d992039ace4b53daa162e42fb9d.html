<h1>Designers Charlotte Moss and Lisa Fine show how to shelter in peace</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As you spend more time at home these days, you might be realizing an update is in order. Designers Charlotte Moss and Lisa Fine have some ideas for what you can do now to improve your environment and how &nbsp; to think about future design projects.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The two designers were scheduled to give a talk at the Carnegie Museum of Art last month, but it was postponed until next year by COVID-19 restrictions. Ms. Fine planned to discuss her latest book, “Near &amp; Far: Interiors I Love” (Vendome Press, $60), which includes Ms. Moss’ home.</p>
<p>“I am self-quarantined at my house in East Hampton with my husband, Barry, and two dogs,” Ms. Moss said in a phone interview. “We feel very fortunate to be where we are, but we only leave the house to walk the dogs and take a beach walk each week. You cannot be careful enough.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>One thing the pandemic has done is to give people a long sustained look at their interiors. But will this experience have them changing their style?</p>
<p>“I think people will have more time to revisit their personal style and prioritize their needs,” said Ms. Moss. &nbsp;</p>
<p>“If getting cozier with more color and textures is it, great. If paring down is what’s calling you, then do it. The point is this: With time we can reflect on who we are and what we want,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Fine, who is spending the pandemic at her mother’s place in Texas, agreed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think when you spend this much time in your home, you are going to change, no matter what,” she said. “I am not saying you will do something out of your comfort zone, but you might.”</p>
<p>Ms. Fine has an affinity for textile design and layering. Her book, which has examples of&nbsp;classic looks, is a great escape on a rainy spring afternoon.</p>
<p>“I think after this people are going to long for cozy,” she said. “They may not go as colorful and layered as I like, but might choose a more colorful piece of art or lots of fresh flowers.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Her book showcases homes where the owners’ personalities are evident, collections are on display and layers of their lives are seemlessly intertwined with the desgin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I am inspired by people who know how to get that look and not have it look like a junk shop or a souk,” Ms. Fine said. “As much as I like layers, the real talent is when you get the feeling of coziness and lavish yet have it edited down.”</p>
<p>She said the late Lee Radziwill’s apartment, which appears in “Near &amp; Far,” is a perfect example of that.&nbsp;“It is very layered, but it is edited.”</p>
<p>Ultimately, the designer advises to go with what you love.</p>
<p>“Even if it doesn’t look right, you live with it, you move it around. The best houses and the best interiors are interiors that evolve over time,” said Ms. Fine.</p>
<p>So what can people do to improve their environments without leaving the house?</p>
<p>“I know organization doesn’t sound like a ‘design’ project, but when you are organized it gives life so much clarity,” Ms. Moss said. “Start by opening every drawer and closet.”</p>
<p>That seems rather ambitious.</p>
<p>“It sounds a little overwhelming at first, but bit by bit it will get done,” she said.&nbsp; “Trust me, you will be ready to tackle anything after you are energized with this.”</p>
<p>During their talk here, Ms. Moss said she planned to revisit some of her projects “plus classics that continue to inspire and why.” She had several projects underway at her home in Long Island, N.Y., when the pandemic hit.</p>
<p>“We were in the middle of renovating a guest room and bath and our poolhouse,” she explained. &nbsp;“All halted now. What will be will be.”</p>
<p>Ms. Fine is turning to her bookshelves for inspiration.</p>
<p>“Books are the one thing I can buy that will not break the bank and they will always interest me,” she said.</p>
<p>The designer, who believes design blogs are passe, suggests using downtime to browse older blogs online and look for &nbsp;design books.</p>
<p>“Now is a great time to research what you might want to do later. You can read about Georgian architecture or the history of chintz or designer Billy Baldwin.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;To keep her library at her fingertips, Ms. Fine hired a carpenter to build the bookshelves in her New York city apartment. Several years later, a friend suggested they weren’t sturdy enough.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘Lisa, those books are all going to come crashing down.’ The shelves were all drooping under the weight of the books and they had to be rebuilt,” Ms. Fine said, adding that you won’t find objects next the volumes on her shelves.</p>
<p>“For me, bookshelves are for books. I personally don’t like bookshelves used for knickknacks. They are for books.”</p>
