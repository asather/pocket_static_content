<h1>Converse's new shoe line honors Duquesne legend Chuck Cooper</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Converse on Monday debuted a new shoe line paying tribute to a group of groundbreaking NBA players, including Pittsburgh’s Chuck Cooper.</p>
<p>The new <a href="https://theundefeated.com/features/converse-collection-honors-nba-pioneers-chuck-cooper-earl-lloyd-and-nat-clifton/" target="_blank">Breaking Down Barriers</a> collection was revealed on Martin Luther King Day at least partially because it is meant to honor three ballers — Cooper, Earl Lloyd and Nat Clifton — who broke color barriers in professional basketball.</p>
<p>“I always say their stories are little-known history,” Cooper’s son Chuck Cooper III told The Undefeated. “But just as the world knows about the great Jackie Robinson, they should also know about Cooper, Clifton and Lloyd.</p>
<p>“And I truly believe that this collection will go a long way in providing that recognition and appreciation.”</p>
<p>Converse’s new collection will be available on Jan. 23 through the company’s website and at House of Hoops, according to The Undefeated.</p>
<p>Cooper — a Westinghouse High School and Duquesne graduate — became the first black man to be drafted into the NBA on April 25, 1950, when the Boston Celtics selected him 13th overall in that year’s draft.</p>
<p>Clifton was the first black NBA player to sign an NBA contract when he did so with the New York Knicks that same year, and when Lloyd suited up for the Washington Capitols on Oct. 31, 1950, he became the first black person to play in an NBA game.</p>
<p>Cooper was inducted into the Basketball Hall of Fame in September 2019, four years after his death at the age of 86.</p>
<p>“Just from a community standpoint, my father was somebody who worked tremendously hard for people of all races in the community, particularly African Americans,” Cooper III told the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/gene-collier/2019/09/01/Chuck-Cooper-Hall-of-Fame-Cooper-Foundation-NBA-Larry-Bird/stories/201909010089" target="_blank">Post-Gazette’s Gene Collier</a> on Sept. 1, 2019. “What he really believed in was the importance of education, community service, and leadership, and he really did that by example.”</p>
<p>In addition, Cooper will also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/duquesne/2018/10/23/duquesne-palumbo-center-renovations-chuck-cooper-nba-upmc/stories/201810230107" target="_blank">be the namesake</a> of the newly renovated UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse — formerly the A.J. Palumbo Center — which will serve as the home venue for Duquesne’s basketball team.</p>
<p>“We felt like in Pittsburgh, if there’s an underrated name and an unknown name that needed to be out there, it was Chuck Cooper’s,” Duquesne athletic director Dave Harper told the Post-Gazette in October 2018.</p>
<p>“And when people hear the story, I think obviously it will resonate that this is the well-deserved recognition that he should have.”</p>
