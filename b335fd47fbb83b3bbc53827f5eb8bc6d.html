<h1>Trump breaks with Fauci on need for more testing as he spotlights heat, sunlight</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>President Donald Trump blatantly broke with Dr. Anthony Fauci on Thursday, claiming he doesn’t “agree” with the health expert’s assessment that the U.S. needs to greatly expand its coronavirus testing capacities.</p>
<p>At the same time, Trump and Pence made international headlines for promoting new lab results suggesting heat and sunlight slow the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>Speaking at his daily COVID-19 briefing at the White House, Trump dubiously maintained the U.S. has “tested far more than anyone else anywhere in the world” when asked about Fauci’s assertion in a just-published interview that testing actually needs to be “significantly” ramped up.</p>
<p>Pressed to respond directly to Fauci’s remarks, Trump added, “I don’t agree with him, if he said that.”</p>
<p>Fauci, a senior member of Trump’s coronavirus task force and the nation’s top infectious disease expert, did not attend the Thursday briefing.</p>
<p>Trump has experienced a rocky relationship with Fauci since he joined the White House coronavirus task force. Earlier this month, Trump even retweeted a post calling for the doctor’s firing.</p>
<p>The president’s insistence that the U.S. has performed “far more” tests than other countries is misleading.</p>
<p>While it has carried the largest number of tests, the U.S. lags behind several other countries on a per capita basis, including Germany and South Korea.</p>
<p>Considering the U.S. has more than 300 million residents, the per capita figure carries far greater importance than the individual number of tests, according to health experts.</p>
<p>The White House COVID-19 task force said the U.S. had performed roughly 5 million tests as of Thursday evening — accounting for less than 2% of the total population.</p>
<p>In an interview with TIME Magazine published Thursday, Fauci addressed the country’s testing disparities and said far more needs to be done.</p>
<p>“We need to significantly ramp up not only the number of tests, but the capacity to perform them, so that you don’t have a situation where you have a test but it can’t be done because there isn’t a swab, or because there isn’t extraction media, or not the right vial,” Fauci said.</p>
<p>“I am not overly confident right now at all that we have what it takes to do that. We are doing better, and I think we are going to get there, but we are not there yet.”</p>
<p>Fauci and other medical experts say the U.S. needs to perform at least 4 million tests every week before the nation’s economy can be safely reopened. At the moment, the U.S. only performs about 1 million tests per week.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Trump kept claiming the U.S. is outdoing itself during Thursday’s briefing, as the nation’s coronavirus death toll neared 50,000.</p>
<p>“As you know, we are very advanced on testing,” the president said. “Other countries are calling us to find out what we are doing.”</p>
<p>Also during Thursday’s task-force press briefing,&nbsp;Trump and Vice President Mike Pence showcased emerging laboratory evidence on Wednesday that suggest the spread of the novel coronavirus may ebb during the upcoming summer months, owing to how the virus interacts with ultraviolet light as well as heat and humidity.</p>
<p>The acting undersecretary for science and technology at the Homeland Security Department, William Bryan, detailed recent lab studies carried out by the agency at the U.S. Army’s high biosecurity laboratory at Ft. Detrick, Md.</p>
<p>The results, which have not been peer reviewed but were briefed to the press and on live television via slides, largely match other laboratory studies and the suspicions of some researchers by showing that the novel coronavirus, like many other viruses, does not survive as long on certain surfaces when exposed to high amounts of ultraviolet light and warm and humid conditions.</p>
<p>The laboratory results show that increases in temperature, humidity and sunlight can all speed up how fast the virus is destroyed, based on measurements of its half-life when exposed to these elements.</p>
<p>Trump said the results vindicate him for his much-criticized suggestions that the virus would ebb with the arrival of warm weather. “I just threw it out as a suggestion, but it seems like that’s the case, because when it’s on a surface, that would last for a long time. When that surface is outside, it goes very quickly. It dies very quickly with the sun,” Trump said.</p>
<p>The president asked coronavirus task force coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx "to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could."</p>
<p>Trump then asked Birx if she "ever heard of the heat and the light" having an impact on viruses. She responded, "Not as a treatment," before Trump asked her again to look into it.</p>
<p>Later, Trump again directed Birx to look into the potential for sunlight to be a cure.</p>
<p>"I would like you to speak to the medical doctors to see if there's any way that you can apply light and heat to cure, you know, if you could. And maybe you can, maybe you can't."</p>
<p>Trump said he’s not giving people advice to go outside in order to stay free from the virus, but said, “I hope people enjoy the sun, and if it has an impact that’s great.”</p>
