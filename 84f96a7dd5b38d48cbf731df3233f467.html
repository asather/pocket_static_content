<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">The Penguins added some forward depth to their organization on Wednesday, signing Czech forward Radim Zohorna to a one-year, two-way contract.</span></p>
<p>The 6-foot-6, 233-pound forward played the last six seasons Czech Republic’s top professional league, the Czech Extraliga. Twice the 24-year-old helped his team win the Czech Extraliga championship.</p>
<p>“Radim is a smart player with good hockey sense that uses his big size to his advantage,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “His ability to play all three forward positions will help provide depth to our forward group.”</p>
<p>Zohorna, who went undrafted in the NHL, made his professional debut in 2014-15 as an 18-year-old. The left-shooting forward has recorded 55 points (28 goals, 27 assists) in 173 career Extraliga games. He’s also tallied 12 points (seven goals, five assists) in 30 career playoff games.</p>
<p>This past season, Zohorna appeared in 56 games for BK Mlada Boleslav, setting career highs in goals (10), assists (12) and points (22).</p>
<p>Zohorna has two older brothers, Thomas and Hynek, who play in the KHL. Thomas and Hynek were teammates with current Penguin Dominik Simon, on Team Czech Republic at the 2019 IIHF World Championship.</p>
