<h1>Trump defends Iranian general's killing, targets usual suspects at rally in Toledo</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>TOLEDO, Ohio — In his first Ohio campaign rally in 2020, President Donald Trump defended killing an Iranian general, pointed fingers at the “fake news” media, mocked his political opponents, and talked up the state’s economy — all while supporters in a packed Huntington Center cheered “USA! USA!”</p>
<p>It was a scene that wasn’t all too different from other Trump campaign rallies, except for the location.</p>
<p>“We take good care of our auto workers in Toledo, home of the Jeep. How good is Jeep?” Mr. Trump said, from the center of the arena, home to the Toledo Walleye and host to concerts and other community events.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump spoke for nearly 90 minutes in his first trip to the Glass City since the 2016 election and his 15th appearance in Ohio since assuming office.</p>
<p>“You have this army tank plant in Lima,” he said, talking about the Joint Systems Manufacturing Center in Lima, Ohio, the nation’s last manufacturer of U.S. Army battle tanks, where increased defense spending under Mr. Trump has increased hiring and production. “They’re the best in the world.”</p>
<p>While some observers believe Mr. Trump enters 2020 with a good chance of winning re-election in the state, the President can’t really afford to lose Ohio’s 18 electoral votes in his re-election bid.</p>
<p>“All roads to the White House run through Ohio,” the President’s daughter-in-law Lara Trump, a senior campaign adviser, said Wednesday in Columbus.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump carried battleground Ohio by 8 points over Democrat Hillary Clinton, and flipped nine “pivot” counties that twice voted for President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In July, 2016, at the Huntington Center, Mr. Trump, one of three Toledo rallies before the election, railed against trade agreements that sent jobs overseas and promised to build a wall at the southern border. While only 100 miles of the border wall was refurbished in 2019 — the use of Defense Department funds to build the wall is being decided in court — the U.S. House passed his renegotiated North American free trade pact, the USMCA, with Democratic support.</p>
<p>“These companies would leave and go to Mexico, go to Canada. They’re all coming back and many are coming right here to Ohio,” he said.</p>
<p>While Mr. Trump touted the strength of the economy, low unemployment and stock market highs, Democrats have a painted a different picture of an Ohio economy that is on track to lose jobs for the first time in a decade, including thousands in manufacturing.</p>
<p>“Those job losses matter,” Ohio Democratic Party Chairman David Pepper said during a new conference at Promenade Park. “He’s broken those promises and Ohioans are paying the price.”</p>
<p>In the lead-up to the 2020 election, Democrats are focusing on swing suburbs that trended the opposite direction of the state as a whole in 2016. They believe there’s an opportunity to bring educated women disillusioned with the president into the party — a campaign strategy they highlighted at the October Democratic presidential debate in Westerville, a blue-trending Columbus suburb.</p>
<p>Also joining Mr. Trump on stage in Toledo was Vice President Mike Pence, who spoke first about the simmering tensions in the Middle East.</p>
<p>“It’s been three years of action. It’s been three years of results. It’s been three years of promises made, promises kept — and we’re just getting started, Ohio,” Mr. Pence said.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump and Mr. Pence landed at Toledo Express Airport in their respective airplanes — Air Force One and Air Force Two — and were greeted by Secretary of State Frank LaRose; Mr. Trump’s Ohio campaign director, Bob Paduchik; John Robinson Block, publisher and editor-in-chief of The Blade; Block Communications Inc. Chairman Allan Block, and Allan Block’s wife, Susan, a member of Block Communications’ board of directors.</p>
<p>The rally came a day after the President addressed the nation regarding Iran’s ballistic missile launch targeting two U.S. military bases in Iraq, which Iranian leaders said was in retaliation for the United States’ killing of its top military commander, Gen. Qassem Soleimani.</p>
<p>“He was a bad guy. He was a blood-thirsty terror, and he’s no longer a terror, he’s dead,” Mr. Trump said to massive applause from the 8,000-plus crowd at the arena.</p>
<p>Less than a month from the Democrats’ first nominating contest in Iowa, Mr. Trump took shots at the party’s front-runners, former Vice President Joe Biden, Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg of Indiana.</p>
<p>While 12 Democrats are competing in Ohio’s March 17 primary, Mr. Trump has the ballot to himself here.</p>
<p>The most recent polling in Ohio was last summer, showing Mr. Biden, who leads the Democratic field in national polls, beating Mr. Trump in a head-to-head matchup.</p>
<p>“It’s like watching death,” Mr. Trump said of the Democratic debates. “You gotta sit through those things for two, three hours. You gotta be real committed to the country to do that.”</p>
