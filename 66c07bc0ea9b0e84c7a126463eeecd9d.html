<h1>Pirates release 39 players from minor league contracts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates on Wednesday released 39 players from their minor league contracts, though the moves were largely expected. The players will be paid through June, while they will also receive full benefits.</p>
<p>One notable name was pitcher Luis Escobar, who made his MLB debut in 2019. Things didn’t work out well for Escobar, a 24-year-old right-hander, and he wound up with a 7.94 ERA.</p>
<p>Another was Jake Elmore, a 32-year-old utility man who spent some time with the big club in 2019. Elmore was 1-for-21 over his first 12 games before finishing with nine hits in his final 26 at-bats (.346 average).</p>
<p>Both illustrate why these moves were made.</p>
<p>The Pirates cut these guys because either they weren’t in the club’s future plans or to allow them to pursue opportunities&nbsp;where maybe they could play a little more.</p>
<p>Chances are the Pirates weren’t going to allocate a ton of at-bats to Elmore in Class AAA, the same for Escobar innings out of the bullpen. Those opportunities are likely better used on guys they’re trying to develop and eventually bring up to the big club.</p>
<p>“We’ve wanted to be as thoughtful as we can, especially with a new GM and trying to learn as much as I can about the player group that we have,” general manager Ben Cherington said on June 3. “It all comes back to the best information we have about looking forward to next year. Our feeling and I think the feeling of other teams has been that if we truly cannot see opportunity next year for a minor league player, we are not necessarily helping them by extending the relationship, if it’s that clear.”</p>
