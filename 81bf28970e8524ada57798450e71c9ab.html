<h1>Pirates on pause: Where can defensive improvements come from in 2020?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>With MLB hoping to return soon, the Post-Gazette’s Jason Mackey and Mike Persak will analyze 20 issues related to the Pirates — think 20 Thoughts or questions about the team. They’ll run each weekday online through May 22 and will appear in print (or via other PG digital platforms) on Sunday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When it comes to the Pirates’ defense, there are at least two kernels of good news: There’s pretty much nowhere to go but up, and the new regime seems to grasp the fact that Pittsburgh was defensively deficient in 2019.</p>
<p>While the Pirates were criticized for their primary offseason additions of Jarrod Dyson, Guillermo Heredia and Luke Maile, new general manager Ben Cherington was operating with a specific purpose, to ensure the Pirates don’t give away as many runs.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Generally we need to improve defensively as a team,” Cherington said back in February. “It was a priority to improve our team defense overall. Hopefully the additions help in some way toward that.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">How badly those improvements are needed and where they might come from are two separate-but-intertwined questions facing the Pirates in Derek Shelton’s first season as manager.</span></p>
<p>Playing better defense is hardly a sexy topic, but it is important. It can also come cheap, which is the opposite of home runs and why this sort of thing should matter to the Pirates.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Pittsburgh in 2013 was one of the better defensive teams in baseball, hence why the Pirates were finally able to make the playoffs and end the longest consecutive stretch of losing seasons in North American pro sports history.</span></p>
<p>According to Fangraphs, the Pirates accounted for 45 Defensive Runs Saved (DRS) in 2013, which was good enough for third in MLB. They’d finish sixth each of the next two years. But in 2019, the Pirates combined for minus-46 DRS, six spots from the bottom.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">A couple things, obviously, but one of the most glaring differences occurred in the outfield. In 2013, Starling Marte, Andrew McCutchen and Travis Snider (the right fielder with the most innings logged) combined for 19 DRS. Last summer, Marte, Reynolds and Melky Cabrera (using the same criteria), produced a total of minus-17.</span></p>
<p>Cherington talked during spring training about how he’s actually relatively happy with the defensive positioning model the Pirates have in place, which could calibrate the problem to include execution of defensive plays, assuming players are in the proper position when those opportunities arise.</p>
<p>“We feel like the work that has been done on positioning with the Pirates in the past has been pretty good,” Cherington said. “We’re in a pretty strong spot. The focus will more be on helping guys get the most out of their ability as defenders through coaching, and hopefully some of the additions will add to that, too.”</p>
<p>The defensive improvements the Pirates sought this offseason flew under the radar for understandable reasons. Their fans wanted them to spend more, and nothing here is presented to invalidate that concern. However, the group does offer some interesting opportunities to get better:</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• Dyson has been worth 52 DRS since 2016, the fourth-most among all MLB outfielders during that time behind Mookie Betts (94), Kevin Kiermaier (73) and Lorenzo Cain (55). His Ultimate Zone Rating (UZR) — an advanced metric similar to DRS — of 36.1 was third.</span></p>
<p>If you don’t understand any of that, or don’t care, make sure you know this: Marte finished 38th and 50th in those two categories, meaning Cherington might’ve actually upgraded his defense here.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">• Baseball Prospectus does a solid job quantifying catchers’ performance and had Maile 16th and 13th in Adjusted Fielding Runs Above Average in 2019 and 2018, respectively. As far as Defensive Runs Saved, Maile (21) has accounted for more than twice as many as Francisco Cervelli (10) since 2015.</span></p>
<p>• Heredia’s three DRS in 2019 isn’t a huge number, but it was a heck of a lot better than Melky Cabrera, who contributed&nbsp;minus-15 Defensive Runs Saved in 2019 and a total of minus-42 over the past three seasons combined.</p>
<p>“I take pride in defense” Dyson said. “Like more than anything.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I know I can really play on the defensive end, but I’ve got a lot more to offer than my numbers indicate on the offensive front,” added Maile, who hit just .151 in 2019.</span></p>
<p>There are things returning Pirates can improve upon, as well. Josh Bell has adjusted his throwing motion, trying to perfect a three-quarters delivery. Colin Moran has focused more on his defensive positioning and first-step quickness. Pitch-to-pitch readiness&nbsp;has been on Kevin Newman’s mind.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The biggest question mark of any returning player entering 2020 might be that of Gregory Polanco — and not just whether his balky shoulder will cooperate. Back in 2015, Polanco was actually a fairly reliable outfielder; his mark of 11 DRS trailed only Marte (21), while Polanco actually had a better UZR (8.3 to 7.8).</span></p>
<p>To put that in simple terms: He actually looked like he had played right field before, which would be a welcomed sight at PNC Park this summer.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">So, too, would a better job throwing the baseball from all Pirates players, not just Bell.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Maile, who’s thrown out 28 of 83 would-be base-stealers (33.7%) the past two years, looked terrific in this department during spring training. Pittsburgh’s starting catcher, Jacob Stallings, is also an above-average thrower.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Replacing Marte’s arm will be a challenge. He has an MLB-high 44 assists over the past four seasons, although Dyson isn’t far behind with 36; only four, including Marte, have more.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">But for the Pirates to truly take a step forward defensively, they most of all need to translate what has happened thus far this spring into games.</span></p>
<p>“People probably get tired of hearing [about improvement] until you get better, so I’m looking forward to getting better,” Moran said. “Obviously it’s a production league. You can work on whatever you want, but at the end of the day, you have to produce.”</p>
<p><strong>STATISTICALLY SPEAKING:</strong> After finishing third, sixth and sixth from 2013-15, respectively, the Pirates have been 22nd or worse in three of the past four years when it comes to Fangraphs’ mark of Defensive Runs Saved (DRS).</p>
<p><strong>KNOW THIS:</strong> The Pirates shifted 1,910 times in 2019, an average of 30.2% of all plate appearances by their opponents and the 10th-most in baseball. The MLB average last season was 25.6%.</p>
<p><strong>HE SAID IT:</strong> “I tell myself if I can stop my pitcher from making one extra pitch that can get him to the next inning, I’m all for that. That’s how I play defense. I want the ball to come to me.” — Dyson on helping out his pitchers.</p>
