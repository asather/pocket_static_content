<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>NEW YORK — Four cast members are not returning for another season of Bravo’s “Vanderpump Rules” — two over their racist social media posts, and the others after they racially profiled a coworker.</p>
<p>Bravo released a statement Tuesday confirming that Stassi Schroeder, Kristen Doute, Max Boyens and Brett Caprioni would not return to the reality series, which will air its final episode of season eight next week.</p>
<p>The show follows the personal lives of current and former employees of former “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” star Lisa Vanderpump’s Los Angeles restaurants.</p>
<p>It was revealed last week on a podcast that Schroeder and Doute had reported a former African American coworker, Faith Stowers, for a crime she had nothing to do with. Stowers appeared on two seasons of “Vanderpump.”</p>
<p>“It was a weird photo, so she looked very light-skinned and had these different, weird tattoos,” Stowers said on Instagram Live. “They showcased her, and I guess this woman was robbing people. And they called the cops and said it was me. This is like, a true story. I heard this from actually Stassi during an interview.”</p>
<p>Boyens and Caprioni were let go over past tweets that contained racial slurs.</p>
<p>Schroeder and Doute, who have been main cast members on the show since its 2013 debut, have apologized on social media.</p>
<p>“My emotions over something that happened between our friends outweighed my logic, and there is no excuse for that,” Schroeder, 31, said in an Instagram statement. “I did not realize the serious ramifications that could have transpired because of my actions.”</p>
<p>Doute, 37, said on Twitter: “Although my actions were not racially driven, I am now completely aware of how my privilege blinded me from the reality of law enforcement’s treatment of the black community, and how dangerous my actions could have been to her.”</p>
<p>Boyens and Caprioni, who are new to the series, apologized on last week’s reunion episode of “Vanderpump Rules.”</p>
<p>Vanderpump appeared on nine seasons of “Real Housewives of Beverly Hills” and left that series last year.</p>
