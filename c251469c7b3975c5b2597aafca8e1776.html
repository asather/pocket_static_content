<h1>Developers wanted: Consultant to help forge the future of Hazelwood Green</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A consultant that has been serving in an advisory capacity in the redevelopment of the former LTV Coke Works in Hazelwood is now in line to take a lead role in building out the 178-acre riverfront site.</p>
<p>U3 Advisors has been selected by the Almono partnership, the owner of the tract, to take over for the ReMake Group, which will be ending its involvement with the development at the end of the month.</p>
<p>In a statement, the partnership confirmed that U3 Advisors, based in New York and Philadelphia, “has been engaged to advise on matters relating to Hazelwood Green site management, tenanting, and site-wide development strategies.”</p>
<p>The goal is to help spur more activity on the sprawling tract, considered one of the premier development sites in the Pittsburgh region.</p>
<p>ReMake’s contract was set to expire at the end of the year. It was extended through the end of January “for transition purposes,” said Rebecca Flora, ReMake Group principal.</p>
<p>In November, the Almono partnership — made up of the Heinz Endowments, the Richard King Mellon Foundation and the Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation — announced that it would be looking for a firm to take over for ReMake as the focus shifted “principally to marketing, promotion and development.”</p>
<p>At the time, a Heinz Endowments spokesman said U3 Advisors was “in the mix” for that role.</p>
<p>The company has worked with universities, medical centers, nonprofits, and civic stakeholders on development. Its website states that it aspires “to create desirable, vibrant, and sustainable places and communities that in turn promote empathy, economic development and inclusion.”</p>
<p>Those ideals appear to mesh with those of the Almono partnership, which is seeking to make Hazelwood Green the most sustainable development in the region. The partnership also has emphasized the need to connect the site to the surrounding neighborhood.</p>
<p>U3 Advisors will have work to do in the new role.</p>
<p>Beyond the Mill 19 operation —&nbsp;a 265,000-square-foot complex built from the bones of an old coke works structure by the Regional Industrial Development Corp. — there has not been much activity at the site.</p>
<p>Uber Technologies currently leases 50 acres at Hazelwood Green, where it has a test track for its self-driving cars. But that lease expires in 2023, and Uber does not intend to renew it. Instead, it plans to build another test track on nearly 600 acres of land in Findlay purchased for $9.5 million last month.</p>
<p>At Mill 19, the first building erected by RIDC as part of the complex houses Carnegie Mellon University’s Advanced Robotics for Manufacturing Institute and its Manufacturing Futures Initiative. Catalyst Connection also has moved into the building.</p>
<p>This spring, autonomous vehicle start-up Aptiv will be moving into a second building, about 70,000 square feet in size, within Mill 19. It will be taking all of the space in that structure. A third building is being designed, but construction probably won’t start until RIDC has a signed tenant, president Don Smith said.</p>
<p>ReMake took charge of the overall development in 2016 from RIDC, which had been involved in talking to potential tenants and overseeing work at the site before moving on to Mill 19.</p>
<p>During its time at the helm, ReMake was responsible for putting the key infrastructure in place, including a main boulevard that winds through the tract. A $5.7 million public plaza, which is to include lawns, rain gardens, trees and a water feature, currently is under construction and is scheduled to be completed by end of summer.</p>
<p>It also was instrumental in crafting a preliminary land development plan and master plan for the property, engaging the community in that effort. In November, Ms. Flora said all of the pieces were in place “to accept vertical development and building.”</p>
<p><strong>U3 Advisors’ resume</strong></p>
<p>According to its website, U3 Advisors was formed in 2014 through a merger of U3 Ventures and K. Backus &amp; Associates, both of which were real estate and economic development consultants whose clients included universities, nonprofit organizations, and other “anchor institutions.”</p>
<p>“We are uniquely positioned to help our clients leverage their assets, implement complex real estate projects and deploy existing demand in support of institutional and community goals.,” it stated.</p>
<p>U3 Advisors has worked on projects with a number of universities, including Yale, Columbia, New York University, Amherst College, Arizona State, Case Western Reserve, and the University of Chicago.</p>
<p>It also helped to develop a strategic plan for Brooklyn Public Library’s 58 branches, created a place-based economic development strategy for midtown Detroit, and worked with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation on the redevelopment of its current location in Manhattan.</p>
<p>In addition to New York and Philadelphia, it has an office in Boston.</p>
