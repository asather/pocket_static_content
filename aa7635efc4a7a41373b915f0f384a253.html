<p>RICHMOND, Va. -- News outlets report demonstrators in Richmond tore down another Confederate statue in the city Tuesday night.</p>
<p>The Howitzers Monument located near Virginia Commonwealth University’s Monroe Park campus was toppled after protesters who spent the night marching in the rain used a rope to pull it down from its pedestal.</p>
<p>A video from the Richmond Times-Dispatch shows the paint-splattered statue face down on the ground as the rain continued overnight in Virginia’s capital city.</p>
<p>It’s the third Confederate statue, and the fourth monument, to be torn down by demonstrators in Virginia since international protests erupted following the death of George Floyd by a white Minneapolis police officer who pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck.</p>
<p>Statues of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, Confederate Gen. Williams Carter Wickham as well as Christopher Columbus were toppled by demonstrators in recent weeks.</p>
<p>The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported protesters in Richmond started their march Tuesday night advocating for the removal of all Confederate statues, establishing a civilian review board over police actions and defunding the police, among other things.</p>
<p>Before its toppling, the Howitzers Monument showed a Confederate artilleryman standing in front of a gun. It was erected in 1892 to memorialize the city’s Civil War artillery unit, according to the Encyclopedia of Virginia.</p>
