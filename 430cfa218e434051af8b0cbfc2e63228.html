<h1>No COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County, but health department urges caution</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There are still no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Allegheny County, the county health department tweeted in a Saturday afternoon update.</p>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department is not providing information as to how many county residents have been tested or are in quarantine, said Ryan Scarpino, health department spokesman.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The health department noted that there are at least 340 confirmed cases and 14 deaths nationwide and urged residents to take precautions to stop the spread of germs, such as washing hands with soap and staying home if sick with respiratory symptoms.</p>
<p>Two North Side men, Frank Tallarico and his husband Kyle Cunningham, were passengers on the Grand Princess cruise ship last month and began showing what they feared was symptoms of the COVID-19 virus after arriving back in Pittsburgh. They were tested by the Allegheny County Health Department Wednesday.</p>
<p>Through the glass front door of his Manchester home Thursday evening, Mr. Tallarico said the test results came back negative. He and his husband are still under quarantine, and Mr. Tallarico declined to speak further.</p>
<p>A second set of samples from Mr. Tallarico and Mr. Cunningham needed to be processed by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta before the couple are released from quarantine.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf confirmed the first two cases of COVID-19 on Friday, one in Delaware County and one in Wayne County.</p>
