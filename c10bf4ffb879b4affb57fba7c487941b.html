<h1>For the most vulnerable moms, a chance to connect with family</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Celebrating Mother’s Day has been made more difficult by the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for elderly mothers living in nursing and assisted-living homes.</p>
<p>To help families celebrate, the Charles Morris Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, located at the the Jewish Association of Aging campus in Squirrel Hill, organized&nbsp;“window visits” on Sunday with&nbsp;“some extra love and very careful planning.”</p>
<p>With mom sitting on one side of a plexiglass window and family members on the other side, Mother’s Day was celebrated, albeit unconventionally.</p>
<p>“We recognize it has been a long time since our families last visited with their moms, grandmothers, step-mothers, aunts, etc.,” the center said in a press release. “Due to the vulnerability of our nursing home residents, the opportunity to visit in person is a carefully structured event to assure the safety for our residents, our staff, and visiting families.”</p>
<p>The visits were by appointment only, with each visit lasting about 20 minutes.</p>
