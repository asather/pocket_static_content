<h1>Boys basketball rankings: Highlands back at No. 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>&nbsp;The Highlands and Knoch boys basketball teams switched spots in this week’s Post-Gazette rankings. Now Highlands is back at No. 1.</p>
<p>Highlands is ranked first in WPIAL Class 4A. The Rams were at the top for a few weeks but dropped down after a loss to Knoch on Jan. 7. In last week’s rankings, Knoch was No. 1, Uniontown No. 2 and Highlands No. 3. But Highlands beat Knoch, 72-65, on Tuesday.</p>
<p>Uniontown might have been the new No. 1 team after Highlands defeated Knoch. But Uniontown lost to Laurel Highlands, 62-54, on Wednesday and stayed at No. 2.</p>
<p>If both Highlands and Knoch win their final two Section 1 games, they will tie for the section title. It would be the third consecutive year that Highlands tied for a section championship. Knoch and Highlands tied last year while Highlands tied Franklin Regional in 2018.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the rankings, Upper St. Clair jumped up to No. 4 in Class 6A while Pine-Richland fell one spot to No. 5.</p>
<p>Shenango moved into the Class 2A rankings at No. 5 while Greensburg Central Catholic moved into No. 5 in Class 1A.</p>
