<h1>Pirates call up right-hander Tyler Bashlor, option Cody Ponce to Altoona</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Earlier this month, when talking about the bevy of injuries the Pirates’ pitching staff has suffered this season, general manager Ben Cherington mentioned that they would be looking to add some help from outside the organization.</p>
<p>The Pirates have done just that. In fact, even before Cherington said so, they acquired right-handed reliever Tyler Bashlor from the New York Mets, trading away cash considerations to do so. Since, they appeared to sign right-hander Henderson Alvarez (though that transaction <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/08/17/Pirates-Henderson-Alvarez-Gustave/stories/202008170060" target="_blank">has apparently fallen through</a>), claimed right-hander Nick Tropeano off waivers from the New York Yankees and signed righty Jandel Gustave out of the independent league once the Alvarez signing was not completed.</p>
<p>The problem, as Cherington alluded to in that same press conference, is that in 2020 it has and will take longer for pitchers from the outside to get ready to actually pitch in major league games. They must clear testing protocols and re-acclimate their arms after doing so.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, 16 days after initially trading for him, Bashlor became the first of the newly acquired pitchers to join the big-league roster. The Pirates announced that Bashlor had been called up from the alternate training site in Altoona, while reliever Cody Ponce had been optioned back to Altoona to make room on the roster.</p>
<p>Whenever Bashlor gets into a game for the Pirates, it will be his first live action of the 2020 season. He didn’t make an appearance for the Mets this year before being traded. He did, however, make 48 appearances for the Mets over the last two seasons, accruing a 5.33 ERA and striking out 45 batters over 54 innings of work.</p>
<p>Ponce made his major league debut this season against the Chicago Cubs on Aug. 2. In that outing, he appeared in the bottom of the 11th inning, faced two batters and allowed a walk-off single from Javier Baez. He then pitched one more time against the Minnesota Twins, throwing three innings and giving up two solo home runs and a walk over that span.</p>
<p>Through this injury-riddled 2020 season, the bullpen has been a revolving door. Entering Tuesday, they had used 21 players in relief roles, including backup catcher John Ryan Murphy at one point. Bashlor will be the 22nd. That’s mainly because of six of the Pirates’ relievers, plus starters Joe Musgrove and Mitch Keller, have all spent time on the injured list. Three of them, right-handers Nick Burdi, Michael Feliz and Clay Holmes, won’t be back this season.</p>
<p>So the Pirates have called up players, like reliever Nick Mears, to pitch just a few innings before calling up another fresh arm shortly after. They’ve had to use relievers in spot starts. They’ve had to split up their piggyback starters Chad Kuhl and Steven Brault. And, as Cherington said, they’ve had to look for outside help.</p>
<p>Until Tuesday, that help had been acquired, but it hadn’t yet arrived. Now, Bashlor joins the Pirates with a chance to help solidify what has been an embattled bullpen to this point.</p>
