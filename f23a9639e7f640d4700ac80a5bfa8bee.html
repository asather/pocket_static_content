<h1>Decades after 'Batman Returns,' possible for Pittsburgh native Michael Keaton to 'return' again as Batman?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh’s Michael Keaton likes to keep a low profile, but could he be… Batman?</p>
<p>The Hollywood Reporter and The Wrap have Keaton pegged as possibly returning to the Warner Bros. D.C. universe as an older, mentoring Batman. Keaton starred in two Tim Burton films as the Caped Crusader, 1989’s&nbsp;“Batman” and 1992’s&nbsp;“Batman Returns.”</p>
<p>He would not star in a “Batman” movie per se, but possibly be part of the upcoming&nbsp;“The Flash,” which stars Ezra Miller (“The Perks of Being a Wallflower”). Andy Muschietti (“It”) directs.</p>
<p>This is reportedly not a one-shot deal, but Bruce Wayne might be a crossover character, a la Samuel L. Jackson’s Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.</p>
<p>Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, there is no official word on Keaton’s participation. He was, however,&nbsp;announced last week as one of the stars of&nbsp;“Dopesick,” an eight-part series slated to run on Hulu.</p>
