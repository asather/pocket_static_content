<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Joseph Hall was named Monday as the new executive director of the <a href="https://kelly-strayhorn.org/" target="_blank">Kelly Strayhorn Theater</a> in East Liberty. He will replace Janera Solomon,<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/theater-dance/2019/08/02/Kelly-Strayhorn-Theater-Janera-Solomon-resigns-executive-director-Pittsburgh/stories/201908020086" target="_blank"> who left KST after serving in the position for 11 years</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Hall worked with KST from 2009 to 2014, beginning as an intern and rising through the ranks to producing director of&nbsp;the 106-year-old theater.&nbsp;During his tenure, he co-curated and managed original programming, including mainstage performances, residencies, venue rentals, workshops and classes.</p>
<p>More recently, he was the deputy director of BAAD! The Bronx Academy of Arts and Dance, a 20-year-old organization in New York City founded by writer and LGBTQ activist Charles Rice-Gonzalez and Arthur Aviles, a former Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Co. member. During Mr. Hall’s five years there, he’s credited with tripling the organization’s budget, growing its administrative and production staff, expanding programming and initiating new local and national partnerships for touring opportunities.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>“He was unanimously selected by the search committee and board as the right leader for the next stage of Kelly Strayhorn’s growth,” board chair Yvonne Campos said in a prepared statement. “We are thrilled to have Joseph lead the theater and we look forward to him applying his expertise, experience and knowledge to continue to expand the impact of the organization.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hall is no stranger to Pittsburgh’s dance and arts community. He co-founded with choreographer Staycee Pearl the Pearl Diving Movement Residency, a month-long local program for national and local artists to develop new multimedia work. He’s also co-curator of TQ Live!, a performance series that celebrates the work of artists from the LGBTQIA community at The Andy Warhol Museum on the North Side. As an artist and performer, Mr. Hall has collaborated with choreographers, dancers and video artists in Pittsburgh and across the country.</p>
<p>“The experience and global network that I’ve gained by working in New York City, combined with my ongoing relationships with Pittsburgh’s arts and foundation communities, has uniquely prepared me for this role,” he said in a prepared statement. “I see Kelly Strayhorn Theater as a beacon of contemporary practices and a community convener that leads boldly toward equity and holistic innovation, from operations to public programs. For the city of Pittsburgh and beyond, I want to ensure that Kelly Strayhorn Theater remains an East Liberty treasure.”</p>
