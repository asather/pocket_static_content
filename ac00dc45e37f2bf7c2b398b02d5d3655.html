He’ll be in Oakland for Pitt’s spring semester starting Jan. 6, the report indicated.</p><p>Yellen must sit out the 2020 season and will be eligible for the 2021 campaign as a redshirt sophomore, setting up a post-Kenny Pickett quarterback competition.</p><p>The 6-3, 210-pound Yellen was a true freshman last season and played in only one game for the Sun Devils, a <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/boxscore?gameId=401114160" target="_blank">31-26 loss</a> to USC. He <a href="https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/players/joey-yellen-1.html" target="_blank">performed admirably</a> though, going 28-of-44 (63.6%) for 292 yards, four touchdowns and two interceptions.</p><p>Yellen is leaving Arizona State after<a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaaf/pac12/2019/08/13/arizona-state-quarterback-jayden-daniels-start-true-freshman/1997083001/" target="_blank"> losing a battle</a> for that program’s starting quarterback role to fellow freshman Jayden Daniels.</p><p>He was a highly touted recruit coming out of California’s Mission Viejo High School. Rivals <a href="https://n.rivals.com/content/prospects/2019/joey-yellen-217224#school-interests" target="_blank">rated Yellen</a> as a three-star prospect, while 247 Sports <a href="https://247sports.com/Player/Joey-Yellen-46049554/" target="_blank">had him</a> at four stars. He turned down offers from Georgia, Oregon State, Boise State and Washington State (among others) to play for Herm Edwards in Tempe, Ariz.</p><p>Yellen will join a football program that currently has three scholarship quarterbacks on its roster: Pickett, Nick Patti and Davis Beville. Pickett was the starter last season and is the presumed lead signal-caller going forward. Meanwhile, Patti enters 2020 as a rising redshirt junior, and Beville will be a redshirt freshman.</p><p>Pitt raised eyebrows when it <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2019/12/18/Pitt-football-2020-signing-day-recruiting-Dayon-Hayes-Jahvante-Royal-Bangally-Kamara-Aydin-Henningham-Tate-Rodemaker/stories/201912180139" target="_blank">didn’t sign a high school quarterback</a> to its 2020 recruiting class. Yellen will provide, if nothing else, depth at a position the Panthers definitely need to address after Pickett’s final season of eligibility next year.</p><p><em>Joshua Axelrod: jaxelrod@post-gazette.com and Twitter @jaxel222</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/02/Arizona-State-quarterback-Joey-Yellen-transfer-Pitt-football/stories/202001020175</original_url>
