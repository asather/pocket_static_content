<h1>City Council hears little public input on creating racial equity commission</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As conversations on race, budget priorities and policing dominate conversations in city councils across the U.S., attendance was light at a Pittsburgh City Council public hearing Wednesday regarding the creation of a Commission on Racial Equity and on a set of proposed commitments to racial equity.</p>
<p>One registered speaker testified at the hearing&nbsp;held via Zoom and livestreamed on YouTube.</p>
<p>The speaker, whose name was not displayed, said a commission on racial equity is&nbsp;“a step in the right direction” and that council should&nbsp;“look to some of the younger activists in Pittsburgh” in its establishment of racial equity principles.</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess chaired the 12-minute meeting. Mr. Lavelle, along with members Theresa Kail-Smith, Deb Gross, Erika Strassburger and Bobby Wilson attended.</p>

<p>Councilmen Ricky Burgess and Daniel Lavelle <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/10/Burgess-Lavelle-propose-creation-of-city-Commission-on-Racial-Equity/stories/202003100089" target="_blank">introduced the two pieces of legislation in March</a>.</p>
<p>The proposed commission would be composed of seven members under which five subcommittees would focus on economic stability, education, health, neighborhoods and built environment and “social community context,” so as to include a&nbsp;“cross section” of people, Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>The 10 commitments outlined in Mr. Burgess’ and Mr. Lavelle’s bill include the city committing to the following, among other commitments: eliminating race-based disparities across city departments; engaging community members, especially African Americans and those who live in African American neighborhoods; and&nbsp;applying “deliberately and systematically” a racial equity lens in decision-making.</p>
<p>The proposals are two of&nbsp;numerous bills on race and police reform winding through council.</p>
<p>During Wednesday morning’s standing committee meeting, the body took one step closer to approving a resolution declaring that “Black Pittsburgh Matters.”</p>
<p>Mr. Burgess and Mr. Lavelle introduced the measure on June 23, and it outlines five “strategic investment principles” for directing resources into the city’s Black communities, including the city’s “historic business districts,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>“I respect the pain of all groups that have been disaffected. ... But I will suggest to you that if you look at the numbers, and you add Black to any disaffected group, the outcome is worse,” Mr. Burgess said.</p>
<p>“If you are gay and lesbian, or trans, in Pittsburgh, you do face discrimination, and it’s unfair. But if you’re Black and gay, lesbian, and trans, you’re outcome will be worse,” he said. “If you’re poor in Pittsburgh, that’s awful, and you have my sympathy, and no one should be poor. But if you’re Black and poor in Pittsburgh, your outcomes will be worse. If you’re a woman in Pittsburgh, you will not receive the same pay rate. ... But if you’re Black and a female, you’re outcomes will be significantly worse.”</p>
<p>In December, the two councilmen championed a resolution declaring racism a public health crisis in Pittsburgh after a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/09/17/Pittsburgh-black-population-better-life-quality-comparable-city-gender-equity-commission-race/stories/201909170114" target="_blank">city-commissioned report revealed</a>&nbsp;that Pittsburgh’s Black residents would find better health and economic outcomes in nearly any other comparable U.S. city.</p>
<p>A public hearing will be held Wednesday on Mr. Burgess’ bill to put a referendum to the voters in November on whether they want to expand the powers of the Citizen Police Review Board. To register to speak, call 412-255-2138.</p>
