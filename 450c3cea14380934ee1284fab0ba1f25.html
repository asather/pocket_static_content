<h1>Pitt ranked in the AP poll for the first time since 2018</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sure, 54 of 130 teams aren’t eligible. But a ranking is still a ranking.</p>
<p>Pitt found its way into the Associated Press poll on Sunday, slotting in as the No. 25 team in the country after bulldozing Austin Peay, 55-0, in its season opener.</p>
<p>It’s the first time the Panthers are in the AP poll since Nov. 18, 2018, back when there was a little more competition to earn a spot.</p>
<p>Teams and conferences that are not currently playing due to COVID-19, most notably the Big Ten and Pac-12, were not considered for the Week 1 poll after they were for the AP’s preseason rankings. There were nine teams in the preseason poll that are not playing, including Penn State, which slotted in at No. 7.</p>
<p>Still, Pitt’s leap into the top 25 is impressive. The Panthers, who were picked to finish eighth in the ACC in a media poll, did not receive any votes in the AP’s preseason rankings. There were 21 teams in the “others receiving votes” section of the preseason poll, including five ACC teams.</p>
<p>In the new poll, seven ACC schools made the top 25. Clemson led the way at No. 1 overall after beating up on Wake Forest, followed by No. 7 Notre Dame, which handled Duke at home. North Carolina, Miami and Louisville slotted in at Nos. 12, 17 and 18, respectively, after winning on Saturday. Virginia Tech, which did not play, moved from unranked to No. 20.</p>
<p>Three ACC teams (Virginia, Georgia Tech, Florida State) and West Virginia landed in the “others receiving votes” category.</p>
<p>Pitt has another chance to move up in the rankings in Week 2. The Panthers host Syracuse, which lost 31-6 to the Tar Heels over the weekend.</p>
<p>Pitt and Syracuse kick off at noon Saturday with the game televised on the ACC Network.</p>
