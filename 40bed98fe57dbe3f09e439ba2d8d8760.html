<h1>Redskins' Latimer allegedly shot his gun near friend before recent arrest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Washington Redskins wide receiver Cody Latimer fired two shots near a friend before he was arrested early Saturday morning in Colorado on assault and weapons charges, according to a police report obtained by 9News in Denver.</p>
<p>Latimer, 27, appeared virtually in court in Douglas County on Monday after sheriff’s deputies in suburban Denver charged him with second-degree assault, menacing, illegal discharging of a weapon, prohibited use of a weapon and reckless endangerment. A hearing was set for July 24.</p>
<p>According to the report, Latimer had been at a poker game with several friends Friday night when he started arguing with another guest at the game. The host of the event, described in the report as Latimer’s best friend, kicked everyone out. Latimer returned later, angrily blaming his friend for the fight. He pulled out a gun and threatened to shoot his friend and the friend’s girlfriend.</p>
<p>He later fired the gun near his friend, who eventually was able to pin Latimer to the wall but not before Latimer hit the friend on the head with the gun, the report said.</p>
<p>According to 9News, Latimer’s attorney, Harvey Steinberg, told the court on Monday that the original argument was over allegations of sexual assault against a 4-year-old. The sexual assault allegations, Steinberg told the court, were not against Latimer.</p>
<p>Latimer signed with the Redskins as a free agent in March. He has played for the Denver Broncos and New York Giants during his six-year NFL career.</p>
