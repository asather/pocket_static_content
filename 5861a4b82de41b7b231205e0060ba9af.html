<h1>Sweat Equity: Murder, She Spoke | Local podcaster Erin Fleming is fascinated by the criminal-minded among us</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sitting in the Dobra Tea in Squirrel Hill with her 15-year-old son, Viggo, true crime podcaster Erin Fleming is the living embodiment of the woman we’ve seen on the cover of detective magazines and pulps for generations.</p>
<p>With platinum blonde hair reminiscent of Marilyn Monroe and Jayne Mansfield, Ms. Fleming is an intentional throwback to an age of Hollywood glamour that disappeared long ago, though it has contemporary echoes in the aesthetic of shows like “Mad Men” and “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”</p>
<p>A longtime fan of podcasters Marc Maron and Joe Rogan, Ms. Fleming was inspired to try her hand at podcasting on subjects far removed from the comedic and self-help domains of her heroes.&nbsp;Two years ago, Ms. Fleming, a Greenfield resident, started her own podcast called “Redrum Blonde” as an excuse to explore her fascination with murder narratives — both solved and unsolved.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m one of those people who falls asleep to&nbsp;‘Forensic Files’ every night,” she said with a laugh.&nbsp;“Everyone’s an armchair detective.”</p>
<p>“Redrum Blonde” — “Murder Blonde” for those unfamiliar with the anagram — commands a robust 1,600 listeners an episode, which is pretty good for someone who puts every show together by herself. The show has attracted regular sponsors and has generated fans nationally and internationally.</p>
<p>Now 68 episodes in, Ms. Fleming, 48, feels there’s a lot more she should be doing with her platform as a true crime podcaster.</p>
<p>Our interview took place at a tea house on Murray Avenue that looks like an upscale Moroccan cafe, minus the zoned-out tourists seeking transcendence on the cheap.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by hipsters, tea house regulars and undergraduates reclining on cushions or sitting cross-legged staring at various screens or engaged in loud conversation with friends who wouldn’t have minded being mistaken for beatniks.&nbsp;Dobra Tea is a unique establishment in the city. It also happens to be the last place where 22-year-old Hazelwood artist Tonee Turner, who has been missing since Dec. 30, was seen. As of deadline, the artist, who teaches a ceramics class at the Braddock Carnegie Library, was still missing.</p>
<p>Ms. Fleming has been posting stories about Ms. Turner on her Facebook wall for weeks. She doesn’t know her but still feels an obligation to help find her. The disappearance of someone as beloved as Tonee Turner is the kind of story she often showcases on her podcast, though she hasn’t written one about her yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">A West Virginia native, Ms. Fleming and her son moved to Pittsburgh seven years ago, a move that has expanded her world dramatically.&nbsp;</span>After years working the floor as a clerk at the Barnes &amp; Noble in Homestead, she now works at an ARS Opioid Addiction Treatment Center where she has more control over her schedule, and records two podcasts a month.</p>
<p>For someone with no training as a writer, Ms. Fleming has a strong sense of a narrative’s most important points. She writes the script for every episode, so she’s able to tailor the stories to fit her vocal rhythms and tics. Still, podcasting is a side gig that pays minimally despite her ability to attract some commercial sponsorship. She won’t be quitting her day job anytime soon.</p>
<p>One of her most popular episodes was an examination of the infamous murder of Kitty Genovese, the 28-year-old bartender who was fatally stabbed outside of her Queens, N.Y., apartment building during the early hours of March 13, 1964.&nbsp;Instead of merely restating the cliches about the murder that relied on the much debunked narrative that none of Kitty Genovese’s neighbors called the cops or intervened to help while she was being killed outside their windows, Ms. Fleming updated the listener with facts that didn’t fit the decades long story of neighbors’ inhumanity to neighbors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I watched a documentary featuring her brother and learned a lot about her and what happened that night I didn’t know before,” she said.&nbsp;“Like everyone else, I believed the myths surrounding the case.”</p>
<p>For all of her interest in murder narratives, missing persons and true crime, Ms. Fleming doesn’t have any contacts among the police yet. Her podcast has never featured interviews or voices other than her own. S<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">he admits to “being on the shy side,” but understands that her reluctance to approach people who could impart a layer of moral authority or personal witness to her stories will undermine the value of her podcasts eventually if she doesn’t take it to the next level.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">She’s now looking at unsolved local murders.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>“I’m starting to feel a sense of obligation,” she said.</p>
<p>Consequently, she’s now determined to make “Redrum Blonde” more than a one-woman monologue about crimes mostly taken from newspaper accounts and police reports.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t want to keep researching and writing podcasts without having a better sense of who the [victim] was,” she said.&nbsp;“You don’t just want to tell a story about how they died. These people are important.”</p>
