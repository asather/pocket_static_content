<h1>Column: What chess and my dad taught me about life</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>I was the only girl in my fifth-grade class who could play chess. I remember a group of boys setting up a tournament during recess (so other classrooms could take part). I asked to be a part of it and eventually got a disgruntled yes, probably because they knew my dad ran the after-school chess club.</p>
<p>I won.</p>
<p>Before I left for school the morning of the final game, my dad told me what he always says when I have something big going on: “Take no prisoners.”</p>
<p>He started teaching me to play chess when I was 7 or 8. I got a Disney princess-themed checkers set for Christmas and after I got the hang of that game, my dad convinced me to try chess.&nbsp;It wasn’t easy. I lost my first game in less than a minute to a Fool’s Mate. But I got better.</p>
<p>It became our Saturday morning tradition. He sat on the couch, coffee cup in hand, and I sat on the floor, sipping a mug of sugar and cream with a little bit of coffee. The news played in the background. We’d usually play one or two games, depending on how long they lasted and what else he had to do that day.</p>
<p>He used to tell me that how good a chess player is depends on how many moves ahead she can see. He always had a plan for each possible move I could make, and he never let me win.</p>
<p>I’m still trying to apply this philosophy to my life.</p>
<p>My father was just as tough on other kids learning to play chess.&nbsp;His philosophy was that you need to see it yourself to understand. One time, he played the same game multiple times, move-for-move, with one student. Finally she said, “Oh, I see it now.”</p>
<p>Besides giving me quality time with my dad, chess taught me to calmly analyze all of my options before making a decision. One time, we decided to play “touch-mate,” meaning that if you touch a piece you must move that piece. I lost my queen in the first four moves. I learned a lesson that day in how to work around problems.</p>
<p>Brian McCall, who ran the after-school chess club before my dad, once competed in world championship tournaments. He also happens to be a former pro baseball player for the Chicago White Sox. I think they’ve played five games total and my dad has won a couple of them.</p>
<p>One sunny Saturday morning while playing my dad, I moved my bishop across the board for an early checkmate. I was so excited to finally beat him fair and square. I think I was 13. We left the checkmate on the board for a whole week and took photos to document it. I’d never felt so accomplished.</p>
<p>I’d like to think that I’m as good as he is, but I know he will probably beat me when we play this Father’s Day.</p>
