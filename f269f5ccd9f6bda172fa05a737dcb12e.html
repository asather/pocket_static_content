<h1>Allegheny County restaurant inspections gearing up again under green phase</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Allegheny County Health Department has resumed inspections of restaurant kitchens and other food facilities following the county’s move into the “green phase” of the state’s pandemic reopening plan.</p>
<p>Routine inspections had been on hold during the lockdown when restaurants were limited to take-out and delivery service.</p>

<p>During that time, health inspectors spent most of their shifts on the phone going over coronavirus-related safety protocols with restaurants. The department also continued to perform on-site visits in response to any consumer complaints.</p>
<p>Going forward, inspectors will be following pandemic safety guidelines during their field inspections, wearing protective gear and “taking appropriate precautions,” Allegheny County spokeswoman Amie Downs said in an email.</p>
<p>Inspectors also will be reinforcing the use of special safety procedures for restaurants, including frequent hand washing and masks for employees, reduced occupancy limits and social distancing.</p>
<p>State guidelines for restaurants operating in the green phase are available on the county health department’s website at <a href="https://www.governor.pa.gov/covid-19/restaurant-industry-guidance/" target="_blank">www.governor.pa.gov/covid-19/restaurant-industry-guidance/</a>.</p>
<p>Besides restaurants, the health department inspects kitchens in grocery stores, convenience stores, banquet halls, social clubs, schools and hospitals, in addition to food processors and warehouses, among others.</p>
<p>Inspection reports for food facilities in the county are available at <a href="http://webapps.achd.net/Restaurant/" target="_blank">achd.net/Restaurant</a>.</p>
