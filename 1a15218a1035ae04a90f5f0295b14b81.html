<h1>Pro Bowlers remember Kobe Bryant as AFC tops NFC again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>ORLANDO, Fla. — Green Bay linebacker Za’Darius Smith hastily organized an homage to Kobe Bryant minutes before the Pro Bowl.</p>
<p>Smith and his NFC teammates learned about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/2020/01/26/Kobe-Bryant-dead-NBA-Lakers-California-helicopter-crash/stories/202001260158" target="_blank">Bryant’s death</a> while they were in the locker room getting ready for the NFL’s all-star game Sunday. Smith suggested the best way to pay tribute the late NBA great was to mimic his fadeaway jumper after big plays.</p>
<p>So they did — repeatedly.</p>
<p>It was one of several ways NFL players remembered Bryant during the celebratory event, which the AFC won 38-33 for its fourth consecutive victory in Orlando.</p>
<p>“I don’t even want to talk about it anymore,” Smith said in the locker room hours later. “I don’t want to get emotional.”</p>
<p>Detroit cornerback Darius Slay didn’t duck his feelings. Slay grew up idolizing Bryant so much that he had a custom Lakers hoodie made to warm up in before NFL games. Slay also got to meet Bryant a few years back.</p>
<p>“It’s heart-wrecking,” Slay said with tears in his eyes. “There’s not any words you can say. I’m in shock. I just imagine him growing old, being part-owner of the Lakers and having a future son I could cheer for next. It’s just shocking. Me saying the words ‘Kobe’s gone,‘ that’s just crazy.”</p>
<p>Bryant died in a helicopter crash early Sunday near Calabasas, California, and the news spread shortly before the game. It put a damper on the NFL game held on the other side of the country.</p>
<p>Players checked cellphones on the sidelines for updates, all of them looking for information and answers.</p>
<p>“It shocked the whole locker room,” Philadelphia defensive tackle Fletcher Cox said. “Nobody thought it was true, but it was. It’s a sad day for sports.”</p>
<p>Smith, Slay and Tampa Bay’s Shaq Barrett got together following a second-quarter sack and delivered their first “Kobe J.” Even more NFC teammates performed the routine following a fumble in the third.</p>
<p>Green Bay receiver Davonte Adams pointed to the sky and flashed the No. 24 on his fingers as an ode to Bryant’s jersey after a touchdown catch in the third.</p>
<p>Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson led a prayer for Bryant and his family before the game.</p>
<p>The NFL also held a moment of silence for Bryant at the 2-minute warning in the first half, showing the retired NBA star’s picture on the scoreboards while announcing his death at age 41.</p>
<p>Several guys removed their helmets during the break. Others took a knee and prayed. Fans broke the silence by chanting “Ko-be! Ko-be!”</p>
<p>“I felt hurt,” Chicago safety Eddie Jackson said. “It’s sad. I don’t know how it feels to lose a husband and a child, so I don’t understand what the family’s going through. It’s got to be tough.”</p>
<p>Aside from the Bryant tributes, the NFL’s annual all-star game went as expected. There were big plays everywhere and few tackles anywhere. The teams combined for 834 yards and 10 touchdowns.</p>
<p>The play of the day was Pittsburgh linebacker T.J. Watt’s 82-yard fumble return in the fourth. Jacksonville’s Calais Campbell beat Dallas’ Travis Frederick and sacked Kirk Cousins on a fourth-and-goal play from the 9. Campbell stripped the ball, which Watt scooped up and went untouched the other way to put the AFC ahead 38-27.</p>
<p>The NFC had a chance to rally late and tried to take advantage of a new rule that allows the scoring team to retain possession by facing a fourth-and-15 play from its own 25-yard line. Cousins threw a deep ball that Baltimore safety Earl Thomas intercepted.</p>
<p>Campbell was named the AFC’s defensive player of the game. Baltimore’s Lamar Jackson was the offensive MVP.</p>
<p>The winners earned $70,000 each. The losers got $35,000 apiece.</p>
<p>Jackson threw for 185 yards and two touchdowns. He also threw an interception. Houston’s Deshaun Watson threw for 148 yards, with a touchdown and a pick.</p>
<p>Tennessee’s Ryan Tannehill hooked up with Jacksonville’s DJ Chark for a 60-yard score in which officials opted not to rule him down after two defenders touched him.</p>
<p>Wilson gave his NFC starting spot to New Orleans quarterback Drew Brees, who is contemplating retirement. Brees said this week he will take some time before deciding on his future.</p>
<p>Cousins, Brees and Wilson threw TD passes for the NFC, which also allowed Ezekiel Elliott and Adams to attempt throws. Elliott’s was picked off. Adams added two TD receptions.</p>
<p>The NFC’s top highlight was Cox rumbling 61 yards for a score. Minnesota’s Harrison Smith intercepted a pass from Watson at the 3-yard line and returned it to the 39 before lateraling to Cox, who took it the rest of the while.</p>
<p>No one tried to tackle the 310-pound Cox. Denver receiver Courtland Sutton slapped at the ball for the final 20 yards.</p>
<p>“I’m glad nobody did try to stop me,” Cox said. “It was fun. I was looking for somebody to pitch the ball to, though. Guarantee I was. Get this thing out of my hands.”</p>
