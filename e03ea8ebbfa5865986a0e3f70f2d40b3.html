<h1>Oklahoma woman gets federal prison for prostituting girl</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An Oklahoma woman was sentenced Tuesday in Pittsburgh to six-and-a-half years in federal prison for prostituting a 17-year-old Ohio girl, who has since died, at Pittsburgh and Cranberry hotels after advertising her on backpage.com.</p>
<p>Shelby Summer Brown, 28, of Tulsa, had pleaded guilty in September to violating the Mann Act by transporting a minor across state lines for sex in 2018.</p>
<p>Her boyfriend and the father of her two children, Oscar Carter, is also under indictment in Pittsburgh on charges related to acting as the pimp.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said the girl, 17 at the time of the crimes in 2018, died within the last month and the circumstances of her death are under investigation.</p>
<p>The couple had met the girl in 2018 at a Waffle House in Akron where she worked, according to court testimony, and she agreed to travel with them as a "family" to Pittsburgh to sell herself as a "high-end escort."</p>
<p>Mr. Carter later picked her up at the restaurant on March 6, 2018, and the three of them drove to Pittsburgh to set up prostitution services from that day through March 14 at two motels on Banksville Road and one in Cranberry. The girl performed sex acts dozens of times in that week and also visited clients at other locations, earning thousands of dollars but turning it all over to Mr. Carter, who she knew as "Daddy" or "Unique," according to FBI testimony.</p>
<p>Brown, herself a prostitute, was able to stop working during that time because the girl was making money for the couple, agents said.</p>
<p>Law officers learned of the operation when a Pittsburgh police detective working a prostitution detail on March 14, 2018, arranged to meet a prostitute at hotel Downtown after answering an ad on backpage.com. He arrested the minor there and while police were interviewing her, Mr. Carter called her. Police turned the incoming number over to the FBI's sex-trafficking squad and agents tracked it to Mr. Carter. They set up surveillance at the Cranberry hotel where the couple was staying and law officers arrested Mr. Carter on March 15. Brown was arrested a few days later.</p>
<p>In the center console of their car was a log book for sex dates for the girl, agents said.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady praised the coordination of Pittsburgh police, the FBI and Cranberry police in rescuing the girl and catching the traffickers.</p>
<p>Brown had characterized herself as the girl's "caretaker," but Assistant U.S. Attorney Heidi Grogan said she actually preyed on her with Mr. Carter.</p>
<p>"The defendant was not the victim’s 'caretaker' – she manipulated the mind and heart of a vulnerable girl, rather than protecting her as any decent adult should," she wrote in court papers. "Defendant’s crime of conviction is one that has a profound impact on its victims."</p>
<p>In imposing the sentence on Brown, U.S. District Judge Cathy Bissoon told her that her conduct is the reason sex trafficking continues to flourish.</p>
<p>The case against Mr. Carter is pending.</p>
