<h1>Robert Morris loses close one with Fairleigh Dickinson, Toole blames refs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With just over 30 seconds left in Robert Morris’ game against Fairleigh Dickinson, the Colonials clung to a two-point lead and the ball. Fifth-year senior Josh Williams threw it away, though, and the Knights hit an and-one layup to take a one-point lead. Not to be outdone, Robert Morris forward AJ Bramah drew a shooting foul with eight seconds left, made both free throws and put his team back in front, 71-70.</p>
<p>Fairleigh Dickinson answered yet again, hitting a tip-in layup with 1.3 seconds left to swing the pendulum back toward the Knights.</p>
<p>Then came the drama and the focus of Colonials coach Andy Toole’s post-game attention.</p>
<p>Guard Jon Williams was the in-bounder. He ran the baseline to his right, while his brother, Josh Williams, set a screen on the defender guarding the in-bounder, Kaleb Bishop. A big collision ensued, but no whistle, and Robert Morris (15-12 overall, 11-3 NEC) fell, 72-71.</p>
<p>Toole went chasing after the referees after the final buzzer sounded, convinced there should have been a foul called, but no explanation was given.</p>
<p>“Hard to get a catch and shoot late. They’re gonna make you catch it in front of them. The play is for him to get run over,” Toole said. “If you watch late-game college basketball all across the country, that’s the No. 1 job of the assistant coach, to yell at the guy guarding the in-bounder,&nbsp;‘Don’t foul!’&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[Fairleigh Dickinson coach] Greg Herenda says to me on the sideline,&nbsp;‘I didn’t go over that with my guys. Complete foul.’ That’s where it’s so frustrating. If the opposing coach is saying it’s a foul and the refs don’t know it’s a foul, that’s a major problem.”</p>
<p>Whether or not there was a missed call, Robert Morris seemed to have things in control late in the game. The Knights (8-16, 6-7), however, made clutch shot after clutch shot to keep things close.</p>
<p>Altogether, Fairleigh Dickinson scored 16 points in the last four minutes, culminating with the tip-in layup to win.</p>
<p>“We didn’t do what we needed to do defensively down the stretch,” Toole said.&nbsp;“... We were up eight and they were able to get free for some threes and create some opportunities to get back into the game, which is a let-down on our part.”</p>
<p>The game as a whole was wildly entertaining, including the first half, which contained a 14-0 run for the Colonials followed by an 8-0 Knights run to draw within a point at halftime. But Toole seemed to find it hard to think about any of those stretches after the game, given how it all ended.</p>
<p>“This is home-court advantage,” Toole said. “People are trying to win a championship, so they can host games in the NEC Tournament. So for guys to miss calls like that is just inexcusable. It’s inexcusable. And that can have a direct impact on where people go late in the season, in terms of hosting a semifinal game, hosting a quarterfinal game, hosting a championship game. You can’t miss those ones. I get it. Block/charges are hard, there are certain calls that are hard. You can’t miss that one right in front of you like that. You can’t.”</p>
