<h1>Legume in Oakland to close at end of February</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Acclaimed upscale Oakland restaurant Legume will close at the end of February and become a more casual iteration called Butterjoint All Day, co-owners Trevett and Sarah Hooper announced Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<p>“It’s bittersweet, but more sweet than anything. There’s definitely sadness, but the reasons are exciting,” Mr. Hooper said.</p>
<p>He explained: “Basically we felt like Legume had a great run but it was time to do something new. When we started in 2007, we had an idea for what Pittsburgh needed, and I think we did that. And now, it needs something different.”</p>
<p>The last day of service will be February 29th. As the change requires only some cosmetic work, Mr. Hooper said he expects a fairly quick turnaround into the new concept, which will combine aspects of all three of his restaurants -- Legume, and neighboring sister establishments Butterjoint and Pie for Breakfast -- and will be open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.</p>
<p>Citing rising operating costs and a supersaturated market, Mr. Hooper said, “This model wasn't sustainable anymore. We thought, rather than do a watered down version of something old lets do something new.”</p>
<p>He emphasized that “none of this is a reflection of my awesome staff. These are larger, industry wide factors.”</p>
<p>“When we opened with Legume, our aim was to connect with the neighborhood,” he said, adding that over time the restaurant evolved into a more expensive destination restaurant.</p>
<p>“Basically what we hope is this will be more neighborhood focused rather than destination focused -- like Butterjoint but with some Legume elements and a couple entrees. It’ll be a more rounded menu. Butterjoint has a warmer feel and we want to bring that over.”</p>
<p>In an email blast to customers, the Hoopers wrote:</p>
<p>“Since our hearts are more inclined to feed a lot of people good food than to maintain fine dining trappings, the choice was obvious. When we looked back and reflected on what has made our guests happy over the years, we realized it hasn’t been the fine dining nature of Legume, or the more ambitious dishes we make that get people excited. It has always been the straight-ahead things like the zurek, duck confit, pierogies, beef tartare, chicken paprikash, cherry pie, chocolate cake, beef and kimchi soup, sour dill pickles, bluefish pate, lamb steak and other simple things that we hear about. These things aren’t going anywhere.”</p>
<p>Legume first opened on S. Braddock Ave. in Regent Square in June 2007 as a bistro concept and was quickly embraced by Pittsburgh diners. Known for its innovative and adventurous cuisine, its opening was one of several in the mid-to-late 2000’s that ushered in the modern-era Renaissance of Pittsburgh dining. It has routinely been lauded among the city’s best restaurants during its nearly 13-year run.</p>
<p>Of Legume’s debut on the scene, former Post-Gazette dining critic China Millman wrote that the Hoopers “introduced an artful, ingredient-focused and highly personal style of cooking that was a hallmark of contemporary cooking in the United States, but was mostly missing from Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>In 2011, the restaurant moved to its current location on North Craig Street in Oakland, in what had been the home of More Italian restaurant for roughly 40 years, and became more of a fine dining destination. The more casual bar Butterjoint opened next door in late 2012 and the diner Pie For Breakfast next to that in 2018.</p>
