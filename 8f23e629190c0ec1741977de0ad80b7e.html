<h1>For those still driving their old cars, these new gadgets might come as a surprise</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When I set out to go new car shopping about five years ago, I had no idea there was such a thing as a panoramic moonroof.</p>
<p>This gigantic sliding skylight nearly the size of the vehicle’s entire roof allows every passenger to have a great view of the sky.</p>
<p>When I saw one for the first time, I was awestruck. I had to have one. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>If you don’t keep up with the latest car gadgetry, you’re in good company.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It’s a situation a lot of people find themselves in,” said Brian Moody, executive editor at the car shopping site Autotrader. The average used car on the road is about 11 years old, he said. That means many people haven’t been to the showroom for a while.</p>
<p>With the Pittsburgh International Auto Show about to open — it runs Feb. 14-17 at the David. L. Lawrence Convention Center, Downtown — Mr. Moody offered a quick update on some of the cutting-edge technology that visitors are likely to see.</p>
<p><strong>• Apple CarPlay and Android Auto.</strong> This technology allows you to integrate your smartphone with your vehicle’s in-dash display using a charging cable.&nbsp;“Tap the screen and your contact list comes up. Listen to Spotify or your music,” Mr. Moody said. “Say you’re going to meet someone and they text you the address. You tap the address and it opens up maps that will give you directions to that location.” A few automakers also offer Wi-Fi connections (available via subscription), eliminating the need for a charging cable.</p>
<p><strong>• Back-seat reminders.</strong> “You’ve seen news stories where people forget their child or dog in the back seat and something awful happens? This gives you a prompt,” Mr. Moody said. These systems know when you’ve opened the back door before starting out on the road and sound a warning tone to check the back seat when you exit the vehicle.</p>
<p><strong>• Electric performance cars.</strong> Traditionally, electric cars have been primarily aimed at saving on gasoline and using fewer resources. Now, some carmakers are focusing on making electric cars that are fast, too, such as Porsche, Jaguar, Tesla and Audi. “They’re designed to be luxurious, high-performance cars that are all electric,” Mr. Moody said.</p>
<p><strong>• Wireless phone charging.</strong> Carmakers have begun integrating wireless charging pads into their vehicles. Place your phone (newer models) onto the tray — typically located in the center console — and it starts charging without having to plug it in.</p>
<p><strong>• Remote smart parking assist.</strong>&nbsp;Available from Hyundai, the system works like other parking assist systems that automatically park your car, but without the need for you to be behind the wheel. The feature can be especially useful for pulling into and out of a tight spot that leaves no room to open the driver’s door. “You can get out of the car and move the car into the parking area using a remote. If someone jumps in front of it, it will stop,” Mr. Moody said. “I think the best use is for people with old houses and tiny garages.”</p>
<p><strong>• Rear cross traffic alert.</strong> This feature uses sensors to warn drivers that something — another car, bicycle, scooter or pedestrian, for example — is approaching from outside the view of the backup camera.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;<strong>Exit warning system.</strong> This system, which works similar to blind spot warning systems, chimes when you or a passenger is about to open a door at the same time that a car or other object is approaching from the rear.</p>
<p><strong>• Smartphone assistant app.</strong> Perhaps you want to start your vehicle and warm it up before going outside, or check on how much battery power is left on your electric car, or unlock the door from your office to let a delivery driver put an item in the trunk. “The idea is you can access your car and get info about your car from a smartphone or watch,” Mr. Moody said.</p>
<p>If you’re planning to visit the Pittsburgh auto show, Mr. Moody recommends doing some research and making a list of the cars and features you’d most like to see.</p>
<p>“The great thing about the show is you get to see a bunch of stuff all in one place. Some people will just go for fun; others go because they want to buy a new car.</p>
<p>“Start with what you think looks cool, but be sure you sit inside. If the seats aren’t comfortable, it doesn’t matter,” he said.</p>
<p>“Don’t be afraid to sit inside and press the buttons. That’s what a car show is for.”</p>
