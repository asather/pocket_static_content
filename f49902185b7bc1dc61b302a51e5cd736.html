<h1>Getting to know new Pirates catcher John Ryan Murphy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates on Friday signed catcher John Ryan Murphy to a minor-league deal that includes an invitation to spring training. With 259 games played for four MLB teams over the past seven seasons, Murphy has ample experience on which to draw as he’ll compete with Jacob Stallings and Luke Maile for time with the big-league club.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette caught up with Murphy on Friday to talk about his backstory and what he might be able to bring. Here are five takeaways from that conversation.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Murphy signing with the Pirates is the definition of things coming full circle.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Murphy, 28, is from Bradenton, Fla., and went to high school at IMG Academy, a preparatory boarding school and sports training center located about 15 minutes from LECOM Park.</span></p>
<p>In fact, Murphy’s mother, Caroline, was one of its first employees, her time there stretching back to when it was the Nick Bollettieri Tennis Academy in the late 1970s. Caroline Murphy worked as admissions director, and her son grew up going to baseball games at McKechnie Field.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“She was one of the originals there when it first opened,” John Ryan Murphy said. “She just retired 3-4 years ago. I grew up here and kind of got grandfathered into that place. I went to camps there my whole life. When it was time for high school, my parents basically gave me the choice. That’s when I kind of committed to the baseball thing.”</span></p>
<p>As a kid, Murphy estimated that he’d go to 8-10 spring training games every year. The Red Sox and Yankees were always the teams he wanted to see the most. Having just bought a house in nearby Tampa, Murphy said he plans on commuting to spring training.</p>
<p>“That’s definitely a unique and special opportunity,” he said.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1"><strong>2.</strong> Speaking of Caroline Murphy, she’s pretty special in her own right. Caroline was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease after the 2015 season. Caroline and her family have gotten better at handling it day-to-day, and John Ryan said she lives an incredibly active lifestyle that includes boxing, cycling, yoga, tennis and golf.</span></p>
<p>“She’s managing it as well as I could ever imagine,” the catcher said. “She tries to stay active and do as much as she can. Honestly, it’s been an inspiration watching her the last few years.”</p>
<p>Caroline and Mark Murphy live in Sarasota now. John Ryan said he doesn’t expect them to miss a single Pirates spring training game.</p>
<p>“They’re as supportive as you could possible be,” he said. “Being in Bradenton will be special for them, too.”</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> The Pirates have a strange habit of acquiring former Yankees backup catchers, and they did it again with Murphy, who caught in the Bronx for three seasons (2013-15).</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Murphy was actually called up to replace Francisco Cervelli when the latter hurt his hamstring in April 2014. The next year, Murphy beat out Austin Romine to become Brian McCann’s backup.</span></p>
<p>Murphy’s most interesting&nbsp;Yankees tie came in 2013, when he was behind the plate for Mariano Rivera’s final game, catching the final pitch from the greatest closer ever.</p>
<p>There’s a picture Murphy has in his house of Rivera crying and sharing multiple hugs with Derek Jeter and Andy Pettitte … with Murphy standing off to the side, mouth agape.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“That was obviously a very special moment,” Murphy said. “That was my first month in the big leagues. Probably had no business being out there. I have that picture; my jaw is just on the floor. All three of them signed it. It’s definitely a special moment I’ll never forget.”</span></p>
<p><strong>4.</strong> Murphy has never been a big offensive producer, but he’s strong defensively, especially when it comes to pitch-framing.</p>
<p>The last time Murphy played a decent amount was 2018, when he saw 87 games for the Diamondbacks. He finished 11th in framing. For his career, Murphy has thrown out 28 percent of would-be base-stealers (29 of 73), which is actually better than Cervelli’s career mark (24 percent).</p>
<p>In terms of Fielding Runs Above Average (FRAA) — Baseball Prospectus’ metric used to quantify a catcher’s overall defensive performance — Murphy was 11th in 2018 and 35th last season.</p>
<p>In batting, he’s never had an OPS above .734, and his best offensive season included nine home runs, 24 RBIs and a .202 average with Arizona in 2018. However, it looks like Murphy can at least contribute on the defensive end.</p>
<p>“I know what winning baseball looks like,” Murphy said. “I’ve been around a lot of winning players and winning coaching staffs. I would say that’s definitely something I would like to bring to the table.</p>
<p>“That pitcher-catcher relationship is really important. I was taught that coming up through the Yankees organization. They really stressed the catching side of things. It’s something I try to pride myself on still.”</p>
<p><strong>5.</strong> Murphy is ready for the competition.</p>
<p>Signing here was easy, Murphy said, because of the reputations general manager Ben Cherington and manager Derek Shelton have around the game.</p>
<p>“It starts with them,” Murphy said. “They’re both great.”</p>
<p>As for trying to win a job during spring training, that’s become old hat at this point. Murphy will return to Bradenton knowing he needs to prove something to his new employer.</p>
<p>“I’ve kind of learned in the last handful of spring trainings that that’s my role going into spring training,” Murphy said. “I’m going to have to fight to make a team. That’s the bottom line. This situation is no different. Nobody is going to be given anything.</p>
<p>“After talking to Ben and Sheltie, I just think it was a good opportunity for me to come in and try to earn a spot. That’s all you can ask for as a minor-league free agent — somewhere where you’ll get a fair look in spring training and see what happens.”</p>
