<h1>Health department: Allegheny County COVID-19 cases jump to 28</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of positive COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County has jumped to 28, the Allegheny County Health Department said Friday morning.</p>
<p>Five of those individuals are hospitalized with the remainder in self-isolation at home. Contact tracing on these cases continues.</p>
<p>The health department statement attributed the increase to an increase in local testing; the totals will continue to increase rapidly as testing becomes more common.</p>
<p>Thursday’s total was 18 positive cases.</p>
<p>“The goal here is to slow community spread as much as possible and to reduce spread to high risk groups through careful mitigation efforts,” the statement said. “ACHD testing continues for specific high-risk individuals – those with known contact, health care workers, first responders and those in high risk categories.”</p>
<p>The state health department reported the state now has 268 cases. They include three in Beaver County, three in Washington and four in Westmoreland. Erie County also has a case.</p>
