<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cleveland Clinic can now test for the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, shrinking the turnaround time for getting results to hours rather than days, officials said Thursday.</p>
<p>The previous turnaround time for the Cleveland-based hospital system was three to four days, Brian Rubin, chairman, Pathology and Laboratory Medicine Institute, said at a news conference.</p>
<p>Now, the results can be available within eight hours.</p>
<p>Patients getting the test will first have to meet certain testing criteria, he said.</p>
<p>“Somebody has to order the test, and for the appropriate indications, and we’ve outlined that in the electronic medical record,” Dr. Rubin said. “We’ll make sure we identify those patients, they’ll actually be identified twice, and then we’ll do the testing.”</p>
<p>Two commercial diagnostic labs serving the Pittsburgh area recently began offering testing for the new coronavirus and UPMC officials say the hospital system is also developing a test for the virus.</p>
