<h1>Crosby points the finger at himself amid Penguins’ longest losing skid in 8 years</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SAN JOSE, Calif. — He was wrong, but Sidney Crosby stated what he feels has been the Penguins’ biggest problem during their longest losing skid in eight years.</p>
<p>Standing, his arms folded, in the visiting locker room at SAP Center after a 5-0 loss to the San Jose Sharks, Crosby purposefully pointed the finger at himself.</p>
<p>“We all care. We all want to have success and do the right thing. I think we understand what it takes to win,” he said Saturday. “But I put it on myself. I’ve got to step up. Key situations, you’re down like this and losing games, you need big plays, big performances. And I haven’t done that. So that’s on me.”</p>
<p>That was noble of the Penguins captain, always quick to deflect praise and willing once again to shoulder some blame even though a slumping superstar probably wouldn’t crack a list of Mike Sullivan’s 10 biggest worries at the moment.</p>
<p>Injuries have forced the coach to rely on suboptimal defensive pairs. Goaltending, while still receiving a passing grade, hasn’t been as stingy. Role players such as Jared McCann stopped scoring. The three new guys have yet to provide a spark.</p>
<p>But it certainly wouldn’t hurt if Crosby got back to being one of the NHL’s best, a player who puts his linemates on his back and squats them into the sky.</p>
<p>Lately, his box-score numbers and more advanced stats have dipped, especially the past two weeks. So what’s the issue? Bad luck? His supporting cast? Lingering effects of his injury? Just a subpar stretch by his standards, part of the ebbs and flows that even superhumans experience during a long season?</p>
<p>Or is the solution as simple as the Penguins putting Jack Johnson back on the third pair or on a plane to Antarctica? Naturally, it’s more nuanced than that.</p>
<p>Crosby has notched just one point, the goal he scored in last Sunday’s 5-3 loss to the Washington Capitals, and a minus-8 rating during this losing streak.</p>
<p>“Nobody feels good about it. It’s tough,” Crosby said. “But we’re just putting ourselves in bad spots. We’re getting behind in games and chasing it, and the puck’s not going in for us right now. And that’s a tough combination.”</p>
<p>Saturday, with the Penguins down three goals early in the third period and still theoretically in it, Sharks goalie Martin Jones went out for lunch. Crosby, 28 feet out, was staring at an empty net from a sharp but not impossible angle, certainly not for him. But he missed. Moments later, the Sharks made it 4-0.</p>
<p>“The chances are there,” he said. “It’s frustrating it’s not going in. But you don’t get points for getting scoring chances. So you can only say that for so long.”</p>
<p>Last season, when he finished second in the MVP voting, the Penguins out-scored opponents, 82-43, with Crosby on at 5-on-5, per NaturalStatTrick.com. They had a 54.5% shot share and generated 14 high-danger chances per 60 minutes.</p>
<p>This season, the Penguins have been out-scored, 28-25, with Crosby on the ice at full strength while generating 11.6 high-danger chances per 60 minutes.</p>
<p>These statistics have dipped further since the 32-year-old returned to the lineup Jan. 14 after he underwent sports hernia surgery and missed 28 games.</p>
<p>At that point, Jake Guentzel was lost for at least the rest of the regular season. So Crosby had to skate alongside the likes of a slumping McCann, a 33-year-old Patric Hornqvist and Dominik Simon, who has a 7.2 career shooting percentage.</p>
<p>Jason Zucker has five goals in 10 games since the Penguins acquired him from the Minnesota Wild. But the two haven’t yet clicked as the team had hoped.</p>
<p>Plus, the injuries to top-four blue-liners Brian Dumoulin and John Marino, both of whom could return to game action this week, prompted Sullivan to play Johnson on the top defensive pair. Crosby’s numbers are substantially worse when on the ice with Johnson, which has been 46.7% of his 5-on-5 time since Jan. 14.</p>
<p>The Penguins had just two high-danger chances combined in their three losses in California while Crosby was on at 5-on-5, and they got out-scored, 3-0.</p>
<p>Seemingly pressing already to pick up slack for others, Crosby’s plus-minus rating has plummeted to minus-9, which is the second-worst mark on the team. He has not finished in the red in plus-minus for a season since his rookie year.</p>
<p>That number also speaks to the play of Crosby and the Penguins in their defensive zone, though puck possession and goal prevention are intertwined.</p>
<p>The Sharks scored their first goal Saturday after Crosby’s pass at the far blue line skipped over the stick of Zucker. The Sharks quickly countered and caught Marcus Pettersson trying to change. Evander Kane would bury the breakaway.</p>
<p>But the other two goals that opponents scored with Crosby on the ice out here in California were largely out of his control. One was a simple deflection. Another was a big breakdown where three others, including Zucker, split blame.</p>
<p>Crosby might have had his most impactful season as a defender in 2018-19. He finished fourth in Selke voting after the Penguins gave up only 9.9 high-danger chances per 60 minutes with him on at 5-on-5, per NaturalStatTrick.com.</p>
<p>During this losing streak, that rate has spiked to an alarming 15.1 per 60.</p>
<p>“I think we’re fighting. But when you get down in games, you can kind of force it a bit,” he said. “When it’s going your way, all of those things fall into place.”</p>
<p>The Penguins, who lost all six of these games in regulation, have dropped to third place in the Metropolitan Division. Suddenly, a playoff spot seems uncertain.</p>
<p>Crosby and the Penguins get another crack at getting back on track when another bottom-five team, the Ottawa Senators, visits PPG Paints Arena on Tuesday.</p>
<p>“These are important games,” Crosby said. “And you want to be at your best, whether it’s being on for goals against or not putting the puck in yourself.”</p>
