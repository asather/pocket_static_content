<h1>Penguins on pause: Evan Rodrigues' fresh start in Pittsburgh didn't last long</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The NHL has “paused” its season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. It is unclear if it will resume. So, with one eye still on the future, the Post-Gazette’s Matt Vensel and Mike DeFabo are looking back at what each Penguins player did in 2019-20. We started with the captain, No. 87, and will count down by jersey number.</em></p>
<p>Way back on Oct. 3, the Buffalo Sabres came to PPG Paints Arena for the season opener and dominated a sleepwalking Penguins squad in a 3-1 victory.</p>
<p>There were no happy campers in the home locker room after that one. Down the hall in the visiting team’s room, one Sabres player wasn’t thrilled either.</p>
<p>Evan Rodrigues had high expectations for himself entering 2019-20 after he had a career-high 29 points for the Sabres in 2018-19, spent a chunk of last season filling top-six roles and got a little action on the power play. But Buffalo’s new coach, Ralph Krueger, had him in street clothes on opening night.</p>
<p>That was the beginning of a challenging season for Rodrigues. The 26-year-old said he was too worried about making mistakes and never settled into a groove. He was a healthy scratch 24 times and reportedly requested a trade.</p>
<p>Rodrigues got the change of scenery he was hoping for Feb. 24, when the Sabres dealt Conor Sheary and him to Pittsburgh in exchange for Dominik Kahun.</p>
<p>“I went through the roof,” the giddy forward said after joining his new team.</p>
<p>The fun didn’t last long. The Penguins lost their first three games after the trade deadline and five of the next eight overall before the NHL suspended its season March 12. Rodrigues was a healthy scratch for one of those games.</p>
<p>But in the two games after returning to the lineup, the speedy forward scored a goal and showed signs he could be a useful bottom-six forward during a playoff run. Now he waits to hear if that race to the Cup will even take place.</p>
<p><strong>DEFINING MOMENT:</strong> The Penguins got routed by the Carolina Hurricanes in the penultimate game before the pause. But Rodrigues almost singlehandedly gave them a chance. He drew three penalties and with the score tied in the second period, he hit the post on a breakaway. The Hurricanes took it from there.</p>
<p><strong>STAT THAT STANDS OUT:</strong> It is very much a small sample size, but in his seven games with Pittsburgh, the Penguins had 61.4% of the scoring chances with Rodrigues on the ice at 5-on-5, per Natural Stat Trick. That’s especially impressive considering the overall struggles of the squad heading into the pause.</p>
<p><strong>IF THE SEASON RESUMES:</strong> Rodrigues will not be guaranteed a spot in the lineup, not if Jake Guentzel and Nick Bjugstad are ready to go if the playoffs take place. But his ability to play all three forward spots, kill penalties and give the Penguins a right-handed option on faceoffs could help him crack the lineup.</p>
<p><strong>LONG-TERM OUTLOOK:</strong> Rodrigues, who earned a $2 million salary in arbitration last summer, is scheduled to become a restricted free agent again this offseason. He is one of seven Penguins forwards who will be free agents. Whether he is back in black and gold next season may depend on his price tag.</p>
