<h1>PIAA officially cancels all spring high school sports in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was like a chain reaction. First, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Thursday morning that all <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/04/09/Pennsylania-schools-shutdown-rest-of-academic-year-coronavirus-governor-wolf-closed/stories/202004090116" target="_blank">schools in Pennsylvania will be closed</a> for the rest of the school year because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>By the afternoon, all high school sports in the state were also canceled.</p>
<p>The PIAA announced on its website that spring sports will not be played this year. The PIAA also announced the state basketball playoffs will not resume and the Class 2A swimming and diving championships also are canceled.</p>
<p>The boys and girls basketball playoffs were in the quarterfinal round when they were suspended in March, with the hopes of possibly restarting the tournament in the future. The swimming championships also were postponed in March.</p>
<p>“Today’s decision by the PIAA board of directors was difficult for everyone. Their thoughts remain on the thousands of student-athletes, coaches, officials and family members affected by this decision,” PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said in a release. “However, the board’s position reflects a steadfast priority of keeping our student-athletes, officials and member schools’ staffs and their communities safe, while following the guidelines provided by the governor, the Department of Health and the Department of Education.”</p>
<p>The PIAA was hoping to possibly finish the winter championships and have some sort of shortened spring sports season. But the closure of the schools doomed those hopes. The release pointed out that 17 other state associations have ended their sports seasons in similar fashion.</p>
<p>“As we navigate through this difficult time, we need to remember the lessons that interscholastic athletics has taught us: cooperation, patience, sacrifice, responsibility, respect and perseverance,” Lombardi said.</p>
<p>The cancellation of spring sports affects more than 100,000 athletes in Pennsylvania. According to the National Federation of State High School Associations, 111,204 athletes competed in spring sports in Pennsylvania last year. The cancellation of the rest of the basketball tournaments affects 96 boys and girls teams.</p>
<p>Although athletes and coaches around Pennsylvania knew the cancellation of all sports was a likely possibility, some held a sliver of hope that some kind of season might still be played. The PIAA’s announcement put a finality to it all.</p>
<p>So, the Chartiers Valley girls basketball team will have to forever wonder what might have been. The Colts had won 57 games in a row and had a chance to become the first girls team in Pennsylvania to win back-to-back championships with a perfect record.</p>
<p>Then there is the Hempfield softball team. The Spartans’ hopes of becoming the first team to win six consecutive WPIAL championships will have to be on hold until 2021.</p>
<p>“It kind of felt like it already was over because we haven’t been together as a team for so long and we weren’t allowed to practice,” said Megan McConnell, a standout senior point guard for Chartiers Valley. “But you’re definitely so hurt because I won’t put on that Chartiers Valley uniform again. We’ll have to always live with not knowing if we couldn’t have had two state titles — and there were only three games left to win.”</p>
<p>The Butler boys basketball team had given a big uplift to its town after winning a WPIAL title for the first time since 1991 and making it to the PIAA quarterfinals. Matt Clement has a unique perspective because not only is he Butler’s basketball coach, but he has two sons at Butler who play baseball.</p>
<p>“I think the PIAA deserves credit for waiting as long as they could before making this decision,” Clement said. “They didn’t make it because they know how important this is to kids. But there are a lot of smart people making these decisions, and if this is the safest thing for everyone to stay safe and healthy, then it’s the right decision.</p>
<p>“Do I want to finish the season? Yeah. But as time went on since we played our last game [in the PIAA second round], and the situation being what it is in the world, it’s hard to get upset. But this will be an awesome talking point for us someday. ‘What if?’”</p>
<p>The North Allegheny girls basketball team also had made it to the PIAA quarterfinals, and the North Allegheny boys volleyball team would’ve been going after its fourth consecutive WPIAL title and 14th in the past 17 years.</p>
<p>“Health and safety of all people is the No. 1 concern of everyone and not having sports is understandable,” North Allegheny athletic director Bob Bozzuto said. “But this is devastation to kids and I don’t know if people really realize that. These are unprecedented times, but you feel for kids. College seniors in spring sports can come back for an extra year and it doesn’t count towards a scholarship limit. But seniors in high school don’t have that opportunity.”</p>
<p>The PIAA release stated: “While PIAA remains hopeful that summer activities will be able to commence July 1, it is still too early to reach any decisions or offer guidance at this time.”</p>
