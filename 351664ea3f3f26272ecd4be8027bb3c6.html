<h1>'We're not bankers': Pittsburgh's Big 3 of college basketball coaches have ditched ties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Keith Dambrot was only going to do this for so long.</p>
<p>Before the start of the 2019-20 season, his Duquesne team played in a charity exhibition at West Virginia, where Dambrot coached against longtime friend Bob Huggins. As the two chatted before the game, Dambrot, sporting a quarter zip adorned with the Dukes’ logo, khakis and sneakers, said he would dress that way until Huggins was inducted into the basketball Hall of Fame, making his clothing choice something between an homage and a plea for a man famous for his casual in-game attire.</p>
<p>Along the way, though, something changed — Dambrot loved his new get-up. He loved it so much, in fact, that he wanted it to become something more permanent, even once Huggins and his more than 800 career wins are inevitably enshrined. The button-up shirt and tie he had worn for so much of his nearly four-decade career would be no more.</p>
<p>“I thought, ‘Well, I’m 61. Why wear a suit?’ ” Dambrot said.</p>
<p>While Dambrot’s look remains an outlier in a profession still dominated by designer suits and dress shoes, he’s not alone among his peers locally this season in abandoning something that’s more of a fixture around a coach’s neck than even a whistle — a tie. The two other Division I men’s basketball coaches in the Pittsburgh area, Pitt’s Jeff Capel and Robert Morris’ Andy Toole, still wear suits, but both have eschewed wearing ties almost entirely this season.</p>
<p>Together, they stand as examples of a line of work that, ever so gradually, is getting a bit less formal.</p>
<p>“Coaches want to present themselves in a certain way,” Capel said. “As I’ve gotten older — not older in the profession, just older — I’ve become more comfortable with who I am and what I believe in. I understand that more so now than I did years ago that not everyone is not going to believe in me and everyone’s not going to agree with the stuff that I do. That’s fine. You can’t please everyone. But when it comes to certain things like this, I’m just trying to be comfortable.”</p>
<p>Each coach arrived at their destination in a different way.</p>
<p>Capel, in his second year at Pitt, initially only wore ties this season during road games, but coming out of the tunnel after halftime at North Carolina on Jan. 8, with the Panthers trailing by nine, he took off his tie and handed it to a graduate assistant before taking the court. Pitt rallied in the second half to win by eight, its first victory ever in Chapel Hill, N.C., and Capel, an admittedly superstitious man, was done with ties.</p>
<p>For a few years, Toole experimented with wearing suits with no tie. This season, it has become more of a full-time look. Like Capel, he wasn’t trying to make any kind of a fashion statement. He just longed for more comfort in a job that can provide little of it.</p>
<p>“It allows a little less angst and discomfort as you’re in the heat of a game, whether you’re yelling, screaming or coaching,” said Toole, the Colonials’ coach since 2010. “You’re trying to figure out how to give yourself a little bit of space there with the tie and the collar.”</p>
<p>Dambrot, the oldest of the three coaches, had become disenchanted with suits and ties over the years. When he was the head coach at Ashland, a Division II school in northern Ohio, he wore a sweater, but when he was hired by Central Michigan in 1991 and joined the Division I ranks, he felt the need to conform and play the part of a coach at that level.</p>
<p>In Huggins, he found an impetus to make the change many years later. After getting approval from athletic director Dave Harper last year, Dambrot was able to make the long-awaited switch.</p>
<p>“I just don’t see the point of it,” he said of suits. “We’re basketball coaches. We’re not bankers.”</p>
<p>Dambrot isn’t the only one confused by how suits and ties became the norm among his colleagues. Most football coaches wear Polo shirts and khakis or hoodies and sweatpants on the sideline. Ridiculous as it may look, baseball managers wear a full uniform, just like their players. Hockey coaches also wear suits, but given their proximity to a giant sheet of ice, it at least serves the practical purpose of keeping them warm.</p>
<p>Though they don’t exert themselves nearly as much as their players, basketball coaches are active during games. They bark instructions, sometimes to the opposite end of the court, which can be onerous with the top button of a shirt hugging tightly against their neck. They pace the sidelines constantly. They crouch. Many sweat over the course of a game, keeping a towel nearby to wipe their face and head. Sweat-drenched players huddle over and around them.</p>
<p>Given those working conditions, a suit doesn’t seem like the most practical clothing option.</p>
<p>“It’s completely bizarre,” said Deirdre Clemente, a fashion and culture historian and a professor at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. “Not only is it counterintuitive to the nature of what they’re doing, but it’s also counterintuitive to the very nature of sports. Sportswear is the basis of the casual wardrobe.”</p>
<p>In some ways, college basketball coaching is reflective of larger trends when it comes to suits and, especially, ties.</p>
<p>In 2016, J.P. Morgan began allowing employees to wear business-casual attire on most occasions. According to Euromonitor, a research firm, the total revenue from men’s suit sales in the U.S. went from $2.2 billion in 2013 to $1.9 billion in 2018. When Dambrot was selling stocks and bonds in his 30s, he noticed coworkers in suits less. Among other things, he said it made some of their clients uncomfortable. Politics, a bastion for suits and ties, received something of a stylistic jolt over the past year with the emergence of Andrew Yang, a one-time Democratic presidential hopeful who opted for an open-collared shirt instead of a tie.</p>
<p>That change is only so pervasive. The fall of ties in American life can be overstated, and suits, even in professional environments as frenzied as the New York Stock Exchange, are still a feature of work life.</p>
<p>But for many college basketball coaches, who wear shorts and T-shirts during practices and recruit in Polo shirts and slacks, questions about the necessity of suits in 2020 remain. For some, there’s an often unstated pressure to wear one. Outside of a handful of exceptions, this is simply how things have always been done. A suit and tie commands not only authority and respect, said Patrick Hughes, a fashion historian and associate teaching professor at the Parsons School of Design in New York, but it’s the most public way a coach represents the institution that employs him.</p>
<p>Capel and Toole got their first head-coaching jobs at 27 and 29, respectively, which came with an added desire to prove themselves worthy of their positions. That feeling affected even the way they dressed.</p>
<p>“When I first got into this thing, I knew everything that was being said about me,” Capel said. “I heard it. ‘You don’t deserve this job. This is a joke.’ I felt like then that if I do this [not wear a tie], people will probably think that, especially if we don’t win. As my dad would say, this would give people the bullets to shoot you. I consciously thought about all that stuff back then.”</p>
<p>College basketball coaches, of course, haven’t always worn suits.&nbsp;Bob Knight, one of the most prominent figures in the sport’s history, regularly wore a red sweater over a button-up shirt in his 29 years at Indiana. Huggins, with his array of track suits and pullovers, has become the revered embodiment of informality in the modern game. Notre Dame’s Mike Brey and Harvard’s Tommy Amaker, both of whom were assistants at Duke when Capel was a player there in the 1990s, have been tie-less for decades, choosing instead to wear mock turtlenecks or open-collar shirts with their suits.</p>
<p>“It’s amazing that I’ve been like a fashion statement for other coaches,” Brey said. “Of course, they never copied my mock turtleneck 15 years ago. That looks so bad.”</p>
<p>Are Dambrot’s, Capel’s and Toole’s decisions a harbinger of what is to come in college basketball? Perhaps.</p>
<p>Dambrot said he has had several coaches come up to him this season saying they wish they could dress like he does during games. Capel, an aficionado of white sneakers, said he would love to get to a point where he could always wear them with his suits, like he does for annual Coaches vs. Cancer games, instead of trudging up and down the wooden floor in uncomfortable dress shoes.</p>
<p>The future of sideline attire may be what’s seen in the array of early season events in college basketball, most of which are held in tropical locations.</p>
<p>“Every coach in the country, when they watch some of those Thanksgiving tournaments in Maui, where everybody is in Polos and khaki pants, I think everyone kind of goes ‘Man, why don’t we just do that full time?’ ” Toole said.</p>
<p>Whatever that future may hold, Dambrot isn’t going to bother waiting around for it. When it comes to suits and ties, he’s never looking back. And he’s perfectly comfortable not doing so.</p>
<p>“I’m through,” he said. “This is it for me, man.”</p>
