<h1>Buying Here: Mt. Lebanon stone Tudor with 1.6 acres priced at $1.975 million </h1>

<p>When is the right time to downsize and sell your house?</p>
<p>MaryAdele and John Krolikowski have lived in a stone Tudor at <strong>54 Roycroft Ave.</strong> in Mt. Lebanon for 22 years. Their two children are married and live in Mt. Lebanon and Atlanta.</p>
<p>“I have observed it is harder to leave the family home the older you get,” said Mr. Krolikowski.&nbsp;“It isn’t easy to leave now but it will get harder over time.”</p>
<p>So the couple decided to put their 2½-story house with&nbsp;seven bedrooms, five full bathrooms, two powder rooms and 1.6 acres of woods and gardens on the market for $1.975 million (MLS No.1456287)&nbsp;with&nbsp;Melissa Prunzik and Melissa Palmer of Howard Hanna Real Estate Services (412-780-9567 or <a href="https://www.howardhanna.com/Property/Detail/54-Roycroft-Avenue-Mt-Lebanon-PA-15228/Westpenn/1456287" target="_blank">www.howardhanna.com</a>). There is a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l7_BJ8Vr8o22wK7T2VS7GKe4j1nnmDF7/view" target="_blank">virtual tour</a> and in-person tours are available under COVID-19 guidelines.</p>
<p>“There is never a great time to do it, but this is an adequate time for us to move ahead,” said Mrs. Krolikowski.</p>
<p>The gently sloping property, which covers four lots, features a fountain, a large stone patio with a gas- and wood-burning fireplace, a large side porch and stone paths that wind among beds of flowers, shrubs and 95 tall trees, each with a tag identifying its species.</p>
<p>“What truly makes this property special is the unique, private setting,” said Ms. Palmer, the agent. “The property wraps around the home perfectly, which creates a private backyard oasis. You feel like you are in the countryside.”</p>
<p>Mr. Krolikowski is the gardener in the family.</p>
<p>“I got the short straw,” he said, laughing.&nbsp;“She wouldn’t do it so I had to.”</p>
<p>The self-taught gardener cleared the paths and planted hundreds of perennials and flowering shrubs. The garden has twice been on the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/garden/2019/07/05/Mt-Lebanon-Library-Garden-Tour-2019-Stardust-Swing-party/stories/201907050015" target="_blank">Mt. Lebanon Public Library Garden Tour</a>.</p>
<p>“I have a rule: If anything dies, I just say I hated that plant anyway,” he joked. “Remember, if something grows let it be there. You have to adapt to Mother Nature because she won’t adapt to you.”</p>
<p>The trees include several sugar maples that Mr. Krolikowski and friends tap to make maple syrup. “Many of these trees are 80-100 years old so we don’t have much to do with them. We just stay out of the way.”</p>
<p>The 5,385-square-foot home was built in 1938 and includes a living room with a vaulted wood ceiling, a master suite with a private terrace and an open kitchen and family room that were part of a three-story addition done in 1982 by prior owners. There is also a butler’s pantry with a vintage refrigerator, a large laundry room, a wine tasting room and a game room with bar. Tommarello General Contractors <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2005/01/22/Extensive-retooling-of-basements-results-in-grand-playrooms/stories/200501220183" target="_blank">finished the basement in 2004</a> and updated the kitchen and master bathroom in 2011. The family wanted a higher ceiling in the basement.</p>
<p>“We dropped the original basement floor by 18 inches, which meant breaking up the concrete floor and digging it out by hand,” Mr. Krolikowski said.</p>
<p>They have kept a list of all contractors who have worked on the house. They are the third owners.</p>
<p>“The plumber, the electrician and Tony Tommarello know everything about this house,” said Mrs. Krolikowski.</p>
<p>The property’s total assessment is $919,000. Over the last three years, six houses have sold in the 100 block of Roycroft Avenue for prices ranging from $195,000 in August 2019 to $570,000 in July 2017 (<a href="http://www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx" target="_blank">www2.alleghenycounty.us/RealEstate/GeneralInfo.aspx?</a>).</p>
<p>The outdoor patio is Mrs. Krolikowski’s favorite space.</p>
<p>“We use the terrace with the gas fireplace all year long,” she said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It burns wood and has a spit for cooking turkey or lamb and there are built-in speakers for music,” he added.</p>
<p>The couple have used the patio for many celebrations, including a wedding and their 25th anniversary party.</p>
<p>“The gardens, fountain and outdoor entertaining space are so inviting and peaceful,” Ms. Palmer said. “When you combine four separate parcels with a coveted Mt. Lebanon address, you know you have something special.”</p>
