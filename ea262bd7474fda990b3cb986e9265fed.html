<h1>Steelers' Javon Hargrave heads to the Eagles in free agency</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Javon Hargrave has struck it rich as a free agent. The former Steelers nose tackle signed a three-year contract with the Eagles, hours after becoming a free agent for the first time in his career.</p>
<p>A four-year starter for the Steelers, Hargrave will make $39 million over three years with $26 million guaranteed, according to reports.</p>
<p>Hargrave was one of two high-profile Steelers free agents that were going to command big money on the open market. The Steelers <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/03/16/bud-dupree-franchise-tag-steelers-2020-kevin-colbert/stories/202003160074" target="_blank">placed the franchise tag</a> on linebacker Bud Dupree earlier Monday, preventing him from reaching free agency.</p>
<p>Once they allotted the $15.8 million to Dupree, there wasn’t enough room to keep Hargrave, too. It’s not that the Steelers did not value Hargrave. They did. But they already have two high-priced defensive linemen on their roster — Cam Heyward and Stephon Tuitt. They simply did not have room for a third, especially with Hargrave’s snaps being limited as a nose tackle.</p>
<p>A third-round pick in 2016, Hargrave played in 63 games for the Steelers with 52 starts. He recorded 14 ½ sacks. He set career highs in tackles (60) and tackles for loss (seven) last season.</p>
<p>The Steelers have several in-house options to replace Hargrave. They can use veteran Tyson Alualu as their nose tackle. He has the most experience of the backup defensive linemen on the roster. They also have veteran Dan McCullers and second-year end Isaiah Buggs.</p>
<p>Hargrave’s departure likely means the Steelers will invest one of their six draft choices in a defensive lineman.</p>
