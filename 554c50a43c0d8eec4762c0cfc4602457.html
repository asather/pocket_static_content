<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council on Tuesday again extended the cityâ€™s COVID-19 emergency disaster declaration for another week.</p>
<p>The body must vote every seven days to keep the declaration in effect.</p>
<p>The state of emergency, allowed under state law, allows the city to cancel or limit large gatherings, limit city permits, cancel or limit some city services, and cancel or limit public and private activities that could increase exposure or transmission of disease.</p>
<p>This is the fourth time council voted to extend the designation since <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/03/13/mayor-bill-peduto-press-conference-covid-19-city-response-virus-residents/stories/202003130170" target="_blank">Mayor Bill Peduto declared the emergency on March 13</a>.</p>
<p>In early April, the body voted to extend the emergency for a 26 day-stretch.</p>
