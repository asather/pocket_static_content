<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf has ordered all commonwealth flags on state facilities, public buildings and grounds to fly at half-staff until further notice in honor of victims of the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>This virus disrupts traditional gatherings such as honoring the dead, funerals and wakes, Mr. Wolf said. He said he hopes lowering flags will provide “some solace” to grieving families and friends, and serve as a reminder of the many sacrifices made during these times.</p>
<p>“Too many Pennsylvanians have lost their lives to COVID-19, and, unfortunately, many more will die,” Gov. Wolf said in a statement. “Already we have lost friends, parents, grandparents, and siblings. We have lost first responders. We have lost community members. Each of these Pennsylvanians is irreplaceable. Each deserves to be honored individually for their contributions to our commonwealth, but this cruel disease will not give us a respite to mourn.”</p>
<p>The governor asks that flags be lowered until after the crisis ends.</p>
<p>All Pennsylvanians are invited to participate in the tribute.</p>
