<html><head><title>Report: 2019 homicides in Pittsburgh lowest in two decades; rest of county struggles to match</title></head><body><p>Homicide trends in Pittsburgh have fluctuated over the years, but in 2019, the city saw its lowest total since 1998, according to city police.</p><p>In 2019, Pittsburgh saw a total of 37 homicidal deaths —&nbsp; a 35% decrease from what police reported&nbsp;in 2010. The same total was also reported in 1998, city police spokesman Chris Togneri said on Thursday. Roughly 58 total homicides remained steady between 2016 and 2018, according to annual police reports online.</p><p>A sharp spike in 2014 yielded 71 homicides in the city, police reports state, which disrupted an average of roughly 50 homicides each year.</p><p>But while data shows the city is pushing forward in decreasing its homicide total, Allegheny County as a whole is struggling to see similar trends, according to county Police Investigations Cmdr. Andrew Schurman.&nbsp;The county in 2019 did, however, see a drop from the previous year as homicides declined by 15%, according to the Allegheny County medical examiner’s office.&nbsp;</p><p>“Outside the city of Pittsburgh, the county numbers are up,” Cmdr. Schurman said Thursday.&nbsp;“In previous decades, there would be maybe 60 homicides inside the city limits, and maybe 40 outside. This decade, it’s going the other way. We’re seeing more outside the city than inside.”&nbsp;</p><p>The medical examiner’s office reported that Allegheny County in 2019 saw roughly 95 homicides —&nbsp;77 were due to shootings, six were stabbings, and six were beatings/trauma. Toxicology and testing can take several months, so the numbers aren’t quite finalized. Some cases are still pending, according to county spokeswoman Amie Downs.&nbsp;</p><p>Cmdr. Schurman said each year three outside municipalities typically have the most homicides: Wilkinsburg, McKeesport and Penn Hills. Other violence-prone areas include McKees Rocks, Stowe, Braddock and Rankin, he said.</p><p>But “they haven’t been as bad in the last few years,” he said. In 2019, Wilkinsburg had roughly 11 homicides and Penn Hills had about eight, Mr. Schurman said.&nbsp;Penn Hills and Wilkinsburg have bigger police departments and larger staffing, he said.</p><p>Areas like Turtle Creek and the Braddock area don’t have full-time departments and rely on each other for mutual aid, Cmdr. Schurman said, and a lack of manpower is partially to blame.</p><p>“They’re having trouble hiring people, and keeping people around,” he said.&nbsp;“Pay is a big reason for that.”</p><p>In recent years, Pittsburgh police implemented an 11-person Group Violence Intervention unit that targets gang violence in the city and involves the entire bureau, as well as a cadre of outside team members. Partners include probation and parole officers, community organizations and federal prosecutors, officials said.</p><p>“I think that has helped them reduce their number of homicides and maybe violent crimes,” Cmdr. Schurman said of the city.&nbsp;“We’re looking into the GVI that the city police uses to get some help moving forward.”</p><p>Cmdr. Schurman said county police in July quietly began a Violent Crime and Fire Arm Unit through Project Safe Neighborhood — which is a federally funded grant — that targets repeat offenders who may not be able to be charged with crimes due to lack of physical evidence. Since July, about 100 guns have been taken off the street through the program, he said.</p><p>“Most violent criminals are involved in the drug trafficking arena, and we use that avenue to investigate,” he said. “To date, it has been successful. We have a lot of communities we can work in, and I hope to continue that success, moving from community to community.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Lacretia Wimbley: lwimbley@post-gazette.com, 412-263-1510 or on Twitter @Wimbleyjourno.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/01/02/Report-2019-homicide-rate-in-Pittsburgh-at-lowest-in-two-decades-Allegheny-County-struggles-to-match/stories/202001020113</original_url>
