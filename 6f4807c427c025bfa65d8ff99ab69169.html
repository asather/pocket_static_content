<h1>100 years of memories on Kennywood's Jack Rabbit roller coaster</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Kennywood’s Jack Rabbit, with its clanking metal and wooden tracks, dark tunnel and infamous double dip, has enchanted thrill-seekers for 100 years.</p>
<p>The Jack Rabbit — one of six century-old roller coasters in the world — was supposed to be feted at Kennywood with a big anniversary celebration this summer. COVID-19 restrictions postponed the party, but the West Mifflin amusement park and Jack Rabbit riders are still celebrating.</p>
<p>In February, fans were asked to submit their favorite Jack Rabbit flashbacks to Kennywood for its “100 years, 100 memories” contest. Park officials received&nbsp;over 800 submissions, and picked 100 entries to win a free season pass for next summer. The winners will be announced Monday on Kennywood’s social media accounts.</p>
<p>But why wait? Here are three of our favorite memories culled from the winners:</p>
<p><strong>Tunnel of love</strong></p>
<p>Katie Richards and Santo D’Amico had their first date at Kennywood, even though Mr. D’Amico was afraid of roller coasters.</p>
<p>Ms. Richards, who is originally from the Mars area of Butler County, was attending Indiana University of Pennsylvania when she met Mr. D’Amico on an online dating app. After a few weeks of chatting, she invited him to Kennywood.</p>
<p>“I decided that I really liked him, and I could tell we clicked so I was like, ‘Do you wanna go on a trip?’”</p>
<p>How did it go?</p>
<p>“As we made our way from ride to ride, I knew my heart was falling harder than each dip of the Jack Rabbit's rolling hills,” she wrote in her contest submission.</p>
<p>Fast forward three years, to September 2019. The couple were living together in Warren, Pa., and planning a trip back to Pittsburgh to visit Kennywood and see “The Lion King” at the Benedum Center. Since it was close to the anniversary of their first date, Ms. Richards hoped he might ask her to marry him.</p>
<p>“We are not rich people and a trip like this was uncommon (we live three hours away). So I figured this would be our special moment,” she wrote.</p>
<p>Mr. D’Amico had indeed brought along an engagement ring, stashed in a pair of balled-up socks they brought to the park in their change of clothes. To make sure Kennywood’s security guards didn’t ruin the surprise, he wrote a note explaining the situation on his smartphone and planned to show it to them if they searched his bag.</p>
<p>The couple enjoyed a day of rides and Potato Patch fries, but as it came to a close, Ms. Richards was growing discouraged. Just before they left,&nbsp;Mr. D’Amico insisted they buy a souvenir to remember the day. They chose a mug and he offered to put it in their bag while she continued shopping. Ms. Richards tried not to smile.</p>
<p>“I pretty much knew what was coming, but I didn’t want to let on that I knew,” she said.</p>
<p>They were in front of Garfield's Nightmare when Mr. D’Amico asked Ms. Richards what the sign behind her said. When she turned back around, he was on one knee.</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, neither of us can remember what he said because we were both so excited,” she said, laughing.</p>
<p>The couple’s wedding is scheduled for Oct. 2, 2021, and the tickets from their first trip to Kennywood together will be on display.&nbsp;And Mr. D’Amico? He isn’t afraid of roller coasters anymore.</p>
<p><strong>It runs in the family</strong></p>
<p>The Jack Rabbit isn’t the first roller coaster visitors see when they enter Kennywood, but it’s always the first ride of the day for Laurie Rodgers’ family.</p>
<p>As a child, she attended Hampton’s school picnic days and as a mom, she joined her children for Richland days at the park.</p>
<p>“I love how you get in there and it’s a different world,” she said. “You can forget about work and all the things you have to do and you just play all day.”</p>
<p>One family trip in 2011 stands out for Mrs. Rodgers. It was the first time in&nbsp;five years that her brother, Army Staff Sgt. Shawn Barber, got to join them.</p>
<p>In 2006, he was injured during Operation Iraqi Freedom when an improvised explosive device went off next to his vehicle. He required multiple operations and was awarded the Purple Heart.&nbsp;The photo Mrs. Rodgers submitted shows her brother’s first ride on the Jack Rabbit in five years,&nbsp;after his recovery.</p>
<p>“We still laugh every time we look at it,” she said. “They were trying to make a muscle like, ‘We’re big guys on the roller coaster.’”</p>
<p>These days, he brings his daughter on family trips to the amusement park.</p>
<p>“Kennywood is truly great for making lifelong and generations of memories,” Mrs. Rodgers said.</p>
<p><strong>The longest line</strong></p>
<p>When Kaylin Blackham was struggling with infertility, she remembers an online friend comparing it to waiting in a very long line, wondering when it would finally be your turn.</p>
<p>Jack Rabbit riders know that feeling. So does&nbsp;Mrs. Blackham, who made her first visit to Kennywood in sixth grade, after her family moved to Fayette County. She and her husband, Jared, now live in Alverton, Westmoreland County, and tried for five years to have a child. She stopped going to amusement parks.</p>
<p>“I would see families with their small children or their little babies and it kind of triggers you,” she said. “You're going through this big ordeal when you're trying to grow your family. You’re not sure if you're ever gonna get that … to carry around all the supplies you might need, like diapers and diaper bags. You don’t know if you’re going to get those moments, so you kind of shy away from them.”</p>
<p>Eight years ago, it finally happened — their daughter Cassidy was born. And last summer, Mrs. Blackham was finally standing in line with a very eager 7-year-old who couldn’t wait for her first ride on a “big-kid” roller coaster, the Jack Rabbit.&nbsp;While they waited, Cassidy counted the number of people in front of them, trying to guess how many times the ride would run before it was their turn.</p>
<p>“She had no hesitation, and the line could not go quick enough for her,” her mother said.</p>
<p>“I waited 13 years to finally be able to share this moment with my first-born.... It just catches you like, Oh my goodness, we’re having that moment, that moment I’ve always hoped for and prayed for.</p>
<p>“Would I have appreciated it as much had we been able to conceive right away? I’m not so sure, but I hold onto the moments more because I know what we went through.”</p>
<p>Cassidy has a little sister now, Magnolia. She’s been to Kennywood, but she isn’t big enough yet to ride the Jack Rabbit. Her family is eagerly awaiting the day when she can join them. Let’s hope the line isn’t too long.</p>
