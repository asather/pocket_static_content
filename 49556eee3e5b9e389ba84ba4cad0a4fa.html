<h1>No doubleheader for Pirates in Cincinnati</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates will not play a doubleheader in Cincinnati Monday, a team spokesman told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette along with several other local outlets on Sunday, though the reasoning was not immediately clear.</p>
<p>Games Saturday and Sunday were postponed after an unidentified Reds player tested positive for COVID-19. The Pirates remained in Cincinnati, with the possibility that they could try to finish the series on Monday â€” an off-day for both teams.</p>
<p>This leaves the Pirates with five games to make up, with all of the postponements coming within the past seven days. The Pirates also must make up three games against the St. Louis Cardinals.</p>
<p>With Monday out, the Pirates and Reds will likely concentrate on two more September series between the clubs: Sept. 4-6 in Pittsburgh and Sept. 14-16 in Cincinnati.</p>
<p>The first of those two might work better, as both clubs are off Sept. 7.</p>
<p>The Pirates won the first game of the series, 9-6, after they scored all of their runs in the first two innings. Reds pitcher Sonny Gray shut them down in Game 2, with Cincinnati cruising to an 8-1 win.</p>
<p>The Pirates will travel Sunday and take Monday off, and they start a three-game series with the Cleveland Indians on Tuesday at PNC Park.</p>
