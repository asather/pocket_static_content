<h1>Repeat child porn offender gets a decade in prison, 25 years of probation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Fayette County man will spend 10 years in federal prison and be on probation for 25 more years after that for his second federal conviction for possession of child pornography.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Mark Hornak imposed that term Tuesday on Michael Pulliam, 37, of Fairchance.</p>
<p>State police searched Pulliam's house on June 14, 2019, and found what prosecutors called a "library"&nbsp;of child porn consisting of thousands of images and videos.</p>
<p>This is Pulliam's second conviction in federal court for child porn possession. He was convicted the first time in 2007 in U.S. District Court in Pittsburgh and sentenced to 51 months. He was still on probation from that crime when police caught him with the new collection.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Karl Lee said the 10-year sentence, the mandatory minimum, will address Pulliam's criminal history and keep him off the street.</p>
<p>"The defendantâ€™s multiple convictions and child pornography collection reveal that he has a sexual interest in young children," he said in sentencing papers. "Although the United States has no evidence that the defendant has ever touched a child in a sexual way, his decision to act in a criminal manner upon his sexual interest in children is a cause for serious concern. As such, a significant sentence will protect the public, and children, from the defendant."</p>
<p>Pulliam's lawyer, Gary Gerson, argued that his client should get the minimum 10 years but no more. He said Pulliam was introduced to child porn by his now-estranged father.</p>
<p>"While this does not excuse his offense, it is a factor that merits some consideration," he said. "And there is no evidence of inappropriate conduct involving a real-time victim in either case."</p>
<p>Pulliam pleaded guilty in June.</p>
