<p>The Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank is hosting two more emergency food distributions Monday and Tuesday.</p>
<p>Monday’s drive-thru distribution will take place at the food bank’s Duquesne site at South Duquesne Boulevard and South Linden Street.</p>
<p>Organizers said they will be able to provide two boxes of food for 1,000 vehicles.&nbsp;The food bank is asking people not to arrive before 11 a.m.</p>
<p>“Due to the high demand for assistance, to ensure as many people receive food as possible, we must adhere to this policy” of two boxes of food per car, food bank officials said.</p>
<p>For today’s distribution, the food bank is again asking people to stay in their vehicles and to unlock their trunk or backseat door so volunteers can place the food into their car.&nbsp;Distribution will end promptly at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Food will also be distributed on Tuesday from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in&nbsp;Alameda Park in Butler. About 575 vehicles will be allowed at that site, organizers said.</p>
<p>The food bank said those needing more food help should contact their local food pantry or <a href="https://www.pittsburghfoodbank.org/covid19/" target="_blank">contact the food bank</a> for help in locating a pantry near where you live.</p>
