<h1>A look at Day 2 witnesses in the Wilkinsburg mass slaying trial</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This is a running list of witnesses called each day during <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/03/Trial-begins-in-Wilkinsburg-mass-slaying-cheron-shelton-robert-thomas/stories/202002030085" target="_blank">the trial of Cheron Shelton</a>, 33, of Lincoln-Lemington, who is accused of killing five people and an unborn child on March 9, 2016, at a backyard barbecue on Franklin Avenue in Wilkinsburg.</p>
<p><strong>The victims:</strong> Siblings Jerry Michael Shelton, 35, Brittany Powell, 27, and Chanetta Powell, 25, who was eight months pregnant; and their cousins Tina Shelton, 37, and Shada Mahone, 26.</p>
<p><strong>Day 2, Feb. 4, 2020</strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Sgt. Todd Dolfi, an Allegheny County homicide detective, on the stand for 50 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Sgt. Dolfi picked up his testimony from the first day of trial, describing for jurors dozens of photographs of evidence markers, shell casings, bullet fragments and damage to 1304 and 1306 Franklin Ave.</p>
<p>“This was the most extensive crime scene that I’ve been on in my career,” he testified. Some personal effects left at the crime scene included victim Shada Mahone’s purse.</p>
<p>Sgt. Dolfi also testified about three driving tests he did to gauge the time and distance between Franklin Avenue and Homewood’s Hilltop neighborhood, where police believe Cheron Shelton obtained a gun used in the mass shooting, and where he returned to afterward.</p>
<p>On cross-examination, he acknowledged that a small pool of saliva found at the crime scene, possibly from a shooter, did not match Shelton’s DNA, and a bootprint impression from the scene was not compared to bootprints from Shelton or his former co-defendant, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/03/judge-Borkowski-drops-case-against-robert-thomas-wilkinsburg-mass-shooting/stories/202002030068" target="_blank">Robert Thomas</a>.</p>
<p><strong>2. Thomas Morgan, a scientist at the Allegheny County Medical Examiner’s Office, on the stand for 50 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Morgan cut open 48 small envelopes arrayed around him on the witness stand, each one containing a bullet’s spent cartridge case retrieved from the crime scene. There were 18 from a .40-caliber handgun and 38 from a .762-caliber rifle.</p>
<p>He explained to the jury that the spent cartridge cases can be compared to one another and to ones from other crime scenes to determine if they match and if they came from the same gun. All the spent cases for each type of bullet matched one another and came from the same gun, he told jurors. He testified that he was not asked to test the cartridge cases for DNA or fingerprints.</p>
<p>Mr. Morgan also said that the manufacturer of the ammunition found at the crime scene was not the same manufacturer of the ammunition found at the Nolan Court home associated with Shelton and searched by police.</p>
<p><strong>3. Lamont&nbsp;“Monty” Powell, one of the victims, on the stand for 15 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Police believe that Powell was the impetus for the shooting because of unsubstantiated rumors that he killed Shelton’s best friend, Calvin Doswell, in 2013. Powell, who was shot in the neck, chest, back and hand, didn’t cooperate with detectives, ignored subpoenas to testify and was finally arrested on a material witness warrant.</p>
<p>Dressed in a jailhouse jumpsuit, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/02/04/wilkinsburg-mass-shooting-cheron-shelton-lamont-powell-day-2-trial/stories/202002040103" target="_blank">he told the jury</a> that he was grilling during a cookout in the backyard of his sister, Brittany Powell, surrounded by relatives, when the shooting started.</p>
<p>Powell, who grew up in Homewood’s Hilltop section, denied killing Doswell.</p>
<p>He confirmed that he sent a social media post saying,&nbsp;“Where’s the cookout?” on the morning of the shooting while he was at home on the North Side.</p>
<p><strong>4. David Shelton, uncle of victims Jerry Shelton, Brittany, Chanetta and Lamont Powell, on the stand for 3 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Shelton, who does drug and alcohol outreach, said he saw a Facebook Live post by his niece, Brittany Powell, celebrating the nice weather of March 9, 2016, with a cookout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said his nephew, Lamont Powell, appeared in the video grilling at the Franklin Avenue address.</p>
<p><strong>5. Julie Knapp, owner of 1304 Franklin Ave., on the stand for 11 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the shooting she was splitting time between the house in Wilkinsburg, part of which she rented to Brittany Powell and her daughter, and a home in Squirrel Hill. It was her childhood home, and she still lives there today.</p>
<p>Ms. Knapp said she had a good relationship with Brittany Powell, driving her to a job interview, giving rides to her daughter and developing a rapport. She said Brittany was a dear friend of their next-door neighbor, Carla Lee.</p>
<p>She said that her ex-husband had to go to China, and when he left she spent more time in the Squirrel Hill apartment because a home repair was needed there.&nbsp;“Actually,” she said of the trip to China,&nbsp;“it saved my life, I think.”</p>
<p>Ms. Knapp left the party several hours before the shooting started, but her dog was shot in the tail, which had to be amputated. She said she hadn’t seen anyone with a gun and wasn’t aware of anyone arguing.</p>
<p><strong>6. John Ellis Jr., who was partially paralyzed in the shooting, on the stand for 7 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Ellis, who uses a wheelchair, said he suffered a spinal injury in the shooting and probably wouldn’t walk again.</p>
<p>He was at the cookout because he was living at 1306 Franklin Ave. in March 2016 with his brother and his brother’s girlfriend, Carla Lee, who was good friends with Brittany Powell.</p>
<p>Mr. Ellis recalled the weather as&nbsp;“lovely” and the party as fun, with Lamont Powell grilling&nbsp;“fat cheeseburgers” and cooking hot dogs. He said he drank Hennessy cognac for the first time.</p>
<p>When the shooting started, Mr. Ellis said it sounded like a&nbsp;“regular” gun and something used by the Army. He said he didn’t see the shooters or anyone with a gun that night.</p>
<p><strong>7. Carla Lee, who lived next door to the shooting scene and said she was Brittany Powell’s best friend, on the stand for 8 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Lee said she went upstairs to her home and passed out before the shooting started because she was so drunk.</p>
<p>She was awakened by a roommate slapping her in the face saying there was shooting next door. She looked out the window but said she didn’t see anyone with a gun.</p>
<p>Ms. Lee said Brittany Powell posted about the cookout on her status on Facebook and also put a video on Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>8. Tara Hardy, who lived in the Hilltop section of Homewood, on the stand for 10 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Ms. Hardy told the jury that she knew the whole Powell family during her decade of living on Ferris Court.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She said she knew Calvin Doswell and that the rumor on the street was that Lamont Powell and someone named Anthony had killed him in 2013.</p>
<p>Ms. Hardy testified that she saw Shelton and his former co-defendant, Robert Thomas, whose charges were dismissed Monday, on Ferris Court on the day of the Wilkinsburg shooting. They were&nbsp;“just chilling on the steps like they usually do,” she said.</p>
<p>She said that she had seen the video post about the barbecue, but said it was shot in a backyard and she did not see the house number on the video.</p>
<p><strong>9. Justin McEachern, who saw a man running on a street just after the shooting, on the stand for 6 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>At the time of the shooting, Mr. McEachern lived at 1281 Franklin Ave., across the street and down the block from the crime scene.</p>
<p>He testified that he was leaning out his window to smoke when he heard 30 to 40 gunshots and saw flashes of light. A few minutes later he said he saw someone running up Midland Street, which is perpendicular to Franklin. The person — he said he couldn’t tell race or gender -— wore a dark hooded sweatshirt and was about 5-foot-8 to 5-foot-10 and about 180 pounds.</p>
<p><strong>10. Jade Burka, intelligence analyst with the FBI, on the stand for 6 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Burka, who used to be the public safety coordinator for Pittsburgh Housing Authority for about two years before moving to the FBI in February 2018, helped locate video from Nolan, Ferris and Heart Courts for investigators.</p>
<p>He said he and the Allegheny County police reviewed video for “well over 12 hours” capturing about 48 hours of footage before and after the shootings.</p>
<p>Mr. Burka told the jury that he was asked to review a general time frame for a possible vehicle and direction of flight.</p>
<p><strong>11. Allegheny County police Detective Kevin McCue, on the stand for 28 minutes.</strong></p>
<p>The detective, a former Pittsburgh Housing Authority police officer, oriented the jury to the Hilltop section, specifically the Nolan, Ferris and Heart Court projects.</p>
<p>He testified that a person in the video got an object from behind a home on Nolan Court, arriving and leaving in a white sedan shortly before the shooting around 10:53 p.m. He said at some point two people went over a fence, entered 1214 Nolan Court, which was where Shelton’s mother lived, left in different clothes and put something in one vehicle before leaving in a different one.</p>
<p>During his testimony, prosecutors played a 69-minute video for the jury that was a montage of surveillance video from the Hilltop projects.&nbsp;</p>
