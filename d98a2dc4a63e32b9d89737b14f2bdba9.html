<h1>Oil City works to keep legacy of WWII ‘ace’ in the public eye</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A steady, gray drizzle softly blurs the outline of a marble memorial stone in a small park in Oil City on the Friday before Memorial Day. The monument, nestled among others dedicated to Polish institutions and individuals, is one of just a few physical reminders of ace pilot and war hero Col. Francis Stanley “Gabby” Gabreski, an “ace” pilot who flew missions in both WWII and the Korean War.</p>
<p>The ace designation was typically bestowed after five or more “kills.” The Oil City native downed 37 ½ enemy aircraft during 266 combat missions, his Korean missions in fighters flying at the speed of sound. He's in rare company — only five other U.S. pilots earned ace status in both WWII and Korea.</p>
<p>He returned to the states to raise his family and died in 2002 in New York.</p>
<p>Once the toast of the town, Gabreski’s legacy — permanently inscribed in the annals of history — has begun to fade from public consciousness, though a handful of mementos still evoke his memory and a more optimistic era in the city.</p>
<p>Mike Fedorek, president of the city’s Polish National Alliance chapter, maintains Polish Heritage Park, which houses the memorial stones. Also born and raised in Oil City, he’s installed an historic plaque about Gabreski outside the PNA Club building and hung photos of the ace in the interior, one painted by Pittsburgh artist James Sulkowski. There’s a lone sign on a local highway commemorating Gabreski.</p>
<p>Oil City was once home to a thriving Polish community, but Mr. Fedorek estimated that only 10% of about 700 PNA club members are Polish now.</p>
<p>“Oh jeez, yeah, some people still know the Gabreski name, but this town’s not like it used to be,” he said. “There’s hardly anyone here anymore.”</p>
<p><strong>Post-industrial</strong></p>
<p>Natalie Cubbon, projects coordinator at the Oil City library, said that anyone involved in Oil City heritage or historical societies would be keeping Gabreski’s memory alive.</p>
<p>“It’s still a name that gets tossed around some,” she said.</p>
<p>Born in 1919 to Polish immigrants, Gabreski dropped out of Notre Dame to join the Army Air Pops cadet program, and downed his first enemy fighter in 1943, a German Messerschmitt. He earned a leave of absence after 30 kills but decided to fly “just one more mission” before returning home to be married. On that final flight, Gabreski crash-landed. He eluded capture in the woods for several days but was ultimately taken by Nazi soldiers, and he spent the remainder of the war as a prisoner in Stalag Luft No. 1, a POW camp for airmen just north of Berlin.</p>
<p>After the war he married and spent a year as a civilian, but Gabreski soon rejoined the military as a test pilot before shipping off to Korea, where he flew a further 100 missions as a Commander. He claimed 6½&nbsp;kills, and his Wing (the pilots under his command) adopted an orphanage in Korea, shouldering responsibility for 300 malnourished children.</p>
<p>Gabreski&nbsp;received a hero’s welcome on his return to the U.S. and served in bases around the country before retiring from the Air Force in 1967, when he moved to Bethpage, N.Y., to become an aerospace executive.</p>
<p>He’s been inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame (1978), and there’s a bust of Gabreski at the U.S. Air Force Academy just north of Colorado Springs, Colo. On Long Island, N.Y., there’s a joint civilian-military airport named after him.</p>
<p>“Gabby Gabreski will always be a part of world history,” Mr. Fedorek said.</p>
<p>In Oil City, his house was torn down years ago and the plot of land stands empty.</p>
<p>Nestled where Oil Creek flows into the Allegheny River in Venango County, Oil City was once a thriving industrial scene and a key player in the development of the petroleum industry.&nbsp;Pennzoil, Quaker State and Wolf’s Head all used to headquarter there.</p>
<p>Now, at about 9,000 residents, the city’s population has fallen by about 25% since the 1990s. Before COVID-19 its unemployment rate was 4.9%, only a point higher than the U.S. average at the time. Mr. Fedorek, 68, said the reasons are the same as for other small Pennsylvania towns: factories closing and refineries and plants relocating out of state. The factories aren’t coming back, but Mr. Fedorek said that local leaders have approved the building of a $14 million museum dedicated to the history of the oil industry, hoping to goose the tourism industry.</p>
<p>Like the industrial boom, the Gabreski name is also fading.</p>
<p>“When he was still alive, sure, people knew about him” said Barb Crudo, former mayor of Oil City. “His family was well-known and there was a very large Polish community. But he didn’t come back here after the war. Especially young folks don’t know him as much now.”</p>
<p>Gabreski does have some distant surviving relatives in Oil City. Reached by phone and asked about the city’s memory of the ace pilot who once so captured its imagination, grand-nephew Paul Gabreski said only:&nbsp;“I don’t think I can help. I didn’t know him much.”</p>
<p><strong>Fading</strong></p>
<p>The Polish school Gabby Gabreski attended, Assumption BVM, is now St. Elizabeth of Hungary, a social services organization. (Mr. Fedorek attended school there as well and recalled having his knuckles rapped by the nuns at Assumption.)</p>
<p>The school is on a small hill in the city surrounded by homes in what used to be known as the Eighth Ward, a predominantly Polish community.</p>
<p>“These houses used to be spit-shined,” he said, gesturing towards a row of houses falling into disrepair. “Now all you find up that hill is crack and heroin.”</p>
<p>Still, Mr. Fedorek isn’t giving up on the city or on maintaining Gabreski’s memory, though his own grandkids don’t know the name.</p>
<p>He’s trying to buy a plot of land from either the city or the neighbors of the Polish National Alliance large enough to house a plane, an F-86 Sabre like Gabreski used to fly. He said he knows of several such planes in scrap yards in California.</p>
<p>“As far as folk heroes go, he’s still the big one,” he said.&nbsp;“But even in his home town where he came from he’s no big deal anymore. That’s why I want to get that plane here. To remember.”</p>
