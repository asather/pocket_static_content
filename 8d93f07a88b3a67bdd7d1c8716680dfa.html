<h1>Orchids bloom at both Phipps and the Orchid Society show</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just in time to bring some color to the gray days of late winter, many types of orchids are in bloom at two shows.</p>
<p>Hundreds of these lovely flowers are on display through March 8 at Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens in Oakland for “Out of This World,” Phipps annual orchid and tropical bonsai show.&nbsp;The plants will also have a few days in the spotlight on March 14-15 during the Orchid Society of Western Pennsylvania show being held this year at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in Bethel Park.</p>
<p>“The Phipps show highlights a few genera,” says Katherine Schuller, orchid manager at the Victorian glasshouse. The majority of the orchids used in the displays are in the genera Phalaenopsis, Spathoglottis, Oncidium, Dendrobium and Vanda.</p>
<p>The Orchid Society show is different. Members construct about 20 individual exhibits that will hold anything from miniatures to huge Cattleyas, says the society’s Nancy Kline. There will also be orchid vendors, including one from Ecuador bringing special plants from that country.</p>
<p>Though the exhibits are very different, Phipps and the orchid society are partners. Ms. Kline, a 17-year-orchid society member, is in charge of the Pfun program at Phipps, which displays plants year-round in its orchid room. The group brings volunteers in twice a month for orchid potting and maintenance. Ms. Schuller pulls orchids from the collection that need attention.</p>
<p>“As the manager of the orchid collection, I view the collaboration with the orchid society to be an invaluable resource,” says Ms. Schuller, “Without their help and guidance, I would not have the success that I have had.</p>
<p>“I knew very little about orchids when I started caring for the collection. They have helped in every step from watering and fertilization to more complicated things like re-potting and plant division.”</p>
<p>The society and Phipps go way back. The first meeting of the group took place at Phipps in 1954, and Phipps now takes care of the Barbara Tisherman Slipper Orchid Collection. Ms. Tisherman, a society member, donated the collection to Phipps, and a memorandum of understanding requires that the society be involved in maintaining this important collection.</p>
<p>Orchids tend to become addictive, says Ms. Kline. She became interested in the plants when she picked one out of the garbage, literally.</p>
<p>“I was walking one day and someone in my neighborhood had put a beautiful gift orchid on the lid of their garbage can. It was a phal (Phalaenopsis) and it took so little care. It bloomed so long I thought it was a fake plant. After that I went to a show and that was the end of it,” she says.</p>
<p>She’s been growing them ever since.</p>
<p>The Orchid Society has quite a diverse membership, with people of all ages and walks of life at monthly meetings, usually held at the Phipps Garden Center in Shadyside. It is a very welcoming group who all share a love of these interesting plants.</p>
<p>But it’s easy to get hooked, says Ms. Kline, quoting late orchid vendor Joe Kunisch: “You can get off alcohol, drugs, women, food and cars, but once you are hooked on orchids you are finished. You never get off orchids, ever.“</p>
