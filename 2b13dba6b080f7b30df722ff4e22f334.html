<h1>Penn State lands commitment from QB Beau Pribula</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even in most uncertain times, there are absolute universal truths in college football. Recruiting can't stop and won't stop, especially when you're a program like Penn State.</p>
<p>Head coach James Franklin tweeted the signal that another addition to the incoming class of 2022 was on the way. A few minutes later, York native and three-star quarterback Beau Pribula announced that he was joining four-star tight end Jerry Cross and four-star wide receiver Kaden Sanders as recent commits to Penn State.</p>
<p>Pribula is 6-foot-2, 195 pounds, and threw for 1,006 yards on 66 completions to go with six touchdowns. He also scored 10 touchdowns on the ground with 298 yards.</p>
<p>Offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca was the primary recruiter for Pribula.&nbsp;He chose the Nittany Lions over schools such as Rutgers, Northwestern, and Nebraska.</p>
