<h1>Pirates sign catcher John Ryan Murphy to minors deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Ahead of a busy Friday of arbitration decisions, the Pirates made a move to add to their catching depth by signing John Ryan Murphy to a minor league contract. Murphy's deal comes with a spring training invite.</p>
<p>The 29-year-old started the 2019 season with the Arizona Diamondbacks, where he hit .177 in 25 games with 11 hits in 62 at-bats. The Diamondbacks designated him for assignment and the Atlanta Braves claimed him off waivers.</p>
<p>Murphy is a .219 career hitter in his seven big league seasons. His best batting averages came in 2014 (.284) and 2015 (.277) for the New York Yankees.</p>
<p>Murphy has a reputation as a good pitch framer and being a sound defender.&nbsp;He will compete with Jacob Stallings and the recently signed Luke Maile for playing time during spring training.</p>
<p>Murphy should have some familiarity with the Pirate City facility and LECOM Park as a native of Bradenton, Fla.</p>
<p>The Pirates also gave infielder Jake Elmore a non-roster invite to spring training. Elmore played in 20 games for the Pirates in 2019, hitting .213 in 47 at-bats.</p>
