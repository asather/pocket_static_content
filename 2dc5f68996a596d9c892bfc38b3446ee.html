<h1>Consol wants a competitor liquidated, angering the miner’s union</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Consol Energy Inc. has drawn the wrath of two of the coal industry’s loudest voices: Murray Energy and the United Mine Workers of America.</p>
<p>Murray Energy — the bankrupt Ohio-based coal company and the largest private coal operator in the U.S. —&nbsp;is trying to reorganize under a mountain of debt, in the midst of a bad and worsening coal market and, now, a global pandemic. It filed for bankruptcy protection in October and, earlier this year, reached a settlement with its largest debt holders and the union to emerge from bankruptcy by shedding liabilities.</p>
<p>But last week, Consol —&nbsp;an unsecured creditor that believes it will be shortchanged if the settlement is approved —&nbsp;charged that Murray’s mismanagement and alleged self-dealing warrants a court-appointed examiner. That is, if the court doesn’t just move the company into liquidation, as Consol has asked.</p>
<p>This brought the usually fiery international president of the UMW to a Zoom press conference Thursday.</p>
<p>He began somberly, by noting the toll that COVID-19 has had on the country, on health care, and other essential workers and those most vulnerable.</p>

<p>It was a smooth segue into his central claim: that Consol Energy is callously using this time of grave trouble to knock a competitor out of the play pit.</p>
<p>Liquidation would almost certainly mean that many of Murray’s mines would be closed, Cecil Roberts said.</p>
<p>“This is clearly an attempt by a coal company to eliminate a very viable competitor,” he alleged. “I cannot think of a more despicable act of any employer in this nation than that committed by Consol.”</p>
<p>Consol’s spokesman Zach Smith said the company asked the court to consider Murray’s liquidation because the move is about “preserving our rights and interests in these complicated court proceedings to ensure the jobs and livelihoods of our nearly 2,000 miners, their families and the communities that depend on our operations.</p>
<p>“We are navigating through the same market conditions and unprecedented economic challenges as others, and the suggestion of ulterior motives is shortsighted,” he said.</p>
<p>What binds Consol and Murray is 7-year-old deal that is now central to the bankruptcy.</p>
<p>In 2013, Consol sold to Murray five West Virginia coal mines —&nbsp;transferring the health care liabilities that went along with them and creating certain leasing arrangements that still exist and give Consol its stake in the bankruptcy proceedings.</p>
<p>That deal built in protections for miners who retired from those mines, stipulating that should Murray default on its benefit obligations to them, Consol would be responsible for making good on them.</p>
<p>Since Murray filed for bankruptcy, Consol has publicly downplayed the risk that might pose for the Cecil-based miner.</p>
<p>“In the event of Chapter 11 reorganization, we do not believe there is any basis for Consol to be liable for the Murray liabilities,” Consol’s CEO Jimmy Brock told an analyst during an earnings call in November.</p>
<p>Consol has maintained from the beginning of the bankruptcy that Murray shouldn’t be allowed to spread its financial pain over all of its subsidiaries and mines. More to the point, Consol claimed that the five mines it sold to Murray in 2013 are the company’s strongest-performing assets and don’t need to be reorganized.</p>
<p>It bid on one of them and on Murray’s river fleet that hauls coal to customers when the whole company was put up for sale during the bankruptcy, according to Mr. Roberts, who believes Consol did this to undermine Murray.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Consol has accused the union and Murray of&nbsp;colluding to dump health care liabilities on Consol — the same health care liabilities that Consol transferred to Murray Energy in 2013.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The new settlement secures UMWA’s blessing for Murray to reject its health care obligations to those miners, and, under the Coal Act, would shift them onto Consol.</span></p>
<p>The cost of these liabilities is a topic of debate in Murray’s bankruptcy, but is estimated to be around $2 million a month, tapering with each subsequent year as beneficiaries die off.</p>
<p>Murray says it cannot handle that amount if it is to emerge from bankruptcy as a viable mining company under the ownership of its debt holders. If it cannot rid itself of these liabilities, Murray told the court, it will be forced to liquidate.</p>
<p>Now Consol is asking for just that. A hearing on Consol’s liquidation motion is set for May 18.&nbsp;</p>
