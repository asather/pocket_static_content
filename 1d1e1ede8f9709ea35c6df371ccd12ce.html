<h1>Stowe man charged with inciting a riot, stomping on police vehicle during Pittsburgh protest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Authorities arrested a Stowe man on charges that he stood on top of a Pittsburgh police cruiser and smashed one of its windows during a protest outside PPG Paints Arena, Downtown.</p>
<p>Dajon Lengyel, 22, is charged with&nbsp;criminal mischief, institutional vandalism and riot, in connection with the May 30 incident. Hundreds attended the protest against racial injustice after the Memorial Day police killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh police obtained a warrant for Mr. Lengyel’s arrest, and he was apprehended by Allegheny County sheriff’s deputies Monday night at a house on Stowe Avenue.</p>
<p>Mr. Lengyel is accused of stomping on the police vehicle, swinging a traffic cone through a window of the vehicle and encouraging others to “join in&nbsp;on the destruction of the police cruiser,” the sheriff’s office said.</p>
<p>He was arraigned early Tuesday and is being held at the Allegheny County Jail on $25,000 bond, according to court records. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for July 20.</p>
