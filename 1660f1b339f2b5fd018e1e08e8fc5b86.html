<h1>So, kid, you wanna be a CEO?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just about any job in college will yield a paycheck, and some are good for academic credit, too.</p>
<p>But a pair of cafes due to open on the University of Pittsburgh campus this fall will offer undergraduate business majors something extra: A chance to be the boss.</p>
<p>Pitt and its College of Business Administration have inked a deal with Saxbys, a Philadelphia-based coffee company, to open what will be two completely student-run outlets, one in the Cathedral of Learning and the other in Hillman Library.</p>
<p>At both locations, Saxbys will pick an undergraduate business major to spend a semester as “Student Cafe Executive Officer.” The individual will oversee all cafe operations, from completing financial reports and overseeing team development to hiring, at venues staffed entirely by Pitt students enrolled in various majors.</p>
<p>The student CEOs will receive competitive pay, the chance for bonuses and 12 academic credits for the semester, the parties said.</p>
<p>What Saxbys calls its Experiential Learning Program is another layer of the increasingly complex synergy between retailers eager to tap the college market and universities that recognize competing for top students means distinguishing themselves from rivals.</p>
<p>Wander streets in any prominent college town, be it Oakland or State College or Ann Arbor, Mich., and there is no shortage of attractive retail brands on and off campus. Eateries in dorms. Retail on the ground floor of classroom buildings.</p>
<p>But merging campus employment with degree pursuit — in this case by turning each cafe into a learning lab — takes the relationship to another level.</p>
<p>This is Saxbys first foray into the Pittsburgh market, but it has 10 campus cafes at eight other Pennsylvania and Maryland institutions, among them Penn State, Temple and Millersville universities, officials with the company said.</p>
<p>The cafes are “a great way to enable students to put what they learn in the classrooms into practice in an integrative context,” said Arjang A. Assad, dean of the Joseph M. Katz Graduate School of Business and College of Business Administration.</p>
<p>Undergraduates hired as student CEOs receive training and mentoring. That’s good, because along with loss-profit decisions, they could be pitching in with frontline customer service chores depending on the crush of customers that day.</p>
<p>Mr. Assad said the two student CEOs at Pitt “will work together with their peers from various majors to develop skills and promote teamwork to help them succeed in the future.” The two will be chosen later this semester.</p>
<p>It is a first-of-its-kind program on Pitt’s campus, but one consistent with a business college that long has prided itself on experiential learning, said Liz Adams, director of academic advising in the business college.</p>
<p>“We think this is sort of the ultimate real-world scenario,” she said. “They are actually running a coffee shop, doing sales, marketing, hiring.”</p>
<p>She said the student CEOs will complete internship coursework and independent study, as well as project work under supervision of faculty.</p>
<p>One of the Saxbys will be located on the Cathedral’s ground floor.</p>
<p>In Hillman Library, the Cup &amp; Chaucer Cafe will be renovated to become the other Saxbys.</p>
<p>Both locations have facilities for such a retail operation and “a lot of foot traffic,” Ms. Adams said.</p>
<p>The Experiential Learning Program run by Saxbys, whose founder and CEO is&nbsp;Nick Bayer, dates back almost five years to its first location at Drexel University.</p>
<p>In the years since, Saxbys has added locations in Pennsylvania and Maryland that include: Temple University, Penn State University, Bowie State University, Millersville University, La Salle University, West Chester University and St. Joseph’s University.</p>
<p>The campus theme at each location ecompasses interior design and even artwork on display.</p>
<p>The Saxbys at Temple, a 900-square foot space on Liacouras Walk, serves 1,000 or so customers each day from morning until night, according to company officials. Its decor is adorned by rotating murals by students from the university’s Tyler School of Art and Architecture, its website says.</p>
<p>The site touts “our patterned ceiling and floor tiles which artfully mirror the walking quad on campus.”</p>
<p>The Saxbys at Penn State’s Smeal College of Business is its largest student-led cafe to date, with its student CEO overseeing 100 peers who serve breakfast, lunch and dinner from eggs and pastries to house-made salads and sandwiches, according to Saxbys officials.</p>
<p>The outlet is “is crafted for students, by students” including art on the walls from student muralists and a photographer. Four live class projects across Marketing, Sustainability, Supply Chain, and Finance departments help maintain the academic component of the program.</p>
<p>At Millersville, the Saxbys is in Gordinier Hall, a former faculty dining hall. A community chalkboard for student art is intended give young artists exposure for the work. The cafe, says Saxbys, operates mornings on Mondays through Fridays, with day and night hours on the weekends.</p>
