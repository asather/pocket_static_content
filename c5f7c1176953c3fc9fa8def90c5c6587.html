<h1>Head-on Butler County crash kills one driver, leaves other in critical condition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Butler County man died Monday night after a head-on collision on Route 19 in Jackson that left the other driver in critical condition.</p>
<p>Michael Slavin, 67, of Lancaster was headed northbound in a Toyota Corolla when he crossed the center line of the road, also known as Perry Highway, and crashed into a 2004 Ford Focus driven by Shana Weiss, 40, of Sewickley, according to Jackson police Chief Terry Seilhamer.</p>
<p>The crash happened around 7:40 p.m. Mr. Slavin was taken by ambulance to Allegheny General Hospital in Pittsburgh, where he died at 10:13 p.m., authorities said.</p>
<p>Ms. Weiss was taken by helicopter to UPMC Presbyterian.</p>
<p>Both drivers had to be extricated from their vehicles but were conscious and talking to first responders at the crash scene between Little Creek and Mercer roads.</p>
<p>There were no passengers in either car.</p>
<p>Police are awaiting the results of toxicology tests on the drivers. Chief Seilhamer said the investigation was complicated by the fact that Mr. Slavin had several cases of beer in his car which exploded upon impact.</p>
<p>“So that smell was everywhere,” the chief said.</p>
<p>There were no issues with weather, mechanical problems or speed, the chief said, and while the road has a slight curve in the area of the crash, the sight lines are good, he said.</p>
