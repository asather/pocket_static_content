<p>An avian altercation was caught on camera today when an immature bald eagle boldly landed in the nest being refurbished by the Hays bald eagles, Allegheny County residents since 2013.</p>
<p>The resident male was working in the nest, seemed distracted and flew off. Seconds later another eagle, younger and without the distinctive white head, landed in the bowl.</p>
<p>It looked around, took a few steps and -- BAM! -- in a dramatic raptor row it was knocked out of the nest by the diving adult male.</p>
<p>Rachel Handel, spokeswoman for Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania, said it could not be determined if the intruder had fledged from the nest and was merely visiting its former home.</p>
<p>“Because the birds are not banded, it’s impossible to definitively say that this isn’t one of the Hays offspring. But given the surge in numbers of Bald Eagles in this region, the most likely scenario is that this is a non-related bird is just passing through the area,” she said. “The juvenile bald eagle’s head is turning white, indicating that it’s nearly 5 years old and ready to find a mate. This juvenile likely saw an opportunity to claim an already-constructed nest.”</p>
<p>Several years ago a bald eagle swooped over the Hays nest, causing some discomfort among the resident pair. Once juveniles fledge the nest, said Ms. Handel, parents drive them away and will aggressively protect the territory, even from their own offspring.</p>
<p>The camera that captured the encounter is operated by CSE in Monroeville in partnership with the Audubon Society of Western Pennsylvania.</p>
