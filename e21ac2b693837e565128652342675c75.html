<h1>RMU dominates LIU, moves on to NEC championship game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Morris lost the opening tip on Saturday against LIU in the Northeast conference semifinals. That was just about the only time the Colonials didn’t have momentum.</p>
<p>Immediately after LIU forward Jack Ballantyne secured the tip, Robert Morris guard Dante Treacy stole it from him, raced up the court and fed junior forward AJ Bramah for a lay-in just 12 seconds into the game. Bramah blocked a shot on the other end moments later, which led to a 3-pointer from fifth-year senior Josh Williams.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Less than 30 seconds after that, Treacy hit a three of his own, forcing the Sharks to take a timeout and putting the Colonials squarely in the early driver’s seat. In the blink of an eye, Robert Morris led, 16-2 a little more than four minutes into the game.</p>
<p>The Colonials never relinquished control, leading wire-to-wire to secure a spot in the NEC championship game for the first time since 2015, beating LIU, 86-66.</p>
<p>“I thought we got off, obviously, to a great start,” coach Andy Toole said after the game.&nbsp;“... But it was really our defense that carried us. Holding them to two points in the first [four] minutes, for a team that averages 77 a game, I think, is a tribute to the way these guys were moving their feet. They were reacting to the flight of the ball. They were communicating on screening coverages. And then obviously, we were able to kind of ride that start to the victory.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The most threatening run the Sharks made was at the beginning of the second half. Thanks to some strong defensive pressure that took the Colonials out of their offense, LIU put together a quick 7-0 run out of the break to cut Robert Morris’ lead to eight points. But that run was quickly ended when Williams canned a 3-pointer from the right wing, motioning for everybody to calm down once the shot went in.</p>
<p>After the 16:26 mark in the second half, the Colonials never allowed their lead to drop below double digits. Interestingly, though, Robert Morris’ second half offensive performance was a drop-off from its first half. That was mostly because the Colonials shot the lights out in the first half, hitting 60% from the floor and 46.2% from three to open up a 15-point, 43-28 lead going into the half.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most impressive part of Robert Morris’ game was that it got contributions from everyone. All eight players who got action scored at least three points. Five of them — Bramah (18), Williams (15), Treacy (12), sophomore guard Jalen Hawkins (13) and junior guard Jon Williams (11) — finished in double digits. Plus, the colonials finished with 20 assists, proving the team-centric style of offense they played.</p>
<p>“I think that’s the most exciting thing about playing a team sport is that you can get everybody engaged and active into the game,” Josh Williams said.&nbsp;“To see everybody be able to go out there and have fun and score the ball in the fashion that we did is a testament to how talented we really are.”</p>
<p>Bramah got the honor of putting the finishing touches on the game, as he threw down a one-handed alley-oop with a minute left to remove all doubt, sending&nbsp;the Colonials to an NEC championship face-off with St. Francis (PA) at the UPMC Events Center next Tuesday.</p>
<p>“It’s a great feeling, but I’d hate to get there and not end up with the championship,” Josh Williams said.&nbsp;“So as good of a feeling as it is, I won’t be completely satisfied until we’re cutting down nets and we’re holding up trophies.”</p>
