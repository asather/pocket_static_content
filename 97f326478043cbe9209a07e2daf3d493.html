<h1>Washington County woman pleads guilty to endangering children at Bethel Park day care</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Washington County woman on Wednesday pleaded guilty to three counts of endangering the welfare of children after giving a 7-month-old girl a skull fracture at a Bethel Park day care.</p>
<p>Tiffany Williams, 24, of New Eagle, was charged in 2017 after several incidents of mishandling infants while she was working at Tutor Time day care.</p>
<p>According to a criminal complaint, investigators observed security video of Williams working at the care center on September 8, 2017, and throwing the 7-month-old victim on the ground twice.</p>
<p>Seconds later, she threw the infant down again, this time tossing her into a pile of blocks and causing the toys to scatter on the ground.</p>
<p>The video also shows Williams forcefully putting the child into her lap so that the baby hit her head on Williams’ knee. The caretaker then forcibly put the girl onto a boppy pillow, the complaint reads.</p>
<p>The baby is seen crying throughout the video.</p>
<p>The footage shows “several” incidents of Williams mishandling infants at the day care, the complaint says.</p>
<p>Williams can be seen throwing two blocks at another baby who is laying on a mat, and later cleaning the baby’s face in a&nbsp;“forceful manner” before&nbsp;“she tosses the baby behind a counter and out of sight,” Detective Eric Humbert wrote in the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Later, she twice puts the baby on a boppy pillow forcefully enough that the back of the baby’s head hits the floor.</p>
<p>Williams appeared remotely in front of Judge Alex Bicket on Wednesday. Following an agreement from the Allegheny County District Attorney’s office, she received three concurrent terms of 18 months probation in exchange for the guilty plea.</p>
<p>She was also ordered to have no contact with the 7-month-old’s family and must take parenting classes.</p>
<p>The plea means she is banned for life from receiving a <a href="https://www.dhs.pa.gov/providers/Providers/Pages/Child-Abuse-Clearances.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8BPA%20Child%20Abuse%20Clearances&amp;text=The%20purpose%20for%20requiring%20clearances,select%20them%20as%20a%20volunteer." target="_blank">child abuse clearance</a>, which is required in order to work or volunteer with children.</p>
