<h1>Jonas Salk's son sees hope in COVID-19 efforts, still pushing for polio eradication</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As horrific as it is, it is not lost on Peter Salk, that this year’s 65th anniversary of the announcement on April 12, 1955, that his father, Jonas Salk, had created the polio vaccine, comes in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic that has researchers across the globe racing to create a vaccine.</p>
<p>“We’ve seen so much success with vaccines over the years, with polio and even influenza,” said Dr. Salk, who lives in California where he is president of the Jonas Salk Legacy Foundation, as well as a visiting professor of infectious disease and microbiology at the University of Pittsburgh, where his father created the polio vaccine. “But I know now with this coronavirus, there is the feeling of helplessness, that there is nothing you can do.”</p>
<p>“And there is a lot of controversy over how this pandemic has been handled around the world,” he added. “But what’s stood out for me is the way people have come together and sheltered in place. The degree of societal cohesión, how humanity has coalesced around this. My hope is that this is the silver lining in this.”</p>
<p>“I’m just hoping one side of this experience is that we’ll come out of this on the other side as more cooperative, nationally and internationally,” he said.</p>
<p>His father spent seven years researching and creating the polio vaccine, which at the time was considered the most feared disease in the U.S. because of its impact on children in particular.</p>
<p>The infectious disease, spread through infected fecal matter and saliva, infected about 40,000 people a year in the U.S., and 600,000 a year around the world, many of them children, in the years before the vaccine was introduced. In many cases, people recovered from its effects of muscle weaknesses and other impacts, but in thousands of cases each year, people died, or exhibited various levels of paralysis.</p>
<p>Before his father’s vaccine, one case of polio in a neighborhood or town could cause people to avoid a pool, park, building or town if people believed that was where a child was infected.</p>
<p>Dr. Salk, now 76, said he recalled one summer his parents said they were not taking a regular trip from their summer home on Lake Erie to Cedar Point amusement park in Sandusky, Ohio, “because of the possibility of a polio case there.”</p>
<p>When the polio vaccine was in clinical trials, Dr. Salk’s father signed him and his brother up as test subjects, as were thousands of other kids in the Pittsburgh area. Like the rest of the country, he cheered when polio was virtually eliminated from the U.S. just seven years later, with a 97% reduction in cases after the vaccine was introduced.</p>
<p>Dr. Salk said as proud as he is about his father’s accomplishments, he remains troubled by the lingering presence of polio in pockets around the planet, primarily in poorer countries because of a combination of vaccine problems and poor decisions by local governments.</p>
<p>Last year, he said, there were 175 cases of naturally occurring “wild” polio cases in Afghanistan and Pakistan. There were another 364 cases of polio caused by the oral vaccine version, which uses a live polio virus to create immunity in people.</p>
<p>The problem, he said, is that the oral vaccine version can get lodged in people’s stomachs and grow into the virus itself, triggering the disease instead of conferring immunity against polio. The vaccine appears to grow in locations where residents have high levels of malnutrition and there may be other, competing viruses running through a community.</p>
<p>The result, he said, is an ongoing, frustrating battle to stamp out the last few cases in the world.</p>

<p>“One one side of the conversation, this is a tremendous amount of progress from where we were not so long ago,” he said. “But on the other hand, there are too many cases occurring, when we had a chance to completely eradicate the disease.”</p>
<p>He worries, now, however, that the coronavirus will ended up causing problems in the fight against polio.</p>
<p>“I think the [polio] eradication program is going to take a hit from some of the coronavirus efforts, because of the focus [in funding and research] on the coronavirus,” he said.</p>
<p>He said he has watched happily as two teams of researchers at his and his father’s academic home, the University of Pittsburgh, have announced two different <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/02/27/Pitt-lab-working-to-create-vaccine-for-COVID-19-coronavirus-pittsburgh/stories/202002270194" target="_blank">COVID-19 vaccine projects.</a></p>
<p>“These are two, really important efforts at the University of Pittsburgh. I hope the best for them,” he said.</p>
<p>He has taken particular note of one part of one of the teams’ efforts, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/region/2020/04/02/Pitt-team-makes-progress-on-possible-COVID-19-vaccine/stories/202004020135" target="_blank">by researchers Dr. Andrea Gambotta and Dr. Louis Falo</a> at Pitt.</p>
<p>Dr. Falo has been working for some time on a so-called “microneedle array” to get a vaccine into a person’s body rather than a needle injection, or an oral liquid, which both have problems. The microneedle would be placed on a person’s skin, like a Band-Aid, and the vaccine would be in the needles themselves as a mixture of sugar and a target protein, and simply be absorbed into the skin.</p>
<p>“I have an affinity with the microneedle array for use in the polio vaccine,” he said. “It may also have to do with my childhood dislike for needles.”</p>
<p>Whichever vaccine ultimately is shown to work, Dr. Salk said he hopes the desires for speed won’t outrun the desire for safety.</p>
<p>“One has to be careful in introducing new vaccines,” he said. “We have to go as quickly as we can but we have to go cautiously. We shouldn’t just introduce a vaccine that came through just a basic clinical trial.”</p>
<p>He said while he hopes any of the teams around the world put the first COVID-19 vaccine together, given his father’s work there on the polio vaccine, there would be “some poetry” if the COVID-19 vaccine was discovered at the University of Pittsburgh.</p>
