<h1>Oh, how draft speculation has changed since the Steelers took Plaxico Burress 20 years ago</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the lead-up to the Steelers making the eighth overall pick in 2000, the rare occasion of having a top-15 selection two years in a row, there was no shortage of intrigue surrounding their options.</p>
<p>You had Chad Pennington, the brainy quarterback with the big numbers from the small school. His lack of arm strength made him a stretch as a top-10 pick, though.</p>
<p>There was Shaun Ellis, the dancing bear of a defensive end who was huge and quick for his size and a safe bet to be an immediate contributor.</p>
<p>Maybe Travis Taylor, a productive pass-catcher out of Florida who ran a 4.43 40-yard dash that had to be appealing to a team that needed a receiver.</p>
<p>But most of all, the talent was apparent in Plaxico Burress. At 6-feet-5 ½ and 231 pounds, he was built like a more physical version of Randy Moss. He was a touchdown-maker at Michigan State, a red-zone threat and splash-play producer who had 20 scores and more than 2,000 yards receiving over two years.</p>
<p>The Steelers were about to make their highest draft pick since 1989 and, accordingly, pay out their most exorbitant rookie salary of all time. Plus, they had a new man running the show in first-year director of football operations Kevin Colbert. They needed to get this one right, needed to find a surefire future star.</p>
<p>“If we can spend as much money as we’re going to spend on him and pass on as many good players as we’re going to pass on at that pick, this guy hopefully someday will be a Pro Bowl player … at some point better be a Pro Bowl player,” Colbert said then, days before the draft.</p>
<p>Oh, how times have changed. Can you imagine Colbert — or head coach Mike Tomlin, for that matter — coming out now and placing such high expectations on a to-be-determined draft pick? Can you imagine Colbert tipping his hand as to what positions the Steelers might be looking at the most?</p>
<p>“I think we need a weapon offensively. I don't think we had a good weapon or a good set of weapons here last year,” he said at the same news conference in April 2000. “The offensive line wasn't as strong as it needed to be last year. And, defensively, I don’t think there’s an impact player, not like they’ve had here in the past. That’s general, but that’s kind of what we think it is.”</p>
<p>Sure enough, a week later, they used their first pick on a receiver, second pick on an offensive lineman, and next two on defensive players. Don't count on Colbert or Tomlin to be nearly as transparent when they preview the 2020 draft.</p>
<p>But that just goes to show how this slice of the NFL offseason has changed over the years, even in the past two decades since Colbert has been at the top of the front office in Pittsburgh. Back when he started, it wasn't uncommon to shed some light on what the team was thinking about players coming out of college. Check out these quotes for a study in pre-draft soundbite evolution:</p>

<p>Colbert in 2000 on rumors about character issues with Burress: “I’ve heard numerous things about this kid and I can't get anybody to say anything bad about him. That’s the honest-to-God truth. The kid is getting a ton of publicity, and I think the more people talk about it the bigger the stories get. We’ve done extensive research on him, not only him but all these guys.”</p>
<p>Colbert in 2000 on Pennington, who was most widely assumed to be the Steelers’ target until he wasn't: “Chad Pennington is an exceptional quarterback who’s been productive, won games and won championships. Everybody talks about the level of competition. You know, the Mid-American Conference is Division I football, probably not as good or produced as many players as some of the other big conferences. But the kid has won, the kid has produced.”</p>
<p>Colbert in February 2020 at the NFL combine, when asked about seeing Oregon quarterback Justin Herbert in-person at a game last season: “I never talk about an individual player. It was a great day, a great setting. We played in San Francisco the next day, which wasn’t so great. But I never talk about an individual player.”</p>
<p>And these days, the players, too, are much more savvy, for the most part. Go back to that 2000 run-up to the draft, and Oklahoma offensive lineman Stockar McDougle — who likely was on the Steelers’ radar but wound up going 20th overall — had no problem divulging a secret.</p>
<p>“[The Steelers] told me they would take me if the opportunity arose and if I was available,” said McDougle, who had a pre-draft visit in Pittsburgh. “And if that receiver from Michigan State was gone.”</p>
<p>Yes, the front office had sprung a 6-foot-6, 340-pound leak. In the end, it didn't matter much, considering they rebuffed various offers to trade the No. 8 pick, and they did take the enigmatic Burress, despite all the buzz about his bad attitude, missed workouts and clashes with coaches at Michigan State. Burress never did make a Pro Bowl, and his NFL career was rocky at times off the field, but Colbert and company have won two Super Bowls between then and now.</p>
<p>The Steelers will continue doing their due diligence on draft candidates, including the ones with personality concerns, and keep making tough decisions. You just won't hear nearly as much about it as you once did.</p>
