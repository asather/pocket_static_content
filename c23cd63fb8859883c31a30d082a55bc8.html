<h1>Retired priest, 89, sentenced for sexual assault of boy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A judge Thursday morning proclaimed a sentence of nine to 24 months for a retired Catholic priest convicted last year of sexually assaulting an 11-year-boy in 2001.</p>
<p>The Rev. Hugh Lang, 89, a one-time school superintendent for the Diocese of Pittsburgh, sat stoically as the sentencing was read, leaning forward with his arms folded on the defense table.</p>
<p>He was dressed in a black suit but with an open-collar shirt, minus the clerical collar he had worn for more than six decades, because he has been on administrative leave since the allegation became known in 2018.</p>
<p>Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Anthony Mariani delayed finalizing the sentence pending an afternoon hearing on a procedural matter.</p>
<p>Lang’s attorney said he would be appealing the verdict, which would give him the right to ask to be out on bail pending appeal.</p>
<p>Lang was convicted in November on one felony and five misdemeanors for sexually assaulting a boy who had made a joke at the priest’s expense during a summer camp for altar servers at St. Therese Parish, where Lang was pastor at the time.</p>
<p>Lang denied his guilt during the trial and did not give a statement at his sentencing..</p>
<p>The victim, now 30, and his parents were present at the hearing, and each provided emotionally moving impact statements to the judge.</p>
<p>“Before 2001, my son and I were friends,” the victim’s father said, recalling teaching his son German and playing chess with him. But after that, the son couldn’t wait to get out of the house and cause mischief and eventually to move “as far away from Pittsburgh as possible.”</p>
<p>The father said he and his wife struggled with the “living hell” of how to deal with him, their marriage strained nearly to the breaking point, and only years later learned it was because “of Hugh Lang’s selfish actions.”</p>
<p>“It undermined the solidarity and well-being of our family, but we weren’t the ones at fault,” he said.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Gregory Stein read the victim’s own impact statement.</p>
<p>The victim said he flew thousands of miles from his current home in Southeast Asia here, requiring him to “rip open this wound all over again.” But he said it was important to bring “some justice to the 11-year-old boy I was”</p>
<p>In words similar to his testimony in November, the victim recalled being an 11-year-old boy at a summer program for altar servers when, in an attempt to impress peers with humor, he made a crass joke that Father Lang probably drank all the excess communion wine.</p>
<p>He said an enraged Father Lang later took him to an isolated basement room, forced him to undress, took a Polaroid photo of him, fondled him and forced the boy to use his hand on Lang’s penis to perform a sex act.</p>
<p>He said Lang ordered him not to tell anyone and that the photo effectively kept him silent because, as a self-conscious, overweight boy, he was terrified of anyone seeing it.</p>
<p>“He was supposed to be my spiritual mentor, he said, but Lang shattered his ideals and sent him spiraling through years of depression, broken relationships and drug and alcohol abuse.</p>
<p>While the victim testified that Lang assaulted him during the camp, the trial judge concluded it happened later that month after a different activity.</p>
<p>Also present at the sentencing were numerous supporters of Lang, including a retired bishop, two priests and a nun who testified to what they described as his sterling character.</p>
<p>Bishop William Winter, retired auxiliary bishop of the Diocese of Pittsburgh, said Lang was a childhood friend and that they have each served as a priest in the diocese for more than six decades. “He is as trustworthy as anyone I ever knew,” Bishop Winter said.</p>
<p>The Rev. Mark Eckman, vicar for clergy for the diocese, made similar accolades and said that besides this case, “there has been no complaint of any sort against Father Lang, sexual or not.”</p>
<p>He and Bishop Winter both identified themselves to the court by their titles with the diocese.</p>
<p>Assistant District Attorney Gregory Stein had asked for a sentence of up to seven years, which would have put Lang in the state prison system, citing the impact on the victim and his family and saying a tough sentence would deter Lang and other potential offenders from similar crimes.</p>
<p>Lang’s attorney, Robert Mielnicki, asked for house arrest, citing the priest’s advanced age, the lack of any other charges against him and the testimony to his character.</p>
<p>Judge Mariani took age into account. “I don’t know how much the public needs protection from an 89-year-old man. But the victim-impact statement weighed heavily, and the sexual abuse of children is “a subject of community interest,” he said. “There needs to be incarceration at the county level.”</p>
<p>Lang was convicted in a bench trial in November in which he took the stand and denied any misconduct.</p>
<p>Judge Mark Tranquilli, who presided at the bench trial, found the priest guilty of one felony — unlawful contact with a minor. He also convicted the priest of five misdemeanors — one count of indecent exposure, three counts of indecent assault and a count of corruption of the morals of a minor.</p>
<p>The sentencing was complicated with a change from some of the key players since the trial.</p>
<p>Judge Tranquilli had been scheduled to sentence Lang, but Allegheny County Common Pleas Judge Kim Berkeley Clark this week restricted him from hearing cases after he was accused of making racist remarks about a juror in an unrelated case.</p>
<p>Lang also recently replaced his lawyer from the trial, Kerrington Lewis. After the trial but being being replaced, Mr. Lewis had filed a motion to dismiss the charges as being beyond the statute of limitations. Judge Mariani said it was odd to get such a motion after rather than before trial, and he set a 1:30 hearing Thursday to discuss it before finalizing the sentencing.</p>
<p>Lang, with more than six decades in ministry, was superintendent of schools for the Diocese of Pittsburgh during the 1980s. He was a priest in residence at St. Anne in Castle Shannon until August 2018, when he was placed on administrative leave after the diocese learned of allegations that would later lead to criminal charges.</p>
