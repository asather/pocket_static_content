<h1> Yuri Orlov | Physicist, symbol of Soviet dissent </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Dr. Yuri Orlov, a Russian-born physicist who designed particle accelerators, studied the foundations of quantum mechanics and — turning from theory to practice in his boldest experiment of all — created the Moscow Helsinki Group to expose human rights violations in the Soviet Union, died Sept. 27 at his home in Ithaca, N.Y. He was 96.</p>
<p>His wife, Sidney Orlov, confirmed the death but did not give a precise cause.</p>
<p>Like his contemporary Andrei Sakharov, a father of the Soviet hydrogen bomb who later won the Nobel Peace Prize, Dr. Orlov was both an eminent physicist and a champion of free speech and human rights. He examined the building blocks of matter, co-founded the Soviet branch of Amnesty International, and organized what is widely considered Russia’s oldest human rights organization, the Moscow Helsinki Group.</p>
<p>As a result he was harassed, jailed and sentenced to hard labor and exile in Siberia, where he endured illness and isolation before being freed as part of a prisoner swap orchestrated by President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.</p>
<p>Dr. Orlov came to prominence in the 1970s. His activism expanded in the wake of the 1975 Helsinki Accords, which were signed by 35 states in the Soviet bloc and the West, covered a sweeping array of political and economic issues and included a section noting that “the participating states will respect human rights and fundamental freedoms.”</p>
<p>After less than a year, Dr. Orlov was arrested by the KGB in February 1977, then convicted of “anti-Soviet activity” following a three-day trial.</p>
<p>Sent to a labor camp in the Ural Mountains, he slept on bare planks, dined on hot food every other day and was diagnosed with tuberculosis. His confinement generated outrage from scientists and the U.S. government, and in 1986, he was stripped of his Soviet citizenship and deported to the United States.</p>
<p>Dr. Orlov resumed his scientific career at Cornell University in Ithaca, published a memoir, “Dangerous Thoughts” (1991), and campaigned on behalf of imprisoned Soviet dissidents.</p>
<p>His first three marriages ended in divorce. In 1988, he married Sidney, a Cornell writing instructor who helped teach him English.</p>
