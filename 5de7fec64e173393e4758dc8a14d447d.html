<h1>Rinku Singh, ex-Pirates pitcher and 'Million Dollar Arm' star, trades baseball for WWE dreams</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rinku Singh came to the United States on an improbable journey, the son of a truck driver who grew up in rural India winning a reality TV show contest called “Million Dollar Arm.”</p>
<p>A high-level javelin thrower and cricket player as a kid, Singh, then 19, earned $100,000 for his ability to throw a baseball and eventually signed with the Pirates for $8,000.</p>
<p>The experiment of whether Singh could make it as a professional baseball player flamed out in 2016, the result of recurring elbow problems, but the unlikely path has taken a sharp, strange turn, into the world of professional wrestling.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2014/05/16/Movie-tells-the-story-of-a-Pirates-prospect/stories/201405160004" target="_blank">The Million Dollar Arm</a> becomes the Million Dollar Man? Hey, maybe.</p>
<p>Singh made his TV debut on March 25 by wrestling on “WWE NXT,” which is essentially the $5 billion company’s feeder system. While it was obviously a significant achievement, Singh, 31, hopes it’s only one step en route to stardom in his new arena, one that’s somehow even more surprising than the last.</p>
<p>“I wanted to share the journey of Rinku Singh,” Singh told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on Thursday afternoon. “I want to put a smile on peoples’ faces all around the world, inspire them and share my story with them. So many kids can relate to it, and WWE allows you to do that.”</p>
<p>Even amid the coronavirus pandemic, apparently. While sports have shut down, WWE has kept going, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/04/15/wwe-essential-business-florida-ron-desantis-coronavirus-vince-mcmahon-firings/stories/202004150146" target="_blank">deemed an “essential” service</a> by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.</p>
<p>Matches take place without fans. They say social distancing is practiced, though that seems difficult to do during a wrestling match. Nevertheless, Singh said he believes WWE’s medical staff “has been on top of that” and doesn’t worry about any potential ramifications.</p>
<p>“Our health comes first. And also our fans,” Singh said. “We’re taking precautions. The medical team has been on top of it. During this pandemic, when the entire world has been shut down and people are staying home, how many movies can we watch? How many TV shows can we watch? Obviously the fans love to see us performing. Any way we can entertain our fans — in the safest way — we’re doing it.”</p>

<p>In case you forget about the story involving Singh and Dinesh Patel, who was the runner-up on “Million Dollar Arm,” let’s rewind to 2008.</p>
<p>More than 30,000 people entered the contest, which was the creation of agent J.B. Bernstein. After it ended, Singh and Patel — who had not yet signed — came to America in May 2008 to train with famed throwing coach Tom House. Seven months after arriving in the United States, Singh and Patel officially became professional baseball players when the Pirates offered them contracts.</p>
<p>Adjusting to life here was tough. They had to learn how to use gloves and water fountains and deal with the rigors of baseball. Patel pitched just 13⅔&nbsp;innings between 2009-10 before he was released and eventually returned home. Singh fared better, pitching to a 3.00 ERA in 2012 with 65 strikeouts in 72 innings for the Class A West Virginia Power.</p>
<p>But offseason work in the Dominican Republic and Australia overstressed Singh’s arm. He tore an elbow ligament in 2013, requiring Tommy John surgery, and would not pitch again until 2016 because of a few different elbow issues.</p>
<p>Singh pitched just one inning in 2016 before realizing he probably needed to start doing something else.</p>
<p>Enter WWE. While playing baseball, he was drawn to WWE because of its charity/community focus, specifically longtime star John Cena and how he carried himself. So while Singh kicked around his possible next moves — football and MMA were considerations — he asked Bernstein to call WWE and see if there might be an opportunity there.</p>
<p>Turns out there was. Singh was invited to participate in a four-day tryout in Dubai in April 2017 and signed a contract with WWE in January 2018.</p>
<p>Singh has been working out at the WWE Performance Center in Orlando, Fla., its sprawling campus serving as the primary workout spot for dozens of similarly minded wrestlers trying to climb the ladder. In baseball terms, it’s like Pirate City.</p>
<p>Singh, who said he’s an obsessive noter-taker, has been filling black-and-white composition notebooks and studying them over and over every night.</p>
<p>“Notes are the key,” Singh said. “On a daily basis, we as humans have so many things and thoughts in our mind. One way to really focus for me is to take notes. I did that with the Pirates. It’s been a constant in my life.”</p>
<p>The same as constantly seeking improvement, really.</p>
<p>When he wanted to perfect taking bumps or falls, Singh yanked his hotel beds together and practiced until 3 a.m. In baseball, when his mechanics lacked, he scoured YouTube or sat with coaches to break down his own film.</p>
<p>“In WWE, we have so many great coaches,” Singh said. “We hear so much great stuff. Obviously all the coaches that we have, they’ve been superstars for a long, long time. They’ve performed. They’ve done that. And we’re learning from the best.</p>
<p>“When I hear their feedback, I always go back and study it. I don’t know what you call it. I’ve just always been comfortable studying something and doing it over and over again.”</p>
<p>It’s been a steady, upward trajectory for Singh (6 foot 4, 255 pounds), who’s tacked on roughly 65 pounds since his Pirates days. Singh said he’s even starting to feel like a real wrestler, with the intensity he used to feel once he stepped on the mound transitioning to the squared circle.</p>
<p>“When I put on the [baseball] uniform, I was a totally new human,” Singh said. “Now I feel like I did when I would put a baseball uniform on. It’s game time. There’s new energy. I’m ready to go out there and perform.”</p>
