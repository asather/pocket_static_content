<h1>'You better shop around,' health insurance brokers tell Western Pa. seniors</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Each fall, competition heats up for the business of hundreds of thousands of seniors in the region who buy insurance plans to supplement Medicare coverage. This year, health insurers are introducing new plans and benefits for 2021 even as they shift risk to members in other plans being offered —&nbsp;a trip wire that could dramatically increase costs for some.</p>
<p>Seniors with Medicare Advantage insurance, which is wildly popular in Western Pennsylvania, can enroll or switch plans starting Oct. 15, a period called open enrollment. Coverage starts on Jan. 1.</p>
<p>The good news for 2021: monthly premiums are flat or down slightly among Western Pennsylvania’s biggest Medicare Advantage insurers, UPMC Health Plan, Highmark and Aetna. The region’s individual Medicare Advantage plan members can choose from among 33 plans, all with member ratings in the high 80s percentile.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing: it can pay to shop around because insurers, in some cases, have boosted the limits on how much their members have to spend out of their own pockets on co-pays and other health expenses before the carrier begins picking up 100% of the tab.</p>
<p>For people who choose traditional Medicare health insurance, the government writes the checks for your care directly to doctors and hospitals. Medicare Advantage care is paid by the government through private insurers, who set the terms and monthly premiums of the coverage, subject to government guidelines.</p>
<p>And for all their differences, Medicare Advantage plans come in basically two flavors, HMO and PPO, which refers to the size of the network of doctors and hospitals that members can use.</p>
<p>HMOs require members to use an in-network doctor or hospital for all services, except in case of an emergency. PPOs allow members to see out-of-network health care providers, but at costs that can be much higher than in-network.</p>
<p>For many seniors, the idea of switching health insurers causes anxiety, said Aaron Zolbrod, owner of the Health Insurance Store LLC, which has offices in Connellsville and Forest Hills.</p>
<p>“There’s the fear factor,” Mr. Zolbrod said. “Too much information for older people. When you have major changes like this, they’re afraid to move. And that fear is advantageous to the companies.”</p>
<p>Open enrollment for coverage starting Jan. 1 continues until Dec. 7, with the average Medicare Advantage premium in Pennsylvania falling 13% to $38.97 in 2021 from $44.65 in 2020, according to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.</p>
<p>Thirteen plans sold by the top three insurers in Western Pennsylvania come with a $0 monthly premium.</p>
<p>But monthly premiums are just one of the things brokers say seniors should consider when choosing a plan. Another is the amount that members must pay before the insurer picks up the tab, which is called out-of-pocket limits.</p>
<p>Medicare Advantage is private insurance paid for by the federal government, so insurers are allowed to tweak conditions of their plans annually, subject to federal guidelines. In 2021, the government allowed insurers to increase the member out-of-pocket limit to $7,550, up 13% from 2020.</p>
<p>Out-of-pocket expenses can include co-payments, co-insurance for doctor’s visits and covered outpatient care, but not prescription drugs.</p>
<p>For years, UPMC Health Plan, the Pittsburgh region’s biggest Medicare Advantage plan carrier with 194,000 members, has had the lowest out-of-pocket limits for its Medicare Advantage plans. The limit for one 2020 plan, for example is $3,400. Another UPMC plan has a limit of $6,700.</p>
<p>In 2021, UPMC is raising the limit on all of its Medicare Advantage plans to the federal ceiling of $7,550, which could be as much as a 122% higher than 2020, depending on the plan.</p>
<p>Highmark, with 155,000 plan members, and Aetna, with 135,000 members, are also bumping up their plan limits on out-of-pocket costs, but the increases aren’t as dramatic because their members had higher ceilings in the past.</p>
<p>UPMC Health Plan officials say their new plans are built to limit the amount that members would have to pay out of pocket, so the increases are not really a big deal.&nbsp;“Less than 5% of our members last year ever made it to that maximum out-of-pocket limit,” said April Golenor, chief Medicare officer, UPMC Health Plan.</p>
<p>UPMC Health Plan is the only one of the three big Medicare Advantage insurers in the region to offer a new federal prescription drug benefit for seniors, which promises big savings for members with diabetes. In addition to low co-pays for brand name diabetes medications, UPMC for Life HMO Premier Rx members will pay no more than $35 for a 30-day supply of plan formulary insulins.</p>
<p>One of every three Medicare beneficiaries has diabetes, according to CMS. So that could mean an average of $446 in annual out-of-pocket insulin cost savings compared to their average cost-sharing today in the UPMC plan.</p>
<p>In June, Tracey D. Brown, president and CEO of the American Diabetes Association, called the new federal benefit a “major victory in our fight for affordable insulin.”</p>
<p>Highmark, the second biggest Medicare Advantage insurer in the region, is introducing a plan for 2021 called Complete Blue PPO, which offers in-network access to medical providers in Highmark’s Allegheny Health Network, UPMC and community hospitals. Moreover, Highmark is expanding dental coverage as part of its best selling Community Blue Medicare HMO plan, which has a $0 monthly premium.</p>
<p>“We’ve got lots of options,” said Ellen Galardy, vice president, senior markets product and strategy at Highmark.</p>
<p><strong>Taking aim</strong></p>
<p>Highmark’s new product may be taking aim at Aetna’s historic market advantage.</p>
<p>Aetna’s draw for many people is offering access to both AHN and UPMC doctors and hospitals, something that bitter rivals Highmark and UPMC have battled over for years.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The Hartford, Conn.-based carrier offers 16 Medicare Advantage plans in Western Pennsylvania, including many HMO plans that are offered in cooperation with UPMC and community providers such as Heritage Valley, Butler and Washington health systems.</p>
<p>“We know that the Medicare Advantage consumer is quite sophisticated,” said Bob O’Connor, chief Medicare officer at Aetna for Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Delaware. “We try to deliver a differentiated product.”</p>
<p>Although it’s the third largest Medicare Advantage provider in the region, Aetna has been the fastest growing carrier in recent years: from 87,000 members in 2015 to 135,000 members in 2020.</p>
<p>“The big differentiator for us is the network, which includes most local doctors,” Mr. O’Connor said. “People have a hard time finding providers that are not in the network.”</p>
