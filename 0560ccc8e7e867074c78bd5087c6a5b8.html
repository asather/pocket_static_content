<h1>Pitt to acquire sampes of coronavirus for development of treatments, including vaccine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research is in the process of obtaining samples of the novel coronavirus from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in hopes of developing interventions including a vaccine, officials said Wednesday.</p>
<p>Paul Duprex, director of the center, briefed faculty leaders mid-afternoon on the Oakland campus about the center’s plans, its interest in working with U.S. and world health experts to study the virus, as well as the logistics of safely bringing the virus samples to the city and campus.</p>
<p>Mr. Duprex could not say exactly when the center expects to receive the virus. He said it will be transported by air and ground using approved shippers experienced in safely transporting biological and infectious materials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pitt’s Center for Vaccine Research is one of the few laboratories nationwide designed to be able to handle pathogens of concern, Pitt officials said.</p>
<p>The center is pursuing funding to potentially develop a vaccine for Covid-19, the new name given a virus that has killed more than 1,000 people, nearly all of them in mainland China.</p>
<p>Mr. Duprex said there is a tradition of working on disease interventions in Pittsburgh dating back to the polio crisis and the late Dr. Jonas Salk.</p>
<p>“We have the experience. We have the facilities within the center for vaccine research,” he said. “There has been significant investments form the university and our school of medicine over many years to build and support those facilities.”</p>
<p>There are almost 45,000 cases of the deadly disease, nearly all of them in mainland China, centered in Hubei Province. The death toll early this week eclipsed that of the SARS virus in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>Mr. Duprex appeared in Posvar Hall at a regular University Senate meeting. His remarks were added to the 3 p.m. meeting shortly before it began, and he took reporters questions afterward at an impromptu news conference..</p>
<p>&nbsp;A spokesman for the CDC in Atlanta could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>The speed with which people move from country to country, including air travel, exacerbates the virus’s ability to spread as it obtains hosts. However, Mr. Duprex said significant efforts to quarantine and control movement has helped keep cases in countries like the U.S. relatively small so far, at 13.</p>
<p>Pitt is one among a number of entities here and elsewhere interested in working toward a way to combat the virus’s spread.</p>
<p>“We need to understand where the virus is. We need to work on it. Grow it, understand [it],” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Duprex said Pitt and the center are a small cog in a much larger wheel of expertise fighting the virus.</p>
<p>“We will play our part because we have no choice,” he said.&nbsp;“We have&nbsp;been resourced. We have this mandate to work on emerging diseases. We have the knowledge.”</p>
