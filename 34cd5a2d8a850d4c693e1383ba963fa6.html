<h1>Pirates to furlough some non-baseball operations employees</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates held the line for as long as they could, continuing to pay people even though the coronavirus pandemic has turned off the revenue spigot.</p>
<p>But on Thursday, they finally had to make a choice, deciding to furlough about 20% of the organization’s employees for an undetermined amount of time starting on June 1.</p>
<p>To their credit, the Pirates hung in longer than the Rays, Marlins, Reds and Angels — teams that previously furloughed employees. It's widely expected around the industry that more organizations will soon go the same route.</p>
<p>“We care deeply about all of our employees and understand the impact this will have on them,” Pirates president Travis Williams said in a statement. “These decisions are very difficult but are necessary for us to endure this crisis and emerge as strong as possible when we are able to resume normal operations. We look forward to welcoming our employees back to work at that time.”</p>
<p>Nobody who will be furloughed is in baseball operations. Those being furloughed have jobs impacted by the lack of baseball with fans at PNC Park for the foreseeable future due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>By retaining those in baseball operations, the Pirates’ hope is that general manager Ben Cherington will be able to use this time to better position the club for 2021 and beyond.</p>
<p>There are no end dates on the furloughs, as employees will be brought back as soon as their job requires it. The Pirates, per a source, expect their next ticketed event at PNC Park may not be until March 2021.</p>
<p>The group that’s furloughed will remain employees of the team and continue to receive medical, dental and vision benefits for them and their families. The club has also vowed to help them secure additional benefits.</p>
<p>Williams conducted a call Thursday with Pirates employees to inform them of the news.</p>
<p>Additionally, every Pirates executive staff member will continue to take voluntary pay reductions for the rest of the calendar year, a policy that was implemented last month when the Pirates stopped matching employees' 401(k) contributions.</p>
<p>In addition to the furloughs, the Pirates will invoke pay reductions for remaining staff. This will be done on a sliding scale relative to salary size, with the lowest-earning group enduring a 5% cut and the highest at 25%.</p>
<p>The Pirates are hardly alone. The Penguins announced on May 12 the decision to furlough a group of employees for four months, while several MLB clubs (most recently the Mariners, Mets and Cubs) relied on pay cuts to make ends meet.</p>
<p>“The impact of the coronavirus has been felt by everyone within our community and our industry,” Williams said. “The Pittsburgh Pirates organization is no different.&nbsp;There continues to be a great deal of uncertainty around the 2020 MLB season, and even if games are played at PNC Park, it will likely be without fans.</p>
<p>"This situation is creating significant and unforeseen consequences for our business, especially with the prospect of no ticket revenue, no revenue sharing and limited television and sponsorship revenue. It is equally disappointing as it is devastating.”</p>
