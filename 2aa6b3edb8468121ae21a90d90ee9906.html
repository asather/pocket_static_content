<h1>Warren says she has the math, plans to solve America's problems </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DERRY, N.H. --&nbsp;To undecided voter and Derry-based telemarketer Sean Cohen, Elizabeth Warren's rally Thursday evening was more like a baseball game.</p>
<p>Ms. Warren, he said, has a way of winding up an argument like a pitcher preparing a fastball. The anticipation builds as she looks toward the audience and fires — delivering a rhetorical "spark" on the way.</p>
<p>"Here's a person who just finds a simple, fun way to crystallize her thoughts," Mr. Cohen said.</p>
<p>It was her campaign platform that was crystallized Thursday under the shining lights of the Tupelo Music Hall, where the Massachusetts senator and Democratic presidential contender delivered plan after plan to an audience of more than 500.</p>
<p>She would start with a broad topic, like ending corruption in Washington. Then, she would offer a specific path, like ending lobbying "as we know it." Then, just one more, she'd say.</p>
<p>"You really want to hose out come of the corruption in Washington? Make every single person who runs for federal office put their tax returns online," she said.</p>
<p>"I could do these all night," she quipped.</p>
<p>What started as a typical stump speech evolved into a question-and-answer session that touched on the topics of health care, climate change, affordable housing and the opioid crisis. Through most of them, Ms. Warren proposed more government spending, outlined in policy plans that she says are backed up by math.</p>
<p>Most of her ideas, she insisted, can be accomplished by removing money from politics and taking the government away from special interests. But, in a nod to some of her more moderate rivals in the field, she said it won't be enough to change "one little law over here" and roll back "one little regulation over there."</p>
<p>It'll take "big structural change," she said.</p>
<p>"This is no time for small ideas. This is no time to see big problems and just nibble around the edges of them," Ms. Warren said. "This is the time for courage over fear. This is the time that we prove who we are as Americans."</p>
<p>Making the country work for everyone and not just the wealthy and well-connected, she said, would include making the ultra-rich pay more in taxes. Ms. Warren has proposed a 2% tax on fortunes of $50 million or more, applicable to every dollar above the $50 million mark, which she said will bring in $3.75 trillion in revenue over 10 years and help cancel student loan debt for 42 million Americans and increase Social Security payments by $200 a month.</p>
<p>That argument resonated with Mr. Cohen, who praised Ms. Warren's student debt plan.</p>
<p>"We need to have a system that's a little more equitable for all," Mr. Cohen said, noting that Ms. Warren's plans are just one of many in the Democratic field. He said he's torn between Ms. Warren, Amy Klobuchar, Andrew Yang and Tom Steyer.</p>
<p>Asked by an audience member about Alzheimer's disease and how a large chunk of unpaid caregivers are young people, Ms. Warren proposed a greater investment in medical research, then brought up her “Medicare for All” proposal that would provide full health coverage to every American at a cost to the federal government of about $20.5 trillion in additional funding between 2020 and 2029.</p>
<p>"I always do the math on it. We can afford health care for everyone in this country if we ask those at the top to pay a little more," Ms. Warren said, promising that the government will collect taxes from giant corporations and go after "tax cheats" at the top by better enforcing existing tax laws. Her plan also anticipates $8.8 trillion in revenue from employers paying into Medicare instead of contributing to employee health insurance, which she said would save employers money, too.</p>
<p>On the music hall stage, Ms. Warren also outlined plans to build 3.2 million housing units, stop all new drilling and mining on federal lands and invest $10 billion a year for 10 years into combating the opioid epidemic — money that she said will go directly from the federal government to the communities on the "frontline" of the epidemic.</p>
<p>Twice, she addressed gridlock in Washington, asked by an attendee how she would work with Republicans in the Senate if they hold onto the majority.</p>
<p>"I'm required to do a disclaimer," she responded. "We're going to take back the Senate and put [Senate Majority Leader] Mitch McConnell out of a job."</p>
<p>The rally matched Ms. Warren's energy, but wasn't typical of the rest of the rallies in New Hampshire in the days leading up to the first-in-the-nation primary.</p>
<p>Before it started, a campaign volunteer asked attendees to turn to one another, introduce themselves and say "why you got in this fight."</p>
<p>Then, the campaign raffled off five chances to ask Ms. Warren a question.</p>
<p>One of the questioners, who said she worked for Ms. Warren's senatorial campaign in Massachusetts, asked if the candidate would commit to avoiding the AIPAC Policy Conference this March in solidarity with those who believe the organization is forming worrisome alliances with anti-Semites and Islamophobes.</p>
<p>"Yeah," Ms. Warren responded, pledging to stay away from the event that she didn't attend last year, either.</p>
<p>But, she added, it brings up a larger policy issue.</p>
<p>"The way I see it, is that for America to be a good ally of Israel and of the Palestinians, we need to encourage both parties to get to the negotiating table," Ms. Warren said, "and we're not doing that if we keep standing with one party and saying, 'We're on your side.'"</p>
