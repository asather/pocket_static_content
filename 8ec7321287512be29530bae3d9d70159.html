<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Should the Pirates go nuts at the trade deadline?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Bobby, @BuStA607:</strong> Even though the Pirates are four games out of the eighth playoff spot (welcome to 2020), what can we realistically expect them to do by next week’s trade deadline?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> First, Bobby, how ridiculous (or fantastic) is it that the Pirates — off to one of the worst starts in franchise history — are only one game back in the loss column (four games overall) for the final wild-card spot?</p>
<p>They should be buyers!</p>
<p>I’m kidding, of course. They are, as ESPN’s Jeff Passan put it, a “definite seller.” Question is, who’s legitimately on the block? And what kind of deadline will it be, given the bizarre nature of the season?</p>
<p>Might it be better to hold on to potential trade candidates to increase their value for the offseason or next year’s deadline?</p>
<p>I’m glad I asked. Or you asked. Here is the lead from Jon Paul Morosi’s piece on mlb.com.</p>
<p><em>“Longstanding friendships between the Blue Jays’ and Pirates’ front offices nearly helped Toronto play its 2020 home games at Pittsburgh’s PNC Park. While Pennsylvania’s state government ultimately rejected that agreement, the Blue Jays and Pirates still could come together for a more conventional transaction: a trade that bolsters Toronto’s pitching staff and adds momentum to Pittsburgh’s rebuild. The Blue Jays have emerged as buyers ahead of Monday’s Trade Deadline, and sources say Pirates right-handers Trevor Williams and Chad Kuhl are among the rotation upgrades they are considering.”</em></p>
<p>Hmmm. Interesting. Obviously, the Pirates should be willing to trade anyone. That part’s easy (Adam Frazier would be a nice piece for a contending team, despite his slow start). They are rebuilding. But what do they get in return? That is always the question — and I’m not sure this would be the time to trade Kuhl.</p>
<p>Williams, I would understand. That could be a case of selling high. He’s off to a good “start” (I keep using that word, even though the truth is we’re almost halfway through the season). His strikeout rate is up. He has changed his arsenal a bit. He could help somebody.</p>
<p>But what is the ceiling there? What is the trajectory?</p>
<p>With Kuhl, I’m thinking the arrow is pointed up, as Mike Tomlin might say. He takes a 2.84 ERA and a strikeout per inning into his start Thursday in St. Louis. I’m curious to see where this goes. Kuhl turns 28 next month. He missed all of last season. The Pirates control him for two more years. He has only pitched one full season.</p>
<p>It’d be a shame, after the long road Kuhl traveled to get back on a major league mound, to get rid of him for minimal return before we see what’s truly there.</p>
<p>Listen, I hear you if you’re thinking, “Get what you can, NOW, for Chad Kuhl.” I just happen to believe he can increase his value immensely by next season. I like what I’m seeing. I’m keeping Kuhl — but if teams get desperate in this weird season, believing they are legit contenders, I’m listening. On everybody.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ biggest problem is that almost nobody is having a good season, er, month.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Hough, @Hoagie7187:</strong> What chance do you give the Steelers to win the AFC North this year? Could be the toughest division in football.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The NFC West will be the toughest division in football, Dr. Hough, but I digress. And I appreciate your question. I give the Steelers a great chance. In fact, if you read <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/08/18/afc-north-favorites-to-win-steelers-ravens-mike-tomlin-ben-roethlisberger/stories/202008180085" target="_blank">last week’s mailbag</a>, I’m picking them to win the AFC North — and that was before the Ravens cut ties with Earl Thomas.</p>
<p>Ben Roethlisberger is back. He’s zipping the ball around, making all the throws. I don’t see why that wouldn’t translate to games. Put him with a top-five defense, and the Steelers are a 12-win team (if they stay relatively healthy).</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Maxwell, @TheeRFS:</strong> Last time you played Strat-o-matic?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Been a while, Col. Maxwell, but time spent playing that game still represents a large percentage of my life.</p>
<p>Three greatest sports board games of all time …</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> APBA Football. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=APBA+football&amp;client=safari&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk00MTsREEPCewROa8SMxSQIt7MdFKg:1598360040622&amp;tbm=isch&amp;source=iu&amp;ictx=1&amp;fir=uMdc02-SnvMUdM%252CXkOtDdTQe-1dcM%252C_&amp;vet=1&amp;usg=AI4_-kSDoChZln_rP4AqDPXgFgQfRULvLw&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjf28aTs7brAhUPhHIEHZx0AtEQ_h0wAnoECA0QBg&amp;biw=1343&amp;bih=768#imgrc=uMdc02-SnvMUdM" target="_blank">The sight of it</a> makes me weep with joy</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Strat-o-matic Baseball. We played full 162-game seasons. Who knew <a href="https://twitter.com/StratOMatic" target="_blank">this game had a Twitter page</a> — and that Greg Brown is a follower?</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> All-Star Baseball (games are faster). <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/3157/all-star-baseball" target="_blank">We made our own cards</a>!&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Frank Alessio, @FrankAlessio2:</strong> Who won, you or Julius Page? I never heard.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not me. I started out hot in the warm-up rounds, Frank, but when it came to the actual competition, Julius rediscovered that sweet left-handed stroke (it was a 3-point shooting competition).</p>
<p>Hey, if I’m gonna lose, it might as well be to a Buffalo guy.</p>
<p><strong>Anthony Scarillo, @AnthScar:</strong> Who has the best comeback season @TeamJuJu, @_BigBen7 or @JamesConner_?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m going Ben, but I also believe JuJu and James (I guess we’re going all first names here) will have bounce-back years, Mr. Scarillo. JuJu, in particular, is a great bet for that. He was bad last season. No question. But he was mostly spectacular his first two years — and it wasn’t all because of Antonio Brown. Ben trusts him. Ben will throw to him. A lot.</p>
<p><strong>Halvy Buckets, @halvybuckets:</strong> Who would you rather start your baseball team with: Bonds, Trout or Griffey Jr.?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Wow. Let me start with this, Dr. Buckets: Juiced-up Barry Bonds, in San Francisco, was the greatest hitter of all-time. So I guess I just answered your question. But how much artificial assistance is allowed in your scenario? All things being equal, I would take Trout as the best all-around player.</p>
<p><strong>Jack Hillgrove, @JackHillgrove:</strong> Which NBA player from the ’70s or ’80s would be most likely to dominate the bubble like Lillard, Booker, etc.?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Well, Dr. Hillgrove, Dame suddenly isn’t dominating the bubble anymore. Not after Monday night’s embarrassment and the way this series has unraveled for the Blazers. By the way, please don’t ever say he’s better than Steph Curry (not that you did). <a href="https://theathletic.com/2020741/2020/08/25/the-key-difference-between-damian-lillard-and-steph-curry-against-elite-defenses/" target="_blank">Check out this excellent piece</a> on what separates the two.</p>
<p>Anyway, are you talking strictly scoring here? Star quality? Best showman?</p>
<p>Are we eliminating Magic and Michael because they’re too obvious?</p>
<p>OK, then, how about Pistol Pete Maravich? He would have been the <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_boy_in_the_plastic_bubble" target="_blank">biggest star-in-a-bubble</a> since John Travolta.</p>
<p>Don’t think so? Here:</p>

<p>If not Pistol, how about Dominique Wilkins? I feel like ’Nique gets shortchanged because he never led a team to a title and because he is only looked back upon as a spectacular dunker. He was way more than that.</p>
<p>Then again, feast your eyes on this:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Ju0mAzCLeA" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="100%" height="350" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Scott Hicks, @SteelThunder723:</strong> The Penguins should trade Murray, right? Not Jarry?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That is correct, Scott, and it’s really a matter of money more than anything else. Jarry is way cheaper, at least for now, and the Penguins believe (as do I) that he can be just as effective as Murray, if not more so.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Mueller, @ChrisMuellerPGH:</strong> What’s your favorite part of Luka Doncic’s game?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Good morning, Mullsy. What a question. What a player! For me, it’s the endless array of scoring methods, from step-back 3s (although not nine in a row) to driving spin moves with either hand to floaters to bank shots to basically whatever there is. I’m half-expecting him to toss up a sky hook, if he hasn’t already.</p>
<p>Not a bad passer, either.</p>
<p><strong>ChiefRobert, @ChiefRobertST:</strong> Trump or Biden???</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m thinking Jerry Falwell Jr.’s pool attendant as a write-in. You?</p>
