<p>Pittsburgh police arrested a man from Pittsburgh’s Allentown neighborhood Saturday morning who is accused of shooting into a car and injuring two people during a suspected road-rage incident on Banksville Road Friday.</p>
<p>Kevin McClintock, 52, was apprehended at 7:20 a.m. in the 1000 block of Saw Mill Run Boulevard after a two-hour standoff with SWAT negotiators.</p>
<p>Police spokeswoman Cara Cruz said police spotted the suspect in his vehicle before 5 a.m. SWAT negotiators were in almost constant contact with him by cell phone before he surrendered without incident.</p>
<p>The suspect faces two counts each of attempted homicide and aggravated assault, three counts of reckless endangerment and one count of illegally possessing a firearm.</p>
<p>Police say Mr. McClintock was the driver of a silver pickup truck that chased a vehicle the wrong way on Banksville Road shortly after noon Friday, then forced it off the road, got out of his truck and fired into the car. He shot a man in the vehicle in the face, police said, and a woman was grazed by a bullet and injured her back in the incident.</p>
<p>Both victims were hospitalized initially in stable condition.</p>
<p>The victims’ 3-year-old son also was in the vehicle but wasn’t harmed.&nbsp; He is staying with grandparents.</p>
<p>A witness told police the pickup truck slammed into the back of the car and pushed it into an embankment before the driver got out and fired three shots into the car. The pickup driver fled the scene.&nbsp;</p>
