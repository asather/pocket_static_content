<p>A young woman was airlifted from McConnells Mill State Park on Monday after falling into Slippery Rock Creek.</p>
<p>Lawrence County dispatch received a call at 1:10 p.m. about a woman who had fallen into the creek. She was flown to UPMC Presbyterian Hospital with leg and head injuries, according to Post-Gazette news partner KDKA-TV.&nbsp;Details on her condition were not available.</p>
<p>The woman fell into the creek at Kildoo Falls. The falls are near a covered bridge, where earlier this month another hiker fell into the creek and disappeared. In April, another hiker was rescued from the park after becoming disoriented, and in February a Slippery Rock University student was hospitalized after falling off a cliff.</p>
<p>McConnells Mill is a popular hiking area located about 40 miles north of Pittsburgh.</p>
