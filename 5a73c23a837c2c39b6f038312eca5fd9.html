<h1>Analysis: Grading the MLBPA’s proposal during baseball’s ongoing talks</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The same as Major League Baseball’s proposal to its players six days ago, what the MLB Players Association sent back Sunday afternoon more than likely won’t pass.</p>
<p>However, it hopefully should spur discussion while also further clarifying the players’ stance.</p>
<p>Where things should get really interesting — because both sides know they’re starting to flirt with a deadline here — will be when it comes to how the league and its owners react off of what the players sent.</p>
<p>Do they immediately reject this latest proposal and stick to their initial demands? Or do they simply ship an amended version back to the MLBPA?</p>
<p>We should find out soon. In the meantime, let’s grade what the players are looking for and examine what it might mean in the bigger picture.</p>
<p><strong>GAMES — B-</strong></p>
<p>The players union wants to play 114 this season, up from 82, starting on June 30 and running through Halloween. It’s expected that doubleheaders would be a big part of making this work, as we’re talking about a 124-day window, which is tight.</p>
<p>The players want this many because they’re being paid a prorated amount. The more they play, the more they make. Meanwhile, the owners have argued they’ll lose $640,000 per game, a number the union disputes.</p>
<p>On the surface, playing 32 more games doesn’t make a ton of sense — that previous figure would equate to a loss of more than $20 million for the owners — but what if they played 100?</p>
<p>That $640,000 could easily be inflated, muddied by owners’ losses in non-baseball ventures, while live sports during the coronavirus pandemic are in high demand; above-average viewership (and ad dollars) is certainly possible, if not probable.</p>
<p>Playing 100 games could also assuage (legitimate) concerns over the most important issue here: What if there’s another wave of COVID-19 in the fall?</p>
<p><strong>OPT-OUT OPTIONS — C</strong></p>
<p>This is a great idea that’s potentially worrisome if exploited.</p>
<p>If a player is deemed “high-risk” and doesn’t feel comfortable playing, he’s still paid. Ditto for anyone with a family member in that same boat. But where’s the line? And what does “high-risk” mean?</p>
<p>It’s a slippery slope, and it requires case-by-case judgement, which we’ve already seen can cause problems when it comes to baseball’s agreement from March 26, the one at the heart of the sport’s current issues.</p>
<p>The owners see it one way. The players look at it and see something else.</p>
<p>They do need to create a system for those who simply don’t feel comfortable playing. Getting service time but not salary feels like a reasonable middle ground there.</p>
<p><strong>EXPANDED PLAYOFFS — A</strong></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Easy one. Under the players’ proposal, the playoffs would grow from 10 to 14 teams for each of the next two years.</span></p>
<p>The postseason is an economic boon. It’s hardly a shock this showed up here, and don’t expect it to go anywhere. Maybe ever.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">EXTRA EVENTS — B</span></strong></p>
<p><span>The players say they’ll agree to a set amount of extra events. An offseason Home Run Derby and/or All-Star game were thrown around, which one could maybe picture happening NFL-style, like the Pro Bowl.</span></p>
<p>They will also potentially have broadcast enhancements such as microphones on the field/players and extra access for fans.</p>
<p>It’s hard to argue with any of that; however, they also need to find a way to monetize it and make it work for the sport’s benefit.</p>
<p>One issue floated in this space last week included an extra subscription service where fans could access additional content for a yearly fee.</p>
<p><strong><span data-mce-mark="1">DEFERRED MONEY — B</span></strong></p>
<p>If there’s no postseason, the players agreed to defer $100 million until November 2021 at the earliest.</p>
<p>Targeting players making $10 million or more (prior to being prorated), that money will be paid in two installments: in November 2021 and again in November 2022, with a max of $7 million of relief for the bigger spenders.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">For this specific plan, it’s likely not enough to compel owners to sign on the dotted line. But deferred money is a key mechanism in making this entire thing work.</span></p>
<p>While neither side is likely to kick the can too far into the future, the MLBPA probably needs to be OK with the possibility that some of its money might not come until 2021 or 2022.</p>
<p>Especially because …</p>
<p><strong>SALARY STRUCTURE — D</strong></p>
<p>This is the big one.</p>
<p>MLB made its proposal with a sliding scale that hit the highest earnest really hard, with those guys theoretically making around 20% of what they would normally make.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The players here are basically arguing for 70% of their salaries, a number they’re likely never going to achieve.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It could be the final sticking point, as talks enter their third week. It could prevent baseball from restarting, which would make all parties involved look incredibly stupid for seemingly prioritizing money during a global pandemic.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">However, it could also establish boundaries. The owners want a harsh, sliding scale. The players want 70% of what they would normally make.</span></p>
<p>Neither side may get what it wants, but with a dash of common sense, the entire baseball world may finally get what it needs.</p>
