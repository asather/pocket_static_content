<h1>Casey: Evidence in Trump's impeachment trial shows need to call witnesses, subpoena documents</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey said Thursday that House Democrats have presented compelling evidence so far in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/22/Showing-video-and-texts-Democrats-argue-President-Trump-pressured-Ukraine-help-cheat-in-U-S-election/stories/202001220184?cid=search" target="_blank">President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial</a>, which puts pressure on the U.S. Senate to call at least four key witnesses and issue subpoenas for documents related to testimony.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, Mr. Casey said, he wants to see notes written by Bill Taylor, former acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, expressing concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about what the diplomat viewed as the president inviting foreign influence in U.S. elections.</p>
<p>“It’s something that every senator should be required to review before making a determination of guilty or not guilty in the trial,” said Mr. Casey, D-Pa.</p>
<p>He added,&nbsp;“I was amazed at how often there was a document ... that connected directly to the basic charges in the case.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., on Thursday described the trial as&nbsp;“long and tedious” and said he is still waiting to hear evidence “that rises to the level of removing a sitting president from office and forbidding the American people from ever electing him again.”</p>
<p>“That’s a very, very high bar to get over,”&nbsp;Mr. Toomey said in a television interview with Lilly Broadcasting.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey added he finds it&nbsp;“extremely unlikely” the Senate would vote to convict the president, and&nbsp;“that’s the case whether or not a witness comes in and says, oh yes, [Mr. Trump] definitely said this.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s any mystery: I don’t think there are 20 Republican senators that are going to join with every Democratic senator” to vote to remove Mr. Trump from office, he said.</p>
<p>Both senators spoke with reporters hours before House Democrats arrive on the Senate floor for a second day of arguments before all 100 senators.</p>
<p>The Democrats, led by Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., are trying to persuade senators that Mr. Trump abused his power by pressuring Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into former Vice President Joe Biden. They are also arguing the president obstructed Congress when it refused to provide relevant documents to the House Intelligence Committee’s impeachment inquiry last fall.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Mr. Schiff presented video testimony and text messages that show diplomats wringing their hands over Mr. Trump’s demands that Ukraine release a public statement. Mr. Trump, Mr. Schiff argued, withheld nearly $400 million in security aid and a coveted White House meeting to pressure the country’s new president.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Casey on Thursday praised the credibility of the witness testimony presented to senators over the eight-hour session.</p>

<p>Regarding Mr. Taylor, the former acting ambassador, Mr. Casey said, “Here’s someone who not only has great knowledge about what’s happening on the ground in Ukraine but is a decorated hero, war veteran of the Vietnam War” Mr. Casey said. “You’re talking about someone with substantial experience.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey also highlighted the memorandum of Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy, released by the White House in September. The memo, he said, contained “red flashing lights of abuse of power.”</p>
<p>“I was offended when I read it,” he said, that the president would bring a campaign opponent into U.S. diplomacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Senate’s looming decision over whether to call witnesses or demand more documents will be a key moment in the impeachment trial. On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled Senate <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/01/21/impeachment-trial-donald-trump-senate-republicans-subpoenas-democrats-amendment-witnesses/stories/202001210165" target="_blank">repeatedly voted down</a> Democrats’ demands to get more information at the start of the trial. The identical vote counts of 53-47 were split by party.</p>
<p>“I just think there will be more instances that, where the managers can turn to the whole Senate and say: ‘Wouldn’t you like to read that?’” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey has been seen taking notes at his desk throughout the proceedings. Though some senators were observed off the Senate floor during the arguments on Wednesday, Mr. Casey said the “overwhelming” number of senators have been “quiet and listening.”</p>
<p>In his interview Thursday, Mr. Toomey defended the trial’s structure.</p>
<p>Let’s wait and hear the entire presentation by the House managers, let’s hear the defense of the president’s team,” Mr. Toomey said.&nbsp;“It’s not clear yet” whether the Senate needs to call witnesses and obtain more information.</p>
<p>“Calling witnesses could prolong this enormously,” he said. “I mean, not just a couple of weeks. It could be months, literally.”</p>
