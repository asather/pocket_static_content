<p><em>The Penguins <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/10/07/matt-murray-trade-penguins-senators-jonathan-gruden/stories/202010070121" target="_blank">traded goalie Matt Murray</a> to the Ottawa Senators on Wednesday in exchange for forward Jonathan Gruden and a second-round pick in the 2020 NHL draft. Here are five of his best moments in a Penguins uniform.</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LLdTBNOvsc&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank"><strong>The playoff debut </strong></a></p>
<p>The Penguins started the 2015-16 playoffs against the same New York Rangers team that had ended their season a year earlier, and they did so without their top two goalies, as both Murray and Marc-Andre Fleury were injured to start the postseason. Jeff Zatkoff filled in admirably for the first two games of the series, which the Penguins split. Fortunately for them, however, Murray was able to return for Game 3 and delivered a gem in his first ever exposure to the playoff pressure cooker, allowing just one goal on 17 shots to help deliver a 3-1 victory. The Penguins cruised to a five-game series win from there, calming nerves about another early exit.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWi9g-YTKUA&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank"><strong>The first Game 7 </strong></a></p>
<p>Murray was serviceable, but not great, for most of the next two series against Washington and Tampa Bay in which the Penguins’ veterans did most of the heavy lifting. That changed with the season on the line against the Lightning in the Eastern Conference final. With the series tied at three games apiece, Murray stepped up in a huge way, stopping 16 of 17 shots and shutting out his opponents in the third period to secure a 2-1 victory. The Penguins claimed the Prince of Wales trophy as Eastern Conference champions and advanced to their first Stanley Cup Final since 2009. It would be another test Murray would pass with flying colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iXpeeQsXy_E&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank"><strong>Claiming the Cup </strong></a></p>
<p>Murray picked the biggest stage to have his best series of those 2015-16 playoffs. He did not allow more than three goals in any of the six games of the Cup final against San Jose. He posted a .920 save percentage. And he had three games in which he allowed only one goal, the last of which came in the clinching sixth game. Murray stopped 18 of 19 shots that night and helped preserve a tenuous 2-1 for almost half the game until Patric Hornqvist’s empty netter at 18:58 of the third period allowed everyone to breathe and begin the celebration of the franchise’s fourth championship. Thus ended one of the best postseason runs by a rookie in franchise history.</p>
<p><strong>Calming force</strong></p>
<p>Murray’s postseason got off to an inauspicious start the following year, when he suffered a freak injury in warm-ups before Game 1 of the first-round series against Columbus. Then Murray’s backup, Fleury was forced to step in, and he did so valiantly. He was brilliant in helping the team down the Blue Jackets, then the hated Capitals in the second round before the proverbial wheels started to fall off in the Eastern Conference final against Ottawa. With Murray sitting healthy on the bench, Fleury gave up four goals to start Game 3 and was quickly chased from the net in what became a 5-1 loss. Murray replaced him and proved to be a stabilizing force from there, allowing just six goals in the subsequent four games to help his team get back in the series, then finish the Senators off in seven games when Chris Kunitz scored in overtime of the deciding matchup. The Penguins were off to dance with Lord Stanley for the second time in as many years.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9QmzB6bSD0&amp;feature=emb_title" target="_blank"><strong>A clinching shutout </strong></a></p>
<p>Game 6 of the 2017 Cup final against Nashville was one of the most nerve-racking in Penguins history. The raucous Bridgestone Arena crowd had appeared to get the best of Murray in Games 3 and 4 of the series, in which he allowed a combined eight goals in a pair of Predators victories that evened the series. Murray responded with a shutout at home in Game 5 to put the Penguins back ahead in the series, but whether he could repeat such a performance in such a tough road environment became an open question. Turns out, he could. Not only did he turn away each of Nashville’s 27 shots in Game 6. He did so under the pressure of a scoreless tie all the way until Hornqvist’s go-ahead goal with just 1:35 remaining. It was a clutch a performance as Murray’s team could ask for, and perhaps as clutch as any we’ll ever see by a Penguins goalie.</p>
