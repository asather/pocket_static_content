<h1>Pitt, CMU among universities to develop contingency teaching plans in wake of virus outbreak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With luck, Cynthia Golden and her staff at the University of Pittsburgh will see a normal finish to spring semester — final exams in late April, then commencement in the 12,500-seat Petersen Events Center, and finally summer break.</p>
<p>But with COVID-19 taking hold in the U.S., already interrupting classes at some major universities, the <a href="https://teaching.pitt.edu/" target="_blank">center for teaching and learning</a> she leads is <a href="https://teaching.pitt.edu/instructional-continuity/" target="_blank">helping Pitt faculty prepare for the possibility</a> of a vastly different reality once students return from spring break next week — from holding some classes online, if necessary, to suspension of face-to-face instruction altogether.</p>
<p>With the number of confirmed novel coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania at 10 as of Monday afternoon, up from two on Friday, Pitt is not alone in developing contingencies. So are many other campuses in the region, among them Penn State University and Carnegie Mellon University.</p>
<p>On Monday, Carnegie Mellon announced that with Qatar officials closing campuses in that country to slow the virus’s spread, <a href="https://www.qatar.cmu.edu/alert/alert-covid-update/" target="_blank">CMU-Qatar would shutter at midnight,</a> classes would be postponed for two days and then resume online Thursday indefinitely.</p>
<p>“University events, including student gatherings, are suspended until further notice," a statement on CMU-Qatar’s website said.</p>
<p>Even in the U.S., what seemed a remote possibility a week ago is starting to feel less so. On Monday, the University of California Berkeley on the West Coast and Princeton and Columbia universities on the East Coast joined a growing number of prominent campuses opting to pause in-person classes, a group also including Stanford University and the University of Washington.</p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon, also on spring break this week, the seriousness of the situation was evident in a message Saturday from the dean of Carnegie Mellon’s Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences.</p>
<p>In his message, Richard Scheines told the college that many students and faculty will have difficulty returning to campus from spring break due to travel restrictions, quarantine and that others may be reluctant to show up because they are immuno-compromised and fear infection.</p>
<p>“We have never dealt with anything like this, and the situation is very fluid,’’ he wrote.</p>
<p>At Penn State, where a dozen action groups are meeting over varied campus issues like commencement, study abroad and athletics,&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;"><a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/611370/2020/03/07/administration/current-status-large-gatherings-campus" target="_blank">senior leaders were said to be deciding</a> “whether and how” events can occur,&nbsp; “</span>from academic symposia to student-led conferences to the annual Blue-White Game,” according to the university’s website.</p>
<p>On Pitt’s Oakland campus, where about 29,000 of the university’s 34,000 students are enrolled, Ms. Golden said she would be happy if it turns out the elaborate planning is not needed.</p>
<p>"My hope is that our university continues to operate normally and that we don't have to move into this mode of alternative instruction, but we'll be prepared if we have to," said Ms. Golden, associate vice provost and executive director of the University Center for Teaching and Learning. "We've been preparing for this for a long time."</p>
<p>The center’s staff, skilled in such areas as pedagogy and teaching support, has updated web pages with resources for faculty, as well as a newsletter that is helping promote discussion about learning or teaching from home.</p>
<p>"It's things like 'Have you thought about whether you want to offer your class synchronously or asynchronously? Do you know how to make video content for your courses if that's what you want to do?’’’ she said.</p>
<p>"The majority of our faculty use at least some technology in their teaching," she said.</p>
<p>And mobile technology like smartphones and tablets increase the likelihood a student who must learn from home or elsewhere can connect.</p>
<p>Pitt has a large infrastructure and bandwidth able to support web-based teaching, she said, adding that Pitt also has experience with instructional continuity questions, some resulting from severe winter storms, and others from a rash of bomb threats that rattled campus in 2012.</p>
<p>The problem this time, she said, is trying to anticipate the highly unpredictable spread of a virus now in 100 countries that by Monday afternoon was blamed for 4,000 deaths globally.</p>
<p>"I think the biggest challenge right now is the unknown," she said.</p>
<p>The University Library System at Pitt also is gearing up in case a switch to remote classes comes to pass. The system has 4.7 million print and electronic volumes, and when combined with the Health Sciences Library System and Law Library, has 5.5 million volumes, said Kornelia Tancheva,&nbsp;Hillman University Librarian and Director of the University Library System.</p>
<p>“Many of our services can be delivered online, and we will continue all operations that can safely be conducted remotely, should the university transition to online instruction,” she said.</p>
<p>“Our primary goal is to provide support for teaching, learning and research — the Pitt community will have access to our electronic resources from any location, as well as to our expert librarians via our electronic reference and consultation service.”</p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon, Mr. Scheines praised elaborate efforts by Carnegie Mellon leaders to prepare and urged those in the college to be accommodating to students for the balance of the semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This is not the time to strictly enforce policies listed in your syllabi — rather, it is the time to triage solutions that meet your educational goals but also allow students to proceed even if they (or you) cannot come to class,” he wrote.</p>
