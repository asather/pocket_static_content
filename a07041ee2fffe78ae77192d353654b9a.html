<h1>Keone Kela named Pirates' closer to start 2020 season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BRADENTON, Fla. â€” Remember how Pirates manager Derek Shelton said back at PiratesFest that the closer role wouldn't be a guarantee for Keone Kela?</p>
<p>Well, about that. Shelton told reporters on Wednesday that Kela will indeed be the closer in 2020 for the Pirates.</p>
<p>Kela had a 2-0 record with a 2.12 ERA in 29 2/3 innings with 33 strikeouts in 2019. He was especially dominant from July 24 until the end of the season, when he&nbsp;gave up only one run on eight hits, seven walks, and one hit batter in&nbsp;18 innings. He faced 69 batters and struck out 22 of them.</p>
<p>Kela was likely the natural internal choice for the closer role, as he had 24 saves for the Texas Rangers before the Pirates acquired him in 2018. Kela moved to the setup role while Felipe Vazquez was the closer.</p>
<p>With Vazquez in jail, the Pirates needed a closer and Shelton has tabbed Kela.</p>
