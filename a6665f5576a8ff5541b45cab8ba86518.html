<p>An elderly female pedestrian has died after she was reportedly hit by a shuttle bus on Terrace Street in Oakland on Thursday afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>According to Allegheny County dispatch, police and EMS responded to the scene at 3400 Terrace St. after reports of a female pedestrian who was struck by a vehicle around 3:33 p.m.</p>
<p>When first responders arrived, they found a nurse performing CPR on the woman, Public Safety spokesperson Maurice Matthews said. From the initial investigation, Mr. Matthews said, the woman was struck in the roadway by a UPMC shuttle bus turning left onto Terrace Street from Buffalo Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>EMS transported her to UPMC Presbyterian hospital in critical condition, Mr. Matthews said. She was pronounced dead shortly after arrival, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The driver of the bus stayed at the scene and cooperated with police, according to Mr. Matthews.</p>
<p>Police temporarily closed Terrace Street between Chesterfield Road and Darragh Street while the Collision Investigation Unit processed the scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The UPMC shuttle bus was moved from the scene around 5:36 p.m. The bus had stopped in the center of the road and appeared to be in midturn onto Terrace Street.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the bus was moved, one sneaker could be seen in the middle of the roadway near the intersection of Buffalo and Terrace. A police officer collected the sneaker in a brown paper bag.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh fire department also responded to the scene around 5:55 p.m. Terrace Street was shortly reopened to traffic around 6 p.m.</p>
<p>There is currently no crosswalk painted at the intersection of where the bus tried to turn left onto Terrace Street. A crosswalk can be seen one block down at the intersection of Terrace Street and Chesterfield Road as well as at the intersection of Terrace Street and Darragh Street one block in the other direction.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a written statement, UPMC officials said the fatal crash is a&nbsp;“tragedy for our community.”</p>
<p>“Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with the family of the deceased and with all who witnessed this terrible event,” the statement said. “Pittsburgh Police are leading the investigation and have our full cooperation.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thursday’s fatal pedestrian crash comes after&nbsp;a University of Pittsburgh student died in January after she was struck by a Port Authority bus on Fifth Avenue in Oakland.</p>
