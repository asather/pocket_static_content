<h1>Hurting financially during the pandemic? State issues guide to breaks in Pennsylvania</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With unemployment rolls skyrocketing, the state has released a guide to the many breaks and protections available to Pennsylvanians struggling financially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“With the intense amount of information and misinformation out there, we wanted to help individuals impacted by this crisis know the facts, their rights and what they are entitled to during these uncertain times,” Attorney General Josh Shapiro said in a statement Friday.</p>
<p>Some of the topics include the moratorium on utility shut-offs, foreclosures and evictions; grace periods for student, home and auto loans; special jobless benefits; and relief from late and overdraft fees.</p>
<p>The guide, which also contains contact information, <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Unemployment-Rights-and-Resources-%E2%80%93-COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank">is available here</a>.</p>
<p>For questions or additional contact information, call the AG’s office at 717-787-3391 or send an email to info@attorneygeneral.gov.</p>
