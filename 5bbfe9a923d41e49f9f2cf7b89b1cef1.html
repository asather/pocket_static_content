<h1>Paul Zeise: Shortened season could actually benefit the Pirates </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Once again plans to get the Major League Baseball season rolling are leaking out, and this latest idea seems to be one that might actually be realistic.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/columnist/bob-nightengale/2020/04/28/mlb-optimistic-about-starting-season-late-june/3039275001/" target="_blank">Bob Nightengale of USA Today</a>,&nbsp;under the newest plan being discussed,&nbsp;teams would play at their home stadiums. There would be no fans, at least initially, and the National and American League would be scrapped and the teams realigned into three 10-team regional divisions.</p>
<p>Teams would then only play within their division, which would help minimize travel. And whatever form of preseason training is decided upon would take place in each team’s home stadium as opposed to spring training sites. This, too, would minimize travel and costs and also allow players to stay at home with their families.</p>
<p>Also, the plan would call for the season to be reduced to 100 games. That, to me, is the most significant part of the plan because it will change the way the season plays out. That is a significant reduction in games which would likely mean the trading deadline would have less of an impact and there is a lot less time for teams to recover from a bad start.</p>
<p>This is where the plan might actually be beneficial to the Pirates. The shorter the sample size, the less margin for error, and that means the teams with high payrolls and deeper rosters have less of an advantage.</p>
<p>The Pirates don’t have the depth of pitching and everyday players that some of the large market teams have, and in a 162-game season that almost always shows up. Baseball is a long-haul sport, and the best and deepest teams are almost always left standing at the end of the season</p>
<p>That’s not to say the Pirates will be able to be a contender, but all it would take is one hot stretch of about 30 games to change their fortunes completely. And there have been examples of those kinds of stretches in just about every season no matter where they finish.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The flip side is a really bad stretch could bury the Pirates, but often their worst stretches have come in August and September — which speaks volumes about their depth.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three seasons come to mind as examples of this.</p>
<p>In 2011, the Pirates finished 69-93 and in last place in the NL Central, 22 games out of first place. They had the second-worst record in the National League. They were by all accounts an awful baseball team. However, they got hot in May and June and they were 53-47 and in first place in the division after 100 games. They then finished 16-46 down the stretch, and so by the time 162 games were played, they were exactly what their talent suggested they were.</p>
<p>The Pirates improved significantly in 2012 as they finished 79-83 and in fourth place in the Central (out of six teams because Houston was still in the division), but they were still 18 games out of first. But after 100 games that season they were 58-42 and in second place, two games behind the Reds. If that season had finished after 100 games, the Pirates would have hosted Atlanta in the wild card game but instead they finished with a losing record.</p>
<p>In 2017, the Pirates were 50-50 after 100 games and only 2 1/2 games out of first place. They then fell apart in late July and August and finished 75-87 and 17 games out of first place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This Pirates team actually reminds me a little bit of the 2011 and 2012 teams. Those teams had some young talent, some pitchers who could get hot and win games in bunches and some good pieces in a bullpen. This year’s team should be very similar, which means if they start off hot, they could indeed hang around the division leaders for 100 games.</p>
<p>Suppose Josh Bell, Bryan Reynolds and Kevin Newman get off to a hot start at the plate and Joe Musgrove, Trevor Williams and Chris Archer get out of the gates fast. That could be enough to carry the Pirates for a couple of months, and in a shortened season, that may be enough.</p>
<p>Many people have buried the Pirates this season because they have such a low payroll and lack of depth, but that can all be mitigated by a shorter season. I would have picked the Pirates to finish last and far out of first with 162 games because they wouldn’t be able to hang around with the best teams that long.</p>
<p>With only 100 games, though, it isn’t that crazy to suggest they could be a contender and maybe even sneak into one of the wild card spots.</p>
