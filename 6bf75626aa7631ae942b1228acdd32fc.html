<h1>China imposes sweeping national security law as Hong Kong marks handover anniversary</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Hong Kong woke up to a new reality on Wednesday, after China's central government imposed a <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2020/07/01/asia/hong-kong-national-security-law-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">sweeping national security law </a>late the night before that critics say has <a href="https://edition.cnn.com/2020/06/30/asia/hong-kong-china-national-security-law-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">stripped the city of its autonomy</a> and precious civil and social freedoms, and cements Beijing's authoritarian rule over the territory.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/25/asia/hong-kong-national-security-law-explainer-intl-hnk-scli/index.html" target="_blank">The law</a> came into effect in Hong Kong in the lead-up to July 1 -- the 23rd anniversary of the handover of Hong Kong from British rule to China -- and dramatically broadens the powers of both local and mainland authorities to investigate, prosecute and punish dissenters.</p>
<p>Speaking after the annual flag raising ceremony on Wednesday, Hong Kong's top official, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, said the law is a "crucial step to ending chaos and violence that has occurred over the past few months" in the city.</p>
<p>"The national security law is the most important development in securing ties between China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region since the handover," she said, framing criticism of the law as "vicious attacks."</p>
<p>The stringent new legislation and its 66 articles were kept secret from the public until the law went into effect and appear to offer the government, courts, police and authorities a roadmap to quash any hint of the mass <a href="https://www.cnn.com/specials/asia/hong-kong-protests-intl-hnk" target="_blank">anti-government protests</a> that rocked the city last year.</p>
<p>In vague language, the law criminalizes secession, subversion, terrorism, and collusion with foreign powers. People who are convicted of such crimes can face sentences up to life in prison.</p>
<p>Activists have vowed to demonstrate against the law on Wednesday -- traditionally a day of protests in the city. For the first time since handover, however, police have not given permission to protesters to hold peaceful demonstrations.</p>
<p>Large red and yellow signs appeared on barges in the city's harbor reading: "To celebrate the national security law."</p>
<p>There was a heavy police presence across Hong Kong's central district and around the city's Legislative Council on Wednesday morning. The night before police commanders were told in a training session that anybody seen waving an independence flag or chanting for independence will be arrested, a police source said. In addition, the source said anybody searched and found to have independence flags in their possession will be arrested.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, a handful of protesters gathered in Wan Chai district, near to where the flag raising ceremony was held, and could be heard chanting "the people will never forget" and "smash the national security law."</p>
<p><strong>Here are some of the key takeaways of the law:</strong></p>
<p>The legislation has been widely criticized by opposition lawmakers in Hong Kong, human rights groups and politicians worldwide. Many worry it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/asia/china-national-security-law-prosecution-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank">will be used to target</a> political dissidents, activists, human rights lawyers and journalists amid the central government's continuing crackdown on civil society under Chinese President Xi Jinping.</p>
<p>Opponents of the law say it marks the end of the "one country, two systems" -- a principle by which Hong Kong has retained limited democracy and civil liberties since coming under Chinese control.</p>
<p>Crucially, those freedoms include the right to assembly, a free press, and an independent judiciary, rights that are not enjoyed on the Chinese mainland.</p>
<p>Jimmy Lai, a Hong Kong media tycoon known for his outspoken support of the city's pro-democracy movement, said the law "spells a death knell to Hong Kong because it supersedes our law and our rule of law."</p>
<p>Rights group Amnesty International said the legislation "represents the greatest threat to human rights in the city's recent history."</p>
<p>"The speed and secrecy with which China has pushed through this legislation intensifies the fear that Beijing has calculatingly created a weapon of repression to be used against government critics, including people who are merely expressing their views or protesting peacefully," said the head of Amnesty International's China Team, Joshua Rosenzweig.</p>
<p>United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said it was a "sad day for Hong Kong, and for freedom-loving people across China" with the imposition of the national security legislation in Hong Kong.</p>
<p>He said the law "destroys the territory's autonomy and one of China's greatest achievements."</p>
