<h1>Boaters renting an escape from COVID-19 on Pittsburgh’s waterways</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After months of living under COVID-19 restrictions, Krysia Kubiak and her husband made the painstaking decision to cancel their August beach vacation. But rather than just sit at home, the couple decided to do the next best thing: join a boating club.</p>
<p>In mid-May, Ms. Kubiak of Squirrel Hill joined Freedom Boat Club Pittsburgh, a members-only boat club with locations all across the U.S., Canada and France. Rather than buying and maintaining their own boats, members instead pay a monthly fee to use the club’s boats whenever they wish.</p>
<p>“People haven’t been able to go to the pool or to after-school events,” said Michael Hills, a Freedom Boat Club Pittsburgh franchise owner.&nbsp;“There’s just so many things that families in particular can’t do right now.&nbsp;Boating is something that’s really fun and can safely fill that gap.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Freedom Boat Club, which was founded in Sarasota, Fla., in 1989, has over 200 different locations with thousands of members that are joining at record numbers since stay-at-home orders began. The individual locations buy boats of all types, in congruence with how many members they have, and members then have unlimited access to them during the clubs’ season.</p>
<p>After he retired in May 2019, Mr. Hills bought the franchise, which is located at The Landing and Marina in Station Square. Membership grew at a steady pace, he said, reaching almost 30 members by the end of the season in October.</p>
<p>Since re-opening in May, membership at the club has more than doubled, most likely due to the restrictions imposed because of the virus, Mr. Hills said.</p>
<p>“I think people are realizing that boating is a great way to have fun while socially distancing, but most can’t or don’t want to deal with the cost and time associated with boat ownership.” Mr. Hills said. “Costs for club members meanwhile are about 40% of what owning a boat would be.”</p>
<p>Members pay a one-time entry fee to join, a monthly membership fee, and individual gas usage.&nbsp;Normally the upfront fee is $6,000, but there’s a summer special for $4,500, and the monthly fee is $350. Members are also required to get a boating license and attend a four-hour training seminar provided by one of the club’s five Coast Guard-certified captains.</p>
<p>Since her family joined the club, Ms. Kubiak said they go out two or three times per week — because they enjoy it and because it’s a safer option during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“Boating seems like one of the safest things we could do because the boats are disinfected between uses, we are naturally distanced from people and everyone wears masks on the docks.” Ms. Kubiak said.</p>
<p>Caitlin Miller of South Side Flats, one of the first to join the Pittsburgh club when it opened last year, said boating has provided a getaway from all of the stresses of the past several months.</p>
<p>“In these unprecedented times, boating has become our favorite hobby and an escape from all of the mayhem in the world right now.” Ms. Miller said. “It feels like a mini-vacation right in the heart of Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Mr. Hills said he expects membership to reach somewhere between 80 to 100 people by the time the club closes for the year on Oct. 31.</p>
<p>Although the Pittsburgh location remains relatively small compared to others, Mr. Hills, who was born and raised in Pittsburgh, said the city’s rivers and natural beauty will entice more and more people to join, especially if social restrictions remain in place.</p>
<p>“I'm very blessed.” he said. “I’ve been a boater in Pittsburgh for 28 years and I’ve finally found an opportunity to help bring that boating experience to the city that I love.”</p>
