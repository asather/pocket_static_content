<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh man has been indicted on a federal gun charge in connection with a domestic violence allegation.</p>
<p>U.S. marshals arrested Joseph Plasan, 32, of Beechview, on Monday in Portland, Ore.</p>
<p>Mr. Plasan had been indicted in Pittsburgh on July 8. The case was unsealed Tuesday following his arrest.</p>
<p>On May 5, according to the indictment, Mr. Plasan possessed a .45-caliber pistol and ammunition while knowing he was subject to a protection from abuse order. Federal law prohibits anyone subject to a PFA from having a gun.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said&nbsp;abusers with guns are five times more likely to kill their victims "so prosecuting those abusers and taking them off the streets is one of our top priorities."</p>
<p>Gun offenses are much more serious in federal court than in the state system, almost always resulting in federal prison time. There is also no parole in the federal system.</p>
<p>The government has requested that Mr. Plasan be detained pending trial.</p>
