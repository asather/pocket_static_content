<h1>Trevor Williams can’t wait to see these homers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Trevor Williams and Cory Hahn planned the inaugural Dingers in the Desert charity event last year, they tried their best to think of everything.</p>
<p>Question-and-answer sessions with players? Check. Food and drink? Of course. They also made sure to include three separate events, one involving kids from local travel ball teams, another pitting two Arizona State teammates head-to-head and the main event for those in the professional ranks.</p>
<p>But there was one thing they forgot.</p>
<p>Before the youngest group was supposed to hit, Williams and others quickly realized they had forgotten to assign a pitcher. So Williams took the mound himself and handled it, later joking that he feared getting the yips because he was grooving pitches without a catcher.</p>
<p>“It was all good, though,” Williams said.</p>
<p>With Dingers in the Desert set for an encore presentation Saturday, Williams expects the <a href="https://projectthirtyfour.com/" target="_blank">Project 34</a>-backed event will be even better, especially because of timing. Whereas last year’s event coincided with many teams holding offseason events such as PiratesFest, the 2020 version does not, which will allow fellow Pirates players Cole Tucker, Kevin Newman and Kevin Kramer to participate.</p>
<p>“That’s awesome, not only for the Pirates but knowing that my teammates support my charity,” Williams said.</p>
<p>Logistically, it’s also easier for Williams and Hahn, because they know more of what to expect.</p>
<p>“Each year it’s going to get better,” Williams said. “We have big goals for what we want this to be and become. I think we’re well on our way to doing that, where this is our main fundraiser every year and we’re able to help a lot of families.”</p>
<p>Project 34 is a nonprofit Williams and Hahn founded in March 2018. It benefits those who have suffered spinal-cord injuries, those who support them and to help with care received — things such as wheelchairs, physical therapy, ramps and other equipment/assistance.</p>
<p>Hahn, Williams’ teammate at Arizona State, has been the inspiration behind the entire effort after <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2018/02/23/trevor-williams-jersey-number-cory-hahn-paralyzed-project-34-arizona-state-pirates/stories/201802210173" target="_blank">he suffered a career-ending spinal-cord injury</a> during a headfirst slide into second base back in 2011.</p>
<p>Last year’s event, held at Phoenix Municipal Stadium — home of the Sun Devils — raised $10,000. Following through on another part of their vision for the event, Dingers will move to Grand Canyon University this year, a neat tie-in because Antelopes coach Andy Stankiewicz actually recruited both Williams and Hahn.</p>
<p>“Arizona State treated us great,” Williams said. “We just kind of wanted to move it around the Phoenix valley.</p>
<p>“Grand Canyon was more than happy to accept our invitation. [Stankiewicz] was ecstatic about it.”</p>
<p>Same as last year, ESPN’s Pedro Gomez will emcee the event, while Williams will probably say few words as well.</p>
<p>One part Williams is particularly excited for includes an on-field presentation of a grant, something the Pirates pitcher thinks is important for transparency.</p>
<p>“We’re awarding the grant on the field to show people that we are doing good; we’re not just saying it,” Williams said. “It will also help raise awareness for how much stuff costs and people know where their money is going.”</p>
<p>Tickets are $10 at the door, and doors open at 11 a.m. on the day of the event. Without naming names, Williams said they have “six guys locked in,” and they’re waiting to hear back from a few more.</p>
<p>As a pitcher, there are certainly more enjoyable things for Williams to see than baseballs flying over the fence — especially when he’s the one throwing the pitch — but this is one day where Williams is thrilled to make an exception.</p>
<p>“It is funny to think about it that way,” Williams said. “It’s unique. So many people do golf tournaments, dinners and casino nights. I thought it would be unique, especially to baseball, especially to Cory to have a Home Run Derby where it’s a charity event and people could donate X-amount of dollars per home run hit versus a lump sum donation.</p>
<p>“A lot of people saw the success that the event had last year and want to be a part of it this year. We’re excited to put it on again. It’s something that we’ve been looking forward to all offseason.”</p>
