<h1>Jason Mackey: A baseball — and reporting — fantasy come to life</h1>

<p>The pitcher stood atop the mound, knees wobbling, palms sweating, staring 60 feet, 6 inches away at the catcher. This used to feel a lot closer, the man whispered to himself as he fidgeted some more, the brand-new Adidas spikes on his feet offering little give.</p>
<p>A few years prior, no such trepidation existed. Life was simple. Grip it, rip it, hit your spots. Now, after years of not doing this, the former college baseball player worried whether his arm might sever at the shoulder or elbow and tumble end-over-end toward home plate.</p>
<p>The pitcher on this day was me. Talked into playing competitive baseball again in my late 20s, I called one of my lifelong friends, Scott Labyoda, who agreed to catch what amounted to a bullpen session, thrown at Winklevoss Field in West Mifflin nearly nine years ago. It was one of the few times in my life where I was truly frightened.</p>
<p>That familiar, nervous feeling has returned, as next week I’ll tackle a unique assignment for the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: attending Pirates Fantasy Camp and writing about all that I experience … as a player. If I told you that I was treating this like anything else I’ve done here, I’d be telling a gigantic lie.</p>
<p>My baseball equipment sits on my basement floor, eager to be used. I’ve been practicing my pitching windup while playing with my kids. Thoughts of batting practice and flipping to second and blocking balls in the dirt have occupied much of my brain space — and none of that has anything to do with covering the Pirates.</p>
<p>As part of this assignment, I will do everything the campers do. That means playing for a team, meeting former Pirates, dressing in the clubhouse, wearing a uniform, the whole deal. I fully intend on being a good teammate, getting to know the men and women who are willing to plunk down a sizable sum to live like a major leaguer for a week and to tell you about why they do something like this. I’ll also write about myself, good or bad.</p>
<p>Playing baseball has been a huge part of my life for as long as I can remember. My dad and I used to play Wiffle ball in the backyard of his Dormont duplex, and I’d giggle every time I made him chase a ball that I hit into the alley. He taught me to hit the ball out of my hand at Keystone Oaks’ old football field, and pretty much every Sunday we’d go to the batting cages and hit.</p>
<p>When my dad moved to Castle Shannon, he had an enormous grass field behind his house. We’d long toss. I’d pitch. He’d catch. We’d work on ground balls. Never, ever was it too much. I loved baseball, loved it through high school (at Brentwood) and even in college, when I played four years of it at Westminster College.</p>
<p>There’s something about the sport that has always resonated with me. Maybe it’s the strategy, the skill involved or the lack of a clock. The history surely had something to do with it, too. Whatever the case, baseball has always been one of the primary loves in my life, hence why I decided to trade the hockey beat for baseball last summer.</p>
<p>It also offers a special connection to my dad, who passed away on March 25, 2018. In a way, this is also for him; I actually purchased a necklace that holds some of his ashes, so I’ll be able to take part of my dad with me on this assignment.</p>
<p>When I made the move to covering baseball, I figured there would be opportunities to do unique stories or, at minimum, report things differently because of my knowledge of baseball — greater than that of hockey. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine something like this.</p>
<p>Participating in Fantasy Camp for the week might have a certain appeal for fans. They’ll get to talk to Steve Blass, Doug Drabek, Kent Tekulve and others and hear Pirates legends talk about the glory years.</p>
<p>I want to know about the people who care so deeply about that. I want to meet the folks who come to this thing and hear why they bother to do it, especially in their 60s, 70s and 80s. Every day, beginning Sunday evening, I will write something from down there, most likely multiple stories per day.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a recap of the day’s events. Or a feature on someone I met who has an interesting backstory. Or perhaps my right arm will fly off and go tumbling toward the catcher. You’ll get it all.</p>
<p>I don’t want to sound cocky, but I’m cautiously optimistic about the baseball part. I typically run four or five times per week, usually 5 to 7 miles per run; so, at 36, I’m still somewhat in shape, although I haven’t thrown a baseball hard in years.</p>
<p>My goals next week are simple. I want to play baseball reasonably well, but I also want to avoid serious injury, the same as my fellow campers. I also want to make this trip worth it from a reporting standpoint. Experiencing baseball as a player — even at a fantasy camp — offers a lens through which very few reporters have the privilege to look. I don’t take that lightly.</p>
<p>I hope to bring you all of the details of what it’s like to be out there, what it’s like to dress in front of my own locker at Pirate City, to eat the food that’s served, to meet my teammates, to hopefully get better throughout the week and to beat some of the Orioles’ fantasy campers — a situation where I don’t have to worry about holding anything back.</p>
<p>It should be an incredible week, one filled with tremendous stories and the opportunity of a lifetime, the chance to experience the major leagues up close and personal. My knees are wobbly and palms sweaty just thinking about it.</p>
