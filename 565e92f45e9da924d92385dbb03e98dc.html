<h1>More questions than answers: What will school be like for immunocompromised students?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>School districts are grappling for solutions as the upcoming academic year is approaching. After a rocky finish to instruction in the spring, many parents and students are hoping to see schools open their doors for an in-person experience.</p>
<p>Options for immunocompromised students, though, may be limited, especially as COVID-19 cases reach record numbers throughout the country.</p>
<p>Many school districts in the region are looking at hybrid classrooms for the school year, while allowing parents to opt their child out of in-person learning if they have health concerns.</p>
<p>With more questions than answers about the future, Janet Zak, a teacher at Minadeo Elementary School in Squirrel Hill, struggles to find a feasible solution to keep every student safe while maintaining their educational experience.</p>
<p>“We’ve really moved away from punitive suspensions, so I don’t know how we can control making sure the kids are wearing their masks at all time, not sharing supplies with each other [and] social distancing,” Ms. Zak said.</p>
<p>Ms. Zak said teaching her own children remotely was a hassle, because they didn’t want to pay attention to their mom despite her 22 years of experience. With working parents and teachers untrained in virtual teaching, she said the quality of education for immunocompromised students isn’t guaranteed. Yet, parents can’t take a risk on their child’s health by sending them to school.</p>
<p>“What choice do you have? You don’t have a choice as a parent,” Ms. Zak said. However, she wonders how parents can stay home to teach their children when they have work.</p>
<p>Ms. Zak has a master’s degree in special education from Slippery Rock University. After dedicating much of her career to special education students, she said they are most likely to be immunocompromised. However, they are normally in need of a more hands-on classroom experience that could put them at risk.</p>
<p>James Harris, superintendent of Woodland Hills School District, said administrators are considering bringing in only students who express a need for special accommodations while others learn remotely. However, Ms. Zak doesn’t see that as a possibility.</p>
<p>“I think every student, regardless of disability, needs to have the same opportunities to come to school,” she said.</p>
<p>Another option Mr. Harris is considering is an A/B schedule where half of the students come into the building on specific days while the other half works at home. This may allow immunocompromised students the chance to sit at a classroom desk occasionally, though Mr. Harris said “no model fits everyone perfectly.”</p>
<p>“We may not even be in the building until September, December or January,” Mr. Harris said, adding that the district is seeking advice from hospitals and health experts. “We’re going to stay closed as long as possible.”</p>
<p>Dr. Amr Hakam Sawalha, professor and chief in the department of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh, said it’s possible for immunocompromised students to be kept safe in the classroom if safety procedures are strictly followed — including social distancing, wearing masks and frequent sanitizing.</p>
<p>“If we want to open the schools and have face to face [classes], then we absolutely have to be mindful of physical distancing and that students wear masks while they’re in class, in recess or walking in hallways,” Dr. Sawalha said.</p>
<p>Dr. Sawalha said schools would be entirely remote until at least January if the decision were up to him. However, he pointed out it may not be attainable for those with spotty internet even if it’s safer to keep immunocompromised students at home, which schools should be&nbsp;“extremely mindful” of before making the final decision.</p>
<p>Jessica Goeller of Indiana Township&nbsp;said her family will remain&nbsp;“as flexible and positive as possible” instead of worrying about the future and school.&nbsp;Mrs. Goeller is the mother of Lucas Goeller, 7, who underwent a liver transplant after being diagnosed with biliary atresia, an incurable liver disease, at 3 months old. On her website, ourfamilyrx.com, she encourages parents of immunocompromised children to enjoy life even through the pandemic.</p>
<p>“[Parents] shouldn’t be so caught up in the fact that there’s one virus out there,” Mrs. Goeller said.&nbsp;“If you could think of the many things that could go wrong, you’ll be bounded by fear.”</p>
<p>Lucas attends a private Catholic school where Mrs. Goeller said she and her husband feel comfortable sending him back if doors reopen. The student population is smaller than a public school, so there are less students to monitor for health risks.</p>
<p>If in-person learning becomes uncomfortable or unsafe, Mrs. Goeller said they’re willing to&nbsp;“change and adjust” to protect their children. However, she wants to treat Lucas like other children and give him the opportunity to come back to school with his friends.</p>
<p>“Kids are going to be kids no matter what restrictions you put on them,” she said, adding a lesson she teaches Lucas every day.&nbsp;“...no matter what virus is going around, wash your hands and don’t put your hands in your mouth.”&nbsp;</p>
