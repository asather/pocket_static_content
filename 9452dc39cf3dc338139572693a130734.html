<h1>2 new deaths in Western Pa.; state reports 780 new cases of COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania has 780 new cases of COVID-19 and 113 new deaths from the viral disease, the state health department reported on Wednesday. Two of the deaths occurred in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Allegheny County and Armstrong each reported a death, according to the state.</p>
<p>With the new figures, the county’s pandemic death toll stands at 151 — 140 are confirmed and 11 are probable. However, the state listed Allegheny County with 160 deaths. Armstrong County is now reporting four total deaths.</p>
<p>Since Allegheny County’s first case of COVID-19 was reported on March 14, the county has had 1,828 cases — 1,720 confirmed and 108 probable cases. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to the county.</p>

<p>As of Wednesday, 324 people in Allegheny County have been hospitalized because of the highly infectious disease. Of them, 126 required a stay at the intensive care unit, and 67 required mechanical ventilation. Allegheny County has administered 29,851 tests, with 992 reported Wednesday. The county health department said it has the capacity to administer roughly 2,000 tests per day.</p>
<p>For the 17th straight day, Pennsylvania health officials on Wednesday reported less than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19. With 780 new cases, the statewide count increased to 69,417. The death count is 5,265.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine also reported new cases of a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/05/12/Pediatric-multi-system-inflammatory-syndrom-Inflammation-children-COVID-19-impact/stories/202005110081" target="_blank">rare inflammatory condition linked to COVID-19</a>, named MIS-C by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Pennsylvania. She said that 17 cases had been reported, and that 9 were confirmed, 6 are under investigation, and 2 were confirmed to be another disease.</p>
<p>UPMC Children’s Hospital of Pittsburgh said it has seen no cases of the condition.</p>
<p>MIS-C is thought to be linked to COVID-19, but Dr. Levine cautioned that there is “rather limited information about this condition.” It is not known, the secretary said, if it only occurs in children, whether there are risk factors for it and how it is transmitted. She urged parents to report symptoms, such as persistent fever, swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain, bloodshot eyes or a rash or change in skin color, to their pediatricians.</p>
<p>On Friday, Mr. Wolf announced that 16 counties, mostly in the northern tier of the state, would move from the yellow category to green this Friday. Additionally, the governor announced Tuesday that Centre County, after initially requesting to be left in yellow, had reversed its request and will also move to green on Friday. Additionally, all counties will be moved out of the most strict red category by June 5, Mr. Wolf announced last week.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said Tuesday that in order for counties to be moved to green, they should see a continued steady reduction in new cases while in the yellow zone. Counties in the yellow category can have some businesses open on a limited basis, and those in green can have restaurants open at half their normal capacity and businesses such as salons can see customers by appointment. Residents in both yellow and green are still cautioned to maintain key public health practices, such as wearing masks, frequent hand-washing and avoiding large crowds.</p>
<p>With just one week until the June 2 Pennsylvania primary, Mr. Wolf called questions about whether the state’s election infrastructure can handle the sharp increase in mail-in ballots “a legitimate concern.” He nonetheless urged Pennsylvanians to apply for a mail-in ballot — the deadline is tonight — so that there is less need to go to the polls in person next Tuesday.</p>
