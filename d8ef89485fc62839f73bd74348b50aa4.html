<h1>New treatment chemical helps PWSA get the lead out</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s only been nine months since the Pittsburgh Water and Sewer Authority started adding an anti-corrosive chemical to reduce lead levels in its water, but new test results show it’s working well.</p>
<p>According to PWSA, tests conducted during the last half of 2019 at 168 city residences with lead service lines or plumbing fixtures, show lead levels measured at 10 parts per billion, down significantly from the 17.52 parts per billion level found in household tests during the first half of last year.</p>
<p>The PWSA, in April 2019, began using orthophosphate, a food-grade additive that forms a protective layer inside lead service lines and creates a barrier between the lead in the lines and the water flowing through them.</p>
<p>“We are pleased to see lower lead levels in our drinking water samples during this round of testing,” PWSA Executive Director Robert A. Weimar said in a Friday release announcing the results. “We are encouraged by the results but our work is not done. We must continue with our stringent monitoring program to ensure that orthophosphate is working effectively in every corner of our service area.”</p>
<p>Since 2016, when testing found water in some city households exceeded the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency action level of 15 parts per billion, the PWSA has been required to do water testing in the most at-risk city households every six months. A 2017 state Department of Environmental Protection consent order also requires the water authority to annually replace thousands of lead service lines —&nbsp;the pipes connecting households with city water mains.</p>
<p>To date more than 6,000 lead service lines have been replaced, free of charge to homeowners, including 3,000 last year. Plans are to replace another 3,000 lines in 2020. The water authority also has inspected 17,000 homes for lead lines.</p>
<p>Will Pickering, a PWSA spokesman, said the test results announced Friday are the third time since June 2016 and the first since June 2018 that the readings have been at or below the 15 parts per billion federal action level.</p>
<p>According to the PWSA, 96% of the 168 water samples taken during the last six months of 2019 were below the EPA’s lead action level, an 8% increase from the June 2019 testing round.</p>
<p>“These latest lower lead testing results signals that PWSA is passing another major milestone as we work to regain the public’s trust,” said PWSA Board Chair Paul Leger. “</p>
<p>A breakdown of the testing results shows:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;116 of the samples had lead concentrations of less than 5 parts per billion</p>
<p>•&nbsp;34 were between 5 and 9.9 ppb</p>
<p>•&nbsp;12 were between 10 and 14.9 ppb</p>
<p>•&nbsp;4 were between 15 and 19.9 ppb</p>
<p>•&nbsp;1 was between 20 and 49.9 ppb</p>
<p>•1 was higher than 50 ppb</p>
<p>The PWSA provides free water filters to any home with test results higher than 10 ppb, and consults with homeowners whose lead levels are higher than 50 ppb to determine potential causes.</p>
<p>The PWSA will conduct another round of testing during the first six months of 2020.</p>
