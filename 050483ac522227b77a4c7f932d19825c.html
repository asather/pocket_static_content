<h1>A unique drama: The debate over Richard Grenell and CMU</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In one sense, the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/06/23/Carnegie-Mellon-University-Richard-Grenell-academic-freedom-race-diplomacy-Trump/stories/202006220059" target="_blank">debate now unfolding</a> at Carnegie Mellon University over the appointment of former U.S. ambassador Richard Grenell as a senior fellow is its own unique drama: a former government official with a history of off-color remarks on social media about women, a man associated with far-right groups, hired without what faculty critics say was adequate vetting.</p>
<p>Mr. Grenell was an appointee of President Donald Trump. So was the campus administrator who hired him.</p>
<p>But the dust-up at CMU also fits a pattern stretching back long before Mr. Trump entered the White House, before “cancel culture” and “#MeToo” became part of America’s lexicon, or even before anyone had heard of social media or Twitter.</p>
<p>Two decades ago, it was “little Eichmanns” and outrage that a University of Colorado professor used those words to suggest that victims of the 9/11 attacks were less than innocents given U.S foreign policy. More recently, those in academia — and others passing through as fellows — have seen past writings or actions scrutinized for evidence of sexism, xenophobia or fascist leanings.</p>
<p>While culture wars raging across college campuses are not necessarily more intense now, they escalate more rapidly on social media where individuals assume they are speaking to like-minded peers but are ripe to be instantly outed by strangers.</p>
<p>“Anyone with a Twitter account can say, ‘Twitter, do your thing,’ and make offensive speech go viral,’’ said Adam Steinbaugh, a lawyer with the nonpartisan, Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education.</p>
<p>Universities inevitably attract those once in power and who often have done controversial things. The challenge for an institution is to tolerate the controversy while also creating a learning opportunity, “a chance to confront whatever it was they are involved with and analyze it,” Mr. Steinbaugh said.</p>
<p>Anecdotally, his group has been hearing more grievances the last few months from those on the right, but that easily could swing back to those from the left by the fall, Mr. Steinbaugh said.</p>
<p>In defending Mr. Grenell’s one-year appointment to CMU’s Institute for Politics and Strategy, university officials cite his decadelong experience in international relations, including a stint as U.S. ambassador to Germany and more recently in intelligence.</p>
<p>“Ambassador Ric Grenell’s role as acting director of the Office of National Intelligence has given him a unique understanding of the complexities facing the intelligence community and how to address them,” <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ips/kiron-skinner-statement-richard-grenell.html" target="_blank">wrote Kiron Skinner</a>, the CMU institute’s director who was both a member of Mr. Trump’s transition team and served as director for policy planning and senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.</p>
<p>Ms. Skinner noted that Mr. Grenell was the nation’s first openly gay member of a president’s cabinet, a political conservative and a Christian.</p>
<p>About 280 faculty and staff have <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KJWLAWdS3-Jdg6HlhAXcfo3zJlzmiYzeSLaaE0dgkfY/edit" target="_blank">signed an open letter</a> urging the university to rethink the appointment. A <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/rescind-richard-grenells-senior-fellow-position/" target="_blank">separate undergraduate student letter</a> with more than 1,400 signatures says “inviting Richard Grenell as a senior fellow would not only tarnish the reputation and credibility of IPS but hurt the greater Carnegie Mellon community.”</p>
<p>The faculty letter links to media reports about comments from Mr. Grenell on women’s appearances, as well as claims of misinformation. Its signers wrote that “as an ambassador to Germany, Grenell met with numerous members of the racist, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic Alternative for Germany.”</p>
<p>The letter linked to a 2012 HuffPost story that said Mr. Grenell had deleted hundreds of tweets amid scrutiny after he joined Mitt Romney’s presidential campaign.</p>
<p>The story cited progressive organization ThinkProgress, which said Mr. Grenell’s tweets about prominent women in politics and media included one that said, “Hillary is starting to look like Madeline [sic] Albright.” He discussed First Lady Michelle Obama working out and “sweating on the East Room carpet,” HuffPost reported.</p>
<p>It reported that Mr. Grenell, in another tweet, urged MSNBC personality Rachel Maddow “to take a breath and put on a necklace,” and another suggesting she resembled pop singer Justin Bieber.</p>
<p>One professor who signed the letter said Mr. Grenell’s politics as a Republican and his role in the Trump administration were not what moved him.</p>
<p>Rather, the professor said, it was comments Mr. Grenell had made in the past about women and their appearances, and how that reflected on a university promoting itself to women.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s a step backwards. It tells our students — and gender is one of the big issues in my field, computer science — it tells women and women of color that CMU is not sensitive to their situation,” said Jonathan Aldrich, a computer science professor.</p>
<p>Mr. Grenell has declined to comment.</p>
<p>On Thursday afternoon, CMU President Farman Jahanian <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.cmu.edu/leadership/president/campus-comms/2020/2020-06-25.html&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1593203067014000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGHp8Cp_Uau2nQqSK-qf86jGql_Gg" target="_blank">notified campus</a> that he will form two groups: one to examine if Mr. Grenell’s section was consistent with campus norms, and a second to explore related issues of academic freedom.</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian, though acknowledging the amount of opposition, said Mr. Grenell has his supporters, too.</p>
<p>“Surrounding yourself with people who believe the same things just makes you intellectually weak and lazy,” one woman posted in a comment to an earlier Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story. “Everyone needs to stop creating bubbles to live in.”</p>
<p><strong>Not the first</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Grenell is not the first Trump appointee to face controversy after being named a senior fellow.</p>
<p>In 2018, two professors resigned from their positions at a University of Virginia think tank over the appointment as senior fellow of Marc Short, who had been White House director of legislative affairs and senior adviser to Mr. Trump, Inside Higher Education reported.</p>
<p>“The Miller Center has welcomed, and should always welcome, people of diverse political views. We ourselves have brought many Republican and Democratic policy makers as well as many conservative and liberal scholars to the events we have coordinated at the Miller Center,” professors William Hitchcock and Melvyn Leffler wrote in their resignation letter.</p>
<p>But the center’s nonpartisan mission did not square with such a “notoriously partisan political appointee” without open, prior consultation with faculty and staff, they wrote.</p>
<p>Last fall, Indiana University Provost Lauren Robel weighed in on a controversy involving business professor Eric Rasmusen. She said he had used his personal social media account to espouse views that women do not belong in the workplace, particularly academia; that gay men should not be permitted in academia either, as they are promiscuous and unable to avoid abusing students; and that Black students are generally unqualified for attendance at elite institutions and are generally inferior academically to white students.</p>
<p>“Professor Eric Rasmusen has, for many years, used his private social media accounts to disseminate his racist, sexist, and homophobic views,” <a href="https://provost.indiana.edu/statements/archive/first-amendment.html" target="_blank">Ms. Robel wrote</a>. “When I label his views in this way, let me note that the labels are not a close call, nor do his posts require careful parsing to reach these conclusions.”</p>
<p>But, she added, “We cannot, nor would we, fire Professor Rasmusen for his posts as a private citizen, as vile and stupid as they are, because the First Amendment of the United States Constitution forbids us to do so.”</p>
<p>Instead, she said, the university in Bloomington, Ind., would ensure no student be required to take his course and that precautions would be taken to ensure impartiality in grading.</p>
<p>Last year, Harvard University announced that Ronald Sullivan Jr. and his wife, Stephanie, would not be renewed as faculty deans at its Winthrop House following protests over Mr. Sullivan’s decision at the time to represent disgraced Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein, later found guilty of rape.</p>
<p>The Sullivans retained their law school appointments, but both pressed a campaign about free speech and due process after Harvard’s decision.</p>
<p>“What’s at stake here is not my future, or ours or even our family’s. We will be fine,” said Mr. Sullivan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EwRNi-HEk4" target="_blank">in a video</a> he made with his wife. “What’s at stake are the values that underwrite the best traditions of higher education.”</p>
<p>Two years before that, Harvard had extended and then quickly rescinded visiting fellow status to Chelsea Manning, a transgender woman who served seven years in a military prison for sharing information with Wikileaks before being pardoned by then-President Barack Obama.</p>
<p>In 2001, with the Sept. 11 attacks still fresh, University of Colorado professor Ward Churchill <a href="https://cryptome.org/ward-churchill.htm" target="_blank">penned an essay</a> titled “Some People Push Back: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens.” According to a copy archived on the Internet, it invoked the name of Adolph Eichmann, equating World Trade Center victims with a Nazi who bore responsibility for abuses by others. Mr. Churchill wrote about the killing of Iraqis and inaction by those in the World Trade Center going to work every day.</p>
<p>“If there was a better, more effective, or in fact any other way of visiting some penalty befitting their participation upon the little Eichmanns inhabiting the sterile sanctuary of the twin towers, I’d really be interested in hearing about it,” he wrote.</p>
<p>The essay went largely unnoticed for four years, until a speech he was to give at Hamilton College in New York was canceled amid what the school described as credible death threats, The Associated Press reported at the time.</p>
<p>Then-Colorado Gov. Bill Owens, a Republican, said Mr. Churchill should be fired, while New York Gov. George Pataki called him a “supporter of terrorists.” Then-Fox News host Bill O’Reilly said the professor “deserves to be shunned forever,” according to his website.</p>
<p>Mr. Churchill was fired by the university in 2007 over research misconduct allegations. He said the dismissal was an outgrowth of the essay and sued; while a court ruled he was unjustly fired, he lost subsequent appeals.</p>
<p><strong>Defending Grenell</strong></p>
<p>At Carnegie Mellon, the faculty protest letter carries signatures from campus divisions that include humanities and social sciences, computer science, business, science, fine arts, engineering, libraries and other units. Two-thirds of the signers are faculty members.</p>
<p>Provost James Garrett Jr. has defended the selection of Mr. Grenell. He said the deans of the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Engineering, and the School of Computer Science, who supervise the institute, saw it as a matter of academic freedom.</p>
<p>“This same academic freedom protects deans and department heads in appointments they might make. It also protects each member of the faculty from interference in the types of speakers they invite to campus or the types of scholarly and artistic works in which they endeavor,” Mr. Garrett wrote. “Limiting that academic freedom in one case would create a precedent that could jeopardize all of us in the future.”</p>
<p>The letter writers contest that, citing definitions that describe academic freedom as involving “personal teaching and research. It does traditionally include speakers invited to campus, but it does not include appointing faculty, special or otherwise.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Mr. Jahanian outlined Carnegie Mellon’s response, including creation of groups to review the matter. “As an academic community that values the free exchange of ideas, we respect the variety of viewpoints expressed by members of the community on this matter,” he said.</p>
