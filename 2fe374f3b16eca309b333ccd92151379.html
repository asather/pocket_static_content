<h1>Dominik Kahun scratched again after testing injury in warmups</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — For the second time this week, Dominik Kahun was labeled a game-time decision. And for the second time this week, that decision was ultimately a “no.”</p>
<p>The 24-year-old Czech-born forward was initially injured on Thursday, when he blocked a shot off of his left knee at the end of the Penguins 4-0 loss in Toronto. Kahun immediately went to the dressing room. He did not practice on Friday and missed Saturday’s loss against Buffalo and Sunday’s loss to the Washington Capitals. In both instances, he tested the ailing leg during pregame warmups but ultimately was scratched from the lineup.</p>
<p>On the lineup sheet distributed to the media at the Capital One Arena, Kahun was scheduled to play left wing on a line with Sam Lafferty at center and Anthony Angello at right wing. Instead, Andrew Agozzino was inserted as the fourth-line center and Lafferty slid over to left wing.</p>
<p>The fact that Kahun felt healthy enough to test his leg is, in itself, a positive sign when it comes to his availability for this week’s three-game road swing out West. The Penguins could use him back sooner than later. After starting the season with just two points in the first 11 games, he’s emerged as a versatile player and a top-six forward option when healthy. Among healthy wingers, Kahun’s 27 points rank third on the team behind only Bryan Rust (49) and Jared McCann (32).</p>
<p><strong>Trotman gets the nod again</strong></p>
<p>Penguins defenseman Zach Trotman, who was recalled from Wilkes-Barre/Scranton on Wednesday, got the nod for the second straight day.</p>
<p>The right-handed defenseman was asked to play on his off side next to fellow righty Chad Ruhwedel. That’s noteworthy for a couple reasons.</p>
<p>For one, virtually every time Penguins coach Mike Sullivan and general manager Jim Rutherford discuss the defensive corps, they always include Trotman. They consider him one of their nine NHL-caliber defenseman, even if he has spent time this season with Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p>
<p>At the same time, the move says something about the Penguins depth on the left side of their blue line. Lefty Juuso Riikola would be the natural option on the left side because of his handedness. But the Penguins have explored different options instead. They played Ruhwedel on his off side earlier this year in place of Riikola. John Marino and Kris Letang also spent time on their off sides on the top pairing, which in turn had a ripple effect that mean Riikola was a scratch.</p>
<p>Theoretically, when Brian Dumoulin returns from ankle surgery, the left side of the Penguins blue line will get a major shot in the arm. Not only does he have the skill to play on the top pairing, but also has built chemistry with Letang.</p>
<p>Dumoulin recently began skating as his rehab continue into the on-ice phase. With the trade deadline looming at 3 p.m. on Monday, it remains to be seen if the Penguins choose to address that side of their defensive corps via a trade.</p>
<p><strong>Around the boards</strong></p>
<p>After tallying his 700th career goal on Saturday, Capitals star Alex Ovechkin was limited to just one shot on net during Washington’s 5-3 win over the Penguins… Penguins forward Jared McCann ranks sixth on the team with 32 points, however he hasn’t found the back of the net since he scored goals in three straight games on Jan. 12, 14 and 16. He had two prime opportunities on Sunday. He hit the post once and got behind goalie Braden Holtby in the blue paint on a play he just missed finishing… Capitals defenseman John Carlson became the franchise’s all-time points leader among defensemen after recording two points on Sunday. Carlson recorded his 475th career point, passing Calle Johansson (474).</p>
