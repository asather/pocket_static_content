<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Was Kevin Colbert right about Ben Roethlisberger?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lucius Allen and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>Donny Del Zotto, @DonnyD43:</strong> O/U 4,000 yards, 35 TDs for No. 7?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Interesting numbers, Dr. Del Zotto — and your question, combined with Ben’s camp performance, has me wondering if Kevin Colbert was correct when he uttered the following words at the combine: “We might have a better Ben Roethlisberger coming out of this surgery.”</p>
<p>I thought Colbert was nuts at the time, and I’ll still say 40% of Ben would be significantly better than what the Steelers got from the position last season.</p>
<p>But what if he was right?</p>
<p>Roethlisberger has been zipping the ball around practice and talking about how he’s pain-free in that right elbow for the first time in years. The rest of his body is 38, it’s true, but maybe a year off helped rejuvenate the non-elbow parts, as well.</p>
<p>Obviously, we can only know by the games and how Roethlisberger is able to withstand the physical abuse. The proof’s in the pounding, you might say, and with the likes of Von Miller, Myles Garrett and J.J. Watt on the docket, he’s going to take some hits (maybe more than we think, depending on how that right tackle position shakes out).</p>
<p>But if the body and arm are willing, Roethlisberger could become the rare athlete to combine a mature mental acuity for the game with still-elite physical skills. So many athletes finally figure it all out when it’s too late (that’s when they become TV analysts or coaches). Roethlisberger’s mental game, as one would expect, has evolved dramatically over the years, even as his mobility has declined.</p>
<p>He has plenty of weaponry, too. So what about the numbers?</p>
<p>You said 35 touchdowns. That would mark a career-best by one. You also said 4,000 yards. Roethlisberger has cracked that number six times and should do so easily if he plays 14-15 games.</p>
<p>So let’s go through Ben’s career bests and add a “yes” or “no” as to whether he’ll top those figures this season:</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Completion Pct.: 68.0 (2015). Yes.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Touchdowns: 34 (2018). Yes.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Yards: 5,129 (2018). No.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Rating: 104.1 (2007). Yes.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Interceptions: 23 (2006). No, meaning he will (and better) throw way less than 23 interceptions. Half as many or fewer would be good.</p>
<p>Add it all up, and yes, Dr. Del Zotto, I think we might see Ben have his best season.</p>
<p><strong>Joel Alexander, @Joel_Closer:</strong> Odds the NFL gets through a full season? Odds Ben Roethlisberger is the Steelers QB next year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> It’s going to be tricky to try to survive in a non-bubble environment, Joel, but baseball is still playing, despite tire fires erupting left and right. I think the NFL will have to navigate some unusual situations — can you imagine if an entire quarterback room is put in quarantine for a week? — but I like the odds at the moment.</p>
<p>As for Ben, it all depends on health. If he’s healthy and productive this season — and I see no reason why he wouldn’t be — then yes, he will absolutely be the Steelers quarterback next season.</p>
<p><strong>Matt dicicco, @DiciccoMatt:</strong> Is there anything dumber than “unwritten rules” of baseball?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I can think of a few things, Matt. Just not many. I’m glad Fernando Tatis Jr. is smashing some of unwritten rules to pieces. Did you see him stretch a single into a double with a 10-run lead the other day?</p>
<p>If you don’t like it, stop him.</p>
<p>I’m still reeling over the whole grand slam-on-a-3-0-count-with-a-seven-run-lead debacle from a few weeks ago and how Tatis’ manager, Jayce Tingler, seemed upset and called it a “learning opportunity” for Tatis.</p>
<p>If I’m the Padres owner, I call Tingler into my office the next morning and read him the riot act.</p>
<p>I make these two points, emphatically, to my friend Tingler:</p>
<p>1. This franchise has been a joke for many years. We’re good now. Tatis is way more than important than you. If he hits a grand slam, under any circumstances, that’s a good thing. So shut up.</p>
<p>2. Do you remember when we blew a 6-2 lead to San Francisco earlier this season? Or how about when we trailed 7-1 in the eighth inning against Arizona on Aug. 15 and came back to make it 7-6 and were a play at the plate away from tying the score in the ninth? Review point No. 1: We’ve been a joke for many years. We never, ever, NEVER, EVER, NEVER, EVER take a win for granted around here. Do I make myself clear?</p>
<p><strong>Randall Alessi, @Califbuckeye:</strong> Do you believe Rutherford will actually pull the trigger on a trade of Jarry instead of Murray if he finds that deal to be better?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Interesting question, Dr. Alessi. Can you imagine if Rutherford surprises us with a Jarry trade?</p>
<p>Listen, I wouldn’t be surprised if the offers are better for Jarry. There is the allure of the unknown with him. We haven’t seen enough to know if he’s going to be an elite goaltender. Maybe teams look at Murray and see a player who, while he has won two Cups, is more of a known commodity and not all that enticing of one, given what has transpired since Cup No. 2. Maybe they see him as Cam Ward with one more Cup (and maybe they believe Marc-Andre Fleury did the heavy lifting in Cup run No. 2 by stealing a series against the Washington Capitals).</p>
<p>But if you’re asking me — and clearly you are, this being a mailbag and all — if I believe Rutherford will trade Murray, even if it’s a lesser return, I would say yes. Jarry is cheaper, and Rutherford may very well believe Jarry will be better, both immediately and in the long run.</p>
<p><strong>Zack Henry, @zackoff39:</strong> Which Pittsburgh professional team will have success quicker after their primary star retires — the Steelers or Penguins?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> You’re talking about Ben and Sid and not Duck Hodges and Dominik Simon, I presume, Dr. Henry. The answer is the Steelers — depending on how one defines “success.” They almost made the playoffs without Ben last season. This is a young, talented defense that could have a team around .500 even if the quarterback situation falls apart.</p>
<p>The Penguins, on the other hand, will fall to the bottom of the league without Sid (and Geno). But that’s still several years away, if you ask me.</p>
<p>And who else are you asking, this being a mailbag and all.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Schnupp, @MatthewSchnupp:</strong> Do you think the Pirates will give Will Craig an actual chance to prove himself?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Dave Ryckman, @dryckman_13:</strong> With GMJR including a first rounder in Kapanen trade I’m inclined to believe he feels he can get a first in a deal for Murray. Do you see a team out there willing to part with their pick to land him? Quite a few teams need a No. 1 goalie. Need to hit home run with that move imo!</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’ll take a double, Dr. Ryckman. I’m not sure there are a ton of teams willing to part with something significant (such as a first-round pick) for Murray. Kevin Allen of USA Today recently told me he believes the Detroit Red Wings would be interested, but not at that price.</p>
<p>Might the Minnesota Wild and GM Bill Guerin be interested? I think that’s a distinct possibility. Carolina, Calgary or Edmonton might see Murray as a guy who could put them over the top in big games. All it takes is one. I’m just not convinced there is one — at least not at the price of a first-round pick.</p>
<p><strong>Heäth, @Metal_Heath:</strong> Question: Although it didn’t happen, what is with the Pirates entertaining trading Josh Bell? He’s a player to build around. Sounds like the old regime.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The Pirates need to be entertaining the idea of trading anyone and everyone, Dr. @Metal_Heath. They stink beyond words., and that won’t change anytime soon. I get your point on Bell. I, too, still believe he is a player to build around. I’m not going to let one month’s worth of at-bats tell me differently.</p>
<p>But you need to realize that his agent is Scott Boras and that the Pirates have never handed out a contract worth more than $60 million, which is incredible when you think about it. I <a href="/%20https:/www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2020/03/04/pittsburgh-pirates-biggest-contract-jason-kendall-josh-bell-jason-bay-francisco-liriano-joe-starkey/stories/202003040107" target="_blank">wrote about this phenomenon last year</a>, and I think you’ll enjoy it.</p>
<p>The Pirates control Bell for two more years, at which point he’ll be 30. The chance of them shelling out huge money to keep him beyond that age is next-to-none, Mr. Metal, and “next to” just put his running shoes on.</p>
<p>I would imagine the idea now, sadly, is to hope Bell reclaims his 2019 form and then trade him for the best package possible this offseason or by next year’s trade deadline.</p>
<p>If you ask me, he’ll be gone by midseason of 2021.</p>
<p>And who else are you asking, this being a mailbag and all.</p>
