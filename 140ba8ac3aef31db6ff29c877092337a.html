<h1>Mark Cuban on Pittsburgh's resolve, paying employees and when sports could return</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Mark Cuban is confident Pittsburgh will use its trademark blue-collar spirit to get through the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter what our politicians say, it doesn’t matter what our government does when it’s all said and done,” the Mt. Lebanon native told KDKA Radio’s Marty Griffin on Tuesday. “It matters what we do.</p>
<p>“That’s the cool thing about Pittsburgh. We bust our ass every minute of every day.”</p>

<p>Cuban, owner of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, is one of many high-powered folks across professional sports trying to navigate a reality where games aren’t being played and team employees largely aren’t able to work. The famously outspoken Cuban has been front and center throughout this crisis, declaring early on that hourly Mavericks employees <a href="https://www.cnn.com/videos/business/2020/03/18/mark-cuban-hourly-workers-nba-coronavirus-intv-cpt-vpx.cnn" target="_blank">would continue to be paid a salary</a> while the sports world stands still.</p>
<p>“I’ll keep on paying. I’m doing it for not just the Mavs, but for other companies as well,” Cuban told Griffin. “It’s just the right thing to do. But just as important, it’s to get people motivated to come up with ideas, to start new companies, to find ways ... to bring back employees.”</p>
<p>Just like every other sports fan, Cuban is eager for live sports to get up and running again. Of course, Cuban isn’t willing to compromise the health of his employees, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/ron-cook/2020/04/06/Ron-Cook-It-s-hard-to-stay-optimistic-about-sports-returning-soon/stories/202004060028" target="_blank">telling ESPN last week</a> that he won’t be OK with the NBA resuming play “until we can be absolutely certain everybody can be safe.”</p>
<p>Griffin asked Cuban what he thinks about President Donald Trump <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/04/04/Trump-meets-with-U-S-pro-sports-leaders-to-discuss-virus/stories/202004040050" target="_blank">reportedly telling pro sports commissioners</a> last weekend that he believes the NFL season will start on time Sept. 10.</p>
<p>“I hope it means we’re playing games,” Cuban said. “They may not be in front of fans, but they’ll be on television, simply because I think we need sports.”</p>
<p>Even if games are being played in empty stadiums and arenas, Cuban is confident sports-starved Pittsburghers will be grateful just to have their beloved sports back — including the Pirates.</p>
<p>“That first Steeler game, are you kidding me?” Cuban said. “Even the Pirates, you know as much ... grief [as] the Pirates get, they’re going to be heroes the minute they walk on the field again and play a game.”</p>
