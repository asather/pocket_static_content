<h1>Pirates spring training: Another tie, as Mitch Keller dazzles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PORT CHARLOTTE, Fla. — Mitch Keller was at least somewhat worried about his slider heading into Sunday’s game against the Tampa Bay Rays at Charlotte Sports Park, which ended in a 2-2 tie.</p>
<p>His catcher, Jacob Stallings, saw things a little differently.</p>
<p>“I was pleased with it,” Stallings said. “I think he’s a little more concerned with the slider than I am.”</p>
<p>Keller had very little to worry about after what he did against the Rays (9-5-4), pitching into the fourth inning and striking out five while allowing an earned run on three hits and a walk. The right-hander had control of his breaking staff, and his fastball had plenty of life.</p>
<p>“I thought I did really well,” Keller said. “Stuff was crisp. Everything felt really good coming out of my hand. Slider felt really good. Curveball, too. A few of them popped out of my hand a little bit, but I’m not too worried about that.”</p>
<p>Keller’s best moment might’ve come in the bottom of the third inning, when he struck out Rays second baseman Brandon Lowe looking on a 95 mph heater.</p>
<p>The only hit Keller allowed was a triple to third baseman Yandy Diaz, on a breaking ball that caught a little too much of the plate. Diaz simply took it the other way on a windy day. Keller left the game one batter into the fourth, when he issued his only walk.</p>
<p>“I thought he was better,” Pirates manager Derek Shelton said. “I thought his command was better. He got to his pitch count, and that’s why we took him out. I thought he threw the ball well today. That was a really positive step for him.”</p>
<p><strong>On the mound</strong></p>
<p>Couple of other performances that stood out …</p>
<p>• Despite a wild pitch, Luis Escobar did a solid job cleaning up Keller’s mess, getting a flyout, a strikeout and a grounder to third to end the inning.</p>
<p>• Nik Turley worked a scoreless sixth and struck out two. In 3 1/3 innings this spring, Turley has seven strikeouts.</p>
<p>“Really good,” Shelton said of Turley. “Really consistent pounding the zone. Stayed in his delivery. Yeah, that was a really positive sign to see him [Sunday].”</p>
<p>• Yacksel Rios and Montana DuRapau had identical lines to Turley: one inning; no hits, runs or walks allowed; with two strikeouts.</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Colin Moran had a pair of hits and drove in a run, bringing his spring RBI total to six. Only two Pirates have more — John Ryan Murphy with eight and Phillip Evans with seven. Neither ball was struck particularly hard, but Moran will also take the average boost.</p>
<p>Evans, who started at second base, crushed a double in the fourth inning. Had the wind not been blowing in, it almost assuredly would’ve netted his second home run of the spring. JT Riddle made some loud contact in the fifth, but it, too, got swallowed up by the wind.</p>
<p>“It wasn’t a great day to hit,” Stallings said.</p>
<p>Charlie Tilson tied the game with his double down the left-field line in the top of the ninth inning, which scored Jared Oliva. The Pirates (3-12-2) had a chance to win it in the ninth, but Jason Delay struck out swinging with the bases loaded.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The play of the day came from Guillermo Heredia in center field, the Pirates newcomer saving a run during an otherwise ugly inning.</p>
<p>Sam Howard walked two, and the Rays jumped ahead, 2-1, when Cole Tucker threw wide of first base on a double-play attempt.</p>
<p>After Howard hit right fielder Hunter Renfroe and Lowe struck out, Diaz singled to right-center field. Heredia fired a strike home to nail Renfroe, ending the inning.</p>
<p>“He charged it perfectly and made a perfect throw,” Stallings said. “Pretty impressive. Good first one.”</p>
