<h1>Supreme Court fight raises stakes, and risks, in Pa. battleground campaigns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As the battle ignited on Saturday for the U.S. Supreme Court vacancy left by the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, political campaigns and operatives in Pittsburgh and beyond raced to realign their messaging, raise money and turbocharge the polarizing debate over a once-in-a-generation ideological shift at the high court just 45 days before Election Day.</p>
<p>And in a crucial swing state that President Donald Trump won by a mere 40,000 votes in 2016, the new wrinkle in the 2020 race has dramatically raised the stakes — and, possibly, the pitfalls — for both parties in November.</p>
<p>Republicans argued the Senate, which their party controls, should act quickly to hold a vote on whoever is Mr. Trump’s nominee to replace the trailblazing progressive justice. Democrats are rushing to oppose such a move, promising to heap pressure on Republicans and portray the nomination fight as an existential threat to the country’s future.</p>
<p>In Pennsylvania, the sharp pivoting of mobilization efforts is fraught with potential traps, said Kiron Skinner, director of Carnegie Mellon University’s Institute for Politics and Strategy.</p>
<p>The Republican strategy risks a surge in turnout from angry Democratic and Independent voters, while Democrats now are forced to articulate their pick for the court — which could spark its own backlash — all while keeping the pressure on Mr. Trump for his failures during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Both parties have the ability to stumble and gain momentum, Ms. Skinner said, depending on Mr. Trump’s nominee and the names and issues the Democrats put forth in response.</p>
<p>For Democrats, “this could be a shot in the arm,” Ms. Skinner said. “If they list and discuss, in some depth, the issues that they care about that will find their way to the court, it could be something that galvanizes voters.”</p>
<p>Ms. Skinner — who served on Mr. Trump’s national security transition team in 2016 and as a senior adviser to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo — also said Mr. Trump could “deepen his base and expand his reach” to a broader base of voters.</p>
<p>“We just won’t know until they start floating names, until they test their arguments,” she said. “There’s no guaranteed outcome, but it means that more strategizing on both sides needs to happen right away.”</p>
<p>The organizing began Friday, minutes after the news spread across the country.</p>
<p>J.J. Abbott, executive director of Commonwealth Communications, a Harrisburg-based Democratic strategy firm, took to Twitter with a promise: “This is going to be one hell of a fight.”</p>
<p>Reached by phone Saturday, Mr. Abbott, a former spokesman for Gov. Tom Wolf, said he views the Supreme Court vacancy as a chance for Democrats to amplify the issues Justice Ginsburg stood for and avoid getting bogged down in procedural debates.</p>
<p>“Up and down the ticket, it does provide Democrats the opportunity to have really intentional and stark conversations with voters,” he said. “But they need to make clear what’s at stake and avoid only debating the process.”</p>
<p>“You can’t undervalue the significance of Ruth Bader Ginsburg to the Democratic electorate,” Mr. Abbott said. “We have to talk about the values and the issues that are at stake given what we’re facing right now.”</p>
<p>Planned Parenthood Pennsylvania Advocates — a representing three Planned Parenthood affiliates serving 90,000 patients annually — promised a “new urgency up and down the ballot.”</p>
<p>“We’re taking this fight to the legislature, the streets, and the ballot box,” said Emily Callen, executive director of the group, on Saturday. “This election the choice could not be clearer. If Trump rushes to fill this vacancy, he will answer for it in November.”</p>
<p>Friday’s statement from the women’s rights organization urged Congress to avoid “another divisive Supreme Court nomination fight like we had with Justice Kavanaugh” and instead focus on approving more economic relief for those struggling with the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“We vow to honor the legacy of Justice Ginsburg and approach the coming months like the future of our country depends on it — because it absolutely does,” the group wrote.</p>
<p>Keith Rothfus, a former Republican congressman, social conservative and pro-life supporter, said he doesn’t see the vacancy leading to a specific surge in motivation from voters in a politically charged atmosphere. But both sides will hope to message the importance of the Supreme Court to their base.</p>
<p>“If it changes anything, it just changes the issues that come to fore,” Mr. Rothfus said, listing abortion issues, gun control, religious freedom, and states rights as examples.&nbsp;“Any number of these issues that were 5-4, certainly people are going to be looking at.”</p>
<p>“This was an issue he [Trump] ran on in 2016, and there were a lot of people who voted for him specifically because of the Supreme Court,” Mr. Rothfus said.</p>
<p>The vacancy is likely to put more pressure on vulnerable Republican senators who face close re-election contests like Susan Collins of Maine, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Cory Gardner of Colorado.</p>
<p>One Democratic tack is to call out Senate Republicans who refused to support a vote on Merrick Garland, former President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace Justice Antonin Scalia after the conservative justice died in February 2016.</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., was among those senators who opposed Mr. Garland on the grounds that it should wait until after the election. (Mr. Toomey’s next election is scheduled for 2022.)</p>
<p>Progressive groups, including Mr. Abbott’s firm, widely shared Mr. Toomey’s statement from March 2016 that urged the Senate to “give the American people a more direct voice in the selection and confirmation of the next justice” with “the presidential election fewer than eight months away.”</p>
<p>In a statement released Saturday, Mr. Toomey did not comment on whether he supported Mr. McConnell’s push to hold a vote for a justice. He praised Ms. Ginsburg as a “trailblazer” who “proved time and again that it is possible to disagree with someone without being disagreeable.”</p>
<p>“Simply put, Justice Ginsburg left an indelible mark that will resonate for generations,” Mr. Toomey stated. A spokesman said there would be no further comment Saturday.</p>
<p><strong>Staying silent</strong></p>
<p>Other Republicans also stayed silent on the Supreme Court issue Saturday.</p>
<p>At a conservative gathering in Washington County, Sean Parnell, the Republican who is challenging Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon, did not mention the vacancy. Mr. Parnell on Friday retweeted a Trump campaign video of the president’s praise of Justice Ginsburg and retweeted an article that highlighting the precedent for presidents nominating Supreme Court justices in election years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, who on Friday tweeted “thoughts and prayers” to Justice Ginsburg’s family, focused his talk on criminal justice reform and did not refer to the vacancy.</p>
<p>Perhaps the only mention came as a brief aside from Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, during a speech praising a recent district judge nominated by Mr. Trump and approved by the Senate in July 2019.</p>
<p>“President Trump has picked obviously two — I mean, almost three — Supreme Court justices and hundreds of judges,” Mr. Schlapp said, part of a speech in honor of U.S. District Judge William S. Stickman IV.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Judge Stickman ruled last week that the non-life-sustaining business closures, restrictions on outdoor gatherings and stay-at-home orders mandated by Gov. Tom Wolf and Secretary of Health Rachel Levine to mitigate COVID-19 are unconstitutional.</p>
