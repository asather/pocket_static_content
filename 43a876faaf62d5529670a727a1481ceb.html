<h1>Pirates spring training: Joe Musgrove pleased with effort in final game for a while</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt;">BRADENTON, Fla. — It wasn’t exactly an afternoon where baseball seemed relevant, but don’t bother explaining that to Joe Musgrove.</span></p>
<p>The Pirates starter, trying to prepare for a season that will now start at least two weeks late because of the coronavirus/COVID-19 outbreak, put in some solid work Thursday during a 7-5 loss to the Blue Jays at LECOM Park.</p>
<p>Musgrove’s line was only so-so — three earned runs on nine hits with four strikeouts in 4 1/3 innings, as the Pirates fell to 3-15-2 — but the right-hander was more encouraged by how everything felt than the results.</p>
<p>“Stuff-wise, I thought it was the best that I’ve felt all spring,” Musgrove said.</p>
<p>That was most noticeable with Musgrove’s breaking stuff, as he was able to get ahead in counts with his curveball and slider. That’s important because it shows a better command and more functional usage of the pitch, instead of bouncing in the dirt and hoping hitters simply swing and miss.</p>
<p>Geoff Hartlieb and Yacksel Rios scuffled out of the bullpen, recording just five outs, allowing four runs and walking four.</p>
<p>Sam Howard, competing for job, pitched a scoreless seventh and looked solid doing it.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next</strong></p>
<p>With spring training suspended, and likely over, Musgrove and others face an interesting dilemma: The next step for them would be throwing around six innings or 100 pitches, but what if this delay stretches on?</p>
<p>Do they throw just 2-3 innings to stay sharp, or do they simply morph into regular season mode, hoping to sustain that for longer this season?</p>
<p>“When we hear more from the league, it’ll be easier to know what to do,” Musgrove said, as the players are waiting to learn more details about what will happen in the weeks ahead.</p>
<p>Musgrove also said pitchers would likely circle back with pitching coach Oscar Marin on things maybe they didn’t get time to work on during spring training. Manager Derek Shelton, meanwhile, said the Pirates must be mindful of not overworking anyone so early in the season.</p>
<p>“We would probably have to work back from two weeks [into the regular season] to see where we’re at,” Shelton said. “We’ll have to monitor the volume, where they’re going from there in terms of are those [missed] games being made up or are they not? With all the unknowns of that, we have to make sure that we’re mindful of innings.”</p>
<p><strong>At the plate</strong></p>
<p>Bryan Reynolds, Adam Frazier and Gregory Polanco had two hits apiece, with Reynolds absolutely crushing a solo home run to open the bottom of the third inning. Reynolds scored twice. Frazier’s first hit was a double, and he also stole a base.</p>
<p>“It felt good,” Reynolds said of his home run. “I got all of it. I was pleased with it.”</p>
<p>Shelton agreed. Although Reynolds is definitely quiet, sometimes he seems to do some really loud things on the field.</p>
<p>“He does things every day that kind of surprise you because he doesn’t really talk very much,” Shelton said of Reynolds. “When you see things like that, I think you see what people about why he’s such a good player.”</p>
<p>Cole Tucker homered inside the right-field foul pole in the bottom of the eighth inning. His third of the spring tied John Ryan Murphy for the team lead. Polanco has reached base safely in eight of nine preseason games, hitting safely in six of the past seven.</p>
<p><strong>In the field</strong></p>
<p>The fourth inning was an interesting one for Musgrove. Blue Jays third baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. led off with a solo home run — one of two for Toronto — before first baseman Travis Shaw and catcher Reese McGuire reached with singles.</p>
<p>That’s when Musgrove was able to get second baseman Joe Panik to hit a ground ball to second base, which Frazier and Kevin Newman converted into a double play.</p>
<p>After left fielder Forrest Wall singled in a run, Luke Maile made a strong throw to nail Wall at second base, ending the inning. Maile has now thrown out all four runners who’ve tried to steal against him this spring.</p>
<p>“I thought I did a good job pitching out of jams,” Musgrove said. “A little bit of everything [Thursday].”</p>
