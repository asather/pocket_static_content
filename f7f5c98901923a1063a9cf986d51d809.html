<h1>Carnegie Mellon University cancels commencement</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University President Farnam Jahanian has announced to the senior class that spring commencement exercises have been canceled.</p>
<p>“I am writing with deep regret to let you know that we will not be able to hold this year’s commencement exercises on the Pittsburgh campus on May 17 as planned,” he stated in the announcement.&nbsp;“To our graduating students, this decision – like so many of the past few weeks – ranks among the hardest I have had to make as president.”</p>
<p>Mr. Jahanian said university officials came to the decision “to protect the health and well-being of our entire community and to comply with guidance by the CDC to avoid large gatherings.”</p>
<p>“We also are making this call now to provide this year’s graduates and their families with as much time as possible to plan accordingly,” he said.</p>
<p>Recently, a CMU student tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>In his announcement, Mr. Jahanian praised the energy and achievements of senior class members while noting that they “have sacrificed several cherished CMU traditions” during their final semester.</p>
<p>“[And] it pains me to add one more. We already miss the unmistakable energy that fills every corner of this campus when you are here, and we share in your sadness at this moment as well.”</p>
<p>He also said plans are underway to pay tribute to student success.</p>
<p>“We will virtually confer degrees at the end of the semester, and we are exploring ways we can celebrate the Class of 2020’s outstanding achievements together on campus in the next academic year,” his announcement said. “We are also looking into other creative ways to connect with this cohort of graduates, whether in Pittsburgh or in other areas around the world. We will share details about these programs with students and families as they are confirmed.</p>
<p>One’s life returns to normal, he said in a final comment, the university “will look forward to welcoming returning students back to campus again.”</p>
<p>“For those of you who will graduate this May, we look forward to welcoming you back as alumni,” he said. “In the meantime, keep your spirits up, continue to support and look out for one another, and take pride in being part of the CMU family.”</p>
