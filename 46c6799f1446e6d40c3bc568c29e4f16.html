<h1>Pirates takeaways: Lucas Giolito accomplished something that may never happen again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>CHICAGO — On Tuesday night, Lucas Giolito did something that may not happen again.</p>
<p>He stepped onto the mound to start against the Pirates at Guaranteed Rate Field, threw 74 strikes on 101 pitches, struck out 13 batters and did not allow a hit all game.</p>
<p>Commendable as that is on its own, what’s unique is that the no-hitter happened in 2020. So there were no fans in the stadium to witness it.</p>
<p>“They turned up the [automated] crowd noise. I noticed that,” Giolito said. “The crowd noise was getting louder and louder as the game went on. That was fun. At the end of the day, it would have been great to pull that off with fans in the stands and be able to kind of look out there after it was all done and see how excited they were.</p>
<p>“I’m sure a lot of White Sox fans were excited from their homes watching it on TV.”</p>
<p>Giolito, donning a red, Michael Jordan, Chicago Bulls jersey after the game, thought back to just two short years ago. In 2018 with the White Sox, Giolito was flat-out bad. He allowed the most earned runs and walks of anybody in the league.</p>
<p>Of course, he was just 23 years old back then. On a terrible White Sox team that lost 100 games, he still got his chances.</p>
<p>Now, the 25-year-old who made the All-Star game last season can speak with some hindsight.</p>
<p>“It’s crazy, man. The weird thing is that I always envisioned that I’d throw a no-hitter in the big leagues,” Giolito said. “If you had asked me about it in ’18, I probably would have been like, ‘What the hell are you talking about?’ But that was a weird year.</p>
<p>“... I think that getting my ass kicked over and over again, kind of looking at my year, I was pretty much bottom of the league when it comes to every stat, almost. … I kind of had to get my ass kicked, kind of had to learn from failure and go and make the changes I needed to make to be able to realize my true potential.”</p>
<p>Giolito’s manager, Rick Renteria, believed in him back then. There’s a story from 2018, when Renteria and Giolito were in an elevator together in Cleveland. As it goes, Renteria told Giolito point blank that he would be an All-Star some day.</p>
<p>As it’s turned out, he was.</p>
<p>That’s all well and good. On Tuesday, Giolito took another step forward and into the history books.</p>
<p>“I just told him I was extremely happy for him, and I think everybody was,” Renteria said. “… You see how much he’s worked and the path that these guys are taking, and he’s one of the guys that’s done so much in terms of turning themselves around, from when you first start seeing him with us. I can’t. I don’t have any words. I want to cry. I’m really, really happy for him.”</p>
<p>A no-hitter, it seems, is never complete without the highlight defensive plays to save them.</p>
<p>In the top of the seventh, Pirates left fielder Bryan Reynolds dribbled a ground ball up the middle, and shortstop Tim Anderson ranged over to make a great, bang-bang play with a throw to first.</p>
<p>On the last out, Pirates shortstop Erik Gonzalez ripped a line drive into right field. The White Sox had it perfectly scouted. Right fielder Adam Engel sprinted in, leaned to his left, reached out and snagged the final out of the game.</p>
<p>As soon as Engel caught it, the scene unfolded almost like these were normal circumstances. Catcher James McCann walked out to the mound, and Giolito embraced him. Teammates streamed out of the dugout to join in.</p>
<p>Perhaps players were more tentative to dog pile than they would have been without social distancing on the mind.</p>
<p>There could be another no-hitter this season. The frequency with which they happen says otherwise. Whatever transpires in the games to come, this one was surreal. In front of zero fans, Giolito made history.</p>
<p>After the dust had settled, about 90 minutes post-final-out, Giolito went back onto the diamond for a TV interview. When he was finished, he went back out to the mound and snapped a few pictures.</p>
<p>As he departed, he got a small round of applause from the White Sox’s PR staff down the right field line. It was the most boisterous response he got from people in the crowd all night.</p>
<p><strong>Tropeano shows promise</strong></p>
<p>Whatever Nick Tropeano had done Tuesday would have been lost to history. Rightfully so, with what Giolito achieved.</p>
<p>Still, for the Pirates’ sake, the most encouraging part of Tuesday night was the right-hander’s efforts. After being claimed off waivers from the New York Yankees earlier this season, Tropeano made his debut against the White Sox.</p>
<p>Before he even entered the game, it got off to a rocky start. As he was warming up in the bullpen, Tropeano was receiving a throw back from his catcher when a foul ball was hit down the right field line. It bounced off an awning, into the bullpen and nearly drilled Tropeano in the face.</p>
<p>From there, it was smooth sailing. Tropeano went four scoreless innings, allowing three hits and no runs with four strikeouts along the way.</p>
<p>“Give him a ton of credit,” manager Derek Shelton said. “I mean, he hasn’t thrown a ton. To go out and give us four innings of length and to keep a really good offense off-balance. Really good pitch mix, and definitely went right at them and attacked them, and I think we saw it.”</p>
<p>What’s more is that the Pirates needed it Tuesday. Starter Steven Brault went just three innings himself, as he struggled to consistently find the strike zone.</p>
<p>So Tropeano stepped in to ease any burden there would have been on a strained bullpen.</p>
<p>“It was good,” Tropeano said. “I mean, Braulty went a little short. I’m here to pick up the team in any way. They wanted me to go a little long today. I felt pretty good. I was just trying to get ahead of all the hitters, with first-pitch strikes, using all my pitches and try to put them away when I can.”</p>
