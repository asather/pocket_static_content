<h1>Jason Mackey’s Life at Home: Searching for ‘social currency’</h1>

<p>It turns out that they get it, too. Just a slightly different version.</p>
<p>“How do you write about sports when there are no games?”</p>
<p>Even typing that sentence makes my skin crawl, and I’m hardly alone. Two of my good friends, Colin Dunlap and Andrew Fillipponi from 93.7 The Fan, have experienced the same thing.</p>
<p>Before I answer the question, I’d like to explain my reasoning for contacting these two this week — and it has nothing to do with our friendship.</p>
<p>They’re incredibly good at what they do because of their talent, sure, but also how seriously they take the job, their creative minds and also an innate ability to sense what makes good conversation.</p>
<p>It’s similar on this side when it comes to writers with strong news sense, a nose for detail or the ability to pull a story idea out of left field and execute it.</p>
<p>I’m extremely proud of how well my colleagues here do those things, but I chose the radio guys because that side tends to be extremely reactive — some might say too reactive.</p>
<p>So, what do you talk about when there’s nothing to react to?</p>
<p>Plenty, obviously, as these guys explained. Their shows have hardly lacked during this time; they’ve flourished. And as they told me, they’ve learned a lot throughout the entire process.</p>
<p>“It’s forced me to take topics and really expand on them and dive a few layers deeper than I ever had before,” Dunlap said. “You can’t get away with just doing something surface-level.”</p>
<p>Fillipponi echoed that sentiment and steered the conversation down another path.</p>
<p>“During Steelers season, when they lose a game on Sunday, people are angry about it, and you get a reaction, it’s like, ‘OK, you should be getting one,’ ” he said. “But when you feel like you’re able to get people interested and invested in what you’re talking about now, I feel unbelievably better about myself.”</p>
<p>I can relate to what Fillipponi is saying here.</p>
<p>For as proud as I am of writing stories after having visited Sidney Crosby or Matt Murray, of covering a Stanley Cup run or any number of bigger features I’ve done, there have also been the slogs, the stories where maybe I wasn’t feeling it, didn’t have a ton of material or otherwise had to give readers something interesting without my best stuff.</p>
<p>That’s sort of how I feel about these past few months, whether that’s been tracking down Derek Bell, doing a retrospective on the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/04/09/pittsburgh-pirates-mlb-1995-strike-coronavirus-season-postponed-canceled/stories/202004090031" target="_blank">1995 baseball season</a>, chatting about life with Doc Emrick, learning about <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/12/dock-ellis-LSD-no-hitter-50-years-later-pirates/stories/202006090084" target="_blank">Dock Ellis’ legacy</a> or writing about Jameson Taillon’s brother, who’s a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/05/jameson-taillon-brother-jordan-doctor-covid-19-pandemic/stories/202006050092" target="_blank">pulmonary and critical care doctor</a> and has been working crazy hours during the COVID-19 crisis.</p>
<p>You tap into your creativity, get a little weird and figure out a way to write about sports without anything being tied to a game. And I’m hardly alone at our paper.</p>
<p>Brian Batko did that with features on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/08/derek-watt-tj-steelers-brothers-teammates-family-jj-pittsburgh/stories/202005010138" target="_blank">the Watt family</a> and JuJu Smith-Schuster’s <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/22/juju-smith-schuster-2020-corey-calliet-trainer-offseason-workout-steelers/stories/202005180094" target="_blank">workouts</a>; Matt Vensel revisisted the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/02/sidney-crosby-2005-nhl-draft-lottery-penguins-15-years-later/stories/202004050011" target="_blank">Sidney Crosby draft</a> and turned a detailed piece on quarantined players <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/22/pittsburgh-penguins-jack-johnson-nick-bjugstad-kris-letang-patrick-marleau-coronavirus/stories/202004220008" target="_blank">thrust into dad duty</a>; Mike DeFabo wrote about a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/04/10/NCAA-frozen-four-brandon-tanev-providence-boston-university-2015/stories/202004100114" target="_blank">Frozen Four game</a> from five years ago; and Mike Persak gave us a terrific look at the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/06/01/pirates-freak-show-jason-kendall-kevin-young-dale-sveum-gene-lamont-1997/stories/202005270129" target="_blank">“Freak Show” Pirates</a> of 1997.</p>
<p>It absolutely can be done.</p>
<p>“Just because there are no games, there are still 30,000-foot questions about sports,” Dunlap said. “Stuff that we didn’t really have time to do in other times, wide-ranging topics, stuff like what’s going on now with the racial divide in sports and also things that are fun and light-hearted.”</p>
<p>The light-hearted has been a big key, in my opinion. And not necessarily coming off as goofballs — both for writers and talkers — but showing a little personality, being relatable and not taking yourself too seriously.</p>
<p>Now has been a time to do things differently, to circle back to that dusty book on the corner of the shelf, to make a bunch of phone calls and see if something will crystallize.</p>
<p>On The Fan, Dunlap, co-host Chris Mack, producer Matt Koll and utility man Jim Colony have gotten mileage out of home-schooling and the fact that nobody drives more than 50 miles a month. They’ve even drafted Memorial Day picnic foods (love the strawberry pretzel salad pick) and things in Pittsburgh that aren’t here anymore (Club Zoo, Cool Springs’ batting cages and the Log Jammer were oversights).</p>
<p>With Fillipponi, PM Team co-host Chris Mueller and producer Kraig Riley, we’ve batted around chicken wings (flavors and boneless vs. traditional) and parenting — topics that offer levity and hopefully solicit some sort of reaction from people listening.</p>
<p>“We don’t need to get into screaming matches and debate each other like crazy,” Fillipponi said. “That’s probably not the right temperament to have right now.”</p>
<p>These past few months should have opened our eyes to all sorts of things, not the least of which include washing our hands more and appreciating the tiniest luxuries in life, but I also think they’ve been instructive from a professional standpoint.</p>
<p>Whether you’re writing or talking about sports for a living, it shouldn’t be about the result of the game the night or day before. It should be about a story and establishing a connection with whomever consumes our product.</p>
<p>“They’re coming to you because they want your personality in there,” Fillipponi said. “They’re not coming to you because they want your reaction to the Pirates losing to the Brewers.</p>
<p>“They’re stopping at our restaurant because they like the people. They like the cooks and the wait staff; it’s not so much that we have the best apple pie in Pittsburgh. Right now, people are drawn to the personalities and the hosts more than they are the content.”</p>
<p>But you also can’t diminish the content.</p>
<p>For Dunlap, that has been an even bigger challenge because people haven’t been driving to and from work. Fillipponi has had less breaking news to react to later in the day.</p>
<p>Both guys described their creative process to me, how it comes from everyday life and observing conversations, with Dunlap comparing it to figuring out what would generate discussion in a corner bar.</p>
<p>It’s also not always about what you want to talk about. Even more important now is what the audience wants to hear.</p>
<p>On the written side, I think we’ve mutated well by telling stories and delivering longer-form pieces that tackle a topic from a unique angle. That’s something I think we absolutely have to carry out of the pandemic.</p>
<p>“I think people come to us for social currency,” Dunlap said. “They wanna hear something on the radio and carry it with them and talk about it with their friends later. That’s been my goal, for them to keep that social currency.”</p>
