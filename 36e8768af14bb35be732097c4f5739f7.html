<h1>Over 30 local therapists are providing free teletherapy sessions for those on the frontline of COVID-19 </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>More than 30 therapists — and counting — from the Pittsburgh area are coming together virtually to provide free teletherapy sessions for workers on the front lines of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Those eligible include workers for life-sustaining businesses such as doctors, nurses, paramedics, janitors, grocery workers, police officers, firefighters and waste management workers.</p>
<p>Clinical psychologist William Hasek and other therapists created a Google document sheet filled with contact information of therapists who want to provide free therapy sessions — and the list is growing. Those who are interested may call or email any of the numbers and set up an appointment with a therapist.</p>

<p>In the months ahead, Mr. Hasek said he believes there will be a rise in people seeking mental health treatment. As many people know of someone or have been affected themselves by the virus, he said there will be a rise in post-traumatic stress treatment. By providing one to four free telehealth therapy sessions for those on the front lines, Mr. Hasek said he hopes he can provide supportive therapy by quickly strengthening coping skills.</p>
<p>Through his direct experience working with paramedics, doctors and grocery store workers, Mr. Hasek has noticed similar patterns of concern.</p>
<p>One of the biggest is the fear of catching the virus and possibly giving it to family members, Mr. Hasek said. Because the virus is fairly new and not well understood, he said he has noticed a level of stress with the uncertainty of what the virus may bring and how long it may last.</p>
<p>Particularly, what he sees among his clients who work in grocery stores and other essential businesses is the stress of putting their lives at risk while still being paid a lower living wage. He also has noticed an increased amount of bigotry against his Asian American clients, which adds more stress to their lives.</p>
<p>“If we can organize people that will provide some therapy and give them some support during this time, it could be one of the best things that I could do,” Mr. Hasek said.</p>
<p>As a veteran Navy SEAL who has worked on the ground in Haiti and Japan for disaster relief and later as a policy planner for the Department of Defense during the Ebola crisis in 2014, Eric Golnick can understand the overwhelming feeling many first responders are facing while fighting the pandemic.</p>
<p>“When I got out of active duty, I didn’t think I had any issues whatsoever,” Mr. Golnick said. “With all these crises happening, you get into a battle rhythm, you’re used to it every day, you wake up, you do your job, you try to compartmentalize the bad stuff and you keep moving.”</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="blank"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Years went by after leaving active duty during which his mental health went unchecked; as a result, he participated in destructive behaviors, such as substance abuse. When he received help, he was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress.</p>
<p>Mr. Golnick, who is the co-founder and CEO of Veteran and First Responder Healthcare, a service with an office in Greensburg that provides trauma-informed therapy to veterans and first responders, said he is waiving all co-pay fees for first responders seeking teletherapy.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. Golnick said he has noticed a rise in first responders calling with more urgency for immediate mental health help.</p>
<p>“There’s nobody to come bail you out in this. You are the front line. And I think people, when they realize that, it can get a little bit too much,” Mr. Golnick said.</p>
<p>Mr. Hasek said he shared his idea with a group of local therapists on Facebook — where people almost immediately pitched in to help.</p>
<p>“I was just shocked,” Mr. Hasek said. “I think people are eager to help and want to do everything they can. If we’re helping the front-line workers do their job, that’s going to help everyone in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Thomas Lindquist and his partner, Kristin Lindquist, a licensed psychologist and licensed counselor, respectively, both decided to provide free teletherapy sessions.</p>
<p>Because teletherapy can be accessed through phone, tablet or laptop, Mr. Lindquist said the flexible accessibility provides a benefit for many.</p>
<p>“People don’t have to travel anymore to go to a session,” Mr. Lindquist said. “They can be at work and shut the doors in their office and start their session. They can even schedule a session after work at night, if necessary.”</p>
<p>Mr. Golnick agrees. “Telemedicine is the way to do this,” he said. “Just from the crisis intervention piece, it’s going to change the way we deliver mental health treatment.”</p>
<p>Working at home can provide some challenges in finding a quiet place to talk. However, Mr. Lindquist said some of his clients have sat in their cars to talk or asked their partner to watch the kids in a different room while they’re in session.</p>
<p>Since announcing the free therapy initiative, Mr. Hasek said he hasn’t received as many calls as predicted.</p>
<p>“I think sometimes people get this feeling of, ‘Oh I don’t want to use it because someone else might need it more than me,’ and I would definitely tell people to just call. We’ll make sure the people who need help are getting it,” Mr. Hasek said.</p>
