<h1>'I can't imagine.' Vigil planned for 10-year-old boy who fell into Ohio River </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A vigil honoring the life of a 10-year-old boy who fell into the Ohio River in Beaver County earlier this week is set to take place Thursday evening.</p>
<p>Several policemen, firefighters and river rescue teams searched for nearly five hours Wednesday before finding the boy’s body.</p>
<p>The Beaver County coroner identified the child as Thomas Jett; his death was ruled accidental.</p>
<p>A social-distancing vigil is scheduled to take place around 6 p.m. at the corner of 11th and Merchant streets (behind the police station) in Ambridge, according to Megan Clark, community member and organizer of the gathering. She is not related to the boy or his family.</p>
<p>“My boys went to school with him, and he used to give me hugs every time I saw him at school, so I just felt like I needed to do something for him,” Ms. Clark said. “Our community isn’t super small, but we need to stick together.</p>
<p>“I’m a mother myself, and if this would have happened to me I would have been devastated. I can’t imagine what the family is going through.”</p>
<p>The child was found around 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, Ambridge police Lt. Brian Jameson said.&nbsp;A state police cadaver dog working from a boat picked up the child’s scent about 80 to 100 feet off shore in water that was 18 feet deep, he said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>State Police out of Philadelphia, where the agency’s marine operations are stationed, utilized equipment to locate the body near the Ambridge Sewage Treatment Plant. The Ambridge police department, Harmony police, dive teams from Beaver Falls, Butler and Murrysville, and Pittsburgh’s river rescue were among those&nbsp;who participated in the search.</p>
<p>The boy, along with two of his brothers and two other children, left home Monday afternoon to play along the Ohio River, Lt. Jameson said, adding that the mother was unaware the children left and was in the home watching several younger children. The boy’s father was at work, Lt. Jameson said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The boy fell into the water as he was trying to retrieve his shoe, Lt. Jameson said.&nbsp;The river bottom where the boy fell in is rocky and sandy and gradually gets deeper the further out one goes, he added.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The parents weren’t aware they had gone down to the river,” he said. “When the kids realized he was in trouble, they jumped in the water and swam out there to try and save him. His brother got a hold of him but lost his grip so the boy went under.”&nbsp;</p>
