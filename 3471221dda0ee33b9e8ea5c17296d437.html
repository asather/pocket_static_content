<h1>TV Q&amp;A: Does a WPXI reporter have a sibling on another Pittsburgh channel?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Post-Gazette TV writer Rob Owen answers reader questions online every Friday in Tuned In Journal blog at<a href="http://communityvoices.post-gazette.com/arts-entertainment-living/tuned-in" target="_blank"> post-gazette.com/tv</a>. Here’s a selection of recent queries.</em></p>
<p><strong>Q: The sister of Jennifer Tomazic, of Channel 11, was a staff announcer on another Pittsburgh channel. I don't recall her name, but she is no longer seen. What happened to her?</strong></p>
<p><strong>-DICK, BETHEL PARK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob</strong>: Tomazic confirmed she doesn’t have a sister, let alone one who works in local TV news. Perhaps Dick is thinking of Kelly and Courtney Brennan.</p>
<p>Kelly Brennan left WTAE in 2017 after the birth of her second child. Her sister, Courtney, departed WPXI in May 2019.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why do the local meteorologists feel they have to tell us when it is raining to use your umbrella or to bundle your kids up when it is cold outside? Most people have common sense and know to use an umbrella when it’s raining and to bundle up when it is cold outside.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-ROBERT, BELLEVUE</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> I think I would chalk such talk up to colloquial speech more than I would see it as an actual reminder or admonishment.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What happened to Missy Peregrym who played Maggie on “FBI”? She was a main character.</strong></p>
<p><strong>-MARY LOU VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> The actress went on maternity leave and will return to “FBI” once her maternity leave is done.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why would FX have an original series — “Mrs. America” — broadcast exclusively on Hulu? Why not just on regular FX?</strong></p>
<p><strong>I have Hulu now and looking forward to watching it but just wondered. Has this ever been done before?</strong></p>
<p><strong>-KITTY VIA EMAIL</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rob:</strong> I’ve written about<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/01/09/Tuned-In-Original-stars-join-Saved-by-the-Bell-thirtysomething-sequel-series/stories/202001090153" target="_blank"> FX on Hulu previously in January </a>&nbsp;and again when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/2020/02/27/Tuned-In-AMC-Dispatches-From-Elsewhere-Jason-Segel-Eve-Lindley-trans-love-story-Sally-Field-Andre-Benjamin-Devs-FX-on-Hulu-Alex-Garland/stories/202002270041" target="_blank">its first original series debuted in March, “Devs”</a>.</p>
<p>The industry sees the future in streaming and every established brand is trying to stake out its territory there. Execs know that as people cut the cord on cable, they are picking up streaming services so they’re trying to come up with reasons — original programming — for consumers to subscribe to their streamer.</p>
<p>Both “Devs” and “Mrs. America” were developed and intended for linear FX before FX became part of Disney, FX Now got shuttered and the decision was made to create an FX home on Disney-owned Hulu.</p>
<p>When FX announced “Devs” and “Mrs. America” would move to its streaming service, I wondered if it’s because FX execs viewed the projects as too niche for linear FX. Having seen both, I do think that’s why “Devs” got moved but not “Mrs. America.” Moving “Mrs. America,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/tv-radio/2020/04/09/Downton-Abbey-Belgravia-Killing-Eve-Mrs-America-The-Good-Fight-Roger-Stone-Paul-Manafort/stories/202004090035" target="_blank">which is such a great series</a>, is an attempt at a prestige play. FX execs probably have a good sense that “Mrs. America” will get critical acclaim and positive word of mouth, which they hope will encourage more consumers to subscribe to Hulu so they can see the show. (I do think it’s possible FX on Hulu shows may someday play on linear FX.)</p>
