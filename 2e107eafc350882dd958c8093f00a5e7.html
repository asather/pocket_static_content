<html><head><title>Streamlining plan </title></head><body><p>Pittsburgh City Council’s move to streamline the process for hiring professionals for design and construction projects may improve efficiency, but it lacks transparency and oversight.</p><p>It’s not good government.</p><p>Previously, city departments had to issue requests for proposals or qualifications if paying professional contractors $30,000 or more. The department could choose someone other than the low bidder, but council had to approve the choice.</p><p>Under the plan approved in December, about 70 firms would be prequalified to bid on some 34 categories of work. The firms would not have to go through a full-blown request-for-proposal process to bid on projects, and city departments could accept a bid without having to get council approval. Those contracts could be for as much as $750,000; small firms would be capped at $750,000 a year, while large firms could get as much as $2.5 million.</p><p>That’s a lot of money that will bypass the usual request-for-proposal process and a vote by city council.</p><p>When first proposed, Pittsburgh Controller Michael Lamb said the change, though legal and possibly more efficient, could also “open up the potential for favoritism.”</p><p>The intent is to allow qualified firms, particularly smaller ones, the chance to compete for projects they might normally skip because they don’t have the time or resources to put together the usual proposals.</p><p>Requests for proposal already provided city government flexibility in hiring professionals. Council was not obligated to select the low bidder, but could consider other factors such as quality of service. Conversely, contracts for commodities or highly standardized services such as paving require competitive bidding under state law.</p><p>Opening the process to more competition and cutting away at government bureaucracy are laudable goals, but not at the expense of transparency in how tax dollars are spent. This change unwisely removes council oversight.</p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/opinion/editorials/2020/01/04/Streamlining-plan/stories/201912190062</original_url>
