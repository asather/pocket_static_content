<h1>Erie's William Jeffress becomes Pitt basketball's highest-rated recruit since 2012</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Though not exactly a hotbed for basketball talent, Western Pennsylvania has produced a handful of top-100 recruits over the past several years.&nbsp;But each of those sought-after prospects the region produced — from Robby Carmody (Notre Dame) to Oscar Tshiebwe (West Virginia) to Ethan Morton (Purdue) — opted to play somewhere other than Pitt.</p>
<p>That string of missed opportunities and lingering hypotheticals has, for now, come to an end as&nbsp;William Jeffress, a standout from Erie ranked by both of the major recruiting services as a top-75 prospect, announced his commitment to Pitt on Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 6-foot-7 forward, Jeffress is rated by 247 Sports’ composite ranking as the No. 58 prospect nationally in the class of 2020, making him the Panthers’ most heralded commitment since Steven Adams in 2012. Jeffress is ranked 75th in the country by Rivals. With his pledge, Pitt now has the No. 13 2020 class among Division I programs, according to 247, which would be tied for its best haul since 2007.</p>
<p>Jeffress selected the Panthers from a group of 10 finalists that also featured Baylor, Penn State, Stanford, Virginia, Memphis, Villanova, Vanderbilt, Notre Dame and Northwestern.</p>
<p>It stands as a massive recruiting victory for Pitt coach Jeff Capel, who has prioritized Jeffress from virtually the moment the former Duke assistant arrived in Oakland in 2018. Jeffress becomes the fifth top-150 recruit and third top-100 recruit he has landed in his 25 months at Pitt. In the four classes preceding Capel’s hiring, the Panthers had just two top-150 recruits and no top-100 recruits.</p>
<p>“I want to go to a team where we can strive together to reach the next level, to a place that intrigues me with its pursuit of excellence,” Jeffress said in a video announcing his commitment. “Even more, I want to be coached by someone who will challenge me as a dream-chaser, feed my hunger as a scholar and an athlete, and develop me as a leader. Most importantly, I want to go to a place where I can see myself grow as a young man. That place is the University of Pittsburgh. That coach is Jeff Capel. My heart now beats for the City of Champions.”</p>
<p>At McDowell High School, Jeffress emerged as one of the most accomplished, nationally relevant players ever from the Erie area. Despite graduating one year early, he’s the school’s all-time leading scorer with 1,673 career points and averaged 24.4 points per game as a junior. Last season, he led McDowell to a 23-3 record and a berth in the PIAA quarterfinals for the first time in 20 years. He has international experience, as well, having been a part of Team USA’s gold-medal-winning effort at the FIBA Americas U16 Championship.</p>
<p>The immediate impact he’ll be able to make, even for a player with the honors and recognition he has received, is unclear. Jeffress is young for a 2020 recruit, having reclassified from the 2021 class, and will not turn 17 until June. At 6-7 and shy of 200 pounds, he’s relatively slender, leading to questions about how well he’ll handle the physical toll of a full college season.</p>
<p>Jeffress becomes the fifth member of Pitt’s 2020 class, one that already included a top-100 prospect in center John Hugley, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/04/02/pitt-panthers-basketball-recruiting-john-hugley-jeff-capel-chet-mason-ohio-brush-high-school/stories/202003270032" target="_blank">the No. 84 player in the class</a>.</p>
<p>He’ll provide the Panthers with yet another rangy and versatile wing, joining rising junior Au’Diese Toney, rising sophomores Justin Champagnie and Gerald Drumgoole, and soon-to-be freshmen Noah Collier and Femi Odukale as players who are between 6-5 and 6-8 and who can shuffle between multiple positions. His addition should theoretically also provide another offensive weapon for a team that has struggled mightily to score in each of the past three seasons, never finishing higher than 154th of 353 Division I teams in adjusted offensive efficiency in that time.</p>
<p>With Jeffress’ commitment, Capel still has one scholarship with which to work. The Panthers made the final six for Adama Sanogo, a 6-foot-9 center who might reclassify to the 2020 class, but if they don’t land him, it’s entirely possible they head into the 2020-21 season (should it happen as planned) with an unused scholarship, which would mark the third time in the past four seasons that has been the case.</p>
