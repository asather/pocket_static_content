<p>ST. LOUIS — Derek Holland was ejected from a game before he made his first start in a Pirates uniform.</p>
<p>Sunday afternoon in St. Louis, as the Pirates became upset with Jordan Baker’s strike zone — a called strike on Jarrod Dyson in the third inning got everyone especially worked up — the home-plate umpire ejected Holland from the game.</p>
<p>Holland, mind you, was not actually in the game at the time. He won’t start until Tuesday at home against the Brewers. But he apparently said something that irritated Baker, who sent Holland to the showers with one out in the bottom of the third.</p>
<p>It was initially thought that Baker ejected manager Derek Shelton, which also would’ve been hilarious. Shelton would’ve been kicked out of a game before he won one.</p>
<p>With the Cardinals’ center field Lane Thomas at-bat, Baker suddenly stopped and walked toward the Pirates bench. A short while earlier he had warned everyone to quiet down, but this time he could be heard screaming “You’re gone!”</p>
<p>Shelton came out to argue before the crew chief, Jerry Meals, joined the discussion from second base. After about a minute, Shelton returned to the Pirates dugout.</p>
