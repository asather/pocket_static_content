<h1>Federal Reserve to the rescue? As economic forecasts dim, a cautious institution goes into overdrive</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — When Mekael Teshome took over as the Federal Reserve Bank’s top officer in Pittsburgh, he was tasked with assessing a regional economy rising to its upper limit a decade after the 2008 financial crisis.</p>
<p>Mr. Teshome today finds himself in the unenviable position of delivering increasingly dark economic forecasts amid the COVID-19 pandemic,&nbsp;dampening any hopes of a quick recovery even as businesses begin to gradually reopen.&nbsp;That’s in part because Pittsburgh’s economic linchpins, like health care and education, are facing unprecedented shutdowns and consumer confidence remains unpredictable, he said.</p>
<p>“Some of these traditionally more stable sectors — they’re also feeling a lot of pressure now,” Mr. Teshome said in a recent interview. “So it’s not really clear to what extent they can remain that force of stability.”</p>
<p>“Even when businesses open up, [consumers] have to feel safe to go out,” he added. “They also have to feel secure in their job prospects.”</p>
<p>With so much uncertainty, Mr. Teshome has tried to reassure the region by explaining the Fed’s&nbsp;range of lifelines to head off <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2020/05/17/How-bad-can-the-economy-get-Could-this-be-another-great-Depression/stories/202005170017" target="_blank">the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.</a> <span class="comment">[could link to Tim’Grant’s story here?]</span></p>
<p>The Federal Reserve, the country’s central bank, ensures the healthy circulation of money, stable prices and employment through the U.S. economy with carefully planned policies and minute changes in benchmark interest rates.</p>
<p>In good economic times, the Fed, from its headquarters in Washington, is a staid institution with such cautiously constructed policy statements that they are known as “Fedspeak” that must be deciphered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the COVID-19 economic crisis, however, the Fed has taken a much more public — and candid —&nbsp;role.</p>
<p>In doing so, the bank has stepped in to fill in the gaps, in a way, left by a squabbling Congress and federal agencies that at times have struggled to implement some $2.8 trillion authorized by lawmakers.</p>
<p>“What has been happening in the United States, partly as a result of political polarization, is the Fed has taken on more of a role,” said&nbsp;Stefania Albanesi, an economics professor at the University of Pittsburgh and former research officer at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Under Fed Chairman Jerome Powell, the central bank is, for the first time, scooping up long-term corporate debt. It is also <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/05/06/Federal-Reserve-loans-eligibility-PA-natural-gas-companies-SBA-loan-program/stories/202005050015" target="_blank">lending to mid-sized companies</a> left out by other programs tailored to small businesses. It is buying municipal bonds and considering an additional lending program for nonprofits like universities and health care providers.</p>
<p>The Fed is walking a bit of a tightrope as it tried to lend support without interfering with fiscal policy set by Congress, Ms. Albanesi said.</p>
<p>“It really is unprecedented” that the central bank is directly lending to companies, she said. “This is really a departure of what we would consider to be the standard role of a central bank.”</p>
<p>During a webcast hosted last Wednesday,&nbsp;Mr. Powell pledged the Fed&nbsp;“will continue to use our powers to the fullest.”</p>
<p>The downturn is “completely unique in our history, so we’re learning as we go,”&nbsp;he said during a conversation with the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.</p>
<p>Mr. Powell also suggested that&nbsp;Congress could possibly help by passing more spending packages.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Remember, the Fed has lending power, not spending power,” he said.&nbsp;“Additional fiscal support could be costly — but worth it if it helps avoid long-term economic damage and leaves us with a stronger recovery.”</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., a member of the Senate Finance and banking committees and a supporter of Mr. Powell, praised the Fed’s actions as&nbsp;“extraordinary in terms of the speed and the breadth and the magnitude.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey, who sits on a congressional oversight panel overseeing the Fed and Treasury lending programs,&nbsp;said he didn’t view the Fed chairman’s remarks as suggesting that more spending is needed.</p>
<p>“I take that as a very, very conditional observation,” Mr. Toomey said.&nbsp;“He’s simply saying if the determination were made we’re doing more good than harm then ... he can envision a scenario where that cost might be worthwhile.”</p>
<p>“I think we’re doing more good than harm,” he added, “but we’re definitely doing harm in some of the ill-conceived features in some of these bills.”</p>
<p><strong>‘... this strange virus ...’</strong></p>
<p>In Pittsburgh, Mr. Teshome has served as a spokesman for the Fed’s various monetary levers and is familiar with the Pittsburgh economy. Before becoming the vice president and senior regional officer of the Pittsburgh Branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, he served as&nbsp;an assistant vice president and economist at the PNC Financial Services Group for six years.</p>
<p>He spoke on the Pittsburgh Technology Council’s daily webcast,&nbsp;“Business As Usual,” joining Mark Schweitzer, the Fed’s senior vice president and adviser to the research director, to lay out business loan programs.</p>
<p>In an interview, Mr. Schweitzer said the Fed’s purchase of corporate debt was to jump-start a market that many of Pittsburgh’s largest companies rely on — and one that can have a cascading effect in the region.</p>
<p>“When they have constraints on [debt], they’re not able to do business,”&nbsp;Mr. Schweitzer explained. “When they’re less able to do business, that will bleed through to their supplies and their employers and to the broader community.”</p>
<p>Mr. Teshome also has kept in touch with members of the Fed’s business advisory council in Pittsburgh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The council’s 13 members meet quarterly with Mr. Teshome to share insights specific to each of their sectors, said Jeff Burd, president and owner of Tall Timber Group, a construction and real estate research firm based in Ross.</p>
<p>At the group’s last meeting in February, discussion had just started about “this strange virus that was popping up in China,” Mr. Burd said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since then, the Fed unveiled the Main Street Lending Program, which offers loans ranging from $500,000 to $25 million for a wide range of mid-sized businesses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But that program left out nonprofits like higher education, which has been pressing the the Fed for assistance, said William Generett Jr., vice president for community engagement at Duquesne University who serves on the Fed’s council.</p>
<p>The Fed recently sent out a questionnaire to schools, asking about how best to assess their creditworthiness and debt structure, Mr. Generett said.</p>
<p>“What they’re trying to figure out is: ‘OK, you’re a business, but you’re a different type of business,’” Mr. Generett said. “‘How can we, in some respect, figure out how to underwrite you guys?’”&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve had discussions, and we are hopeful at some point in time nonprofits and higher education will be able to take advantage,” he said.</p>
<p>Last week, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto said the city was eyeing the Fed’s municipal bond-buying program <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/05/13/pittsburgh-severe-dip-in-revenues-less-spending-covid-19-pandemic-economy/stories/202005130082" target="_blank">among other options to avoid layoffs</a>.</p>
<p>Through it all, the Fed plans to&nbsp;avoid as much risk as possible.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Schweitzer pointed out the Fed’s standards for buying corporate debt include a minimum credit rating.&nbsp;“The Federal Reserve needs to recover its costs,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Powell, on the webcast last week, reiterated the consensus among Fed board members against the idea of negative interest rates — which would require banks to pay borrowers interest — like those established in recent years by the the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank.</p>
<p>President Donald Trump has repeatedly heaped pressure on Mr. Powell to lower rates below zero.</p>
