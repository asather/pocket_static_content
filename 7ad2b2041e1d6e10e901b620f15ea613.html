<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 05.18.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hello, everyone. If you’re on time, you’re late, at least for today’s chat. Come one, come all, for Steelers banter.</p>
<p><strong>yno</strong>: I see a lot of fans seem to think the Steelers should have moved on from Big Ben. If they had done that though, how would you see them going about getting a quarterback over the past two years? They usually draft near the bottom of the teams in the first round. so they wouldn’t have gotten a first-round quarterback, more than likely. Do you get a feeling there is a good chance that Mason Rudolph may be the backup quarterback in Pittsburgh going forward? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It’s impossible to say. Depends when they would’ve moved on, how they would’ve done without him, etc. As for Rudolph, I have to think he’ll want the chance to become a starter somewhere and would take that opportunity before signing something long-term here.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Dixon</strong>: Brian - What impact, if any, do you think empty stadiums will have on the outcomes of games? I’d like to think that professional athletes would perform at peak levels no matter how many fans are yelling for or against them. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi, Dennis. If anything, maybe a slight edge to visiting teams, just because homefield advantage won’t be quite the same. I know talking with a former NFL player recently, he mentioned how much easier it would be for offenses to operate on the road, so perhaps you’d see some higher-scoring games.</p>
<p><strong>Sissy</strong>: why not go after Darron Lee for ILB kind of help/depth he is FA unsigned yet, experience, former 1st Rd, Ohio State U which seems we like, and he won’t command to much I think.. someone like him makes a lot of sense.. No? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Possibly. He’s got that first-round pedigree that the Steelers have been enamored with at times, especially on defense. But it’s not like he played all that much with the Chiefs last year. It’d probably be an upgrade, but it seems that the Steelers are content to see what they can get out of their young backups behind Devin Bush and Vince Williams.</p>
<p><strong>ketterer</strong>: Hi Brian, out of the 6 draft choices who makes the 53 man roster and who makes the practice squad <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hi. I haven’t sat down to really look at a roster projection since the draft, but with such a small class, it wouldn’t be a shock if they all made it. Even seventh-rounder Carlos Davis, he’d essentially just have to beat out Dan McCullers.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: What are the next 2-3 dates and activities on the NFL season calendar? Meet and greets? Mini-mini camps? Time with coaches? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It should be the league’s spring meeting this week, followed by OTAs and then mandatory minicamps, but obviously all of that is either scrapped or likely to be.</p>
<p><strong>Tim</strong>: With the additions of Mcfarland as a homerun threat and Watt at fullback, is our running back room complete now? Factoring in Conner as a three down back, Samuels as our swiss army knife and Snell as the hammer. More than enough in today’s NFL. What say you, Brian? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: What say me? Me say yes, it’s complete to the point of being crowded. Lots of competition for James Conner going into a make-or-break year. Gives the Steelers flexibility to either run the wheels off him if he’s healthy and producing, or transition to more of a committee approach, which we know is not really Mike Tomlin’s cup of tea.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: After last year’s quarterbacking to the tune of the Hokey-Pokey, why won’t the Steelers go after someone like Cam Newton, with Rudolph at third? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Because they want Rudolph to be second.</p>
<p><strong>TX Steeler</strong>: Given the current situation and potential near future of college football, do you think the supplemental draft might be more important this year <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There was some speculation about that a while back, but then there was a report that the NFL won’t allow college players to enter the sup draft for anything other than the usual reasons, i.e., no COVID-related factors.</p>
<p><strong>Steeltowntim@aol.com</strong>: Seems like the NFL will need to accept that there will be people in and around them at some point who will test positive for the virus. The bug question is how will they deal with that <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Sometimes you’re the windshield, sometimes you’re the bug.</p>
<p><strong>Gino</strong>: Hey Brian. Have you heard any Steelers coaches or players express any reservations about participating in games if there is an nfl season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I have not. But if we’re being honest, I’m not sure any coaches or players from the Steelers or any other teams would even openly express those thoughts if they are having them. Although I guess Blake Snell from the Rays is proof that I should be monitoring any and all video game streams. I think the kids call them Twitches.</p>
<p><strong>Yuri</strong>: I must say I’m tired of seeing and hearing the antics of Antonio Brown and James Harrison. They didn’t go out in a good way and can’t seem to realize that their reputations continue to plummet with each inane utterance or action. Are they that insecure or need attention so much that they are willing to denigrate themselves? They should be grateful for what the Steelers did for them...on and off the field. It’s time for these guys and others like them to grow up and get a life! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Kind of different cases here, Yuri. AB has actually been fairly underground lately, at least from a media perspective. Harrison seems to be keeping up the same edginess that made a lot of fans love him as a player.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: Hi Brian, I’m starting to read about the possibility that Ben might play longer than his current contract. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think it depends how he fares this season (and next). But at this point I’d be surprised if he’s on a roster in 2022. If he were to win another Super Bowl, I could see that being the impetus for him to retire and go out on top.</p>
<p><strong>Jake</strong>: Brian, Do you think Eli or Phillip would have given the Steeler’s more SB’s than Ben? Thanks. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I’ve always considered Roethlisberger to the best of that trio, followed by Rivers, who of course has zero rings.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff M</strong>: Did you get the sense that Jaylen Samuals fell out of favor last year after the abandoned the wildcat formation? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not really. I think Benny Snell showed himself to be a more powerful runner between the tackles, which got him bumped up the pecking order. Remember that Samuels got banged up a little bit too midseason, right around the time of the off week. Everyone on offense was hurt at some point last year, right?</p>
<p><strong>JDaven</strong>: What will the Steelers practice schedule look like next week when their facility is opened? How will the NFL monitor the teams to see if they are following the correct protocols? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It won’t look like much of anything considering coaches can’t be there yet and players are only allowed in if they were undergoing rehab/treatment prior to closing. The offseason work, such as it is, will still be virtual until we hear otherwise.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong>: Is there any reason, other than just fear, to think that Roethlisburger won’t be back to his usual self this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don’t have any faith in Roethlisburger.</p>
<p><strong>Chuck S</strong>: Hi Brian, Are you surprised that Anthony Chickillo has not been picked-up by anyone? Do you think that domestic situation has hurt his chances to play somewhere? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not really. I’m sure that type of brush with the law doesn’t help, especially when you’re a backup looking for work.</p>
<p><strong>Nosmo King</strong>: Who is the starter at TE...Ebron or old McDonald? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hello, Nosmo. I’m going with Eric Ebron, who has made his way to Pittsburgh, by the way. Has a pretty sweet outdoor setup in Sewickley and was catching balls from a JUGS machine by the pool over the weekend, as I observed on his Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Nosmo King</strong>: Say what....? No faith in Ben? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No faith in Roethlisburger, Mr. King.</p>
<p><strong>troyboy</strong>: what the odds paxton surpasses mason on the depth chart, me 100%. you heard it hear first. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Write down the name “troyboy” folks.</p>
<p><strong>Mo Nongahela</strong>: How much do you think U Gilbert will be on the field on defense this year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: How about 27% of the snaps?</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: lets just say that the steelers make the playoffs with ben and lose their first round game again and ben does nothing through the year, and they got there only because of their defense whats next for ben? do they continue to pay him for one more season or dump him and his outrageous contract? thank you <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hard to believe he’ll have “done nothing” for a team that makes the playoffs, even if the defense does prove to be the strength of the team again. But hey, in this hypothetical, I’ll say they continue to pay him because he’d still be their best shot at employing a Super Bowl-winning quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>574Fan</strong>: There is no more stabile franchise in professional sports than the steelers. Assuming we play a season and the off/pre-seasons are very abbreviated, that’s gotta be a huge advantage, right? Obviously, the single biggest factor going into the season is Ben’s health and age, but the continuity has to be worth a win or two I would think. Baltimore would have a similar advantage, while Cincy and Cleveland would be on the opposite side of the issue. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Possibly, but I’d also be at least a little concerned with lack of time for Ben to develop chemistry with some of his pass-catchers. He has barely worked with Diontae Johnson in game situations and has never played with Chase Claypool or Eric Ebron. Plus he just went almost a whole season without facing NFL defenses, which could help from a freshness standpoint but hurt from a rust standpoint.</p>
<p><strong>Cosmo K</strong>: Any idea what would happen with incentive/performance related clauses in contracts if the season is shortened? For example, 1,200 yards rushing or receiving. Would there be pro rated payments? Darren says hello... <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There’d probably be some fighting over that between the NFLPA and the league/teams. Pro-rated would only be fair, though.</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: So, you arrive at Heinz field with the ticket that you paid several hundred dollars for (not to mention being fleeced for parking) and they take your temperature as you are entering and say you have a fever. What happens then? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You probably have to go home, as you should.</p>
<p><strong>Myron’s Ghost</strong>: It’s possible that this could be the first time in decades that the Steelers play without Terrible Towels waving. How detrimental will this be to their performance? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No idea, but I’ve always had a question about Terrible Towels. Do you think there’s enough of them that at any given second during a game, at least one is waving inside the stadium?</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: What’s the Steelers’ plan for getting back to practice and opening up the facilities now? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: They can’t get back to practice yet, and if you heard Mike Tomlin’s comments from a couple weekends ago, he doesn’t intend to try to get a headstart on other teams if they do get the go-ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Peter</strong>: Has Ben said what he wants to do after his playing career is over? Enjoy family time? Coach? Other? Thanks Brian. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Don’t think I’ve heard him express any interest in post-playing coaching or broadcasting. Also doesn’t really strike me as something he’d be interested in. All of his interviews about that usually end up coming around toward his desire to spend more time with family, watch his kids grow up, etc.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Best guess here, how many OLBs will be kept, who, and who will the third guy? I’m thinking this might be the year for five. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hmmm. I think they’ll still only keep four, with rookie third-rounder Alex Highsmith getting every opportunity to be the top backup, then Ola Adeniyi and Tuzar Skipper battling it out for the last spot.</p>
<p><strong>Paul</strong>: Does LB Leo Lewis or Houston have a chance to stick at ILB. They <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: To quote my good pal Mike White from his high school sports chats (Tuesdays at 11): “No, they don’t have a chance. They shouldn’t even show up.”</p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong>: You’re till confusing Nosmo with your spelling joke. <br> <strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Hey Brian! Thanks for the chats! With the pandemic, is there a chance that the salary cap actually goes down next year further handcuffing the Steelers with Ben’s contract? Any chance he signs a 3-5 year extension to spread the hit over time even if he retires in year 2 of the extension? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Wrote about this a bit in my Steelers mailbag last week: <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/14/steelers-salary-cap-2021-nfl-covid-pittsburgh-juju-smith-schuster-ben-roethlisberger/stories/202005140090" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/14/steelers-salar...</a><br> <br> As for the Ben idea, sure, they could try to get creative with something like that.</p>
<p><strong>YinzInFlorida</strong>: Rudolph is terrible. He was already a year older than most in his draft class, and between the elite summer camps these QBs attend starting in middle school through college, running pro style offenses in college...why is there this delusion that this kid is all of a sudden going to be able to be a legitimate NFL QB? He got progressively worse ever game last year and he throws the ball worse than some QBs playing in the Canadian football league. He had a 6th/7th round grade coming out of college and the Steelers wasted a high draft pick that could have been an actual impact player at some point and are simply trying to save face. Change my mind. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I don’t think I can. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: OK buds, that’s all the time we have for today. I’m happy you all stopped by. It was a nice, leisurely chat. Have a great week.</p>
