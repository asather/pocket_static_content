<p>PARIS — The French navy is investigating how COVID-19 infected more than 1,000 sailors aboard the aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, amid growing pressure on government leaders to explain how it could have happened.</p>
<p>The ship, France’s biggest carrier and the flagship of its navy, is undergoing a lengthy disinfection process since returning to its home base in Toulon five days ago.</p>
<p>One person remains in intensive care and some 20 others hospitalized, navy spokesman Cmdr. Eric Lavault told The Associated Press.</p>
<p>Two of four U.S. sailors serving aboard the Charles de Gaulle as part of an exchange program also tested positive, according to a U.S. Navy statement. A British sailor was aboard another vessel, Mr. Lavault said, refusing to reveal the sailor’s health status.</p>
<p>Mr. Lavault insisted the aircraft carrier’s commander sought to increase the physical distance among the crew on the vessel, where there was no testing equipment and for most of its three months on operations, no masks.</p>
<p>It is “very difficult to apply social distancing measures … on a combat vessel,” Mr. Lavault said. But “security of the crew is the first concern. A combat ship, especially an aircraft carrier, is nothing without its crew.”</p>
<p>The French navy has been spared major controversy so far, but the defense minister and the head of the French military’s health service arm were questioned Friday about the infections at parliamentary hearings.</p>
<p>Defense Minister Florence Parly told lawmakers 1,081 of the 2,300 people aboard the Charles de Gaulle and its escort vessels have tested positive so far — nearly half the overall personnel.</p>
<p>While the virus has immobilized the immense and important ship, Ms. Parly insisted that otherwise “our forces continue to assure the defense of our country at sea, under the sea, on land and in the air.”</p>
<p>An investigation to retrace the paths of the personnel is in progress. Mr. Lavault noted the aircraft carrier made a call in the French port of Brest, on the Atlantic Ocean, had been in the North Sea as part of a “naval diplomacy” mission with NATO partners and had stopped in Cyprus during an operation in the eastern Mediterranean Sea to join in the fight against the Islamic State group.</p>
<p>Journalists had boarded the vessel at one point.</p>
<p>“All hypotheses are on the table,” Mr. Lavault said.</p>
