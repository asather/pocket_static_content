<h1>Chewing away morning breath: Pitt grad created gum that brushes teeth on the go</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Millennials are shockingly bad at brushing their teeth.</p>
<p>So bad that, on average, they have gone 2.35 days without brushing, based on results from a survey conducted by oral care company hello, based in Montclair, New Jersey. Thirty percent of millennial participants also admitted they only brushed once a day.</p>
<p>With stats like that, the oral care industry could be the next casualty of the slate of businesses millennials are accused of killing off.</p>
<p>Recognizing a need for a generation that prides itself on keeping busy and championing sustainability, local entrepreneur Emily Siegel came up with a solution — chewing gum that cleans teeth on the go.</p>
<p>The mechanics and ingredients of the gum are still being tested, but it comes down to a mix of natural antimicrobials and micro-abrasives that clear plaque off of teeth as you chew.</p>
<p>The gum has the “grittiness of toothpaste without feeling gritty like sandpaper,” said Ms. Siegel, 24, a recent University of Pittsburgh graduate. “It’s a happy blend of you know there’s something that’s helping you remove the plague but it’s not gross.”</p>
<p>On Thursday, Ms. Siegel won the Pittsburgh round of the 2020 Hardware Cup, an international competition where entrepreneurs make a short pitch to investors about their product and business plan. The competition, hosted by startup investor Innovation Works and hardware accelerator AlphaLab Gear, is in its sixth year. As the regional winner, Ms. Siegel won $3,000 and the chance to compete in the final round for $50,000 in May.</p>
<p>The idea for her startup, Trek Gum, came out of necessity, Ms. Siegel said. After adding a major in her junior year at Pitt, she found herself skimping on her brushing habits because she wasn’t spending enough time at home — and ended up with cavities. The only alternatives to brushing in your own bathroom involved a lot of single-use plastic.</p>
<p>“When I looked for portable options, they were all made of plastic and I wanted something that wasn’t, so I had to make it myself,” Ms. Siegel said.</p>
<p>She’s hoping to tap into the market for sustainable products, which is expected to grow to $150 billion by 2021, according to a study from The Nielsen Company in 2018. That same study found 75% of people between 21 and 34 years old said they would change their shopping habits to reduce their impact on the environment.</p>
<p>Ms. Siegel plans to offer a pack of Trek Gum for about $5, but hasn’t decided how many sticks will be in each package.</p>
<p>Comparatively, a pack of Peppermint Cobalt Five Gum from Target costs about $2. A bag of Lifesavers Mints from CVS goes for $2.60. And a value pack of three Colgate toothpaste tubes from Walmart costs about $4.</p>
<p>No one should start throwing away their toothbrush just yet, though. Trek Gum is still in the alpha phase, Ms. Siegel said, meaning there isn’t a product ready for use.</p>
<p>Right now, working out of her home kitchen, Ms. Siegel and her team are still gathering data. Using what she calls a “chewing machine,” they are mimicking the motion of chewing using something similar to a meat tenderizer to control things like the force of each chomp and how many chews occur in a minute.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Ms. Siegel is teaching herself the basics of food science to master the flavor.</p>
<p>“You can have a gum that works really well, doesn’t taste good, your consumer doesn’t care,” she said. “Flavor is something that we’re really trying to learn about.”</p>
<p>Already, Ms. Siegel has garnered a reputation as the “gum girl” on Pitt’s campus — in large part because she won the 2019 Randall Family Big Idea competition, hosted by Pitt’s Innovation Institute — and has started handing out her business card to interested chefs and Uber drivers.</p>
<p>She plans to release a beta version, or a test run, of the gum in October and she’s already got a list of interested taste testers.</p>
