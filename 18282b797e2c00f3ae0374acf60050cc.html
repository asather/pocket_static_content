<p>SUNRISE, Fla. — Amid all the injuries on the blue line, there has been one constant.</p>
<p>Marcus Pettersson is the lone Penguins defenseman to have played in every game this season. The steady Swede skated in his 54th game Saturday when the Florida Panthers played host to the Penguins at BB&amp;T Center. He also didn’t miss a game last season after he was acquired from the Anaheim Ducks.</p>
<p>And with seemingly everyone dropping like flies around him since he arrived, Pettersson has at various points been paired with several partners.</p>
<p>“There’s an element of simplicity to his game but he also has strengths on both sides of the puck,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said of Pettersson, who will turn 24 in May. “Because of that, he’s a fairly easy guy to play with.”</p>
<p>Pettersson, who two weeks ago was given an extension that will keep him under contract through 2024-25, entered Saturday with 1 goal, 14 assists and a plus-6 rating on the season. He is a defense-first player who usually makes a smart decision while trying to help the Penguins escape their zone.</p>
<p>“He defends well but he also has an offensive dimension to his game,” Sullivan said of the 6-foot-3 blue-liner. “He’s not just an off-the-glass-and-out guy.”</p>
<p>With rookie defenseman John Marino out, Sullivan reunited Pettersson and Justin Schultz Saturday. Kris Letang and Jack Johnson remained together. Juuso Riikola returned to the lineup and was paired with Chad Ruhwedel.</p>
<p>Pettersson and Schultz started the season as partners and had some ups and downs. The Penguins had 62 high-danger scoring chances with 49 against while both were on the ice this season, according to NaturalStatTrick.com. But their goal differential was even during those 300-plus minutes at 5-on-5.</p>
<p>While Schultz twice missed a chunk of time due to injury, Pettersson most often skated with Marino. But in Thursday at Tampa Bay, Marino got cracked in the left cheek with a one-timer and could be out for a while. If so, there is a decent chance that Pettersson and Schultz settle in as the second pair.</p>
<p>“They’re both good players,” Sullivan said. “That combination has been effective for us in the past. … [They] can be solid for us on both ends of the rink.”</p>
<p><strong>What’s up with Marino?</strong></p>
<p>Sullivan was mum about Marino, other than saying he was out Saturday.</p>
<p>“He’s being held out for precautionary reasons,” he said. “He’ll be evaluated on Monday [after] we get back to Pittsburgh to determine the course of action.”</p>
<p>The rookie defenseman has three broken bones in his left cheek after taking a Steven Stamkos slap shot to the face Thursday in a 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning and is expected to have surgery, according to a source. It is unclear how long the 22-year-old will be out if he indeed has surgery.</p>
<p>After that game, the Penguins believed that Marino, who needed to get stitches at Amalie Arena in Tampa, Fla., had somehow escaped without a major injury. But Friday morning, after the Penguins arrived in Sunrise for a practice at BB&amp;T Center, further testing revealed the extent of Marino’s damage.</p>
<p>Marino had settled into a top-four role and saw time on both special-teams units. The Harvard product has 5 goals, 20 assists and a plus-14 rating through his first 51 games while averaging more than 20 minutes of ice time per game.</p>
<p><strong>Gonchar gets involved</strong></p>
<p>Assistant coach Sergei Gonchar, who finished his stellar career with 102 goals and 325 assists on the power play, has worked closely with the power-play unit this past week. The Penguins seemed to be getting into a groove after Sidney Crosby returned then went 0 for 11 against Washington and Tampa Bay.</p>
<p>“He was a real cerebral player himself. I think he has a great demeanor. He has a great relationship with the players. They have a lot of respect for him,” Sullivan said. “I think he can offer just great insights for these guys, and a lot of it is on the subtleties of the game, most specifically for our defensemen.”</p>
<p>Sullivan also praised assistant coach Mark Recchi, a Hall-of-Fame player, when asked about Gonchar’s recent work with the power play.</p>
<p>“Between Sergei and Recchs, we have two guys that have just tremendous experience in that aspect of the game,” he said. “Both of those guys can offer the insights that they have and the experiences they have to draw on to try to help our power play, and in particular individuals in the group, to be successful.”</p>
<p><strong>Jarry gets his turn in goal</strong></p>
<p>Tristan Jarry got the start against the Panthers after Matt Murray was in goal for the team’s previous two games. Murray played well in both those starts.</p>
<p>Sullivan was asked if he was establishing a rotation with his goalies. Murray made back-to-back starts Jan. 17 and 19. Jarry got the two games after that. Murray played against Washington and Tampa Bay. Then Jarry got Florida.</p>
<p>“We think it’s a competitive advantage for the team,” he said. “We’ll try to manage workloads at the same time. Right now, we feel as though regardless of which guy goes in the net, both of these guys are playing extremely well.”</p>
