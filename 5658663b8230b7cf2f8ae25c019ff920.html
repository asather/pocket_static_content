<h1>With a few tense moments, protest in East Liberty ends peacefully </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With a few tense moments through confrontations with police and restaurant goers, Saturday night’s protest in East Liberty ended peacefully.</p>
<p>About 100 people met at the Target in East Liberty 7 p.m. Saturday. Many were wearing pink, after coming from a protest known as “Civil Saturdays” that traveled through Downtown earlier in the afternoon.</p>
<p>Tonight’s protest was intended to disrupt restaurant goers and residents around the area with their message of Black lives matter — and head to Mayor Bill Peduto’s house to address racial inequality starting with the charges filed against four protest leaders.</p>
<p>Protesters traveled through East Liberty, chanting “Out of the bars and into the streets,” as restaurant goers dined outside at various restaurants.</p>
<p>Local activist Lorenzo Rulli held up his microphone, stating,&nbsp;“I got my instrument of crime,” in reference to when <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/08/22/City-police-arrest-man-during-protest-in/stories/202008210143" target="_blank">police arrested him&nbsp;</a>and after a tense two-hour standoff near Mr. Peduto’s home on Aug. 21.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Rulli faces three misdemeanor charges —&nbsp;specifically citing him with using a megaphone as an instrument of a crime. Mr. Rulli told the crowd they were heading to Mr. Peduto’s house because of his arrest.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before heading off from Target, protest leader Nique Craft, who identifies as nonbinary, told the crowd the group will be a walking on one lane only, as the streets were initially not blocked off. “There’s no civil affairs, there’s no cops down the street to protect us. It’s just us,” they said.</p>
<p>As they weaved through the East Liberty neighborhood, protesters flashed lights into windows and restaurants. Craft stopped in front of one apartment building to address residents standing on their balconies why the group is here to disrupt.</p>
<p>“Four people were arrested just for doing exactly this,” they said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tensions rose when the group made their way to Mr. Peduto’s home, passing Pino’s Contemporary Italian Restaurant &amp; Wine Bar, where Craft said an employee allegedly told them to “go back to their own country.”</p>
<p>Once arriving at Mr. Peduto’s, protesters were met with about a half-dozen Pittsburgh Police officers standing in front of the mayor’s front door. After a short time standing and chanting in front of Mr. Peduto’s home, police officers started to put on helmets.</p>
<p>Protesters started to chant, “I don’t see a riot here why are you in riot gear?”</p>
<p>They then marched back to Target, due to a 10 p.m. curfew, marching silently for a portion of the route. Shortly after reaching Target around 10:15 p.m., protesters dispersed.</p>
