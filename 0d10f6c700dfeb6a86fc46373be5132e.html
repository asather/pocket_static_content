<h1>Italy reports biggest day-to-day increase of virus cases, 368 more deaths</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of COVID-19 cases in Italy on Sunday surged higher again.</p>
<p>Some 3,590 more cases of the coronavirus were reported in a 24-hour period, nearly 100 more than the increase as the day before. The additional infections reported Sunday represent the country’s biggest day-to-day increase.</p>
<p>Italy’s Civil Protection chief, Angelo Borrelli, announced the latest number of cases, bringing the total number of people with the new coronavirus to 24,747. The number of deaths increased by 368 to 1,809.</p>
<p>Italy has the largest outbreak outside of China, which — according to Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio — is sending 150 pulmonary respirators now and more later to help treat seriously ill COVID-19 patients in the center of Europe’s coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Italy’s national health institute chief, Silvio Brusaferro, said it is not known if Italy is reaching its peak and might start seeing the number of new cases decline.</p>
<p>Italians were being left even more isolated Sunday amid a national lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>Italy’s transport minister signed a decree Saturday banning passengers from taking ferries to Sardinia, a large Mediterranean island. The minister also banned overnight train trips, which many in the north had been taking to reach homes and families in the south.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, as they are cooped up at home by a government decree to combat the spread of coronavirus, Italians are coping creatively.</p>
<p>A trumpeter on a balcony in Sicily blasts out “Imagine.” At the same precise moment, a saxophonist plays some jazz riffs through an open apartment window in northern Turin. Pot lids are clanged like cymbals by homemakers in aprons in Rome and Naples — all at the stroke of 6 p.m.</p>
<p>In Milan, an opera singer leans out her window and sends notes wafting through the early evening air. Elsewhere in the city, which is Italy’s financial hub in a region that has the most coronavirus cases and deaths in the country, people strum guitars on perches overlooking the Navigli, a neighborhood that normally bubbles with nightlife.</p>
<p>And everywhere it seems, from north to south, windowsills and terraces are draped with Italian flags in a country which rarely displays them in any great numbers except during the World Cup every four years.</p>
<p>Such simultaneous combustion of creativity, which burst into the open Friday and is continuing daily, is how Italians, forced into domestic isolation, are coping and keeping spirits high as they do their part to slow the spread of coronavirus.</p>
<p>COVID-19 cases rise and deaths are mounting in the increasingly locked-down nation — even cemeteries are now off-limits.</p>
<p>But citizens are passionately converting cooped-up energies into initiatives to make them feel still in touch while their government, struggling to contain Europe’s largest outbreak, forbids them from leaving home except for essential reasons such as work, food shopping or bringing assistance to the elderly or disabled.</p>
<p>The virus can cause mild to moderate symptoms, although some cases are severe. The very large majority of those infected recover.</p>
