<h1>The Steelers' passing game looks a lot different than it did in the past</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was a time not all that long ago when the Steelers had one of the most prolific receiving corps in the NFL. In 2018, JuJu Smith-Schuster was fifth in the league in receiving with 1,426 yards, and Antonio Brown, who twice in the previous four years led the league in yards, was 11th.</p>
<p>This year, you have to scroll pretty far down to see a Steelers receiver among the NFL leaders. All the way down to line 43, to be exact.</p>
<p>That’s where Smith-Schuster ranks among the league leaders in receiving yards after three games. The likes of Kendrick Bourne, Marquez Valdes-Scantling and Scotty Miller are ahead of him.</p>
<p>Smith-Schuster has 17 receptions for just 160 yards. Diontae Johnson is next with 14 catches for 151 yards and then rookie Chase Claypool, who has nine catches for 149 yards.</p>
<p>It’s certainly different from 2018 or really any other season quarterback Ben Roethlisberger has been under center over the past decade.</p>
<p>But can it be different in a good way? From 2014-18, the Steelers were one of the more dangerous passing offenses in the NFL, and they never reached a Super Bowl. The Steelers are 3-0 for the first time since 2010, and the style points don’t seem to matter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>They certainly don’t to Roethlisberger.&nbsp;The prolific numbers take a back seat to the most important one in the win-loss column.</p>
<p>“I’d say the biggest stat is 3-0,” Roethlisberger said. “I don’t think anyone cares about their stats right now. No one is complaining; no one is coming to me. I’m not exactly playing lights-out. Their stats are directly affected by the way I play. If I’m not playing well, their stats aren’t going to be very good. So, obviously, some of their numbers are down because I’m not playing as well as I should be and need to be playing.</p>
<p>“They’re all contributing. There are a lot of guys who have their hand in the pile and are making plays for us. It seems like it’s someone different every week. We’ve got some guys that we can depend on all the time. We’ve got some new guys that can make plays. The ball is getting spread around, and that’s what makes it fun. Everyone is involved and everyone is involved in winning a football game. And at the end of the day, that is our only priority.”</p>
<p>For the season, 10 players have caught passes from Roethlisberger and six of them are in double digits in receptions. Seven players caught passes in Sunday’s victory against the Texans.</p>
<p>And even though Smith-Schuster isn’t producing in volume like he has in seasons past, he has produced big plays. He has three touchdowns, and each has come at important junctures of games.</p>
<p>The same can be said of Claypool. He only has nine catches, but among them have been an 84-yard touchdown against the Broncos, a leaping 28-yarder early in the Giants game and the 24-yard gain late in the game against the Texans that allowed the Steelers to close the game out by kneeling.</p>
<p>One thing Roethlisberger doesn’t plan on doing is feeding his top receivers just for the sake of padding their stats or to let them know he is cognizant of their lack of touches. He admitted he has done that in the past, and there are consequences to those actions.</p>
<p>“You have to be careful because if you get caught in that game, you’ll try to force someone a ball,” Roethlisberger said. “I’ve done it in the past, and sometimes it leads to bad things. I don’t predetermine going into it, but I think the biggest thing that shows is that I trust each guy. Each guy can make a play for this team. And depending on the situation, that’s kind of how it unfolds.”</p>
<p>The receiver Roethlisberger used to force the ball to the most was Brown. He once caught 17 passes for 284 yards in a single game against the Raiders in 2015.</p>
<p>At this rate, Smith-Schuster might hit that number by mid-October. Then again, if the Steelers are 6-0 at that point, no one will be complaining.</p>
