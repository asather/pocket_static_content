<h1>Group on South Side protests Minneapolis killing of George Floyd </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With large signs in hand, a local family held a mini-demonstration Friday in front of the FBI’s Pittsburgh headquarters on the South Side to protest&nbsp;the Memorial Day killing of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who was in police custody in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Several drivers honked their horns in support as Eric Younkins of Point Breeze walked along East Carson Street with his daughter Emma Younkins, his son&nbsp;Jake Younkins and his son’s girlfriend,&nbsp;Jessica Ashenbrenner, all of Plum. A passer-by, Billy Jackson of the South Side, stopped and joined in on the protest.</p>
<p>Mr. Floyd died&nbsp;in a confrontation with police that was captured on video. Mr. Floyd can be seen pleading as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, presses his knee against his neck. Mr. Floyd repeatedly says, “I can’t breathe,” and as minutes pass, he slowly stops talking and moving.</p>
<p>His death has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/28/Protesters-enter-Minneapolis-police-station-set-fires/stories/202005280202" target="_blank">sparked violent protests in Minneapolis</a> and in cities across the country. Officer Chauvin and the three other officers at the scene of the incident were fired earlier in the week.</p>
<p>“They fired the four cops. What did they fire them for? They fired them for murder. You don’t fire somebody for murder, you arrest them,” Eric Younkins said. “If they’d arrested those guys, there would not be any of this violence. Justice would proceed. It’s madness.”</p>
<p>The protests raged all week in Minneapolis, and on Thursday night, angry demonstrators torched a Minneapolis police station. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at Mayor Jacob Frey’s request.</p>
<p>A few hours after Mr. Younkins’ protest, Minnesota investigators <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/05/29/Minneapolis-cop-who-knelt-on-handcuffed-black-man-arrested/stories/202005290101" target="_blank">announced they had filed charges</a> of third-degree murder and manslaughter against Officer Chauvin and took him into custody.</p>
