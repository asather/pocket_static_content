<h1>As COVID-19 cases at the 14 state universities near 500, faculty union head questions wisdom of face-to-face classes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With almost 500 COVID-19 cases across the 14 state-owned universities, the faculty union president on Tuesday questioned why schools had reopened for in-person classes and suggested she wished the decision was less about campus finances than safety.</p>
<p>The State System of Higher Education and its chancellor, Daniel Greenstein, have maintained that the decision should be left to individual universities, since they know their regions best and since severity of the outbreak varies across Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>A number of campuses planned to hold sizable shares of classes in person this fall but most later pivoted — some sooner than others — as cases spiked. Several, however, are continuing to offer a sizable portion of face-to-face classes.</p>
<p>During a noon-hour Facebook Live discussion with state Auditor General Eugene DePasquale on Tuesday, Jamie Martin, president of the Association of Pennsylvania State College and University Faculties, said campuses that initially chose face-to-face classes but later pivoted are now at a disadvantage as they abruptly prepare classes for online delivery.</p>
<p>“I think the health and safety of our students, of the staff and the faculty should have been paramount,” Ms. Martin said. “If we decided in March to send students home, or in most cases not bring them back from spring break, when we had less than 100 cases of COVID, I don’t know, whatever we now have —&nbsp;&nbsp;about 140,000 cases — why that makes sense to bring students back to campus.’’</p>
<p>“We know conventional wisdom would suggest that [students] are not going to socially distance and wear masks when they are socializing off campus and on weekends,” she said.&nbsp;“So, I think the outcome could have been predicted.”</p>
<p>Ms. Martin added:&nbsp;“I think the short answer is it wasn’t a wise decision, and I wish it would have been more long-sighted than short-sighted, instead of just about the fall semester and potential financial impact on some of the universities.”</p>
<p>David Pidgeon, a spokesman for the roughly 96,000-student State System, could not immediately be reached for comment Tuesday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last week, in response to questions, he said&nbsp;campus-level plans “make sense for their individual communities, including when and how to determine if a shift in the delivery of academic programs is warranted.”</p>
<p>Cheyney is offering 70% face-to-face instruction; Kutztown, 40% remote, 60% hybrid or face-to-face and Shippensburg is split about evenly between remote and hybrid or face-to-face, he said.</p>
<p>Ms. Martin made her comments shortly before the University of Pittsburgh on Tuesday provided its update, stating an additional 36 positive case have been logged, bringing the total of active cases to 78 and the cumulative total to 128 since Aug. 1. The university’s medical response office said the moving five-day average of cases had risen to 10 from 7.6</p>
<p>There are 78 active student cases in isolation, said a statement released Tuesday by Pitt spokesman Patrick McMahon. His school, like others, has expressed growing concern about off-campus gatherings where social-distancing guidelines and mask rules are not being followed.</p>
<p>On Friday, Penn State President Eric Barron said his university planned to re-evaluate whether to move classes online in light of a near tripling of cases from a week ago. Results on significant cases there are not yet in, leaving the most current positivity rate unclear from last week.</p>
<p>In follow-up questions from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Ms. Martin, a professor at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, said in an email, “I do wish that the State System would have been more direct in the guidance provided to the 14 universities regarding the fall 2020 reopening and that there had been more uniformity.</p>
<p>“If the State System did not want to make the decision regarding remote delivery of classes for all 14, I would have hoped that, at the very least, they would have provided direction re: the compilation and dissemination of the number of COVID-19 cases on each campus as not all are reporting this data.),” she added.</p>
<p>“Further, it would have been helpful if the State System had specified the point at which a campus should halt face-to-face classes,” she explained. “For example, at Lock Haven, they went to remote classes (for at least 2 weeks) once the positivity rate reached 5% on their campus. I am not aware of other universities that have these kinds of parameters in place. Hence, we are seeing cases rising across our campuses and no knowledge of how many cases are 'too many.’ ”</p>
<p>Ms. Martin said Bloomsburg University, which began classes Aug. 17, now reports 267 cases. She said Lock Haven University, which started a week later, has 57 cases as does Kutztown University.</p>
<p>Other campuses are reporting cases in varied numbers, among them Slippery Rock University, which as of this week has 42 cases since Aug. 20, including 31 new confirmed cases last week. It has switched largely to remote classes.</p>
<p>In July, responses to an APSCUF membership survey found 70% felt "very unsafe" about returning to in-person classes. About 40% of the faculty who responded reported having some type of pre-existing medical condition that puts them at additional risk if they get the virus, and more than half said they lived with someone who would be at risk.</p>
<p>The union represents about 5,000 State System faculty and coaches.</p>
<p>A debate nationally is continuing over the academic and psychological benefits of bringing students back for in-person classes versus the health risks. The virus has claimed 190,000 lives in the U.S.</p>
<p>The 14 State System universities are separate from the four state-related universities, which include Penn State, Temple and Lincoln universities, as well as the University of Pittsburgh. Those campuses also have reported increases in cases, collectively in the hundreds.</p>
<p>The 14 state-owned universities also include California, Clarion, East Stroudsburg, Edinboro, Indiana, Mansfield, Millersville and Shippensburg.</p>
