<h1>COVID-19 Update: Pa. reports nearly 800 new cases, with Pittsburgh region up 214</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After six days of double-digit increases in daily COVID-19 cases, Allegheny County on Thursday reported a triple-digit jump along with an increase in the number of tests completed.</p>
<p>Allegheny County reported 100 new cases of virus. These new cases come from 1,648 tests — almost double Wednesday’s number of tests. The positive tests were administered between June 23 and Aug. 19.</p>
<p>The county health department said all but three of the positive results were collected within the last week. Those who have tested positive range in age from 2 to 91 years old, with a median age of 44. The county has had a total of 9,676 cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>In a press conference on Wednesday, Dr. Debra Bogen, director of the county’s health department, explained that the low testing from the past week is based on low case counts. She expects testing demand to increase when the number of reported cases is high and decrease when it is low.</p>
<p>Statewide, there were 791 newly reported cases for Thursday, bringing the state total to 126,940.</p>
<p>Western Pennsylvania accounted for 214 of the newest cases, with Allegheny having the highest number of cases, followed by Westmoreland County with 20 additional cases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The county also is reporting one additional death as a result of the virus, increasing the death toll to 298. The death occurred on Aug. 12. The person was in their 70s.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania reported 15 additional virus related deaths. The state death toll is now 7,538.</p>
<p>Three of the fifteen deaths occurred in Western Pennsylvania, with Allegheny, Crawford and Indiana counties each reporting one new death.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Since the county’s first case in mid-March, 911 people have been hospitalized as a result of the virus. Currently, there are 94 patients hospitalized in Allegheny County, according to the most recent data from the state.</p>
