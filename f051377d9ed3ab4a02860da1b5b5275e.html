<h1>Law firm seeks to halt Gov. Wolf's order to close all legal offices</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A law firm outside Harrisburg is challenging Gov. Tom Wolf’s latest order that all “non-life-sustaining businesses” must close to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>The firm, Costopoulos, Foster and Fields in Lemoyne, Pennsylvania, claims the order is “so broad and sweeping, it is manifestly unconstitutional and illegal.”</p>
<p>It filed a petition for an emergency injunction or temporary restraining order on the portion of the governor’s order that applies to “legal services” Friday in the Pennsylvania Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Closing law offices in the state interferes with the constitutional rights of Pennsylvania citizens to counsel and due process, the law firm said in its filing.</p>
<p>Because of the nature of their job, attorneys and lawyers can not work remotely, the firm argued. For example, if a senior citizen is admitted to the ICU as a result of the new coronavirus, their family should not be prevented from meeting their attorney to discuss a living will and power of attorney.</p>
<p>Already, the state Supreme Court ruled Wednesday all courts will be closed to the general public for at least two weeks. On Monday, the state’s highest court declared a statewide judicial emergency.</p>
<p>The governor’s latest order took effect Thursday evening and is set to be enforced starting Saturday. It came almost a week after Mr. Wolf advised all non-essential businesses to voluntarily close or have employees work from home.</p>
<p>“I had hoped for voluntary compliance so our public safety officials could focus on assisting with the crisis,” Mr. Wolf said in a video statement. “Unfortunately, we have not seen full compliance.”</p>
<p>All health care and social-assistance businesses, except child day care, can remain open. That includes hospitals and nursing care facilities.</p>
<p>Crop and animal farming, food and beverage manufacturing, grocery stores, beer distributors, utilities and most telecommunications businesses were also permitted to remain open.</p>
<p>Most transit systems — including air, water and bus transportation — are to continue operating.</p>
<p>Businesses that don’t comply with the orders could face citations, fines or license suspensions.</p>
