<h1>Duquesne fires professor whose use of a racial slur in class reached social media</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Duquesne University on Wednesday fired an education professor whose use of a racial slur in class Sept. 9 reached social media, triggering a debate about academic freedom, race and lines between free expression and a hostile learning environment.</p>
<p>An educational rights group immediately decried the move and is asking the U.S. Department of Education to review the matter and consider sanctioning the university.</p>
<p>Gary Shank, who has taught at Duquesne since 1997, was notified in a letter from university Provost David Dausey regarding Education Dean Gretchen Generett’s decision to place him on paid leave over the incident. It occurred during the professor’s Educational Psychology 1: Child and Adolescent Development class, delivered via Zoom.</p>
<p>“I have received the report written by Dean Generett regarding your conduct,” Mr. Dausey wrote.&nbsp;“I agree with the recommendation it contains. Therefore, pursuant to Section 9.2 of the Faculty Handbook, your employment at Duquesne is terminated for serious misconduct.”</p>
<p>Mr. Shank’s use of the “N word,” which he said was for pedagogical reasons, nevertheless was deemed inappropriate under any circumstances by the dean. However, groups including the American Association of University Professors and Foundation for Individual Rights in Education have intervened on his behalf.</p>
<p>Philadelphia-based FIRE disputed the university’s action, and the AAUP, headquartered in Washington, D.C.,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/09/28/Duquesne-University-Gary-Shank-Gormley-AAUP-academic-freedom-race-slur-speech-discrimination/stories/202009280063" target="_blank">urged Duquesne President Ken Gormley to reinstate </a>the professor while his case is adjudicated, saying he should not have been placed on leave without a hearing.</p>
<p>“We have 30 days to grieve the termination and certainly will do so,” Mr. Shank’s attorney, Warner Mariani, said Wednesday, reacting to Duquesne’s letter.</p>
<p>Officials at FIRE have upped the ante, sending a letter Friday to the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Postsecondary Education, asking the agency to investigate. It asserts that Duquesne has deviated from its stated commitment to academic freedom and free expression, in Mr. Shank’s case and at least one other instance, and says monetary penalty should be considered.</p>
<p>“This is not the first time Duquesne has imperiled its constituents’ expressive rights,” wrote Alexandria Morey, program officer with FIRE’s Individual Rights Program. “This time last year, FIRE reminded Duquesne of its free speech promises after it tried to censor a student group’s use of the term ‘gender neutral’ in its annual Gender Neutral Fashion Show.”</p>
<p>She added,&nbsp;“After a backlash, Duquesne relented and called the incident a ‘miscommunication.’”</p>
<p>Ms. Morey responded to Wednesday’s termination with the following:</p>
<p>“By firing Gary Shank for discussing a tough topic in his class, Duquesne betrays any commitment it purports to have to academic freedom, which protects the rights of faculty to choose whether and how to approach difficult subjects,” she said.</p>
<p>“Duquesne students and faculty will rationally choose to say nothing rather than say something that others might find controversial, as their university won't bother to defend their rights. That's an unacceptable result at an educational institution of any calibre."</p>
<p>The professor’s repeated use of the slur was captured on video by a student taking the class, who forwarded it to a friend who posted it to Twitter.</p>
<p>In one of two videos posted to Twitter, the professor — as he interacts with at least one student — brings up the N-word.&nbsp;In one video, Mr. Shank says, “I’m giving you permission to use the word, OK? Because we’re using the word in a pedagogical sense. What’s the one word about race that we’re not allowed to use?”</p>
<p>After being greeted with silence, he adds, “I’ll give you a hint. It starts with ‘N.’ … It’s even hard to say, OK? But, I’ll tell you the word, and again, I’m not using it any way other than to demonstrate a point. Fair enough?”</p>
<p>In a separate video clip, Mr. Shank says, “When I was a young man, all right, that was a very commonly used word.” He offers an example of how the word was used in his youth and asks his student, “Could we do that nowadays?” After a voice on the video says “no,” the professor offers another example and repeats the question.</p>
<p>“To be clear, I believe that there is never a time, pedagogically or otherwise, for a professor to create a hostile learning environment,” Ms. Generett wrote last month in explaining why the professor was placed on leave.</p>
<p>Duquesne spokesman Gabriel&nbsp; Welsch said its commitment to academic freedom is evidenced in the faculty handbook and the grievance process that Mr. Shank has available to him, one that involves faculty from all schools.&nbsp;“We do not take such matters lightly.”</p>
<p>Duquesne, a Catholic University with almost 9,300 students, is located on The Bluff.</p>
