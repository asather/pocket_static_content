<h1>Fundamental flaws sink Pirates in loss to Cubs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It can’t continue. It just can’t. And the Pirates know it.</p>
<p>But for them to show any meaningful progress here, both short- and long-term, they have to start playing a cleaner brand of baseball.</p>
<p>That did not happen Wednesday at PNC Park, not even close, and they paid for it with yet another loss — 8-2 to the Cubs, their fifth in the past six.</p>
<p>Adam Frazier made a questionable decision on the bases. Colin Moran missed a popup he simply had to have at first base, and Kevin Newman made his team-high sixth error and third in the past three games.</p>
<p>This one allowed a pair of runs to score and ruined any dreams the Pirates might’ve had of coming back. Oh, and the Pirates threw to the wrong base in the seventh inning.</p>
<p>Maybe it sounds like a broken record, but the Pirates don’t have the budget, offense or pitching to compensate for this glaring lack of fundamentals. They also have made little tangible progress in terms of manager Derek Shelton taking over the team.</p>
<p>It’s not for lack of effort. Shelton and his staff dating back to spring training 1.0 have emphasized better fundamental play through drill work and attention to detail, but sooner or later it’s up to the players to execute.</p>
<p>With three more errors Wednesday, the Pirates wrestled the MLB lead from the Giants and now have 33 on the season. When talking about stealing bases, the Pirates prior to Wednesday had been caught seven times on 17 attempts, a success rate of just 58.8% that had them among the first-worst teams in baseball.</p>
<p>So while we can focus on individual performances like what Ke’Bryan Hayes did Tuesday or looking for bright spots the rest of the way, something to track is the same stuff that has continually infuriated the fan base, the Pirates’ inability to play fundamentally sound baseball.</p>
<p>Besides playing a sloppy game, the Pirates (10-24) could not get anything going against Cubs starter Kyle Hendricks or the Chicago bullpen. Pittsburgh got solo home runs from Moran and Anthony Alford, but that was it.</p>
<p>The biggest story of the night from the Pirates’ perspective might’ve been Joe Musgrove returning from the injury list. Musgrove wound up throwing 46 pitches over three-plus innings and actually looking pretty solid while doing it.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ opening day starter had not seen game action since Aug. 4 thanks to right triceps inflammation and right-ankle discomfort.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon native Ian Happ doubled off Musgrove to start the game before Musgrove quickly settled into a groove. He retired the next nine men he faced, four of them via strikeout. Especially effective for Musgrove was his breaking stuff, which he used to get his four punchouts.</p>
<p>Getting a pitch that was pretty much middle-middle, Moran opened the scoring by crushing one from Hendricks 450 feet with an exit velocity of 110.8 mph for a 1-0 Pirates lead. That held up until the fourth, when the Cubs got to Musgrove and wound up scoring three runs.</p>
<p>Musgrove allowed a single to Willson Contreras and a double to Anthony Rizzo before manager Derek Shelton turned things over to Nick Tropeano.</p>
<p>Rizzo’s double scored one, and shortstop Javier Baez smacked the first pitch he saw from Tropeano — a splitter that stayed up — 443 feet to left-center for a two-run homer.</p>
<p>The Pirates kept things interesting against Hendricks but weren’t able to build on Moran’s homer. Hendricks, who entered the game with just four walks in 44 inning this season, actually struggled some and walked two.</p>
<p>Jacob Stallings ended the second at first base before Adam Frazier seemed to think he had timed up Hendricks’ delivery, though he turned out to be an easy out.</p>
<p>The Pirates were able to score again once Hendricks’ left for the evening after six innings of one-run ball, six strikeouts and 102 pitches.</p>
<p>Alford, making his first start for the Pirates after they claimed him off waivers from the Blue Jays, crushed a middle-middle cutter into the bullpens, a no-doubter that showed some of what he can do.</p>
<p>That mattered little, however, as the Cubs plated five runs off Derek Holland in the seventh and eighth innings — again, because of a defensive lapse.</p>
<p>Rizzo scored two with his two-run single in the seventh inning, but it was made possible because Alford threw to the wrong base on the preceding play, a single by Contreras.</p>
<p>Instead of throwing to second base, which would have kept the (inning-ending) double play in order, Alford threw to third base, allowing Contreras to move up 90 feet.</p>
<p>Contreras’ double an inning later scored another run before Newman booted a ball that gave the Cubs their final two runs of the night.</p>
<p><strong>Around the horn</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates have now homered in a season-high six consecutive games. … A night after his specular debut, Ke’Bryan Hayes saw how the other half lives. He went 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.</p>
