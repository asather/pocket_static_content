<p>HARRISBURG — The Pennsylvania legislature will send a short-term budget to Gov. Tom Wolf, an unusual measure made necessary by the strain put on the state’s finances by the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The state Senate on Thursday passed the $25.8 billion budget 44-6, just two days after the House <a href="https://www.spotlightpa.org/news/2020/05/pennsylvania-short-term-budget-revenue-shortfall-coronavirus/" target="_blank">first presented the measure</a> and passed it along party lines.</p>
<p>The stopgap measure flat-funds most state agencies for five months and the Department of Education for one year. That would guarantee that schools — which over the last six years under Mr. Wolf have seen funding boosts every year — will not see cuts in state funding.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for Mr. Wolf was not immediately available to comment.</p>
