<h1>Chartiers Valley administrators, faculty deliver students’ caps and gowns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Students in the Chartiers Valley School District have not seen their teachers or principals since March 13. That all changed on May 11 when about 40 Chartiers Valley High School teachers and several administrators drove around district neighborhoods to hand deliver - while practicing social distancing - care packages to each of the roughly 260 student in the class of 2020.</p>
<p>On the morning of May 11, teachers and administrators met at the high school and were split into small groups - some driving themselves, others riding in small groups on school buses. Each group was assigned a list of students and then made their way through neighborhood to deliver the care packages on the porches of the students’ homes.</p>
<p>The care packages included the student’s cap and gown, a “class of 2020” yard sign, a Chartiers Valley drawstring bag, and cards from the principals and superintendent. Also in the package was a blank piece of poster board for graduates to decorate as well as instructions for recording a cap and gown video that will be used on a video montage on the district’s website.</p>
<p>“A graduation committee made up of principals, teachers and students have been gathering via Zoom to discuss contingency plans for commencement, given the governor’s social distancing orders,” because of COVID-19, said district spokesperson Mikaela Duckstein.</p>
<p>She added while alternative dates for commencement are in place if student cannot graduate on the original May 28 date, the graduation committee acknowledged the class of 2020 has missed out on many of the end-of-year traditions and wanted to do something to make up for that. It also provided an opportunity to distribute caps and gowns, which were typically picked up at school.</p>
<p>“It was incredibly touching that our administration and staff put together such a moving gesture for us seniors,” said student Hannah Roadway. “My twin sister and I opened up our front door and saw two of our favorite teachers holding our very future in their hands. It was so good to see them again and feel special for a bit,” Hannah added.</p>
<p>Senior Sean Banas said it was “really cool” to see his teachers deliver his cap and gown.</p>
<p>“I’m sure they have their own problems in their families and with quarantine, but they took time out of their day to put a smile on our face and that’s what I love about CV (Chartiers Valley),” Sean said.</p>
<p>High school history teacher Scott R. Crimone said the day was “awesome.”</p>
<p>“I was the goof in the CV (Chartiers Valley) apparel riding in the van with the balloons and paint on it,” he said. “To be able to see even just a handful of our students today was such a special situation. The smiles we saw and the joy in their eyes when we rolled up to their houses, honking the horn and blasting ‘Celebration’ on the speakers is a memory that I will cherish and I hope the students will as well,” Mr. Crimone said.</p>
