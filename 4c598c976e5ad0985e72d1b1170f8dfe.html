<h1>WPIAL athletic directors weigh in on cancellation of spring sports</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Stephanie Strauss remembers the phone calls she made March 12 like they were yesterday.</p>
<p>One by one, the Penn Hills athletic director dialed up each of the Indians’ spring sports coaches to deliver the unprecedented news.</p>
<p>“This is going to be your last practice for a while,” Strauss told them. “Make it a good one.”</p>
<p>When the news broke that Thursday afternoon that the PIAA was putting all winter sports championships on hold and postponing the start of the spring sports seasons due to the COVID-19 outbreak, virtually everybody involved reacted with some mix of shock, sadness, disappointment and confusion.</p>
<p>It all seemed to be happening so fast. The day before, the NBA abruptly suspended its season and the NCAA announced that fans would not be permitted at any postseason tournaments, all of which would be officially canceled the next day along with the remainder of the spring sports seasons.</p>
<p>The PIAA, on the other hand, initially decided against officially canceling its winter championships and spring sports seasons, choosing instead to play the waiting game. This standstill lasted nearly a month, but as of Thursday, the PIAA has <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/highschool/2020/04/09/piaa-spring-sports-cancellation-basketball-swimming-championships-pennsylvania/stories/202004090148" target="_blank">officially called an end</a> to the 2019-20 winter and spring sports seasons.</p>
<p>“I feel for those kids and those coaches and the time they put in, but obviously the health and the toll this virus is taking on this country is way more important than that,” Western Beaver athletic director Ryan Matsook said.</p>
<p>Despite the negative effect the COVID-19 pandemic is having on his ability to do his job, Mt. Lebanon athletic director John Grogan seemed to echo many of his fellow athletic directors’ thoughts about having their priorities in order.</p>
<p>“I think that one of the most important things that sports provides us is life lessons,” Grogan said. “When you’ve got to choose between a basketball game, as important as it is, to the potential to socially distance and save a life ... it tends to put high school basketball into perspective.”</p>
<p>Grogan’s stance is particularly noble considering the Blue Devils’ boys basketball team was still in contention for a state title after reaching the second round of the PIAA Class 6A playoffs.</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon had been scheduled to take on Cheltenham High School, located in Montgomery County near Philadelphia, on March 11. But when word got out that a Cheltenham parent was a caregiver to a patient who tested presumptive positive for COVID-19 and that the school had closed for the rest of the week, the Blue Devils <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/03/11/mt-lebanon-blue-devils-joe-david-john-grogan-cheltenham-piaa-basketball-playoffs-covid-19/stories/202003110116" target="_blank">decided not to make the trip</a> to play in the second-round game.</p>
<p>The PIAA as a whole, though, chose to hold out hope for as long as possible, and it seems like most, if not all, athletic directors were on board with that decision.</p>
<p>“I think that’s the way to do it,” Mount Pleasant athletic director Chris Brunson said. “Even with the WPIAL and the PIAA, I think they’re just doing their due diligence. They’re letting it play out and seeing what happens before they make a decision and cancel everything, and I think that’s the right decision.”</p>
<p>Brunson also serves as the Vikings’ softball coach and he has two daughters who would have been playing together this spring for the first time since Little League, one as a junior and one as a freshman. Considering his team reached the WPIAL Class 4A championship and PIAA Class 4A semifinals last season — only to suffer heartbreaking defeats against Elizabeth Forward both times — Brunson and his players were eagerly awaiting the start of a new season.</p>
<p>“This was the fun part of the job for me because I get to coach softball,” Brunson said. “I’m a spring sports guy. I played football and everything and I can appreciate all of it, but there’s just something about the spring. The weather changes and everybody’s excited coming out of the winter doldrums, I guess.</p>
<p>“I was disappointed, but I was more disappointed for the kids.”</p>
<p>Matsook is in his third year as athletic director at Western Beaver, and it’s safe to say the former PIAA title-winning football coach didn’t expect to have this much free time so soon into the new job. Then again, he’s also the school’s principal, so keeping himself busy hasn’t been much of an issue with the rapid shift to remote online learning.</p>
<p>“Sports are something that brings people together, but right now, I don’t know if sports are the most important thing to focus on,” Matsook said. “I think we’ll know we’re back to normalcy when we’re talking about some sports. But it’s on the back burner.</p>
<p>“We’re just trying to educate these kids for the rest of the school year to the best of our ability.”</p>
