<h1>Police charge Clairton man in connection with Oakland homicide</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police on Wednesday were searching for a Clairton man charged in connection to the shooting death of another man in Oakland two weeks ago.<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/04/01/Man-hospitalized-after-being-shot-in-Oakland-early-Wednesday/stories/202004010076" target="_blank"><br></a></p>
<p>Devlin Clifford Jr., 20, was charged with homicide and conspiracy to commit homicide in the early-morning shooting of Esam Hossain, who died after he was found early April 1 on Meyran Avenue with a gunshot wound to the head.</p>
<p>According to a police affidavit, Mr. Clifford was driving the white Lincoln MKZ that was seen leaving the scene of the shooting.</p>
<p>Investigators used accounts from witnesses, city camera footage and data obtained from Mr. Clifford’s cell phone to connect him to the incident.</p>
<p>Surveillance cameras showed the white Lincoln driving inbound on Carson Street around 11:37 p.m. on March 31, according to a criminal complaint. Footage then shows the vehicle stopping for several minutes in the parking lot of the Panera Bread on Boulevard of the Allies in Oakland.</p>
<p>Police said the footage showed three people sitting in the sedan, one of whom they identified as Mr. Clifford.</p>
<p>The car was then seen leaving the lot and parking on Bates Street near Atwood Street around 11:42 p.m., the affidavit reads. Two unidentified men — one in the front passenger seat and another in the rear — were seen leaving the car.</p>
<p>The two men ran toward Oakland Avenue on foot and made a left turn towards Forbes Avenue, the affidavit says. Oakland Avenue is located three blocks away from and runs parallel to Meyran Avenue.</p>
<p>Footage then shows two men chasing Mr. Hossain down Meyran Avenue toward Forbes Avenue and shooting at him, the affidavit said. They then turn and go back toward Bates Street.</p>
<p>The affidavit says cameras show the two individuals enter the Lincoln around 11:47 p.m., and the car drives away.</p>
<p>At 2:08 a.m. on April 1, the sedan’s license plate was captured by a surveillance camera at the intersection of Miller and Saint Clair avenues in Clairton. Police ran the plate and found it was registered to Devlin Clifford of Clairton, the affidavit said.</p>
<p>Detectives later approached Mr. Clifford when he was sitting in the Lincoln and detained him. The affidavit says Mr. Clifford noticed the officers were homicide detectives and stated,&nbsp;“Homicide, I didn’t kill anyone.” When detectives explained they were investigating the Oakland shooting, Mr. Clifford said,&nbsp;“I didn’t shoot anyone. I was here all night and not even in Oakland.”</p>
<p>After searching Mr. Clifford’s phone, police found a&nbsp;“Journey” starting at Frazier Street in Oakland and ending at Mr. Clifford’s Clairton residence. The affidavit notes that this is consistent with camera footage that places the Lincoln on Frazier Street around 12:36 a.m. on April 1.</p>
<p>The criminal complaint also notes a third unidentified male was seen leaving the scene of the shooting, passing the Lincoln and appearing to talk on a cell phone.&nbsp;</p>
