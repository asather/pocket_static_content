<h1>Paul Zeise: If you are a sports fan and aren’t watching the NBA, you should be</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh is not an NBA town. I know this because I’m told this over and over by many so-called sports fans. Apparently we can’t appreciate the NBA because we don’t have a team, or something like that.</p>
<p>If you are one of these people who claims to like basketball but hates the NBA, I have to tell you that you are missing a great game right now. The NBA in the bubble for the playoffs is as fun to watch as basketball has been in a long time. It is basketball played at the highest level, and there are a lot of great young players — as well as some of the old guard stars — who have really been great to watch.</p>
<p>I’ve often said that Pittsburgh fans would love the NBA if they got a chance to watch it live a few times. Once you see it live, you understand how skilled, strong and athletic those players are. You also understand how much higher of a level the game is played at than college basketball.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nevertheless, these are the things I keep hearing from people who “hate” the NBA and why they couldn’t be further off:</p>
<p><em>‘College basketball is much better. They play with much better fundamentals and it is a team game.’</em></p>
<p>OK, let me see if I have this correct: The argument is that players who aren’t yet as developed and many who will never sniff the NBA but start on college teams are better than NBA players? Is this what we are gonna go with? Really? That is so dumb on its face I can’t even imagine anyone with a working knowledge of sports trying to make this claim.</p>
<p>You know what an NBA player is? One of the best players in the world. They are fully developed and they have been coached and taught by the best coaches available. They don’t have to go to class, there is no restriction to how much they can work out or practice. Those guys are so much better than college players it is silly.</p>
<p>It isn’t even close. College basketball is junior varsity, the NBA is varsity. The best players in the world playing the game at the highest level possible. It is a game played at a level the best college teams don’t come close to.</p>
<p><em>‘They don’t play defense in the NBA!’</em></p>
<p>OK this is another one that is totally ridiculous. Going back to point one — it is really hard to play defense in the NBA. Do you know why? Because you are trying to stop the best players in the world. And with the way offenses are run nowadays and the way everyone is spread out, it isn’t easy to get stops. That doesn’t mean they don’t play defense or that there aren’t great defensive players on every team.</p>
<p>And all those great defensive players in college become even greater in the NBA. That is just one of ways that teams are better defensively than college teams. The NBA has better defensive players and in turn that makes for better defensive teams.</p>
<p>Craig Meyer, who covers Pitt hoops for the Post-Gazette, crunched some numbers for me. In the NBA, they do score more, as a typical NBA team would average about 76 points per game while a college team about 69, based on points per possession of both leagues for a 40-minute game.</p>
<p>That isn’t a product of worse defense, though. It is a product of better offense in the NBA. The NBA players, who allegedly lack fundamentals, shoot 77 percent from the free-throw line and about 36 percent from the 3-point line. Their college counterparts shoot 71 percent from the free-throw line and 33.4 percent from the 3-point line.</p>
<p>NBA players shoot better and they shoot more because the shot clock is shorter. That’s not about defense, unless there is some sort of way to defend free throws that I haven’t heard about.</p>
<p><em>‘I hate all that woke political stuff.’</em></p>
<p>If you are that triggered by “Black Lives Matter” written on the courts, there is probably something deeper at work with you, and that’s sad. As for the other stuff — tune in after the national anthem and don’t listen to postgame interviews and I think the amount of “woke political stuff” you have to endure is almost nothing.</p>
<p>Above and beyond all of that other stuff is this: The league has some great, exciting young players and there seems to be more of them than in a long time. The future of the NBA is bright and the players just keep getting better and better.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And let’s not forget — the best player in the league is still LeBron James and he is on the short list of best players of all time. He is a generational player, an elite superstar and he is likely to lead his team to the championship. That is something you should want to tune in and watch.</p>
<p>If you don’t like basketball, that is one thing. But if you do and you aren’t tuning in to watch the NBA, you are missing out. It is a great game to begin with, but this year especially as it seems like the excitement level is at an all-time high.</p>
