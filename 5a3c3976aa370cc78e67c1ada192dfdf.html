<h1>Ohio Senate comes to defense of health director after judge rules she overstepped authority</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>COLUMBUS, Ohio — On the same day a state judge ruled that Ohio’s health director overstepped her authority when she extended her stay-at-home order that kept gyms shuttered to prevent spread of the coronavirus, the Ohio Senate came to the defense of Dr. Amy Acton by unanimously rejecting a House attempt to curb her powers.</p>
<p>Judge Eugene A. Lucci of Lake County Common Pleas Court issued a preliminary injunction on Wednesday preventing Dr. Acton and the Lake County Department of Health from enforcing the state’s requirement that gyms, recreation centers, fitness facilities, and similar entities remain closed. Under the judge’s ruling, the businesses would have to follow safety precautions similar to those imposed on other businesses already allowed to open.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen how much of an impact the ruling would have, given that Gov. Mike DeWine last week announced that such businesses may reopen on May 26 subject to social distancing, disinfection, and other mandates. For now, the ruling has no jurisdiction beyond Lake County and could still be subject to review by the local court of appeals and Ohio Supreme Court.</p>

<p>The judge’s ruling comes after a lawsuit was filed by the conservative 1851 Center for Constitutional Law on behalf of 35 independent gyms. A federal judge had recently rejected a similar lawsuit filed on behalf of a bridal shop, so the center shifted to a state court this time.</p>
<p>It also comes as a broad debate rages around the nation between those opposed to the social and economic restrictions intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus, and those who believe a return toward normal life is happening too quickly because of the ongoing threat presented by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Ohio as of Wednesday had recorded 29,436 cases of coronavirus, 1,781 deaths, and 5,198 hospitalizations. Lucas County public health officials on Wednesday reported 2,045 cases of the disease, and 204 deaths.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton in recent weeks has been the target of Ohioans — including many GOP lawmakers — who argue the state has overstepped its authority in shutting down portions of the economy and restricting the ability of people to travel and gather in groups.</p>
<p>Then on Wednesday, the Senate unanimously rejected an attempt by House Republicans to prevent Dr. Acton from signing any emergency health order lasting longer than 14 days absent approval by a legislative panel.</p>
<p>The health director language was added to Senate Bill 1. The bill, sponsored by Republican Sens. Rob McColley and Kristina Roegner, started out as a pre-coronavirus measure to reduce government regulations. Once it got to the house, lawmakers tacked on the provision about Dr. Acton’s authority.</p>
<p>“The House very quickly with no process took some amendments that didn’t really work right, put them in a bill, and just dropped it in our lap,” Senate President Larry Obhof, a Republican, told reporters after the vote to reject the amendment.</p>
<p>Republican Sen. Peggy Lehner, one of the state’s leading voices against abortion rights, provided a different explanation as to why she opposed the measure.</p>
<p>“It’s just really confusing me ... that personal liberty should be put ahead of life, because for years I and many of the sponsors of Senate Bill 1 and 311 have said we must put life first over and above personal liberty of any kind,” she said. “Suddenly, that argument has gone out the window.</p>
<p>“Now personal liberties are replacing the protection of life in the state of Ohio,” Ms. Lehner said. “I don’t get it. I can’t support it.”</p>
<p>She wore a mask while taking note that many of her colleagues were not.</p>
<p>Senate Bill 1 now goes to conference committee following the negative vote by senators on Wednesday.</p>
<p>While Mr. McColley voted with his Senate colleagues to reject the House amendments in Senate Bill 1, he has sponsored Senate Bill 311 that would separately enact restrictions on Dr. Acton’s authority, and would give local school districts the authority to hold graduations during the pandemic if they choose to do so.</p>
<p>After some major protests in recent weeks demanding the lifting of the stay-at-home order and its successors, a handful of protesters were present in the Statehouse when the vote took place. While not wearing masks as many legislators and state employees were, they carried signs. There were no outbursts or interruptions.</p>
<p>In his ruling on the gym lawsuit, Judge Lucci referenced many of the broad principles cited by such protesters. He found that plaintiffs are ultimately likely to prevail on their arguments that Dr. Acton, as a nonelected official, doesn’t have legal authority to shut down “nonessential” businesses for two months.</p>
<p>“The director has no statutory authority to close all businesses, including the plaintiff’s gyms, which she deems nonessential for a period of two months,” Judge Lucci wrote. “She has acted in an impermissibly arbitrary, unreasonable, and oppressive manner and without any procedural safeguards.”</p>
<p>Under state law, a violation of the stay-at-home order would be a second-degree misdemeanor punishable by up to 90 days in jail or a fine of up to $750.</p>
<p>Dr. Acton’s original stay-at-home order issued on March 20 initially ordered nonessential businesses to shut down until further notice. On April 30, she extended that order through May 29, although Mr. DeWine has since poked a lot of holes in it for restaurants, bars, manufacturers, retail stores, offices, child care, and other businesses. Gyms were added last week.</p>
<p>“Constitutions are written to prevent governments from arbitrarily interfering in citizens’ lives and businesses,” said Maurice Thompson, 1851 Center for Constitutional Law executive director. “On that front, the call to action is clear. The governor and health director may no longer impose their own closures and regulations and write their own criminal penalties to enforce those regulations and closures.”</p>
