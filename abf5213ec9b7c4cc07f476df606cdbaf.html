<h1>Bethel Parks teachers, WQED join on education program </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two Bethel Park educators have, for the past five years, been working with WQED and PBS Kids on educational programs in the classroom.</p>
<p>Their efforts led them to speak at the PBS Kids luncheon at the National Education Telecommunications Association Conference held in Washington, D.C., in January.</p>
<p>The partnership started about five years ago when WQED received a Ready to Learn grant from the state geared toward community engagement with schools.</p>
<p>WQED manager of education projects Cathy Cook approached Abraham Lincoln Elementary librarian Denice Pazuchanics and first grade teacher Dawn Douds about using PBS Kids’ science, technology, engineering and math (STEM) activities with their students. Ms. Cook’s children had attended Abraham Lincoln.</p>
<p>“They are the most magical, wonderful educators,” Ms. Cook said of Ms. Pazuchanics and Ms. Douds. “They’ve really created this wonderful engagement.”</p>
<p>Last spring, Ms. Pazuchanics and Ms. Douds, working with WQED, developed an after-school program focused on bringing children and families together.</p>
<p>The curriculum they were supposed to follow from PBS Kids wasn’t quite ready, so the pair developed their own family and community learning program focusing on the school’s onsite garden.</p>
<p>During four sessions last spring under the theme “eat, explore, play and share,” Abraham Lincoln students and their families had the opportunity to make worm composting bins, bird feeders, herb gardens and seed balls for planting. They then cooked using produce from the garden.</p>
<p>Ms. Douds said the sessions let the kids “experience things they might not normally do.”</p>
<p>“They’re outside in nature, getting dirty and learning from it.”</p>
<p>She added that the sessions also gave families a chance to meet each other.</p>
<p>“It forms its own little community,” she said.</p>
<p>In May, the growing season will start again in the Lincoln garden.</p>
<p>“Every student is involved in planting the garden,” Ms. Douds said.</p>
<p>The school donates much of the produce grown in the garden to South Hills Interfaith Movement’s food pantry.</p>
<p>“They love being in the garden,” Ms. Pazuchanics said. Students can also sign up to help care for the garden during the summer months.</p>
<p>It was the gardening activities that led the pair to speak at the PBS Kids luncheon.</p>
<p>PBS was so impressed by what Ms. Pazuchanics and Ms. Douds were doing with their students, that PBS Kids is set to adapt their curriculum for a nationwide rollout.</p>
<p>“It just turned into a beautiful thing,” Ms. Cook said of the partnership with the two teachers. “It’s been a really special project for WQED, and we are extremely thankful,” she said.</p>
