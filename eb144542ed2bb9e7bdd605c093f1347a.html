<h1>How Ben Cherington and the Pirates are preparing for the 2020 MLB draft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For all the uncertainty surrounding the 2020 MLB season, at least the details of the MLB draft seem close to being nailed down.</p>
<p>Of course, in the world of COVID-19, that still doesn’t mean things are set in stone.</p>
<p>In March, the MLB and MLB Players Association agreed to a deal which, among other things, will allow the 2020 draft to be shortened to as few as five rounds. Some have predicted it will be as many as 10 rounds. The draft is scheduled to take place in July, and there’s a pretty good chance it will be virtual, like the NFL draft was last weekend.</p>
<p>As far as the Pirates are concerned, though, that doesn’t change much. General manager Ben Cherington said on a conference call on Tuesday that his team are approaching it similar to past drafts even though there will obviously be some adjustments.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s virtual and our scouts aren’t in ballparks watching games,” Cherington said. “But, in terms of the conversation that’s happening, the way we’re diving into information and identifying questions that we still need to get answers on, going through the process of ranking players, etc. —&nbsp;we’ve had virtual calls the last couple weeks to get down into the first 200 players or so –- it’s very familiar, very similar, just in a virtual setting instead of the same room.&nbsp;As far as the prep, a lot of it is very similar.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main adjustment for scouts seems to be picking up information on prospects that isn’t as easily obtainable without college or high school games being played.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cherington said the Pirates’ scouts are cleared to interview potential prospects. They can ask about things that happened prior to the shutdown or, if the players have it, they can watch tape of games from February before things were halted.</p>
<p>“In terms of adding more game footage, whether it’s actual live scouting or video or additional game data that would normally be coming in at this time, while that’s not happening, what is happening is that that leaves a whole bunch of time to dig even deeper into the information that we do have. And that’s been a real focus on the calls that we’ve been having the last couple weeks,” Cherington said.</p>
<p>“That might include anything from, let’s say we had five or six scouts see a particular player. Well now, in theory, we could have our entire scouting department write reports on any player that we have video or data on, just by providing that information. It’s a different kind of scouting, but it is absolutely scouting and it’s evaluation and it’s additional inputs. And all those inputs will go into our process of ultimately ranking the players. We’re going to do that the best we possibly can to get to as precise a list as we possibly can.”</p>
<p>Cherington said he hopes to get in touch with some people from the Steelers to discuss some of the technical intricacies of drafting virtually, though he did note that there are, obviously, many differences between the MLB and NFL drafts.</p>
<p>The main gist, though, is that there will almost certainly be more clarity in the coming weeks as to how exactly the draft will go down. Until then, the Pirates are just doing the best they can with what they know now, approaching the situation with the intent of optimizing the draft — however it looks.</p>
<p>“Exactly what the draft looks like, we’ll just wait and see,” Cherington said. “We’ll get information from the league. The draft is one important event amongst many in a major league season. I think the league and ownership and the [MLBPA] will look at all of those events and decide what’s in the best interest of the industry in 2020. It’s obviously an important event for us. We need to prepare to make good selections. We’d always prefer the chance to make more selections than less. Whatever the number of rounds are, our job is going to be to execute on those, perform better than our competitors, no matter how many rounds there are.”</p>
