<h1>Pitt is big winner in state COVID-19 research money</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh on Thursday walked away with the lion’s share of $10 million in state grant money to develop COVID-19 therapies.</p>
<p>The university and its Center for Vaccine Research received a total of $1.6 million in grants, more than any of the other 23 entities statewide that received money. Pitt will use its two grants, which were announced by Gov. Tom Wolf, to further develop the university’s patented candidate COVID-19 vaccine.</p>
<p>Also receiving funding in Western Pennsylvania was Carnegie Mellon University, $643,359, to develop an inexpensive vaccination method using micro-needles; and UPMC’s Magee-Womens Research Institute and Foundation, $568,133, to develop a nasal spray that would prevent infection by the highly contagious virus that causes COVID-19.</p>
<p>The funding came from COVID-19 emergency appropriations to the state Department of Health and distributed through the state Department of Community and Economic Development’s Office of Technology and Innovation. Of the 23 projects funded, $6.8 million was awarded to 12 vaccine projects.</p>
<p>“The funding awarded today will jumpstart a number of promising projects that would help Pennsylvania overcome this devastating global pandemic, setting us on a path to recovery and protection both now and in the future,” Gov. Wolf said in a prepared statement.</p>
