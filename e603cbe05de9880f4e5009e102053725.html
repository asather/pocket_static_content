<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three Pittsburgh chefs were announced today as nominees for awards from the prestigious New York City-based James Beard Society.</p>
<p>Neil Blazin of Driftwood Oven in Lawrenceville is among 20 nationwide nominees for “Outstanding Pastry Chef” which is presented to “A pastry chef or baker who demonstrates exceptional skill, integrity, and character in the preparation of desserts, pastries, or breads served in a restaurant.”</p>
<p>A Beaver County-native, Mr. Blazin and business partner Justin Vetter opened Driftwood in 2018 to immediate acclaim for its sourdough breads and pizzas. That same year, Driftwood made Bon Appetit magazine’s top 50 nominees of America's Best New Restaurants.</p>
<p>Christian Frangiadis of Spork in Bloomfield and Wei Zhu of Chengdu Gourmet in Squirrel Hill were among nominees for Best Chef: Mid-Atlantic, for “Chefs who set high culinary standards and also demonstrate integrity and admirable leadership skills in their respective regions.”</p>
<p>This is Mr. Zhu’s fourth consecutive nomination for the bold cuisine of his home Chinese province of Sichuan, which he brought to Squirrel Hill in 2014.</p>
<p>This is the first nomination for Mr. Frangiadis, a veteran chef who worked in Pittsburgh in the 1990s and early 2000s before moving to the U.S. Virgin Islands, where he lived for roughly a decade and started a family before returning to Pittsburgh to open Spork in 2016, which has received accolades for its charcuterie, house-aged meats, house made pastas and tasting menus. Mr. Frangiadis also owns seasonal barbecue restaurant Spork Pit across the street in Garfield.</p>
<p>Mr. Frangiadis and Mr. Zhu are among 18 other nominees in Pennsylvania, Washington, D.C., Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia.</p>
<p>The Foundation will announce finalists at a press conference at 9 a.m., March 25 in Philadelphia.</p>
<p>Established in 1990, the James Beard Awards recognize culinary professionals for excellence and achievement in their fields and further the Foundation’s mission to celebrate, nurture, and honor chefs and other leaders making America's food culture more delicious, diverse, and sustainable for everyone.</p>
