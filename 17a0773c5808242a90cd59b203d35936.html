<h1>West End may see first new development in decades</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Zoning Board of Adjustment has paved the way for a residential and retail building that would be the first large-scale construction in the West End in many decades.</p>
<p>Red Rocks Group of Philadelphia plans to develop 116,000 square feet of vacant land into a five-story, 78-unit apartment building along South Main Street. It would have 2,850 square feet of street-level retail, with elevated parking on the ground floor for 60 cars.</p>
<p>The land has been a grassy lot for years. The Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, identifies it as a special flood hazard area.</p>
<p>Floodplain restrictions prohibit residential units at ground level.</p>
<p>Ethan Fellheimer, managing director of Red Rocks Group, said he requested additional height to build enough apartments above ground level to make the project economically viable. The interior parking would be on the first level, but raised.</p>
<p>FEMA spokesman Corey DeMuro said the hazard designation ties the land to the threat of a 100-year flood, or a 1% annual chance of flooding.&nbsp;She said FEMA sets minimum standards for floodplain regulation through the National Flood Insurance Program but that each municipality is responsible for its own regulations.</p>
<p>The city’s website stipulates that new construction, commercial and residential, in a flood plain “is required to be flood proofed or elevated 18 inches above the base flood elevation.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fellheimer said the West End’s location should make it a hot spot for growth.</p>
<p>“The West End is a charming little jewel, and this is the right time for this project.”</p>
<p>He said he will apply for a state Department of Environmental Protection permit, “and the minute I get it, I’ll be building.”</p>
<p>The zoning board approved variances for height above three stories and greater density in floor-to-area ratio. It approved a special exception and variance to allow for no rear building setbacks.</p>
<p>David Fromm, president of the West End Community Group, said the consensus among West Enders has been positive.</p>
<p>“Considering we are 1.2 miles from the city center, and literally the first bus stop out of the city or the last going into the city, we give residents a five-minute commute. We believe that we are the last undeveloped community so close to Downtown.</p>
<p>“At this point, we believe solving some of the problems in the West End would be to increase the population.”</p>
<p>Maria Joseph, head librarian of the Carnegie Library’s West End branch, said the developer met with two dozen people at the library&nbsp;before the zoning hearing in November. “For the most part, people felt positive,” she said. “The only grumbling was about parking” — that the plan calls for 18 fewer car spots than the number of units.</p>
<p>James Frederick, owner of James Gallery, said the feedback he has gotten is that “people are eager to see this.”</p>
