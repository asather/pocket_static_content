<h1>Gene Collier: Some first and final words about these 2020 Pirates</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite fairly profound obstacles, the time has arrived for the Steelers to begin that process Mike Tomlin likes to characterize hopefully as stacking wins.</p>
<p>Kickoff and the always enthralling first touchback of the season are set for Monday night, and with it the generally irreversible shift of Pittsburgh’s sports focus, such as it is.</p>
<p>But wait. I don’t think I’ve even commented, outside of the occasional effluvium of Twitter, on the truncated Pirates season still completing its prescribed death spiral. So before the pig bladder flies, let me humbly submit these observations into the record.</p>
<p>The Pirates of 2020 did not stack wins. Twice they won two in a row and once (the glory days), they managed three straight. So as of Friday, with 68 percent of their “season” completed, they were 7-27 when they weren’t stacking. They can’t hit to save themselves, don’t pitch well, play dreadful defense, and run the bases in a way I’d most generously describe as unprincipled. The game’s ancient scouting sages used to call all of that, “a tough way to play baseball.”</p>
<p>Interestingly, to this point, they’re 2-1 in seven-inning games, meaning that when the rules are closer to Little League, things improve dramatically for these Pirates. Probably very little of this is directly the fault of first-year manager Derek Shelton, but in just seven weeks, he’s been at the helm for a full season’s worth of high comedy.</p>
<p>His club scored its season-high of 13 runs in the same game that it yielded its season-high of 17 runs. He had a starting pitcher, Derek Holland, who was ejected from a game before he ever appeared in a game, then one of his starts started like this: homer, single, homer, homer, homer; he was behind 5-0 after 11 pitches. That was four days after Shelton sat out the first delay of its kind when a drone flew over the field in Minneapolis, the day on which headline writers showed heroic restraint for not rendering “Pirates Season Drones On.” My only mild criticism for Shelton is that when he sends “reliever” Dovydas Neverauskas to the mound, the manager doesn’t appear to see what’s happening.</p>
<p>Neverauskas came into a game this week with an earned run average of 7.07 and left with an earned run average of 8.40. Yet he retains the manager’s confidence, as do many of his everyday “hitters” who bat less than. 200, probably because Shelton dare not say out loud or even admit to himself what he’s seeing on a daily basis. He’s looking at a team that was 5-13 on the road at the weekend, 2-12 against the American League Central, and, in a 30-team baseball enterprise, ranked 29th in homers, 29th in slugging percentage, 28th in batting average, 29th in walks, 28th in stolen bases, 29th in OPS, and 30th in on-base percentage. Also, in 41 games, his starting pitchers had completed six innings four times.</p>
<p>The one reality the Pirates can’t hide from much longer is that Gregory Polanco is no longer a major league player. The saddest and perhaps most emblematic moment of the season unfolded Wednesday night with the Pirates all wearing No. 21 on Clemente Night. Polanco, wearing Clemente’s number and playing Clemente’s position, could not control an easy single to right, letting it run up his chest and get behind him to allow the batter to reach second and score seconds later.</p>
<p>Polanco was hitting .150 at the weekend, about 100 points below his pedestrian career average. It used to be an embarrassment if a big leaguer had more strikeouts than hits, and while that’s no longer so, Polanco had 48 strikeouts and 16 hits in 188 plate appearances.</p>
<p>The semi-official argument for not releasing him (other than his nearly $9 million guaranteed salary) is the denominator in the formula for determining exit velocity and launch angle. No, seriously. The denominator is something called a “batted ball event,” and I guess on a club that can strike out 16 times one night and get no-hit the next, a batted ball is indeed an event. In any case, Polanco’s exit velocity is apparently among the league’s best, meaning that he hits the ball hard.</p>
<p>Never mind that he rarely hits it, I guess.</p>
<p>I mentioned .150, right?</p>
<p>He was 1-for-his-last-18 as the Pirates opened a three-game series at Kansas City. No matter how hard he hits it when he hits it, no matter how hard the club’s broadcasters emphasize his winning smile and exemplary attitude, fans have begun to hope for a final stat on Polanco’s exit velocity out of town.</p>
<p>Players like Brian Reynolds and Josh Bell, who together with Polanco were to be the presumed heart of Shelton’s lineup, have not been much better than Polanco. Reynolds, who made a run at Rookie of the Year last summer, was hitting .181 at the weekend. On Wednesday night, he fouled a ball from out of the dirt.</p>
<p>Positives? Ummm. I guess catcher Jacob Stallings and infielder Erik Gonzalez look like useful players, but then last May, Bell looked like Willie Mays.</p>
<p>Still again, it’s hard to blame an entirely fresh management team before it earns a place along the arc of Pirates incompetence.</p>
<p>Past management once yearned to change the culture.</p>
<p>This one endeavors to crack the code.</p>
<p>I’ve suggest a more focused mantra: Stack some wins. And work backward into whatever is necessary toward that end.</p>
<p>The very real, very permanent obstacle, as no one has to be told, remains in the unwritten words on the organization’s fictional crest: Nutting Ventured, Nutting Gained.</p>
