<h1>Robert Morris AD talks NIL recommendations, department finances</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The words “name, image and likeness” might end up being as impactful on the landscape of college sports as the shot clock in basketball. For decades, the NCAA has reinforced the message that a scholarship was enough value for athletes.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/04/29/ncaa-paying-athletes-NIL-name-image-likeness-compensation-sonny-vaccaro/stories/202004290142" target="_blank">But that’s no longer the case</a>, with NCAA president Mark Emmert and the organization’s board of governors recently supporting new rules that would allow athletes to profit from their name, image and likeness.</p>
<p>University leaders such as Robert Morris’ Chris King are tasked with helping guide their schools through the potential new policies. King, who is winding down his first year as the Colonials’ AD, is cautiously optimistic that it’ll work out well.</p>
<p>“I’m a big believer in the amateur model, but I also believe in the student-athlete experience,” King said recently. “I do think that student-athletes should have the opportunity to utilize their name and likeness and image for those right projects. It would be no different than any general student would be able to do.”</p>
<p>There would be restrictions for athletes, of course.&nbsp;Payments would be regulated by a yet-to-be-determined body that ensures a “genuine” transaction. Agents will be regulated. Schools can’t use it as a recruiting inducement. Whatever payments an athlete receives would have to be consistent with what is considered fair market value.</p>
<p>Some have expressed concerns about the unintended consequence of jealousy among players. A star quarterback would, in theory, stand to make more money than a backup fullback. But both athletes are putting in work.</p>
<p>“Every team has a pecking order. ... How many interviews does Trevor Lawrence from Clemson do in comparison to an offensive lineman?” Robert Morris men’s basketball coach Andy Toole said. “Now it’ll manifest differently. How many times is the top player on a team used on a&nbsp;billboard versus the 10th man?”</p>
<p>Toole has an old school approach to solving what could be a new age problem.</p>
<p>“It happens with playing time. We tell our guys to work harder when they complain about playing time,” Toole said. “I don’t know if the conversation turns into if you’re not getting endorsements, then you’ve got to work harder. I’m not sure because nobody knows. There’s always a pecking order in locker rooms, and this will be a part of that.”</p>
<p>There will always be a hierarchy in every locker room. Some kids will come from money. Some will be poor.&nbsp;Athletes already manage economic differences. The new NCAA policy could be an opportunity for students to learn even more about the world they’ll enter after school.</p>
<p>“Teammates will understand. I think most guys will be happy for their teammates,” Toole said. “There will be guys with gripes. But they’ll have to make decisions on their own. It’s not much different than the workplace we’re preparing them to enter. There are hierarchies everywhere you go in life. This could prepare kids for it.”</p>
<p>What Toole and his program couldn’t prepare for this year, though, was having an NCAA tournament appearance canceled in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>The Colonials punched their ticket to the dance with a thrilling 77-67 victory March 11 against St. Francis at UPMC Events Center. Days later, March Madness was no more.</p>
<p>“I was in my driveway on Thursday around five o’clock when it came out that the tournament was canceled,” Toole said. “I was out there shooting around with my sons. When you get the word, it feels like the air is being knocked out of you.”</p>
<p>Toole said he moved quickly to contact his players once he received that crushing blow.</p>
<p>“The hard part is in the day and age as soon as you know, everyone else knows. As soon as you know you know your whole team knows,” Toole said.” There used to be a time when you could take solace in the fact that you could craft a message to your team. But in this they’re all in different places. The news is there, and it is real.”</p>
<p>The emotional damage was bad, but there was also a financial loss.&nbsp;King estimated the basketball team would’ve generated between $580,000 and $700,000 for the athletic department f the Colonials participated in the tournament.&nbsp;The Robert Morris women’s team won its own conference regular season title and was the No. 1 seed in the conference tournament before it was canceled after the quarterfinal round.</p>
<p>“We lost about $540,000 as part of our regular distribution,” King said. “It was cut by almost 70%. Then we would’ve received another $40,000 from the NEC. And then, if the men’s basketball team played in the play-in game and won, that we could have received up to another a hundred thousand dollars from the conference.”</p>
<p>The loss of spring sports offset the losses somewhat.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Altogether, King estimates the athletic department lost around $275,000.</p>
<p>“We didn’t have any of the spring travel expenses,” King said. “We didn’t have to pay for officials or game-day expenses. Not having all of those costs helped balance things.”</p>
<p>Robert Morris offers 15 varsity sports (six men’s, nine women’s). Some universities have announced the elimination of programs due to the pandemic, though Robert Morris isn’t considering following suit, according to a university spokesman, in part because eliminating a sport could put their Division I status in peril.&nbsp;NCAA rules stipulate that Division I schools must offer at least 14 sports: seven for men and seven for women, or six for men and eight for women.</p>
<p>That lack of travel has had a direct impact on Toole and the basketball program, not to mention others. The staff would generally be on the road about now, trying to find the next group of Colonial athletes. Instead, Toole is at home like everyone else until the outside is fully open again.</p>
<p>“It’s been a challenge. We’d be on the road by now and evaluating guys for the 2021 class,” Toole said. “There are two sides to it. There’s an opportunity to find somebody that nobody else has seen, if you’ve done a good job of prospecting.”</p>
