<h1>Brewdog opens its Pittsburgh 'Outpost'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BrewDog Pittsburgh opening Friday on Centre Avenue in East Liberty has 24 taps of beer. Some of it will be made in house at this&nbsp;“taproom and mini production facility” -— by brewer Paul Young, formerly of Homestead’s Enix Brewing Co.</p>
<p>Some brews will come from BrewDog USA’s headquarters brewery in Canal Winchester, just this side of Columbus, Ohio, and some will come from BrewDog breweries in the United Kingdom and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And four of them will come from breweries in and around Pittsburgh and Pennsylvania, as the Scotland-based multinational corporation says it wants to be a good local neighbor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This BrewDog is one of its many far-flung outposts and was to be its first official&nbsp;“Outpost” location in the U.S., <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/08/30/BrewDog-USA-East-Liberty-Pittsburgh-brewpub-Outpost-beer-Centre-Avenue/stories/201908300036" target="_blank">it announced here</a>&nbsp;this past summer. One in Indianapolis opened first, but its brewing setup is really small and “educational,” so, “This is the one,” said Jon Quick, BrewDog USA’s head of retail, as he and other bustled to get the new space open.</p>
<p>Its 5-barrel system — open to customers’ view — won’t be commissioned until next week or so. (“I can’t wait!” said Mr. Young, as he bustled, too.) But there will be on tap on Friday some Yinzer Pale Ale, a 4.12% (get it?) alcohol by volume brew that is to be a staple here. Mr. Young traveled to U.S. headquarters recently to brew the first batch, which was trucked here, along with a wide range of others, including two alcohol-free ones.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Eventually, Pittsburgh brews will be sent to other BrewDogs (it has two bars in Columbus and one in Cincinnati in its total of 100 bars and four big breweries) and will be marketed to other bars here, and Mr. Young wants to do collaborations with other breweries. Beer will be available to take out in cans, bottles, growlers and, eventually, crowlers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The BrewDog U.S. HQ brewery includes a sour facility, huge restaurant, museum and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/drinks/2019/01/21/DogHouse-hotel-BrewDog-brewery-Columbus-Ohio/stories/201810210002" target="_blank">dog-friendly hotel, the DogHouse</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dogs will be welcome on the outdoor patio of the Pittsburgh location, but not inside, because the place will be serving a menu of&nbsp;“elevated bar food” including burgers, tacos and wings, including BrewDog’s signature Cauliflower Wings, plus small plates, sides, salads and desserts. Mr. Quick notes that the company is open to food collaborations, too. The drinks menu includes cider, spirits and wine.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The new Pittsburgh location seats 130 inside (where the decor includes three pinball machines and a gnarly jellyfish mural by company artist Plague Fisher) and 70 more outside, and will blur those lines in nice weather when it can throw open five garage doors. The front door opens at 11 a.m. Friday and the first 100 guests&nbsp;get raffle prizes including a $200 BrewDog gift card, a branded beer fridge, a branded bike and other merchandise and a two-night stay at the DogHouse. True to its self-styled punk ethos, the company says it will offer&nbsp;the first three raffle winners who want one a free BrewDog shield tattoo, which will get them a lifelong 20% discount on beer at BrewDog bars across the globe.</p>
<p>Local&nbsp;“equity punks,” part of a community of 125,000 people who’ve invested via crowdfunding in the otherwise-privately-held BrewDog, were to get a chance to hang out at the new location Thursday night before it opens to the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>BrewDog Pittsburgh is at 6144 Centre Ave.,&nbsp;Pittsburgh, PA 15206. Learn more at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.brewdog.com/usa/bars/us/pittsburgh/" target="_blank">www.brewdog.com/usa/bars/us/pittsburgh</a>.&nbsp;</p>
