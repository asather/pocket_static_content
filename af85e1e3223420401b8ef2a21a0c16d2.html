<h1>Analysis: What we know — and don’t — about Pirates closer Keone Kela</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Nobody has a definitive answer for why Pirates closer Keone Kela has been absent from spring training 2.0 since it started July 3.</p>
<p>But we do know a few things that are probably worth mentioning at this point.</p>
<p>Some involve precedent. Others — brought forth independent of Kela and whether or not he tested positive for COVID-19 because we truly do not know — speak to the tricky nature of testing and problems Major League Baseball might encounter the entire season.</p>
<p>So let’s work through them, starting with the move the Pirates made to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/17/Pirates-Keone-Kela-injured-list-closer-Opening-Day-Crick-Burdi/stories/202007170088" target="_blank">place Kela on the 10-day injured list</a> last Thursday — again, with no reason given.</p>
<p>Two days later, manager Derek Shelton said infielders Kevin Newman and JT Riddle were a little “dinged up” and have been limited in their physical activity. And before the exhibition game Saturday against the Indians, the Pirates announced <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2020/07/18/Luke-Maile-Pirates-baseball-catcher-MLB-finger-surgery/stories/202007180073" target="_blank">catcher Luke Maile had surgery</a> for a fractured right index finger and would miss between 10 and 12 weeks.</p>
<p>Asked July 8 about his club’s injury situation, Shelton offered this: “We’re dealing with some minor things. Nothing that I think would put [Pirates director of sports medicine] Todd [Tomczyk] in front of you guys right yet, but we definitely have dealt with some things.”</p>
<p>The lack of information on Kela would seem to rule out the possibility of an injury, no?</p>
<p>We also have two similar cases to compare — Gregory Polanco and Ke’Bryan Hayes.</p>
<p>Whenever Shelton was asked if those two had been working out, the manager said “no” and nothing more. The exchange was awkward. Shelton was truthful but not terribly revealing. Shelton also added that there was nothing he could say.</p>
<p>It’s been the same way with Kela, the last one of those coming Friday after Polanco had tested positive for COVID-19. “No,” Shelton said, there was no reason he could provide for Kela’s absence.</p>
<p>So does that mean Kela had or has COVID-19? It’s possible, but we don’t know for sure.</p>
<p>But for the sake of argument, let’s examine the COVID-19 route and see if there’s anything here that might be reasonable.</p>
<p>If a normal resident tests positive for COVID-19, a two-week quarantine would follow. Say the symptoms are mild or non-existent. By the end of those two weeks, that person doesn’t need to be tested again. They’re likely going to move on.</p>
<p>In baseball, it’s different. For those who’ve had a positive test, they need to produce two negative tests within a 24-hour window to begin the process of rejoining their teammates. (They also need to have an EKG and a physical.)</p>
<p>Again, for the sake of argument, say Kela did test positive for COVID-19 whenever he arrived at PNC Park for intake testing. (And Shelton did say that all 40 players arrived in Pittsburgh before the start of camp.)</p>
<p>The first round of testing was July 1. Assuming a 48-hour turnaround on Kela’s results, 14 days would have fallen this past Friday.</p>
<p>So, where’s Kela?</p>
<p>If his absence is COVID-related, there could be a very good reason, and it would involve both testing and something completely out of Kela’s control.</p>
<p>Just because someone had COVID-19 and is no longer exhibiting symptoms doesn’t mean the virus is completely out of their body.</p>
<p>According to Oh Myoung-don, a Seoul National University hospital doctor, dead virus fragments caused more than 260 South Koreans <a href="http://m.koreaherald.com/amp/view.php?ud=20200429000724" target="_blank">to test positive days and weeks</a> after they had recovered from the virus.</p>
<p>“The tests detected the ribonucleic acid of the dead virus,” Oh said during an April 30 press conference at the National Medical Center in South Korea.</p>
<p>In normal society, with these dead fragments not being contagious, it’s not a huge deal. But when you have to pass back-to-back tests, it could turn into an issue.</p>
<p>Oh also explained that in PCR (polymerase chain reaction) tests, what’s examined can appear bigger during tests, whether it’s from the live virus or parts of dead cells that sometimes take months to go away. The inability of a test to distinguish live from dead could produce false positives.</p>
<p>If this would happen, the subject’s test results would likely be mixed, although they would not show symptoms or be required in normal society to quarantine. It’s a strange sort of middle ground. Also, it bears repeating that we don’t know for sure whether Kela had the virus in the first place.</p>
<p>If the test was picking up ribonucleic acid and the inconsistent results continued, it’s likely that doctors from all sides would have to come together and declare that Kela was healthy and able to return.</p>
<p>But as of now, with opening day approaching, there’s not much we’re able to say for sure. Only that this probably can’t and won’t continue for much longer.</p>
