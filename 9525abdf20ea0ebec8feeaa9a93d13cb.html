<h1>The year Billy Porter ruled the fashion world</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>“What will Billy Porter wear?” is a common refrain heard before red-carpet events these days.</p>
<p>2019 was the year that Porter ruled the fashion world — the Pittsburgh native was the No. 1 search in the category of ”People on the Red Carpet,” according Google.&nbsp;He upstaged Cardi B and Lady Gaga, who were No. 2 and No. 3, respectively. And he has showed no signs of slowing down in 2020.</p>
<p>Porter, who first made a red-carpet splash at last year’s Golden Globe Awards, has been on a fashion roll that includes the Met Gala in May, where he arrived as a Sun God, in head-to-toe gold by The Blonds, David and Phillipe, via a litter carried by six shirtless men. Vogue’s headline declared, “Billy Porter Just Made the Most Fabulous Entrance in Met Gala History.”</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette asked Sam Ratelle, his stylist — who also runs his social media accounts&nbsp;— about the star’s fashion ethos.</p>
<p>Ratelle spoke by phone before Porter’s big 2020 Golden Globes red-carpet reveal: He was decked out in an all-white tux that sparkled with 4,000 Swarovski crystals and a yards-long, zipped-on feather train. <a href="https://www.allure.com/story/billy-porter-art-issue-cover-interview" target="_blank">He followed up by making a splash as the first male to grace the cover of Allure for the magazine’s February 2020 issue.</a></p>
<p>The big cover reveal came Jan. 9 on&nbsp;“Good Morning America,” where Porter said,&nbsp;“I want to have a conversation about what it means to be a man. And that’s about humanity.”</p>
<p>He spoke of growing up in an atmosphere of toxic masculinity — Porter was a Pittsburgher from birth through Carnegie Mellon University, before he was off to New York and Broadway — and of finally freeing himself to be his authentic self. Being in&nbsp;“Kinky Boots,” which earned him Tony and Grammy awards in 2013, further released him, Porter said.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.allure.com/story/first-man-allure-cover" target="_blank">Allure editor in chief Michelle Lee, in her introduction to the issue</a>, explains, “Great art connects emotionally. It makes you think. It takes risks. One person who seems like the living embodiment of that is our cover star, Billy Porter. In all of its 29 years and 345 issues, Allure has never featured a man on its cover — until today. So I’m thrilled to have the ‘Pose’ star as our first.”</p>
<p>Porter’s style is a testament to the concept that clothes do not make the man, Ratelle said. It’s the man wearing them. Their partnership is strategic, and they consider everything from Porter’s Pittsburgh roots in the Pentecostal church, where his stylish Aunt Dorothy was known for her hats, to his Broadway career.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The red carpet is the stage to me, and that’s how we see it,” Ratelle said. “He really tells a story with that garment, and not everyone can do that.”</p>
<p>Every time Porter is out and about, Ratelle is sure to not only post photos on social media but also to give credit to every designer represented.&nbsp;Porter has worked with up-and-coming designers such as Sergio Guadarrama, who is a contestant on the current season of “Project Runway.”</p>
<p>“We’ll always work with emerging designers, but he’s never worn Chanel before, he’s never worn Georgio Armani,” Ratelle noted.” We really want to collaborate with these houses we’ve never had access to. And sometimes it’s just logistical … he still hasn’t been to Paris fashion week or Milan, which is going to be very new to us and something we hope to do in the next two years. I think now the doors have opened in a different way, and everyone’s willing to have a conversation.”</p>
<p>Here’s Ratelle with more on Porter’s 2019 style and some peeks into the future for their stylish collaboration.</p>
<p><strong>The Oscars</strong></p>
<p>For Porter, there is Before the Oscars, and After the Oscars.</p>
<p>Before the Oscars, he made fashion waves and drew particular attention to his pink-lined, bejeweled cape at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards, and his fashion status got a big boost when he was named the one and only ambassador for New York Fashion Week men's shows. But it was Feb. 24, 2019, on the red carpet of the 91st Academy Awards, that he vaulted to the fashion story of the year.</p>
<p>It all started with the now-iconic, gender-fluid tuxedo gown created by Christian Siriano with two weeks to spare — right after Porter was named a red-carpet interviewer for ABC. He didn’t try on the outfit, which featured a traditional tux on top and ballgown from the waist down, until hours before the ceremony.</p>
<p>There was a controversial Best Picture win for “Green Book” that Oscars night, but the spotlight was shared by Porter, who went on to win an Emmy for his role as the drag ball emcee Pray Tell on the FX drama “Pose.” He was the first openly gay black male to win a best actor Emmy, and he may have been the first to accept the award wearing a couture hat, an asymmetrical cowboy hat by his frequent milliner, Stephen Jones, to top off a crystal-encrusted pinstripe Michael Kors suit and a knee-length black scarf.</p>
<p>“I don’t think we understood the power of that moment. That’s when you get surprised. When Google released its research that said the biggest red-carpet search was “Billy Porter, red carpet?” That’s crazy! Out of trillions of searches around the world, for us to be No. 1? Have a direct-to-commerce lineage where we can track that? That’s impressive!</p>
<p>I’ve been doing this for 13 years, but I think, especially in the digital age, when things are changing every month, nothing prepares you for that.”</p>
<p><strong>The Moment</strong></p>
<p>“The Met Gala was a moment that, after going through the Oscars, you understand that frenzy. … So we went into it with more calmness and joy. Because the Oscars were so fast … that later you’re like, ‘What just happened?’ At the Met Gala we were able to experience it and enjoy it, kind of like a performer. That’s what made it so much better. It was theater.”</p>
<p><strong>Hats</strong></p>
<p>“It’s foundationally authentic. .... He will say, ‘I love clothes. I’ve been loving clothes since I was a child. His family in Pittsburgh didn’t have a lot of money, so they made everything with patterns. I think going to church, he always speaks about how Sunday was a fashion show for him, including the best hats. It really is an homage to his Aunt Dorothy, who he speaks about often as a very stylish lady who wore hats. It’s really an homage and a reminder -- and he’s doing that with music, too -- that he comes from the black church.</p>
<p>“It really is authentically who he is, and we go back to it all the time. I don’t think visually in pop culture we see that authenticity. What’s fascinating to me -- I love it when he’s a church lady -- is having the courage and freedom to do that. It’s so seamless, it doesn’t even seem different to me, because it’s very pure and authentic to who he is.</p>
<p>“Oh, getting back to hats … working with milliners, that’s something I love about him. He really wants to know the intricacies of things. … How hatmaking works is really exciting to him because he already loved hats from being around his family.</p>
<p>“For me to work with someone like [milliner] Stephen Jones is such a dream. Having someone being so welcoming to you is such a magnificent feeling.”</p>
<p><strong>Shoes</strong></p>
<p>“We’re starting to work with specific shoe companies now, Jimmy Choo and Sandra Choi, who’s just a brilliant, brilliant human. The Thom Browne team has been amazing in regard to footwear; everything they do is really cohesive but just looking at the pieces on their own, if you study shoe design, they are just magnificent and futuristic in a mindset that exudes this kind of work.</p>
<p>“[If there’s a drawback,] Billy is not generally a guy that has a lot of shoe options, so one of the things we keep talking about is creating a shoe line in the near future. ... Right now we are welcoming all shoemakers, but it’s a broader discussion: Why are there these limitations? I mean shoes, we all walk in them. Why can’t we just have a universal size?”</p>
<p><strong>Signature collection?</strong></p>
<p>“He certainly wants to figure out how strategic it’s going to be, because he thinks ahead and he’s very careful. He wants to do it right. I think when the right moment comes, it will happen.</p>
<p>“He’s really, really invested. Fashion is part of who he is. Take a look at someone like Victoria Beckham. It might have seemed unexpected back in the [Spice Girls] day, but when you look at her work, it’s completely true to who she is. … She’s an incredible designer and creative director, and I see that in Billy. I see him having a successful, artistic, individualistic brand that caters to a group of people who will champion that and want the kind of designs he is going to work on.”</p>
<p><strong>Seated next to Anna Wintour at runway shows …</strong></p>
<p>“It’s beyond. I will say it speaks a lot about manifesting, about speaking into life. He and I are both very like that. When we met, I was like, ‘You’re going to be an A-list star and have a million followers within a year.’ And he didn’t believe me. He said that recently. It’s crazy how all these things can come true when you set the intention to do good, to do service and be authentic and make it about that work. That’s been very enlightening, but sometimes we have to pinch ourselves because we can’t believe all that’s happening.”</p>
