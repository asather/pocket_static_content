<h1>National briefs: Judge calls Barr's handling of Mueller report 'distorted' and 'misleading'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Thursday sharply criticized Attorney General William Barr’s handling of the report by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, saying that Mr. Barr put forward a “distorted” and “misleading” account of its findings and lacked credibility on the topic.</p>
<p>Judge Reggie Walton said Mr. Barr could not be trusted and cited “inconsistencies” between his statements about the report when it was secret and its actual contents that turned out to be more damaging to President Donald Trump. Judge Walton said Mr. Barr’s “lack of candor” called “into question Attorney General Barr’s credibility and, in turn, the department’s” assurances to the court.</p>
<p>The judge ordered the Justice Department to privately show him the portions of the report that were censored in the public version so he could independently verify the justifications. The ruling came in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit seeking a full-text version of the report.</p>
<p>“It would be disingenuous for the court to conclude that the redactions of the Mueller Report pursuant to the FOIA are not tainted by Attorney General Barr’s actions and representations,” wrote Walton, a 2001 appointee of President George W. Bush.</p>
<p>A Justice Department spokeswoman had no immediate comment. The case centers on requests by the Electronic Privacy Information Center and by Jason Leopold, a BuzzFeed News reporter.</p>
<p>Mr. Barr’s public rollout of the Mueller report has been widely criticized. He issued an initial four-page letter he issued in March 2019, two days after receiving the 381-page document, that purported to summarize its principal conclusions. But Mr. Mueller himself sent letters to Mr. Barr protesting that he had distorted its findings and asking him to swiftly release the report’s own summaries. Instead, Mr. Barr made the report public only weeks later after a fuller review to black out sensitive material.</p>
<p><strong>Former UAW chief charged with misusing union funds</strong></p>
<p>DETROIT — A former president of the United Auto Workers has been charged with embezzlement of union funds and other crimes, the biggest step yet in a broad investigation of financial wrongdoing that the prosecutor said could justify a federal takeover of the union.</p>
<p>In a criminal filing unsealed Thursday, the former official, Gary Jones, is accused of misusing more than $1 million of union money for extravagant meals, golf outings, cigars and apparel over several years, even before he was elected president in 2018.</p>
<p>He is the highest-ranking UAW official to be prosecuted in the inquiry, in which more than a dozen people have been charged. Among them are three former Fiat Chrysler executives, including the company’s chief negotiator with the union.</p>
<p>Mr. Jones resigned as UAW president Nov. 20 after the union’s executive board found he had submitted false and misleading expense records and took steps to oust him. His home in Canton, Mich., had been raided in August by agents from the FBI.</p>
<p><strong>Abuse allegations, calls for state inquiry build in Michigan</strong></p>
<p>YPSILANTI, Mich. — More men came forward Thursday with allegations of sexual abuse by a late doctor at the University of Michigan, as the state’s attorney general insisted that the school must commit to cooperating with her office before she would move to begin an independent investigation.</p>
<p>The new allegations include four men who filed lawsuits against the school saying that Dr. Robert Anderson sexually assaulted them while they were members of the football, hockey and wrestling teams in the 1980s. At a news conference, two others said Anderson molested them during medical exams.</p>
<p>The university, located in Ann Arbor, revealed last month that it was investigating multiple allegations of abuse against Anderson, who died in 2008. Last week, it said it had received more than 100 complaints.</p>
<p>The lawsuits accuse the university of failing to remove Anderson despite multiple complaints about him.&nbsp;</p>
