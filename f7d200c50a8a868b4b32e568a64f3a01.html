<h1>K-9 officers and their partners graduate from training</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>No one played&nbsp;“pomp and circumstance,” but it was a graduation ceremony, nonetheless, as five big dogs and their partners marked the end of three months of training and the start of careers as K-9 officers on Friday.</p>
<p>“Thank you for taking the dogs and making them your partners,” Pittsburgh Police Chief Scott Schubert told the two-legged officers, before he handed out the diplomas.&nbsp;“It’s really a 24/7 job. It’s a job that not everyone can do.”</p>
<p>Two of the teams work for Pittsburgh police, two for Butler City Police and one for the Lawrence County Sheriff’s Department. All worked with Pittsburgh officers and trainers at the city’s K-9 Training Academy on Washington Boulevard.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Three of the dogs are Belgian Malinois: K-9 Shadow with Pittsburgh Officer Kevin Foley; K-9 Miky with Pittsburgh Officer Matt Schwartzmiller; and K-9 Chooch with Butler Lt. Brian Grooms.</p>
<p>Two are German shepherds: K-9 Rico with Butler Patrolman Andrew Niederlander and K-9 Baki with Lawrence County Sheriff’s Deputy John Baldelli.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>All of the dogs were bred, born and raised in Europe. They generally come from the Czech Republic, the Netherlands and Germany, said Sgt. William Watts, one the trainers for this K-9 class.</p>
<p>An audience of spouses, children and fellow officers watched as each man-and-dog team walked up to Chief Schubert to get their graduation diploma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each leashed dog wagged his tail and walked nicely on the left side of their officer/handler.</p>
<p>“Baki is very vocal,” noted Sgt. Watts as the German shepherd made noises and sounds that were closer to talking than growling. He also barked a time or two.</p>
<p>Spectators “ooh-ed” as Rico gamely walked the graduation walk with a slight limp due to a cast on his left rear leg.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A training accident,” explained Sgt. Watts. The leg has a fracture, but surgery was not required and Rico is expected to work in about a month.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tiny Grace Schwartzmiller hugged 90-pound Miky after the ceremony. The 1-year-old, red-haired girl&nbsp;“is obsessed with Miky,” said her mother, Allison.</p>
<p>All of the dogs trained to protect and serve while on duty go home at the end of their shift to live with the officer’s family.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The partnership between officers and K-9 dogs&nbsp;“is based on trust and it’s based on love,” Sgt. Watts said,&nbsp;“and we ask these officers to take these dogs into harm’s way.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich said the K-9s “are probably the best employees in public safety. They never complain and they eat less than the horses.&nbsp;Sometimes&nbsp; they give their lives to protect their officers and to protect the public.”</p>
<p>Chief Schubert said “Sometimes officers have to put their (dog) partner at risk.That’s something that is not often looked at.”</p>
<p>The dogs and their partners trained all day, five days per week for three months. Every month the Pittsburgh K-9 teams will train for 16 hours, in two 8-hour shifts.</p>
