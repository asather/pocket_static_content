<h1>Steelers announce Heinz Field safety protocols for fans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>We now know the details of the Steelers’ plan to welcome fans back to Heinz Field for their game Sunday against Philadelphia.</p>
<p>The team announced protocols Thursday that will be in effect, as up to 5,500 fans will be permitted to attend the matchup following Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision earlier in the week to relax limits on gatherings in large venues amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Those with tickets should load them on their phones before the game. Only mobile tickets will be accepted at the Heinz Field gate. All ticket holders within a given group must sit together, and fans are advised to use the entrance closest to their designated section in order to reduce interaction between fans sitting in different parts of the building.</p>
<p>Face masks will be required for all fans. Alcohol sales will be limited to contactless food purchases. Bathrooms, likewise, will largely be touchless, and points of contact throughout the stadium will be reduced. Hand sanitizer stations will be available as well, and fans are expected to maintain physical distancing of at least six feet from those outside their groups.</p>
<p>Gates will open at 11:30 a.m. for the 1 p.m. game, and the stadium’s normal clear bag policy will be in effect. Parking lots will open at 11 a.m., and no tailgating will be permitted.</p>
<p>The Steelers also ask that fans evaluate themselves before leaving for the game by checking their temperatures.</p>
