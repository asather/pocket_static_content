<h1>Film study: A second look at James Conner’s tough day</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>James Conner played 15 snaps against the Giants on Monday night before he exited with an ankle injury, but his play before he left the game should be of great concern for the Steelers. And it’s yet another reason why second-year back Benny Snell will be in line for more carries no matter what Conner’s status is Sunday afternoon against the Broncos.</p>
<p>In three series, Conner managed nine yards on six carries and caught two passes for eight yards. But there was more to his subpar outing than his final stat line. He made a couple of other uncharacteristic mistakes that contributed to the offense’s slow start.</p>
<p>On a third-and-5 on the first series of the game, Conner had a poor effort in pass protection that almost resulted in a turnover when he had to recover a lateral from Roethlisberger that glanced off his hands.</p>
<p>Conner, who is usually stout as a pass protector, had to block cornerback Darnay Holmes, who was blitzing off the edge. Conner outweighs Holmes by 35 pounds and should have been able to easily handle him. It’s a block he’s made a hundred times in his career.</p>
<p>But instead of standing up and taking on Holmes with good technique he instead threw his shoulder Holmes, who easily got around him and almost sacked Roethlisberger before he attempted the lateral. Conner’s weak attempt at blocking Holmes was a real head-scratcher considering the size mismatch.</p>
<p>Things got even worse after that. On the next series, the timing with right guard Stefen Wisniewski was poor on a screen pass, and they bumped into each other as Roethlisberger’s pass fell incomplete at his feet. Later on the drive, Conner was dropped for a 1-yard loss. Visibly upset, he gestured toward the sidelines demonstrating his displeasure with something. After a 2-yard run he pointed for Snell to enter for the third-down play.</p>
<p>Conner came out with the starters for one more series. On first down, he dropped a pass from Roethlisberger in the flat. He was stopped for a 1-yard gain on second down and subbed out for Jaylen Samuels on third down. He didn’t come back in the game after that.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Snell came on for the next series, and the Steelers scored a touchdown. He was the primary back for the remainder of the game and had 113 yards on 19 carries, a 5.9 yards-per-carry average compared to Conner’s 1.5 yards-per-carry average.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Tomlin said Conner’s ankle injury occurred “in the early portion of the game”, but it was not evident when the injury happened. Tomlin also said the uncertainty about how the Giants would play the Steelers also factored into Conner’s performance though it does little to explain the physical mistakes he made.</p>
<p>Even if Conner gets healthy for the Broncos game, Snell earned the right for more playing time.</p>
<p>“We’re confident in whoever it may be,” quarterback Ben Roethlisberger said Wednesday morning. “I’m really proud of the way Benny stepped up and filled in for James. He ran the ball hard, picked up some blitzes. We’re confident in whoever has to go in there that they’ll step up.”</p>
<p><strong>Protection problems</strong></p>
<p>Zach Banner’s season-ending knee injury not only leaves the Steelers short-handed at tackle for the remainder of this season, but it casts doubt on who will be playing tackle for them in 2021.</p>
<p>Banner, who earned the right tackle job this summer, is set to become an unrestricted free agent in March, as is veteran left tackle Alejandro Villanueva. Both struggled against the Giants. They each gave up a sack and struggled to keep Roethlisberger clean early in the game. (Other than Matt Feiler, who was making his first start at left guard, no one on the line had a particularly good game.)</p>
<p>Villanueva’s play, especially in the first three quarters, had to be particularly unnerving for the coaches. He is tasked with protecting Roethlisberger’s blindside, and the Giants edge rushers got steady pressure against him. He was bull-rushed with success and beaten around the edge with finesse moves. He was fortunate not to allow multiple sacks in the game.</p>
<p>Given the salary cap limitations next year, combined with his age and declining play, it’s probably Villanueva’s last season with the Steelers.</p>
<p>Banner is a different story. The Steelers obviously liked his progression this summer because he earned the starting job after a competition with Chukwuma Okorafor in training camp. In an odd way, the injury could help the Steelers retain Banner.</p>
<p>It’s hard to envision a scenario where an opposing team would offer big money to a player who is coming off major knee surgery. Most ACL injuries require nine months of rehab, which would put Banner on track for a mid-June return.</p>
<p>Banner’s best bet to become a starter again is likely with the Steelers.</p>
<p>If there is a bit of good news, it’s that the Steelers have 15 games and possibly more to evaluate Okorafor. If he plays well enough, they might think about moving him to left tackle in 2021, which would open the door for keeping Banner at right tackle, if he recovers from his injury.</p>
<p>“Injuries always concern you, especially when it’s the guys protecting you,” Roethlisberger said. “We have confidence Chuks will do the job. We’ll need Chuks to step up. He has playing experience. We’ll expect him to do great things.”</p>
<p>If Okorafor doesn’t play well, then the Steelers are going to have to invest a high draft pick to address the position next year. They might do that anyway.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Dealing with the no-huddle</strong></p>
<p>One play can turn the complexion of any football game and Cam Heyward’s interception late in the third quarter certainly did that for the Steelers. The Giants held the ball for almost nine minutes and ran 19 plays on their opening drive of the second half, keeping the Steelers off balance and tired with their no-huddle offense.</p>
<p>On second-and-3 from the 4-yard line, Giants quarterback Daniel Jones scrambled to his left under heavy pressure from Bud Dupree and threw the ball into a sea of Steelers. Heyward jumped into the air and secured the first interception of his career.</p>
<p>“They just kept pacing us to get us out of rhythm,” Heyward said. “We have to learn form that. The thing we can learn from that is we can bend but we can’t break. And when the ball is in our hands we have to make sure we get the picks.”</p>
<p>The Giants certainly had their way with the Steelers on that drive utilizing their no-huddle offense, but it was so unsuccessful in the first half that it was surprising they went back to it to open the second half.</p>
<p>In the first half, the Giants gained just 20 yards on 11 plays out of the no-huddle. Of their 64 offensive plays in the game, they operated out of the no-huddle 38 times and gained just 118 yards (3.1 yards per play). The Steelers forced them into seven negative plays when they went without a huddle.</p>
