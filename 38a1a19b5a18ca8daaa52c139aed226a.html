<h1>Brian Batko's Steelers chat transcript: 07.20.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You have questions about whether NFL training camps, let alone the season, will start on time. I don't have those answers, and neither does the league or its players. But we can chat and speculate on it all the same. Welcome!</p>
<p><strong>pdxJaxon</strong>: Morning Bats - Im starting to really think this season is going to be compromised.<br> The players dont seem too convinced that the NFL is really prepared with a plan.<br> I know you're not Nostradamus, but any changing consensus with the chances of Season being put on hold? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good afternoon, now. The season may well be compromised in some way, shape or form, but that doesn't mean it'll be scuttled completely. I actually think the NFL does have a fairly thorough plan, just not one that has satisfied its most significant party to this point: the players. But then again, this is how bargaining works. The league starts out way over here, the NFLPA way over there, and perhaps they're slowly working their way towards the middle, despite how little time they have left.</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Is it more likely that established stars with plenty of money in the bank will opt out this season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's probably more likely than middle-of-the-pack guys or back-of-the-roster types who need the money, yes. But I still don't think it's particularly likely. I'm not too doom and gloom on the odds of football happening just yet. Too much money at stake for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>John D</strong>: Where is Gerry Dulac? Haven't seen anything from him in a few weeks, <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Gerry is in a highly classified, undisclosed location preparing for the upcoming 2020 season. If I tell you more, I'll have black helicopters flying over my house.<br> <br> OR Gerry is just on vacation and was covering golf last week before that. That's all I can say.</p>
<p><strong>SoCalSteelers</strong>: Hi Brian, thanks for doing these chats, I look forward to them weekly. Did you happen to see some of the Steelers madden ratings? I'm not usually one to comment on these types of things but TJ Watt ranked at 86, Minkah ranked at 87, and Bud at 80 seems insane to me while JJ Watt maintains his 98 and Von Miller 97...Thoughts? <br> <strong>SoCalSteelers</strong>: and if you care, these are the players above Fitz, this one is a real shocker, not sure I'd trade Mikah for any of these guys on the list</p>
<p><br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: To be honest, I haven't even purchased a new gaming console since Playstation 2, let alone kept up with Madden in that time. But yeah, it does seem to me that the Steelers didn't get much love this year in the game's ratings, which is surprising given how well the defense played collectively last year and allt he individual accolades that came along with that. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Also, I don't have to be a video game expert to agree with all of those who think it's bizarre that Rob Gronkowski is rated a 95 in his comeback season.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>livinthedream</strong>: Brian, I think I have the perfect name and logo for the team formerly known as the Redskins. How about the Washington Swamp Creatures and their logo will be a running lobbyist holding proposed legislation in one hand and a wad of cash in the other? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: If teams really want nicknames/mascots that strike fear into people, why not the Washington Politicians? That's downright scary. Let's Go Pols!</p>
<p><strong>Jimmie</strong>: With the signing of the pass-catching TE, is McDonald's expensive contract now a liability? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Yeah this could very well be his last year as a Steeler, especially if Eric Ebron and/or Zach Gentry show something in their roles. Salary cap issues would seem to indicate one of McDonald or Ebron will be a cap casualty.</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Hey Brian...do you think Zach Banner has a chance to start this season? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nope, no chance. He shouldn't even show up for camp. Of course, I'm joking. Banner has a great chance to win the right tackle job. He's one of those players that you look at him, and his sheer size, if he can just fine-tune a few technique things and get himself in great physical shape - he says he spent his offseason doing just that - he can be a monster.</p>
<p><strong>Sunner in the sunshine</strong>: Hi Brian thanks for the chats! I have not heard about a bubble type scenario for the NFL players when the season starts. Do you know why there has been no announcement or are they actually going to permit the players to go home and go out etc..? I think they are asking for trouble if they don't have a bubble like the NBA or the MLS. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: As far as I know, it's going to be on the players to take those precautions off the field. And if you put yourself at risk and test positive, then you're only hurting yourself and your teammates.</p>
<p><strong>Walt</strong>: With the news that Pirates broadcaster Bob Walk is recovering from the virus, have you heard if Steelers broadcaster Bill Hillgrove will be calling games since his age is risk factor? Thank you. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, Walt, I have not. For what it's worth, when Hillgrove had to miss the last two games of last season due to back surgery, it was Rob King who filled in.</p>
<p><strong>John Strange</strong>: Which is more grounded in reality? Talking about the 2020 NFL season or talking about the different shapes of clouds in the sky? Bonus points if one of the clouds is shaped like a fullback. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Pretty sure Ron Nimbus was an absolute stud for some of those old Green Bay teams.</p>
<p><strong>Charlotte Steelers Fan</strong>: Brian - thank you for doing these chats and entertaining us fans who are just begging for some football. That being said, was watching the top 10 games played in 2019 over the weekend, and for the most part saw a really disturbing trend in these games. Just how bad the officiating is (for the most part) and the absolute refusal of New York to get the call right on the field. Seems that all could change by adding a sky judge and just reviewing the plays, adding some cameras and just using technology to quickly get these calls right. Do you ever think we will get there or still going to be subjected to worse officiating year over year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: You're quite welcome, CSF. I've been fairly consistent over the years in that concerns over officiating are overblown. But maybe that's just the sporting nihilist in me, the one who says that at the end of the day these games and their results are not life and death or even close to it. Is it frustrating when a call gets missed? Absolutely. Can it affect people's job status and legacies? It can. But officiating is a difficult job, and overcomplicating the aspect of human error in sports isn't something that's a no-brainer solution in my eyes.</p>
<p><strong>rman</strong>: Is it worse for an NFL player to be pro American flag or anti semitic? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: *rolls eyes* Wow rman, that's a real toughy there. But I'm gonna have to go with Anti-Semitic. Thanks for the insightful question.</p>
<p><strong>fredward</strong>: Have any Steelers indicated they may not report to camp, like Demarcus Lawrence is considering for Dallas? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not that I've seen. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That doesn't mean some aren't at least considering it, though.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Davern</strong>: Do you think the Steelers start slow this year as in the past or will it be even slower because of the lack of practice? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Well, as Mike Tomlin would say, the lack of practice is a global issue. As for the Steelers, specifically, if anything they should start fast. Just basing that on their first two opponents, a Giants team with a new coach and young core, then a Broncos team with a second-year coach and a second-year QB. If they aren't 2-0, I'll be worried for them.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Don't you think it's time we erect a statue of the Emperor Chuck Noll outside Heinz Field ? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Nah, let's take whatever it would cost to erect said statue and donate it to a good cause. I don't think Chuck would mind.</p>
<p><strong>Bubby_Blister</strong>: What is the probability that Ben leads the Steelers to another Super Bowl win? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: My six-month-old is sitting on my lap as we do this chat, so I asked him to run the odds real quick. He came back with 6.5%. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Don't ask me what he did. He had a calculator and some charts and stuff. Way over my head.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: If teams hold off on signing rookies because they think there may not be a season, is there a point where the drafted rookies are let out of their commitment to a team and become free agents? It seems like if you don't sign me to a contract for months and aren't showing interest in doing so, I should be able to go find another team that will pay me. <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: There's not much rookies and their agents can negotiate in their contracts. The process of agreeing to/signing them is basically a formality at this point. But to the crux of your question, 2020 could be different than any other NFL season we've seen, so who knows if some wonky stuff might happen. I just don't think it's worth worrying about any issues with rookie deals.</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Hi Brian do the players have access to the Rooney Complex all year to work out? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I believe so, but much of the offseason nowadays is on a strictly voluntary basis. Teams can only mandate the players be there for a few weeks each year when not in-season.</p>
<p><strong>Jim Ryan</strong>: Are the Shaler Titans the worst team in the WPIAL? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Hmmm I highly doubt the coach of the Shaler Titans football program would ask that, but that's nice that you're thinking of them so much. And to answer your question, no!</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: now that ben is back, do you think the steelers will make the playoffs? they didn't the last 2 years, even when ben threw for 5,000 yards they missed, so why would he make a difference now? he's older, over weight, and slower? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I think it'll be close, but I like their chances for this reason: Outside the Chiefs and Ravens at the top, I think the AFC is pretty bunched up in terms of talent. Could be a lot of teams with similar records by the end of the season.</p>
<p><strong>George in OKC</strong>: If Ben does end up winning another super bowl, do you think it would change the his legacy as to one of the all time greats? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Good question, George. I think it kind of depends on what you consider to be all-time great territory. Regardless of whether he wins another, he'll be a Hall of Famer, maybe even first ballot. But when you say all-time great QBs, I think of Montana, Elway, Marino, Unitas, Brady, Manning. And even a third Super Bowl win might not vault him into that tier.</p>
<p><strong>Miklos</strong>: Hi, heard a so-called expert say that current cryboy Prescott could have a great chance of coming to the Steelers when Ben retires. Your thoughts? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: It's hard for me to imagine the Steelers getting right back into the paying-huge-money-at-QB game after Ben retires. With the amount of young talent at the rest of the positions, they seem like the type of team that could try to keep the window open with more of a budget-friendly option, perhaps a young guy or rookie on a cheap deal?</p>
<p><strong>Casey</strong>: Hi Brian. Being a big country music fan, I was wondering if you know if the Steelers acknowledged the passing of country music star Charlie Daniels who was a huge Steelers fan and mentioned the Steelers in one of his greatest hits. Thanks!! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: No, I don't believe they made any sort of public statement as an organization. If they did, I missed it.</p>
<p><strong>CoalportKid</strong>: Are players required to have certain vaccines like, says kids in school? I'm just imaging we someday have a COVID vaccine and some players decline. What then? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: That might be a team-by-team decision, but I have to imagine there are some pro athletes out there who wouldn't take kindly to being forced to get vaccinated.</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong>: It doesn’t seem right that Troy and the others have to wait a year to get into the HOF. Why can’t they say these guys are officially in now and just the ceremony part has to wait until next year? <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Not sure it really matters, Mercury. The best part about making it official is the pomp and circumstance of that weekend in Canton, and that just isn't happening this year. I don't think any of this year's inductees, Troy Polamalu or Bill Cowher included, are offended by that. They're in, and they know it.</p>
<p><strong>Frank</strong>: Hi Brian Enjoy your chats and humor. Do the Steelers have control of Bub Dupree for another year after this upcoming one ? Another year of a franchise tag? Thanks <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Why thank you, Frank. My humor is amused by "Bub Dupree," by the way. They have control in the sense that they could tag him again, yes. But it would be more expensive, I think 120% of the previous year's tag. So you don't see that very often from teams.</p>
<p><strong>seferg</strong>: What percent of 2018 Ben R do you think we get this year? (low ball, your hope, high end) Im thinking at worst 50%, im thinking 85% realisticly and high end 100% <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: I went to my son again and he says 60%. Glad we have him to do the math in the family.</p>
<p><strong>Jay Davern</strong>: You forgot Bradshaw! <br> <strong>Brian Batko</strong>: Is Terry Bradshaw an "all-time great" quarterback? Ah, nuggets. We're out of time for this week's chat. Thanks for coming, everyone. Tip your waiters!</p>
