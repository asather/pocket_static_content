<h1>Fireworks production companies see events fizzle, while consumer showrooms start the season with a bang</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>This year’s Fourth of July celebrations were expected to be a sparkling boom of revenue for the fireworks event industry, as usual. But after the unexpected blow of the COVID-19 pandemic, they’ve turned out to be more of a damp squib — at least for many in the business.</p>
<p>Cranberry-based Zambelli Fireworks and New Castle-based Pyrotecnico both produce hundreds of shows across the country on and around the Fourth of July holiday under normal circumstances. Not this year. As the virus spread, the cancellations began rolling in.</p>
<p>“It’s significantly impacted the industry and our company,” said Stephen Vitale, president and CEO of Pyrotecnico. He described the impact of COVID-19 on Pyrotecnico and the fireworks event production industry as a whole as “devastating.” During a holiday week when companies may draw as much as 40% to 50% of their yearly revenue, small companies in hard-hit states have seen upwards of 90% of their contracts canceled.</p>
<p>Pyrotecnico is not a small company, but it also has had huge numbers of cancellations, as well as some postponements, according to Mr. Vitale.</p>
<p>Zambelli Fireworks has seen an 80% cancellation rate, with some clients postponing their events to later in the year, said&nbsp;Dr. George Zambelli Jr., chair of the company’s board.&nbsp;“We’re in hopes that some of the displays that have canceled — if there isn’t a second wave of the pandemic — will come back later on in the year, but who knows?” he said.</p>
<p>Dr. Zambelli splits his time between his ophthalmology practice in Rochester, Beaver County, and his work on the board of the company, though he notes that there’s been more than usual to do at the fireworks business recently, under the unusual circumstances.</p>
<p>Beaver County will be putting on a major Zambelli-organized show to raise community morale on the Fourth of July, but almost every other major contract has cancelled, he said.</p>
<p>Workers across the live-entertainment industry have been hit hard financially by the pandemic, and the fireworks business is no exception.</p>
<p>Pyrotecnico had to lay off around 70% of its staff and is hoping a stimulus package from Congress aimed at helping live entertainment workers could be approved to prevent further damage to the company and the industry. “These are highly skilled and trained workers in a highly specialized, highly regulated field,” Mr. Vitale said.</p>
<p>Zambelli has not laid off any of its 45-person year-round staff, instead rotating small numbers of employees through 3-week furlough periods due to the financial strain of cancellations.</p>
<p>Both companies also had to tell many of their several thousand seasonal employees — fireworks enthusiasts who work specifically on the Fourth of July shows —&nbsp;that they wouldn’t be taken on this year.</p>
<p>Running a fireworks company during a pandemic is complicated by the fact that fireworks storage is strictly regulated and requires frequent inventory checks and maintenance.</p>
<p>Mr. Vitale said many production companies take out loans in order to buy their materials for July 4th celebrations, intending to pay the loans off using revenue from the coming events. And the product isn’t cheap —&nbsp;for a large-scale display like the upcoming Beaver County show, the materials cost “tens of thousands of dollars,” Dr. Zambelli said.</p>
<p>Fireworks don’t expire, Mr. Vitale said, but any business that borrowed money this year will have to pay the “carrying cost” of staffing and maintaining their warehouses until the products can be used.</p>
<p>The American Pyrotechnics Association, a Bethesda, Md.-based major trade association for fireworks companies in the United States, is urging lawmakers to make it easier for production companies to access loans. “Our industry is working diligently to get us support to get us to next season,” Mr. Vitale said.</p>
<p>Zambelli received eight weeks of paycheck coverage from the federal Paycheck Protection Program, Dr. Zambelli said, but it’s not enough to cover the length of time the company will go without income. The company, along with several fireworks trade associations, is urging the government to allow more extended loans through the program.</p>
<p><strong>Back-yard boom</strong></p>
<p>There is a part of the industry that’s sizzling.</p>
<p>Phantom Fireworks is experiencing an unexpected boom in sales as consumers unwilling to give on up seeing a fireworks show are resorting to making their own. Phantom, which is based in Youngstown, Ohio, is a major seller of consumer fireworks.</p>
<p>William Weimer, vice president at Phantom,&nbsp;has seen what he calls an “unusual early season” of buyers coming in to stock up, resulting in the company doing “unbelievably well.”</p>
<p>He said the bulk of Phantom’s showroom business generally happens in the 10 days leading up to the Fourth of July. This year has been an exception, with people coming in to buy fireworks to use both on — and well before — the holiday.</p>
<p>To cope with the sudden increase in demand, Phantom is trying to hire temporary workers to staff showrooms and warehouses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Weimer also said the current opening-up period in parts of the country has provided an ideal environment for excitement around fireworks.&nbsp;With no concerts, public displays, or baseball games where they can see fireworks, people have turned to creating their own backyard shows.</p>
<p>“People have been cooped up for a long time … [they’re] very enthusiastic to get out, and couple that enthusiasm with the Fourth of July being so close, and naturally it’s a tendency to go toward fireworks,” he said.</p>
<p>But some people are less than enthusiastic about their neighbors’ new evening pastime.</p>
<p>The city of Pittsburgh announced Friday that it will form a fireworks task force in response to the 137 complaints that residents have lodged so far this summer — significantly more than the 28 complaints received over the same period last year.</p>
<p>The announcement notes that although the fireworks themselves may be legal, there are few places in Pittsburgh where the same can be said for their use — given that city law forbids the use of fireworks within 150 feet of any structure, in parks and public spaces, and in private spaces where the landowner has not given permission.</p>
<p>For anyone considering an at-home fireworks display this year, Mr. Weimer offered some advice: “Used properly by a sober adult — keep the fireworks out of the hands of the children — you can have a safe, wholesome family experience.”</p>
<p>He can personally report to seeing the results of his company’s sales spike.</p>
<p>“In my neighborhood, I have two or three people in the immediate couple of blocks that seem to be shooting fireworks pretty regularly these days. To some people, it’s offensive — to me, of course, it’s music to my ears,” said Mr. Weimer.</p>
<p>He’s also aware that everyone in the industry isn’t so fortunate. “That translates to a devastating loss of business for our close friends in the professional display business.”</p>
