<h1>Penguins' Kris Letang named captain for 2020 NHL All-Star game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two weeks ago, there was some question as to whether Kris Letang would earn an All-Star jersey. Now, they’ll have to sew a “C” onto it.</p>
<p>The NHL announced on Monday that the Penguins defenseman will captain the Metropolitan Division.</p>
<p>Letang, a six-time All-Star and one of the most unique defensemen in the NHL, was initially not one of the players selected for the game on Jan. 25 in St. Louis. Instead, he was one of the candidates for the “Last Men In” vote. However, when Jake Guentzel violently collided with the boards and underwent what was likely season-ending shoulder surgery, Letang was selected as his replacement.</p>
<p>In 37 games this season, Letang has tallied 28 points (18 assists and 10 goals). Among NHL defensemen, Letang is tied for eighth in goals and 16th in points.</p>
<p>Letang will be joined at the All-Star game by his teammate, Tristan Jarry, who replaced injured Columbus Blue Jackets goalie Joonas Korpisalo. Jarry leads the NHL in goals-against average (2.08) and save percentage (.932).</p>
<p>Fans initially voted Alex Ovechkin as captain. However, when Ovechkin elected to sit out the game to rest, Letang was tabbed as the replacement.</p>
