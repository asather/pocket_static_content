<h1>LOOPED IN: PHILLTER Music Showcase takes over Three Rivers Arts Festival on Saturday</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PHILLTER artists come in all shapes and sizes, but there is one common thread.</p>
<p>“This is an artist,” says Mike Why, “who can drive to the venue, speak to no one, put up an entire PA, play a show that is band-competitive from any corner of the room, pack their car back up and leave without interacting with anyone.”</p>
<p>In other words, he says, they are “the most COVID-compliant ‘bands’ in the world.”</p>
<p>Why, whose real name is Yanchak, is the co-founder of the PHILLTER Music Showcase, which will be featured on Saturday as part of the Dollar Bank Three Rivers Arts Festival’s second weekend of virtual performances.</p>
<p>While some musicians are beginning to step away from their phones and computer screens and perform again live in person in reduced capacities, TRAF is known to draw too big of a crowd for that.</p>
<p>So, this Saturday night edition will offer solo musicians who, with the use of loopers, specialize in sounding like full bands.</p>
<p>Why, an a cappella/beatbox artist who makes use of loops, founded PHILLTER three years ago with his friend Philip Coachman, a Microsoft employee, using the acronym for “performance + human innovation + live loops + technology + education + renaissance.” He calls PHILLTER an association of artists from across North America who “demonstrate a common thread of taking a band in your head and communicating it to an audience with a single solo performance.</p>
<p>“So we're talking about things like effects, live looping, harnessing aspects of studio production and harvesting live aspects of stage production and being able to do it as an independent artist.”</p>
<p>For the last three years, PHILLTER has showcased on the Stanwix Street stage of the Three Rivers Arts Festival. For this 61st edition, they were approached to contribute to the festival’s 10 days of streaming.</p>
<p>The PHILLTER artists, for the most part, will perform from Coachman’s work-at-home space in Butler, which happens to be a refinished barn.</p>
<p>“It’s going to be a little bit of a weird look for us,” Why says, “because when we were saying we were developing artists of the future, I’m not sure we necessarily we're planning on shooting music performances in front of like a bear skin rug or a deer head, but you know these are the times we're living in.”</p>
<p><strong>WHAT’S IN A LOOP</strong></p>
<p>A familiar face to a lot of Pittsburgh music fans on the lineup is Bob Banerjee, the fiddle and mandolin player known for his work with Gaelic Storm, Corned Beef &amp; Curry and, going way back, country band Silverado.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/idAxvWW2sNk" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>“I started back in the ’90s, believe it or not, before looping was even a big thing,” Banerjee says. “I wanted to play multiple violin parts at the same time. I come from an orchestral background so I've always tried to make my sound bigger.”</p>
<p>He started out using repetitive phrases to play Bach’s “Pachelbel's Canon” on a box that only had 16 kilobytes of space.</p>
<p>“Keep in mind, this is back in the days of the Vic 20 and the Commodore 64,” Banerjee says. “The first box wouldn't even save more than a 23- second loop before you could put on another loop.”</p>
<p>Now, obviously, things have changed with 16-bit loopers allowing unlimited overdubs, echo, delay and other effects.</p>
<p>“It's like using a tape recorder or VCR,” Banerjee says. “The looper records the phrase that you're playing into it for a certain amount of time and then when you press the pedal again it turns it off. So that part is exactly like a like a tape recorder. The difference is that what the looper does is it takes you back to the beginning of what you just recorded and plays it back for you and it will play it back ad infinitum. And some people what they'll do is they will put percussion on top of that or harmonies on top of that, or, as I do, I put other instruments on top of that. So what you do is, basically, in that one interval of time you layer your instruments one on top of each other.”</p>
<p>It requires the musician to be something of a juggler in the process, knowing when to hit the loops and for how long.</p>
<p>“My friends who are new to looping always find that that is the toughest part,” he says. “No matter how simple you make it, it still is up to the musician and it's the musician’s craft that allows them to know when to come in, when to bug out, what kind of stuff to put on it. Otherwise, it might sound just like a mess. So the creative artists are out there that are doing looping right now, they're timing has to be just absolutely on target and precise. If you're off by even a smidgen, you’re going to be off by that smidgen every time. There’s nothing worse for a musician than hearing that one mistake that you made in your phrase over and over again.”</p>
<p>He says that while a lot of people use electronica in their loops, “I went the other way around and tried to find out as many ways of getting acoustic instruments and layering acoustic instruments so that it sounds bigger. That led me to doing multi-instrumental stuff where I would put a guitar track down and then maybe put two mandolin tracks down on top of that and then put maybe another four violin tracks on top, so that you really sound like you've got this huge ensemble.”</p>
<p>For something completely different, PHILLTER features Neil Meadows, aka NaPoM, a beatboxing phenom from Greensburg.</p>
<p>He started beatboxing in middle school.</p>
<p>“Initially,” he says, “I was just on YouTube and came across a video of someone playing a flute and beatboxing at the same time. That didn’t work out for me, but it introduced me to beatboxing. Growing up in Greensburg, I wasn’t much of a hip-hop head and introduced me to a new world.”</p>

<p>Then, it was a matter of learning a new language, starting with the baby steps of using the words “boots” and “cats.”</p>
<p>He started performing in 2011 at 16 and within a few years, he was winning competitions. In 2017, became the Grand Beatbox Battle Champion.</p>
<p>On his YouTube channel you’ll see him booming out deep subwoofer bass sounds in videos that have been viewed millions of times. He’ll teach you how to do that as well. Based in New York now, he’s a member of the duo K-Pom with Kenny Urban and the supergroup The Beatbox House, which has yet to be booked in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Like a lot of beatboxers, he embraced looping using the standard tool of the beatbox trade: the BOSS RC-505.</p>
<p>“If you know how to drop a basic beat with your mouth,” he says, “you loop that and then it’s just a matter of hitting the buttons at the right time.”</p>
<p>His typical 20-minute set, he says, he incorporates solo beatboxing, then sprinkling in the loop station and then effects.</p>
<p>Chiming in from Chattanooga, Tenn., will be Meadville native Butch Ross, a dulcimer and mandolin virtuoso and looper who will perform pieces of “Kid A,” marking the 20th anniversary of that transitional Radiohead album.</p>
<p>PHILLTER’s mission goes beyond performance into outreach and education, so following the performances on the Arts Festival site PHILLTER will move to its Facebook page for a green room discussion with the artists.</p>
<p><strong>PHILLTER METRICS</strong></p>
<p>If you’ve gotten this far, you may be wondering if Ed Sheeran, the poster boy for looping, is a PHILLTER kind of artist.</p>
<p>“The day he performed at the Grammys,” Why says, “I got 17 Facebook messages, saying, ‘Hey man, I just saw what you do!’ ”</p>
<p>Sheeran, a last-minute addition to the Grammys in 2017, performed “Shape of You” with just guitar and his custom Chewie II looper, a moment, Why says, that “elevated live looping.”</p>
<p>Among the other stars mastering those loops, in a range of genres, are Andrew Bird, Imogen Heap, KT Tunstall, Kimbra, Tash Sultan, Tune-Yards and Keller Williams.</p>
<p>Why says they don’t have a set of “quantitative metrics” with which to identify a PHILLTER-type artist but “it's one of those things where we know it when we see it.”</p>
