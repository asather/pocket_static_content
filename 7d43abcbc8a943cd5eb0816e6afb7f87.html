<h1>Attorney, activists question West Mifflin police officers' actions after incident with teen on school bus</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Demonstrators were expected to gather Tuesday night at the West Mifflin Borough Council meeting to demand action after an incident involving two police officers and a 15-year-old girl on a school bus.</p>
<p>The incident, which occurred Dec. 18, was captured on cell phone video and shows West Mifflin police Sgt. Christopher Mordaunt and Officer Tommy Trieu in an altercation with the girl.</p>
<p>The video begins as the two officers have the girl pinned against a window. One of them then pulls her by the hair as other students on the bus implore them to stop. It was unclear why police were called to the bus, or what led up to the altercation.</p>
<p>“Sergeant Christopher Mordaunt and Officer Tommy Trieu committed a crime when they brutally assaulted this tiny girl,” attorney Paul Jubas, who has been retained by the girl’s family, wrote in an Instagram post in December. “They sprayed her blood all over her fellow students and incited riot-like conditions on a school bus. Everything was calm on this bus until these officers began their vicious assault. To make matters worse, other videos prove they lied in their affidavit of probable cause.”</p>
<p>In the post, Mr. Jubas called for the charges against the girl to be dropped and the officers to be fired. He also said he was waiting to have a conversation about the incident with Allegheny County District Attorney Stephen A. Zappala Jr.</p>
<p>Mike Manko, a spokesman for Mr. Zappala, said he could not comment on anything connected to a juvenile case.</p>
<p>Reached Tuesday, Mr. Jubas declined further comment on the case other than to say “I have everything — there’s video evidence of the entire situation.” He said he might have more to say after the girl has her hearing in juvenile court in early February.</p>
<p>He said the demonstrators planning to attend the council meeting Tuesday were grassroots activists seeking accountability from the police department.</p>
<p>Phil DiLucente, West Mifflin’s solicitor, said the officers did not do anything improperly. He said the case was being looked at by outside agencies and he could not comment further until the investigation was completed.</p>
<p>West Mifflin police did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
<p>The group planning to meet at the council meeting said it wants Sgt. Mordaunt and Officer Trieu to be fired. Those in the group said they also plan to attend the West Mifflin Area school board meeting on Thursday.</p>
<p>Allegheny County councilwomen Bethany Hallam and Olivia Bennett released a joint statement Friday that asked the district attorney to file charges against the officers.</p>
<p>“We stand with the family and their legal representation and will do everything in our power to ensure a thorough and transparent investigation,” the statement said.</p>
