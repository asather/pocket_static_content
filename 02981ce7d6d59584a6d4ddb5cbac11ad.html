<h1>North Shore company gets $1.6 million grant for new drug development</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A North Shore biotech company has received a $1.6 million federal grant to continue development of a drug that may be used to treat flu and possibly COVID-19.</p>
<p>CytoAgents Inc. received the grant from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health to develop the company’s lead drug candidates, dubbed GP1681. The investigational drug is being tested in the treatment of severe flu and potentially COVID-19, a highly contagious respiratory disease.</p>
<p>The company’s lead drug targets a condition called hypercytokinemia, commonly known as a cytokine storm, which is an excessive immune response that attacks the body. The Small Business Innovation Research program grant will enable to company to accelerate development of its lead product.</p>
<p>GP1681 is a small molecule inhibitor of cytokine release in activated human immune cells. A cytokine storm can cause more harm than the virus or flu itself, so the new drug tamps down various cytokines, muting the response.</p>
