<h1>WPIAL 6A-City League roundup: Central Catholic routs Seneca Valley</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Normally when Seneca Valley and Central Catholic meet it ends up being a barn-burner.</p>
<p>After all, the last four times the teams had squared off the final outcome was decided by single digits and, in one instance, a single point.</p>
<p>Central Catholic took all the drama out of this one in a hurry.</p>
<p>Following an early field goal, Gannon Carothers returned an interception 45 yards to the house then opened the third quarter with a 77-yard scoring run to help the Class 6A No. 3 Central Catholic (3-1, 3-1) to a resounding 33-7 victory over No.2 Seneca Valley (2-1, 2-1). Their last five meetings were decided by a total of 18 points and the Vikings won this one by 26.</p>
<p>Even when things went well for Seneca Valley they turned ugly fast. The Raiders tried to work their way back into it in the fourth quarter when Brady Skalos caught a 32-yard touchdown pass from Brian Olan. Robinson Waddell countered by taking the ensuing kickoff back 65 yards for a score.</p>

<p><strong><strong>Norwin 28, </strong>Baldwin 12: </strong>The Knights (1-3, 1-3) ended a seven-game losing streak that dated back to last year as Nicholas Fleming put on a show. The senior quarterback completed 10 of 16 for 203 yards and two touchdowns and also ran 16 times for 35 yards and another score to pace an offense that tied its highest output of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Canon-McMillan 45, Hempfield 14:</strong> After being forced to take a week off, the Big Macs (2-1, 2-1) got right back on the winning track as junior running back Ryan Angott carried 22 times for 261 yards and five touchdowns in a running-clock romp over the struggling Spartans (1-3, 1-3). They have now dropped three straight after their season-opening win against Norwin. Hempfield broke up the shutout bid and staved off the mercy rule for a brief time when Christian Zilli connected with Roman Pellis on a 6-yard touchdown on the last play of the first half before Angott got his fifth score of the game early in the third quarter to get the clock moving</p>
<p><strong>North Allegheny 14, Mt. Lebanon 11:</strong> Mason Kress shook loose for a 33-yard touchdown run midway through the fourth quarter that proved to be the difference as the No. 1 Tigers (3-0, 2-0) avoided a letdown after their emotional win last week against Central Catholic with a nail-biter against the No. 5 Blue Devils (1-2, 1-2). Mt. Lebanon quarterback Joey Daniels hit Eli Heidenreich late to draw the Blue Devils within a field goal. North Allegheny trailed, 3-0, at the intermission when Greg Phillips hit Sean Metcalf with a 7-yard touchdown to give the Tigers a lead they never relinquished.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>City League</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>University Prep 8, Perry 0:</strong> For a while it University Prep and Perry would battle to a scoreless tie in regulation and decide this in overtime, but that was before Zisean White went over for a 4-yard touchdown and Keon Smalls hit Zymere Bibb with the 2-point conversion in the fourth quarter to hand University Prep (1-1, 1-1) the win over the Commodores (1-1, 0-1).</p>
