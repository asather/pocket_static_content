<h1>Unnamed Penguins player tests positive for COVID-19</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins announced Thursday that a player tested positive for COVID-19.</p>
<p>“The player is not in Pittsburgh and has been in isolation at his home since first experiencing symptoms,” the team said in a statement, though did not specify who the player is. “He is recovered and feeling well. Those in close contact with the player leading up to his diagnosis have been notified.”</p>
<p>It’s the first known positive test for a professional athlete who plays for a Pittsburgh team. In total, at least eight other NHL players have tested positive for COVID-19, including three from the Colorado Avalanche and five from the Ottawa Senators. Additionally, one staff member from the Senators tested positive.</p>
<p>Testing is one of the key pieces of the NHL’s return-to-play plan, which was officially unveiled last week. All players will be tested 48 hours before they can return to their practice arenas for informal, voluntary skates in Phase 2. By the time teams go to the to-be-determined hub cities for Phase 4, the league expects nightly testing, which should produce results by the next morning. The league expects it will need about 25,000 to 30,000 tests, which will cost millions of dollars.</p>
<p>The positive test from the Penguins shouldn’t fundamentally change the NHL’s return-to-play timeline, based on the information commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly provided last week.</p>
<p>“One single positive test, depending on the circumstance, should not necessarily shut the whole operation down,” Daly said last week.</p>
<p>The NHL season has been on pause since March 12 due to the ongoing pandemic. The NHL plans to move into Phase 2 sometime this month, during which players can skate in small groups. A formal training camp (Phase 3) won’t start until July at the earliest.</p>
<p>“The health and safety of our players, fans, staff and community remains our highest priority,” the Penguins’ statement read. “The club will have no further update at this time.”</p>
