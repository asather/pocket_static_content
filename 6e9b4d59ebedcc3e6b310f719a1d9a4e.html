<h1>Peduto joins other mayors in imploring federal, state leaders to support relief for cities, workers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cities are sounding the alarm over the havoc that declining tax revenue and market volatility could wreak on municipal services and pension funds as COVID-19 spreads, and Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto is one of hundreds of mayors imploring federal leaders to offer financial relief at the local level.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto was one of 300 mayors to sign a <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9051_Mayors-Supplemental-Request-032020.pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> requesting from lawmakers in Washington that $250 billion in&nbsp;“flexible, emergency fiscal assistance” be made available. The letter dated for Friday was sent from the United States Conference of Mayors, a D.C.-based nonpartisan organization of leaders of cities with a population of at least 30,000.</p>
<p>The letter cites overtime and sick pay,&nbsp;“gutted” sales tax distributions and other declining tax revenue, mortgage and rental assistance, and small business relief among other ways the funding would be used.</p>
<p>Mr. Peduto signed two other letters dated for Thursday — <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9050_Mayor_Peduto_LoS_-_American_Working_Families_Relief_Action_Plan.pdf" target="_blank">one sent from his office</a> to Pennsylvania Republican leaders Joseph Scarnatti and Mike Turzai, urging them to support the American Working Family Relief Action Plan, a coronavirus relief bill out of Washington that has already been endorsed by the Commonwealth’s Democratic caucus leaders.</p>
<p>“People, and the small businesses that employ them, are under tremendous stress right now and we need to support them – just as they are supporting us as we deal with this pandemic. It’s time for our federal and state governments to do all they can to step up and deliver significant emergency funding,” Mayor Peduto said in a press release about the letters.</p>
<p>He also co-signed a <a href="https://apps.pittsburghpa.gov/redtail/images/9053_9052_Mayors_city_electeds_Contract_Workers_Sign_on_Letter_(1).pdf" target="_blank">letter</a> from the Service Employees International Union to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, urging that any relief bill&nbsp;“include the well-being of the estimated 125,000 subcontracted service workers at our nation’s airports and their families.”</p>
