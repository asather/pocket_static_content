<h1>Obituary: Timothy G. Banner | A calm, cool demeanor helped make baseball coach a winner</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When Tim Banner was a high school baseball coach, his volume level&nbsp;never needed to be turned down a notch or two. He was as calm and cool as a&nbsp;tight-rope walker.</p>
<p>But in terms of winning, Mr. Banner’s coaching hit a high decibel&nbsp;level.</p>
<p>Mr. Banner is one of the few coaches in the history of WPIAL baseball&nbsp;to win WPIAL championships at two different schools. He also won a state&nbsp;championship and more than 300 games in his career.</p>
<p>Mr. Banner died Wednesday at his home in Ross of an apparent heart&nbsp;attack. He was 64.</p>
<p>Mr. Banner was the head coach at four different WPIAL high schools (Avonworth, North Catholic, North Allegheny and Woodland Hills) and spent three seasons as Chatham University’s coach before resigning in 2019. He&nbsp;won 310 games in his high school career, but did it with a low-key demeanor&nbsp;that endeared him to many players. He rarely raised his voice —&nbsp;and was highly&nbsp;successful with his style.</p>
<p>Andy Maddix was an assistant coach at North Allegheny under Mr. Banner&nbsp;for seven seasons and eventually took over for him when he left North&nbsp;Allegheny after the 2007 season.</p>
<p>“He had a way of getting kids to play without stress and he was sort of&nbsp;a calming influence on them,” Mr. Maddix said. “North Allegheny can be a tough&nbsp;place because the kids can feel a lot of pressure because the expectations are always&nbsp;high. There was a great deal of competition just to get on the field for a ton&nbsp;of those kids. What I saw from [Banner] was a way of getting kids to play free&nbsp;and loose from the burdens of all that competition.”</p>
<p>John Quimby was North Allegheny’s starting shortstop for three seasons under Mr. Banner and was on two WPIAL championship teams.</p>
<p>“You think of two-way players in baseball who are a pitcher and a&nbsp;position player,” Mr. Quimby said. “But [Banner] was such a good ‘two-way’&nbsp;coach. He was such a good coach on the field. But he was there for you with&nbsp;whatever you needed off the field as well.”</p>
<p>When Mr. Banner resigned at North Allegheny, he had no other coaching&nbsp;job lined up. But he decided to take the Woodland Hills job in the winter of&nbsp;2008. Banner turned around Woodland Hills’ program and guided the Wolverines to&nbsp;the WPIAL playoffs in 2009, their first postseason appearance in seven years.</p>
<p>“He cared so much about his players,” said Mr. Banner’s daughter,&nbsp;Nicole Tremel. “I remember when he went to Woodland Hills, he would say he felt&nbsp;like bringing home some of those kids there who weren’t quite as fortunate.”</p>
<p>Mr. Banner played baseball at North Catholic High School and then Point&nbsp;Park University. He played in the Greater Pittsburgh Federation League for&nbsp;years and also played semi-pro football. Fred Birch played baseball with Mr.&nbsp;Banner, was once a neighbor of Mr. Banner’s and was an usher in Mr. Banner’s&nbsp;wedding party.</p>
<p>“When I think of Timmy Banner, I think of sports,” Mr. Birch said. “We&nbsp;played flag football every Sunday for probably 20 years. There probably isn’t&nbsp;one comment I could give you to sum him up, other than he was just a really&nbsp;good buddy – and he lived for baseball.”</p>
<p>Mr. Banner was a football assistant coach at Avonworth in the 1980s and&nbsp;got his first baseball head coaching job at Avonworth in 1987. One year later,&nbsp;he guided the Antelopes to their first WPIAL playoff appearance since 1970.</p>
<p>Mr. Banner became coach at his alma mater in 1992. North Catholic had a&nbsp;44-103 record in nine seasons before Mr. Banner. But the Trojans finished with&nbsp;a .500 record in 1994 and won a WPIAL title in 1995. Under Mr. Banner, North&nbsp;Catholic also made it to the WPIAL title game in 1998.</p>
<p>At North Allegheny, Mr. Banner had a record of 162-49, won three WPIAL&nbsp;titles (2000, 2003, 2005( and won a PIAA title in 2000. His all-time high&nbsp;school record was 310-199.</p>
<p>“I learned a lot from him, just how to manage a game,” Mr. Maddix said.</p>
<p>Mr. Quimby said, “You look at baseball now and how it has transformed.&nbsp;Things have kind of gotten away from ‘small ball.’ But he was such a good&nbsp;manager with ‘small ball’ things. I remember using suicide squeeze bunts and&nbsp;you don’t see them much any more.</p>
<p>“He reminded me of a little bulldog, someone who was calm and cuddly&nbsp;outside, but was extremely competitive inside and would fight for you.”</p>
<p>Even though Mr. Banner resigned from Chatham in 2019, he still helped&nbsp;coach a youth travel team that was managed by his son, Evan.</p>
<p>“He was a coach who only argued when it was the correct time to argue,”&nbsp;Evan Banner said. “He was so nonchalant and that demeanor left an impression on&nbsp;everyone. I’ve had kids he coached 30 years ago calling me. He touched a lot of&nbsp;people going through life.”</p>
<p>Baseball was what Mr. Banner used to affect people. That’s why his two&nbsp;children are setting up a scholarship fund that will be given to a WPIAL&nbsp;baseball and softball player every year.</p>
<p>“We just want to make sure he’s not forgotten and to give back to our&nbsp;family religion,” Nicole Tremel said. “We’re Catholic, but baseball is our&nbsp;first religion. That’s why we’re setting up this scholarship fund in his memory.”</p>
<p>In lieu of flowers, the family asks donations be made to Tim Banner&nbsp;Scholarship Fund, and sent to Sperling Family Funeral Home, 700 Blazier Dr.,&nbsp;Wexford, PA 15090.</p>
<p>Mr. Banner is survived by his wife, Cindy (Lenz) and children Evan&nbsp;Banner of Cranberry and Nicole (John) Tremel of Clinton; and five&nbsp;grandchildren.</p>
<p>Visitation is Monday from 2-8 p.m. at Sperling. A funeral mass is Tuesday&nbsp;at 11:30 at St. Boniface Church of Christ Our Savior Parish, 2208 East St.,&nbsp;Pittsburgh.</p>
