<h1>Gerry Dulac: Amateur golfers will have to wait for shot at biggest stage</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The U.S. Open, built on the long-held premise that the tournament is available to everyone, will not be open at all.</p>
<p>And that means the dreams of hundreds of golfers in Western Pennsylvania, no matter how fleeting or whimsical, are put on hold for at least another year.</p>
<p>That’s because the United States Golf Association announced last week it has decided to cancel qualifying for the 2020 U.S. Open, which had already been postponed from June until September, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It’s the first time since 1924 the USGA has done away with qualifying for golf’s second-oldest championship, a stunning but not surprising move given all that has been happening in the world, not just in golf.</p>
<p>And it’s not just the U.S. Open. All qualifiers for three other USGA championships — the U.S. Women’s Open, the U.S. Amateur and the U.S. Women’s Amateur — have been canceled, as well. The USGA has not announced how players will be exempt into the respective tournaments.</p>
<p>“It’s just a tough year for everyone,” said Nathan Smith, a four-time U.S. Mid-Amateur champion and three-time member of the U.S. Walker Cup team who has never competed in a U.S. Open despite 12 trips to sectional qualifiers. “It’s disappointing.”</p>
<p>Terry Teasdale, executive director of the Western Pennsylvania Golf Association that conducts local qualifiers for the USGA championships, said the decision by golf’s governing body in the U.S. affects approximately 350 male and female golfers in the area. That includes approximately 120 golfers who would annually participate in qualifying for the U.S. Open.</p>
<p>The 18-local qualifier for the U.S. Open was scheduled for May 6 at Butler Country Club. The 36-hole sectional qualifier for the U.S. Women’s Open was May 5 at Shannopin Country Club.</p>
<p>“We expected the women’s and men’s open qualifying to be conducted in the fall, but the longer it went on the less likely it looked,” Teasdale said.</p>
<p>In a typical year, the USGA estimates that nearly half of the 156-player field at the U.S. Open comes from local and sectional qualifiers. This year, there will be none.</p>
<p>“Everything has to be spoken about within the construct of what’s going on in the world, so it’s no big deal,” said eight-time West Penn Amateur and 2017 U.S. Senior Amateur champion Sean Knapp of Oakmont. “Hardly any players ever make it out of local and have a significant impact on the Open. But it’s still very disappointing.”</p>
<p>To be sure, it is not very often a player from Western Pennsylvania who has to go through local qualifying makes it to the U.S. Open.</p>
<p>The last player to do so was Rick Stimmel, who qualified for the 2000 U.S. Open at Pebble Beach after making it through a playoff in a local qualifier at Quicksilver Golf Club and a sectional qualifier at Butler CC. Mike Van Sickle of Kennedy eventually made it into the field of the 2016 U.S. Open at Oakmont as the fifth alternate after finishing as medalist in a local qualifier at the Club at Nevillewood and fourth in a sectional qualifier at Woodmont CC in Rockville, Md., one shot from the final qualifying spot.</p>
<p>“Every year we’re getting a little older so those opportunities don’t come around as much as they used to,” said Stimmel, 52, who has participated in four sectional qualifIers. “It’s another year of sitting on the couch watching time go by.”</p>
<p>It is rare for a player who had to go through a sectional qualifier to win the U.S. Open. The last to do so was Steve Jones in 1996. It is even more rare for a player to win the U.S. Open after going through a local qualifier. The last player to do that was Orville Moody, won the 1969 U.S. Open at Champions Golf Club in Houston, his only PGA Tour victory.</p>
<p>“If you’re like all of us, it’s a measuring stick, it’s a building block,” said Knapp, who has never qualified for the U.S. Open despite nine trips to sectional qualifiers. “If you make it to the next level of sectional qualifying, you’re going to play with a lot of good players, and that helps in your development as a tournament player. The last time I was at Woodmont, the guy in my group made it. It was exciting to see.”</p>
<p><strong>Even a quiet game needs fans</strong></p>
<p>Like every other golfer was who desiring to see something other than the replay of the final round of the 2016 John Deere Classic on Golf Channel, it was nice to see real live golf, played by some of the real live stars, on television last Sunday.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter that it was only four players competing in a skins game that really isn’t a skins game (it’s not their own money), or that they were wearing shorts (nothing wrong with that), or there were no caddies (might see more of that) or there were zero spectators offering not so much as a “get in the hole” shout (like a Bud Cauley gallery).</p>
<p>Some of that will change when the PGA Tour returns to real action June 11 at Colonial Country Club for the Charles Schwab Challenge. Shorts won’t be allowed, caddies will be, but there still will be no spectators allowed on the grounds. And while watching a tournament on television that actually means something for Rory McIlroy, Dustin Johnson and Rickie Fowler will make it even more intriguing for golf fans — they are all in the field at Colonial — the sensation might be short-lived.</p>
<p>The biggest takeaway I had from what I watched at the TaylorMade Driving Relief event Sunday — after enjoying seeing live golf on television again and marveling at the splendor of the Seminole Golf Club — is how quickly the two-team skins game became absolutely lifeless, like watching someone cutting grass.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just me. That was the reaction I heard from just about everyone — that the event, by the time the players made the turn, was boring.</p>
<p>Granted, there was nothing at stake for the players — beyond, of course, the money they raised for charity — and the event will have no place in PGA Tour history. But, after the initial thrill of seeing live golf on television again, the novelty wore off, surprisingly, quicker than anticipated.</p>
<p>That won’t happen as quickly when the tour returns to real action in three weeks. And it won’t happen on a Sunday afternoon when players — maybe McIlroy, maybe Johnson, maybe even Matthew Wolff — are battling for victory and a $1 million-plus winners check. But it will happen.</p>
<p>And the reason is simple: no galleries.</p>
<p>Golf is probably no different than other sports that are facing the possibility of playing in front of empty stadiums and arenas. But, in some instances, it’s very different.</p>
<p>How many sports have anywhere from 8,000 to 10,000 people lining up on a hole and cross-checking people like Tom Wilson to get a glimpse of Tiger Woods? Or just slightly fewer to watch McIlroy and Phil Mickelson when they’re in contention? Part of the Woods experience is seeing the gallery throng, waiting for them to erupt, watching him fist-pump or gyrate at a pivotal moment on a Sunday afternoon. Will he still do that with no spectators? Air-fives are cute, but for how long? Without fans, Woods might be relegated to one of those somnambulant David Toms birdie reactions.</p>
<p>Understand, golf with no spectators it still a whole bunch better than no golf at all. But television will have to do something. For starters, the networks should seriously consider pumping fake crowd reaction into the broadcast, just to make it sound more like a normal PGA Tour event. Just be sure the canned applause and roars are from Augusta National. Do not use any of the guttural sounds and X-rated insults from the galleries at Bethpage Black.</p>
<p>Either way, with no Tiger roars, I’m worried the thrill of having real golf back on TV might wear off like butter on an ear of corn. Maybe the players should wear shorts after all.</p>
