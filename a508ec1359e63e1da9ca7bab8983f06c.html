<p>Pittsburgh will develop and implement a new pre-arrest diversion program for people who commit low-level crimes.</p>
<p>The program, announced by the city on Monday, will be paid for through a federal grant awarded to the Allegheny County Health Department in September.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The pre-arrest diversion program is designed for people who commit low level crimes — like shoplifting or disorderly conduct — that stem from behavioral health issues. This also includes crimes that are related to poverty, substance abuse or mental health.</p>
<p>The city has partnered with the Congress of Neighboring Communities (CONNECT), and the two will collaborate in running the program.</p>
<p>The diversion program’s main goal is to ensure that participants are not entered into the criminal justice system.</p>
<p>"We know that cycling people through the criminal justice system does not improve outcomes,” Mayor Bill Peduto said in a news release. “Our goal is to continue to work with the community, county partners, public safety, and CONNECT to interrupt this cycle by implementing public health-informed practices like diversion."&nbsp;</p>
<p>The program also will look to provide additional support to people who frequently come into contact with police, especially those involved in crimes of poverty.</p>
<p>Additionally, it will help people identify goals and take control of their own lives.</p>
<p>The aims of the program align with the public health focus of the Office of Community Health and Safety, which Mr. Peduto created in mid-June. The purpose of the office is to create a system where public health and social work experts can assist first responders in situations that mandate more long-term assistance or harm reduction.</p>
<p>The pre-arrest diversion program will be piloted in Zone 1 on the North Side with the goal of expanding it city-wide and then regionally.</p>
<p>The grant is paid for through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Overdose to Action program, which was designed to address the opioid epidemic. The county will receive approximately $5.2 million a year through Aug. 2022 through the program.</p>
<p>Legislation to accept the funds will be introduced at Pittsburgh City Council on Tuesday.</p>
