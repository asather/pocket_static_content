<h1>That’s amore … and it, as Francisco Cervelli retires</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Beloved as a player and unfortunately stricken with concussion problems, former Pirates catcher Francisco Cervelli announced his retirement from Major League Baseball via Instagram on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Cervelli, 34, was limited to just 16 games with the Miami Marlins this past season, his 13th in the big leagues. Aside from Pittsburgh from 2015-2019, Cervelli also played for the Yankees and Braves.</p>
<p>“During my career, I encountered injuries and made some bad decisions,” Cervelli wrote. “But, I also learned so much. This game has brought me endless joy and happiness. I’ve received incredible support by so many, including countless teammates — my brothers in baseball — that I will carry in my heart forever. I also hold great pride in knowing that I strived to constantly make the impossible possible.”</p>
<p>The Pirates released Cervelli last year after he was working his way back from another concussion, this time to allow him to pursue an opportunity with another team after Jacob Stallings became their starter.</p>
<p>Atlanta quickly signed Cervelli, and this season he signed another free agent deal with Miami, which advanced to the National League Division Series.</p>
<p>Whether it was the Pirates or anyone else, Cervelli was beloved for his hustle behind the plate and his smarts calling games.</p>
<p>Cervelli has not played since Aug. 22 of this season after sustaining at least his seventh concussion since 2011, the result of a foul ball hitting the catcher in the head.</p>
<p>The Pirates acquired Cervelli via trade with the Yankees following the 2014 season. The next year, he hit .295 and played 130 games, helping the Pirates win 98 games and reach the playoffs for a third consecutive year.</p>
<p>Cervelli enjoyed a really good year in 2018, hitting .259/.378/.431 with an .809 OPS in 104 games, but he was never able to recapture that form.</p>
<p>He retires as one of the most beloved Pirates in recent memory, his hard-nosed style and likable personality resonating with fans.</p>
<p>Cervelli’s signature song became Dean Martin’s “That’s Amore,” which morphed into more than a walkup song; it became an in-game skit and an opportunity for the catcher to dole out love advice.</p>
<p>After he signed with the Braves, Cervelli said he retired the tune, telling the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “That’s only for Pittsburgh.” Apparently he brought it back for the retirement announcement.</p>
<p>“My journey in this game would be nothing without the exceptional people that have supported me along the way, personally and professionally,” Cervelli wrote</p>
<p>“I will never forget all that this game has taught me. I wouldn’t trade the blood, sweat and tears for anything in the world. This game will always be my greatest love because … well, THAT’S AMORE!”</p>
