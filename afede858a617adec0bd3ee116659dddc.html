<h1>Pirates mailbag: Which Pirates are eligible for the 2020 Rule 5 draft?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Thanks to the long weekend, it’s one day later than usual, but folks, we are back once again.</em></p>
<p><em>The Pirates, shockingly, have just 21 games left in their season entering Tuesday night. It feels like we only just began.&nbsp;</em><em>But we could always use help filling the mailbag. If any question about the team pops into your head, no matter the time of day, drop everything you are doing and immediately send that question on Twitter @MikeDPersak or to my email: mpersak@post-gazette.com.</em></p>
<p><strong>Ethan Hullihen (@EthanHullihen):</strong> Was the Gustave signing ever made official? If not, why? If so, is he in Altoona?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>I skipped this question last week, frankly, because I wasn’t sure what had happened with right-handed reliever Jandel Gustave. The signing was reported, but that was all we knew.</p>
<p>In the last week, the Pirates announced that he and the Pirates’ 2019 first-round pick, right-hander Quinn Priester, had joined the alternate training squad in Altoona. We at the Post-Gazette have been told the delay between Gustave’s reported signing and his arrival in Altoona was because he was quarantining after traveling to Pennsylvania from the Dominican Republic, where he was stationed a free agent.</p>
<p>Apologies for the delay in the answer there. We’ll see if the Pirates give him a look on the big-league club before the end of the season.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Cutlets (@georgepayroll):&nbsp;</strong>Do you think Bell and the Pirates could both be open to a surprise extension which buys out one or perhaps two of his FA years? Two would seem like a serious stretch, but perhaps paying the arbitration years + one creates cost certainty and takes some pressure off him.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve broached this topic a little bit in the past, but it’s interesting enough to talk about again.</p>
<p>The way I see it, Josh Bell is more valuable to the Pirates than anybody else right now. They drafted him, they’ve worked with him, they’ve reaped his rewards when he’s been on. He is not on right now. That is inarguable. So he isn’t exactly worthy of an extension, and he isn’t exactly an attractive trade candidate.</p>
<p>So, we’ll see.&nbsp;Bell has two more years of arbitration. By that point, he will be 30. With his current production, I don’t think I see the Pirates committing to him for three seasons, like you suggest. I think a one-year deal, whether through arbitration or otherwise, is more likely. It benefits both sides, not handcuffing them to too much or too little money for too long, when the potential is obviously there but hasn’t been realized this season.</p>
<p><strong>Charlie Franson:</strong> I was wondering who the Pirates must protect from the Rule 5 this year? Who needs to be added to the roster? Who do you think they might add and who gets cut if they need to clear space?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>Oneil Cruz, Ke’Bryan Hayes, Will Craig and Blake Cederlind all apply, but they’re on the 40-man roster. So we’ll limit this to people who aren’t already on the 40-man.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the uninitiated, the convoluted rules are essentially that if a player signs when he is 18 or younger, he must be on the 40-man roster by the fifth Rule 5 draft that takes place after his signing. They take place in the winter, so normally that’s about four and a half years. Otherwise, he is eligible to be taken by another team in MLB’s Rule 5 draft. If they sign when they are 19 or older, they must be on the 40-man by the fourth Rule 5 draft after their signing (about three and a half years).</p>
<p>I won’t go over the entire list. The highlights —&nbsp;people who are relatively close to the majors and thus, would be more attractive to team in the Rule 5 draft — would be James Marvel and Brandon Waddell.&nbsp; Outfielder Lolo Sanchez, the 23rd-ranked prospect, is also eligible. They’ve been eligible in years past, though.</p>
<p>The main highlights for first-year eligible players would be outfielder Jared Oliva (10th-ranked prospect), right-handers Tahnaj Thomas (15th), Santiago Florez (19th) and Max Kranick (24th) and infielder Rodolfo Castro (27th).</p>
<p>That is a lot to think about, so apologies if it doesn’t make sense or if I messed up calculating someone’s eligibility. What’s important to remember is that players selected in the Rule 5 draft have to be on the selecting team’s major-league roster for the entire next season. That prevents too much movement in the draft most years.</p>
<p>Hard to speculate on who might be cut, because Oliva is really the only player I think the Pirates would worry too much about another team taking. Even then, they might not worry.</p>
<p><strong>Mr. Cutlets (@georgepayroll):</strong>&nbsp;I may be too late again, but any news on Kuhl? Is there any sense that his pitch counts are closely being watched and might he even be shut down sometime soon, despite the short season, as a precaution? Has Ben Cherington commented on their overall plan with him this season?</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>A twofer from Mr. Cutlets! Let’s go! This was a thought I had the other day too, which of course only came to me after we spoke with Derek Shelton.</p>
<p>He said Kuhl’s last outing, which went 65 pitches, was planned, and Sam Howard, who pitched in that game Sunday after Kuhl left, confirmed he knew Kuhl was going shorter than usual too. Shelton said it was just to be mindful of Kuhl’s arm health in the season after his Tommy John surgery. What that means for his workload in future games is something to watch.</p>
<p>No real indication it’s a trend yet, though.</p>
<p><strong>Ross Berlin (@RossCBerlin): </strong>Best holiday beer? Labor Day on a boat is elite but not sure it tops the first pour for the noon game on Thanksgiving. Real ones are two beers deep by the middle of the dog show, though.</p>
<p><strong>Mike:&nbsp;</strong>This is the stuff right here. The Thanksgiving beer is a necessity, because the Wednesday before Thanksgiving is its own animal entirely.</p>
<p>The thing I miss most about my home in west Michigan is holidays on boats on lakes, whether that be the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, Labor Day, any of them. Those are my favorite holiday beers. Honorable mention to the first beer after getting off work on literally any holiday weekend.</p>
