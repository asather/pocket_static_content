<h1>Gene Collier: Stew Johnson a star yet again at Duquesne</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>All these decades later, Stew Johnson’s basketball legend is still pretty straight-forward even as his life and career remain vastly underappreciated.</p>
<p>On the playgrounds of Western Pennsylvania and in the gym at Clairton High, every baller knew he was the real deal, an elegant 6-9 baseline prowler who “got out of bed making jump shots,” as one put it recently, and Stew Johnson made a metric ton of ’em.</p>
<p>Made ’em at Murray State, where in 1963 he was the first Black player in the South outside of the modern rubric of Historically Black Colleges and Universities. Made ’em across all nine seasons of American Basketball Association history. Made enough of ’em that he scored 62 for the Pittsburgh Condors one night at the old Civic Arena (breaking Connie Hawkins’ then ABA record of 59). Made ’em in Argentina, Spain, France, Italy, Iceland and Sweden, where he’s lived for 30 years and didn’t stop playing for money until he was 55 years old.</p>
<p>Asked only last year when was the last time he’d dunked a basketball, he told Duquesne women’s basketball coach Dan Burt, “Oh, about six weeks ago.”</p>
<p>Stew will be 76 next month.</p>
<p>“He’s just a very wise, very deep man,” said Burt, whose friendship with Johnson combusted out of nothing along the trail of Burt’s well-established recruiting aptitudes. “Before I was leaving for FIBA European Championships, I was able to find the rosters of all the teams including the team from Sweden, and I was scanning the teams for height, and I came across Precious Johnson, which is certainly not a very Swedish name. I went to social media and found her. She looks like she’s biracial. I find her mother, who is obviously Swedish, but then I’m like, ‘Who is Stew Johnson? Is he a businessman, was he in the military, is he an athlete, is he an African? I don’t know. I sent him a Facebook message about Duquesne University and about myself and the City of Pittsburgh, and literally within 20 minutes I got a message back saying, ‘Hey Dan, I’m from Clairton!’”</p>
<p>Precious will be a sophomore at Duquesne this year. She’s 6-4 and gifted, likely with a WNBA future. But the growing friendship between her coach and her father recently triggered a remarkable, hour-long Zoom call in which Stew Johnson walked the entire team through his career and his life, triumphant in its way certainly, but a dangerous and painful walk just the same.</p>
<p>He was moved. They were spellbound.</p>
<p>“It made me feel good to talk to the young people because when I was in the center of the civil rights thing, I was about their age, so I know what they’re going through,” Stew told me on the phone from Sweden this past week. “It hurts me to have to relate some of the things that happened then because it’s not so far distant from what’s happening today. It’s their time now, and there’s no putting off any of this. I’m sorry from the bottom of my heart that we have to go through all this again. One difference this time is that we are much more educated. We’ve got our PhDs and master’s degrees. For me to say what I said to those kids was in the hope that they’ll think about it and spread it on to others. What good is your experience if you don’t share it? Basketball’s been my pulpit and my passion.”</p>
<p>Stew Johnson found a more virulent strain of hatred at Murray State in the mid-1960s than he ever had in Clairton, where his father was a policeman. The bedrock racism in Calloway County, Ky., was enough that his teammates would often sleep with him on the bus because their hotel wouldn’t admit him. At restaurants, his white teammates would be served at tables while Johnson was handed a doggy bag. None of it sidetracked his game or his scholarship, but it helped drive him into the inspiring company of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., of Ralph Abernathy, of the same John Lewis who will lie in state at the U.S. Capitol this week. Ultimately, Stew did a stint with the Black Panthers, which, for you young people, was not an ABA team.</p>
<p>“Our players are very active in regard to social justice and the issues that society faces today,” Burt said the other day. “They wanted a voice and an ability to speak out, but they also want to know some of the history that goes deeper than just George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, so I knew Stew’s experiences and I just really felt that his experiences really resonated today with what was going on. Our players and society in general need to hear a story like that, a story that has such depth to it.”</p>
<p>The players asked questions, not so many on Stew’s time in Birmingham with Dr. King, the dogs, the hoses, the fear, the incendiary images, but more on how to negotiate the new dynamic where athletes might likely kneel during the anthem for years to come, where the Boston Red Sox, the last MLB team to integrate, have erected a Black Lives Matter banner that stretches 250 feet along the border of Fenway Park that faces the Massachusetts Turnpike, and where, as Johnson put it them, “you can turn a losing situation into a winning situation.”</p>
<p>“You never know who’s watching,” he said to them. “You never know who you can help. It pays to be kind. It’s your time, and it’s time to make positive memories. The world doesn’t have to be the way it is now.”</p>
<p>Precious told me she was appreciative of the reaction she’s gotten to her father’s story from teammates and coaches, even if it might have sounded to her like a version of Dad’s Greatest Hits.</p>
<p>“From a young age, his stories made me open my eyes and understand the importance of self-love and acceptance, because in life there will be people that will make a judgment based on the complexion of our skin,” she wrote in an email. “I think I understood it, but at the same time, I do not think that it is until you witness or face something on your own that you truly understand it. I have heard many stories from the other Black and biracial girls on the team about how they have been treated differently because of the color of their skin ,and it is sad to hear that even in the year 2020 racism is alive and well. I personally have had the N-word used against me at a younger age, and at the time I was of course hurt but also remembered what my dad told me and learned to focus less on the minds of the ignorant and focus on me as a person. He told us that as members of the Duquesne women’s basketball family, we should want all our family members to feel included and valued, something my father expressed he was never able to feel during his college years, and that’s why he expressed the importance of being vocal in the sense of actually using our voice for something positive and spreading awareness about Black Lives Matter, because being quiet is compliance.”</p>
<p>Virus willing, they’ll play basketball at Duquesne this winter, but after just one single, solid Internet hour on the life and times of Stew Johnson, the game just might just have new meaning, as might their young lives.</p>
