<h1>Ron Cook: In the wake of the Penguins’ lost weekend, Mike Sullivan remains a terrific coach</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>You think you’re down on the Penguins after they went 0-for-the-weekend and were blown out by Washington and Carolina on home ice?</p>
<p>You should have been in the team room Sunday afternoon after the 6-2 beating by Carolina, a loss even more embarrassing than the 5-2 defeat against Washington on Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>“These guys, they care a lot. They’re invested,” Mike Sullivan said. “When it doesn’t go the right way, we feel it more than anybody.”</p>
<p>That pain was obvious after the Penguins’ eighth loss in 10 games since they briefly — emphasis on briefly — moved into first place in the Metropolitan Division Feb. 18 with a home win against Toronto. This morning, they are in third place, five points behind both Washington and Philadelphia.</p>
<p>“We’re obviously not thrilled with the position we’re in over the last few weeks,” Sullivan said. “Details of our game have slipped. We all have to take ownership for it. Now, we have to take responsibility for pulling ourselves out of it.</p>
<p>“I believe in this group of players. I think we have a great group. I think we have what it takes. I know we’re capable of more. It’s my job to get it out of them. We’ll do our best.”</p>
<p>That was the only positive to come out of the lost weekend.</p>
<p>Sullivan remains in charge. He is a terrific coach. I have just as much faith in him as I do in Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, maybe more. If anyone can lead the team out of its collective funk, it’s him.</p>
<p>I know, Sullivan is facing a big challenge. It’s not just one thing. It’s a variety of mistakes that are beating the Penguins almost beyond recognition. Saturday, it was odd-man breaks. Sunday, it was poor defensive zone coverage and 16 giveaways compared to just five by Carolina. The Penguins have given up an average of four goals in the past 10 games. The goaltending, so strong for much of the season, hasn’t been good enough to pick up the team. Tristan Jarry gave up the six goals to Carolina after Matt Murray allowed five against Washington. The power play also hasn’t been nearly good enough. Malkin scored a 5-on-3 goal Sunday, but the power play did nothing with its other six chances.</p>
<p>But as overwhelming as the problems seem, the solution is relatively simple, according to Sullivan.</p>
<p>“It starts with a certain attitude. It starts with a level of enthusiasm that we have to regain. I think that’s an important aspect of winning. We’ve got to try to find a way to celebrate some of the small successes so we build our team confidence and build our team attitude and get our swagger back. Right now, we don’t have a lot of it. We’ve got to get it back.</p>
<p>“It’s about making the right decisions and keeping the game simple and working for one another. I think that’s the important part of it. Right now, I think our team looks a little disconnected. It’s not collective, cooperative play. There has to be five guys working cohesively out there, working together in all three zones, both with the puck and without the puck. The league is too hard. It’s hard to take it by yourself and think you’re going to go through five guys and score a goal. It’s just too hard. We have to get back to our team game. That’s what it boils down.</p>
<p>“The responsibility falls on me to make sure that I try to sell the message so that we buy in.”</p>
<p>That shouldn’t be a hard sell.</p>
<p>The Penguins’ confidence might be lower than it’s been at any time during the Sullivan era, but, as he noted, “You can’t use that as an excuse to not find your game. I think a big part of the solution is simplifying the game. Shooting the puck more. Going to the net. Using our speed. Then, we’ve got to pay attention to the details. I think confidence, you can get back just as quickly as you lose it. We just have to make sure we rely on another and trust one another through the process.”</p>
<p>It helps that the Penguins have strong leaders, starting with Crosby and Malkin. Recently acquired Jason Zucker and Patrick Marleau are older pros who aren’t going to panic. It’s nice that Brian Dumoulin finally is back.</p>
<p>“One of the things I said to them is that the answers are inside our dressing room,” Sullivan said of his longer-than-usual postgame address to his players. “We’ve got to make sure that we bring the right attitude to the rink so that we can work ourselves out of this. We’ve got to rely on one another. We’ve got to trust one another.”</p>
<p>That doesn’t start with the game Tuesday night at New Jersey.</p>
<p>It starts with the work day Monday at the UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex in Cranberry Township.</p>
<p>“We practice these things every day,” Sullivan said. “We watch film. We try to learn from all of the experiences.</p>
<p>“We’re going to try to move by this and pick ourselves up and get back in the fight.”</p>
<p>More than a few people already have counted the Penguins out.</p>
<p>I am not among them.</p>
<p>Sullivan is the big reason.</p>
