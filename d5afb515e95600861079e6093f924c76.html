<h1>Paul Zeise: NBA's G-League finally provides viable alternative to college</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The G-League, which is the official minor league of the NBA, signed the No., 1 high school player in the country this week, Jalen Green of California. Isaiah Todd, considered one of the top-15 players in the country, followed suit and signed a contract, and soon there will be several others.</p>
<p>Apparently the G-League is offering packages that give these players the ability to make up to $500,000 through endorsements and salary. There is also a plan in place for them to have an ability to make even more money. They are guaranteed a college scholarship and will get one-on-one training for a year. It is all detailed in a Sports Illustrated column that claims <a href="https://www.si.com/college/2020/04/16/jalen-green-g-league-ncaa-nba-competitors" target="_blank">the NBA and NCAA are now competitors</a>.</p>
<p>There are some people who think this is a bad development. I can’t quite figure this out to be honest as</p>
<p>This may be the best news I’ve read in a long time regarding college basketball. Sure, it was fun watching the Zion Williamsons of the world come to college — many against their will — and play for a season, but it isn’t what’s best for the sport. Nor is it morally the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I’ve often said the NBA’s age limit rule (aka the one-and-done rule) goes against everything we stand for in a free country. If a high school player thinks he is ready to go to the NBA and wants to give it a try, he should be allowed to. The fact that these players have had to go through some sort of charade of going to school for a year before they are eligible to be drafted was a crime.</p>
<p>And please, spare me the silly nonsense of&nbsp;“Nobody forced them to go to college” as if playing in Europe is a legitimate option for most of these players. It’s silly to ask kids to leave their families and go to a foreign country to play in a professional league against grown men. If they can do that there, why can’t they just do it here in the United States in the NBA?</p>
<p>The flip side is the NBA put the rule in for one reason — so it can essentially keep a free minor league system. The NBA was tired of developing first round picks coming straight out of high school so it instituted a rule so that colleges could take on the expense of developing players.</p>
<p>It was as corrupt of a system as there was. The NBA is worth billions and shouldn’t be leaning on colleges to develop its players. And colleges shouldn’t be a place where players who have no interest in being in school are there because they want to go play basketball for a living.</p>
<p>Now we have the G-League, which is run and funded by the NBA, finally making it right for all involved — the players, the NBA and college basketball. Players, at least the top ones, have a chance to go straight into professional basketball and cash in immediately on their talent. The NBA gets a chance to develop players as well as find out about their talent at a deeply discounted rate over having to pay them as lottery picks.</p>
<p>And college basketball programs and coaches can try and build programs with players who, at least on some level, actually want to be there. This also could perhaps lessen — it won’t eliminate — the stench of payoffs and corruption that plagues the sport and has it currently mired in an FBI Investigation. Corrupt programs won’t be able to outbid the G-League for the top players they want, and that is a good thing.</p>
<p>This will also be great for players because they will develop more given the “Academy-like” instruction for a year.&nbsp;A college player is allowed an extremely limited number of hours of instruction over the summer. Then during the season there is about 20 hours a week they are allowed to be develop with coaches, not to mention classes, study halls and other obligations. A professional basketball player works on one thing — his basketball game. He can workout every day, he can practice as much as he needs and he will have the benefit of the best instruction in the world.</p>
<p>This isn’t a perfect solution, but it’s far superior to the idea of forcing one-and-done players to go to school for a year.</p>
