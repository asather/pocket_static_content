<h1>Peters Township safety Donovan McMillon commits to Florida</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One of the most heavily recruited players in the WPIAL revealed his college decision Saturday evening, as Peters Township safety Donovan McMillon announced his verbal commitment to Florida.</p>
<p>McMillon, a 6-foot-2, 193-pounder who helped guide the Indians to an appearance in the WPIAL Class 5A championship last season, received scholarship offers from more than a dozen Power Five programs after the end of his junior year. Considered a three-star prospect by Rivals and a four-star prospect by 247 Sports, he narrowed his final list to five schools before making his decision, choosing Florida over Virginia Tech, Texas A&amp;M, Oklahoma and Oregon.</p>
<p>“Having all these offers come within such a short period of time these past six months has just blown my mind,” McMillon said in a <a href="https://twitter.com/donovanmcmillo3/status/1284631833209176066?s=20" target="_blank">video</a> posted on his Twitter account announcing his decision. “I’m pretty speechless about it.”</p>
<p>McMillon didn’t spend much time on offense last season, though he did catch 12 passes for 102 yards. The defensive side of the ball is where he made a name for himself. Going into last year’s WPIAL championship, McMillon had been credited with a team-high 78 tackles — including seven tackles for loss — along with two sacks, two interceptions, four forced fumbles and two fumble recoveries.</p>
<p>At the end of his junior season, McMillon had offers from Pitt and a few mid-major Football Bowl Subdivision programs. But soon after the first of the national powerhouses extended an offer, the rest just kept flowing in.</p>
<p>“I think what went into making my final decision was finding a home from home,” McMillon said in the video. His father,&nbsp;Peters Township co-defensive coordinator Darrin McMillon, is from Florida.</p>
<p>Along with being a blue-chip recruit on the football field, McMillon is also one of the best wrestlers in the WPIAL. He finished second in the 182-pound weight class at the WPIAL and PIAA Class 3A individual championships earlier this year, losing only to Canon-McMillan’s Gerrit Nijenhuis both times.</p>
<p>McMillon will now attempt to lead the Indians to a return trip to the WPIAL title game in Class 5A before heading down south to Gainesville in 2021.</p>
