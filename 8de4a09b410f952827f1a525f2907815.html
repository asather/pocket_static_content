<p>Allegheny County reported six new deaths on Monday, and the state’s figures, which were released an hour later, said the county’s nursing/long-term care homes accounted for the six deaths.</p>
<p>With the exception of Westmoreland County, where its coroner reported three new deaths, there were no other fatalities blamed on COVID-19 in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Allegheny also reported 13 new cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Allegheny County, which reported zero deaths on Sunday, now has 79. The number of cases now totals 1,224 since the first instance was reported on March 14</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s total cases to date include 1,190 confirmed and 34 probable, according to the county health department. A case is probable “when the person displays symptoms of COVID-19 and has had close contact with a confirmed positive case but has not had a positive test themselves,” according to a statement accompanying the numbers.</p>
<p>Of the 1,224 cases, 169 of them — or 14% of the total number of cases —&nbsp;have been healthcare workers, the county said. There are 213 past or present hospitalizations.</p>
<p>Among those who have died, 72 are confirmed (had a positive test) and seven were probable. “A probable death is one where COVID-19 is listed on the deceased’s death certificate, but the person never had a positive test for the virus,” the county said.</p>
<p>Allegheny County’s totals are the highest in Western Pennsylvania. Philadelphia County has the highest totals in the state with&nbsp;11,361 cases and 274 deaths, according to the state.</p>
