<h1>Reaction mixed to environmental grand jury findings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A statewide grand jury investigating environmental and health impacts of the shale gas industry heard testimony that some children exposed to emissions from those operations develop a painful condition that looks like alligator skin and is common enough to get its own nickname: “frack rash.”</p>
<p>The grand jury also was told children in the shale gas drilling regions of southwestern and northeastern Pennsylvania experienced severe nighttime nosebleeds, cramping, bruising and vomiting, and doctors testified that children who have suffered persistent health problems related to shale gas operations near their homes should participate in regular cancer screenings.</p>
<p>Dogs and horses drank tainted water, got ill and died, according to the grand jury report released last week by state Attorney General Josh Shapiro.&nbsp;Goats, sheep and cows became infertile or produced deformed offspring. Blood tests conducted after the animals died showed fracking-related chemicals in their bodies.</p>
<p>“This reality is not something that should be tolerated,” the report states. “We find it unacceptable that, for many living in close proximity to unconventional oil and gas operations, their health is jeopardized and their constitutional right to “clean air” and “pure water” has been rendered a fiction.”</p>
<p>For some, including the state Department of Environmental Protection and the Department of Health, the testimony heard by the grand jury sitting in Pittsburgh during its two-year investigation is anecdotal and shouldn’t be considered evidence of weak regulations or oversight. For others it’s fresh ammunition for calls to&nbsp; tighten regulation and enforcement of the industry as the grand jury report recommends.</p>
<p>Several environmental organizations and state Rep. Daylin Leach, D-Montgomery, would go further and have proposed banning the shale gas extraction method technology known as “fracking,” which pumps millions of gallons of water, tons of sand and chemicals a mile or more underground to fracture a shale formation and release the gases it contains.</p>
<p>“We all know the environmental impact is deeply troubling, but the human impact is intolerable,” said Mr. Leach, who has toured many shale gas sites over the last decade. “To those living not just near the wells, but also near the pipelines, compressor and pigging stations, there is no amount of money that makes it worth the impact to their health and property.”</p>
<p>The gas industry drilled its first well into the Marcellus Shale under Washington County in 2004, and the state departments of environment and health have been playing catch-up ever since, according to the grand jury report, which also notes that deliberate policy decisions by governors and laws passed by legislators supported the shale gas industry as an important economic driver.</p>
<p>The methane and other “wet” gases in the sedimentary shale layers underlying Pennsylvania have made it the second largest producer of natural gas in the U.S. and economically revitalized many rural areas. <span class="comment" data-mce-mark="1"><br></span></p>
<p>“However, policy decisions also have consequences, and in this case, one consequence of the decisions made by multiple administrations and DEP was inadequate supervision of an industry which had — and continues to have — significant impacts on the Commonwealth’s citizens,” the report states. “While it may not have been intentional or malicious, ultimately, DEP failed to meet its mission ‘to protect Pennsylvania’s air, land and water from pollution and to provide for the health and safety of its citizens.’”</p>
<p>The state’s environment and health departments disagree.</p>
<p>The DEP, in its 54-page response, submitted to the grand jury by an outside law firm, Pietragallo Gordon Alfano Bosick &amp; Raspanti, hired by the department, sought to assure the public that “the oversight of this industry now in place is comprehensive, responsive and protective.”</p>
<p>While the DEP admitted that the scale of the new industry was “unprecedented,” and required the department to develop new approaches and programs to regulate the industry, the response document defended department practices and criticized the grand jury report for painting an “inaccurate and incomplete” picture of the state’s regulatory efforts based on hearsay and anecdotes.</p>
<p>The department’s legalistic defense of its regulatory efforts states that while the grand jury report highlighted “distressing and serious” stories about health problems of people living near the shale gas operations, those accounts are “unsubstantiated” by names, dates, locations, medical records or the testimony of medical professionals.</p>
<p>“While the report states that the evidence was clear and convincing, there is no documentation of these occurrences nor any evidence to associate these health effects with unconventional drilling,” the department states.<span class="comment"><br></span></p>
<p><strong>Different perspectives</strong></p>
<p>Several of the DEP’s past secretaries testified before the grand jury and some told different stories or hold different perspectives.</p>
<p>John Hanger, who was appointed by Gov. Ed Rendell and headed the department from 2008 to 2011, told the grand jury the delay in putting shale gas regulations in place was “partly political,” and the industry was “very, very successful” in blocking regulations.</p>
<p>Mr. Hanger, in a phone conversation last week, said he’s happy the attorney general is making environmental crimes a priority, and noted that the grand jury investigation filed charges two weeks ago against Cabot Oil and Gas, for contaminating groundwater used by 19 families in Susquehanna County beginning in 2008. He said that because of the enforcement actions during his time as DEP secretary,&nbsp; Cabot paid the families $4.6 million, plugged two bad gas wells and was prohibited from drilling gas wells on its leases in the county.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The state’s regulation of shale gas development was strengthened under Gov. Rendell, Mr. Hanger said, but a new shale gas regulatory package wasn’t proposed until 2013, and Act 13, the state’s current gas law,&nbsp; wasn’t adopted until 2016, 12 years after the first well was drilled..</p>
<p>John Quigley, appointed by Gov. Tom Wolf as secretary from 2015-2016, declined an interview request, but told the grand jury that he had “significant concerns” about public health risks posed by the shale gas industry and the inadequacy of establishing a meaningful health registry with the $100,000 approved by the state Legislature.</p>
<p>Michael Krancer, who headed the DEP under Gov. Tom Corbett from 2011 to 2013, testified that the department was able to address regulatory shortcomings by issuing new policies and guidelines to manage the shale gas industry. But the grand jury deemed those efforts too little and too late.</p>
<p>David Hess, Gov. Tom Ridge’s DEP secretary from 2001 to 2003, just before the start of the shale gas drilling boom, did not testify before the grand jury, but said the shale gas impacts addressed in the report are “real and significant,” though the issues shouldn’t be a surprise.</p>
<p>“... Most of it has been reported by media, citizens and medical groups during the 17 years shale gas drilling has been going on in Pennsylvania,” said Mr. Hess, who closely follows environmental issues in the state and oversees the PA Environmental Digest Blog. ”Gathering it in one place gave it more public impact.”</p>
<p>The state’s shale gas drilling law, touted by the industry as among the toughest in the nation, could have been much stricter and more along the lines of the recommendations proposed by the grand jury report, Mr. Hess said.</p>
<p>Those&nbsp; recommendations include the expansion of no drilling zones around homes from 500 feet to 2,500 feet, and 5,000 feet around hospitals and schools; public disclosure of all drilling and fracking chemicals; stricter regulation of gathering gas pipelines; aggregation and tighter regulation of air pollution emissions from gas wells, processing and compressor stations; safer truck transport of drilling and fracking waste; a more comprehensive assessment of the public health impacts of the shale gas industry, and allowing the attorney general to pursue criminal investigations of the industry.</p>
<p>Under existing law, the attorney general cannot pursue cases unless referred by other state or local agencies.</p>
<p><strong>Work ‘evolving’</strong></p>
<p>The Department of Health, despite its expertise in dealing with public health issues, initially seemed to have a hands-off policy when it came to gas field residents’ complaints about health impacts from exposure to industry contaminated air and water, the report states.</p>
<p>In its 15-page response to the grand jury report, the Health Department stated its work on the health impacts of the shale gas industry is “evolving,” and that it has begun a three-year, $3 million retrospective study to examine the possible health impacts of the shale gas industry by gathering and analyzing data from past complaints.</p>
<p>But because the Health Department discouraged such complaints, the grand jury stated there may not be much to review, and opined that the department remains in a “state of denial” about the health impacts caused by the industry.</p>
<p>The Health Department in its response stated that a definitive link between fracking and human health impacts “has not been proven.” But the grand jury stated the department has “gone out of its way in the past” not to examine the connection between public health and the 12,000 shale gas wells already drilled in the state.</p>
<p>“The circumstantial evidence is compelling and we think it was the department’s job to look at it,” the grand jury stated. “The new study is a start, but is still far from the proper response of a public health agency.”</p>
<p><em>The Health Department urges individuals who believe they are suffering health impacts from shale gas development to report those problems to DOH by telephone at 717-787-3350 or e-mail at env.health.concern@pa.gov.</em></p>
