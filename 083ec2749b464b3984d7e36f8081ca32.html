<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Penn State University is postponing spring commencement ceremonies across its campuses statewide including University Park, will extend online instruction through spring semester’s end and administer final exams remotely.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://news.psu.edu/story/612155/2020/03/18/academics/penn-state-extends-remote-course-delivery-through-spring-semester" target="_blank">university officials said Wednesday morning that</a>&nbsp;thousands of students will receive instructions on when they are allowed to return to campus to move their belongings out of dorms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The move follows by a day Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.emergency.pitt.edu/covid-19/updates/update-2020-commencement-ceremonies" target="_blank">announcement by the University of Pittsburgh</a> that it, too, was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/17/University-Pittsburgh-commencement-graduation-postponed-COVID-19-coronavirus-precaution/stories/202003170157" target="_blank">postponing commencement</a>. Elsewhere in the nation, a number of institutions including the University of Michigan have taken similar steps, and the University of Pennsylvania said Tuesday it would hold a virtual ceremony.</p>
<p>Robert Morris University said its May 8-9 ceremonies will be replaced by a live-streamed virtual event and that students will receive a souvenir program and honors medallions, as well as honorary cords and sashes. Graduates also can walk in a future traditional commencement.</p>
<p>“I am very sorry this has to happen, and I can only imagine what a disappointment this must be to our graduating seniors and those preparing to complete master’s and doctoral degrees,” President&nbsp;Christopher Howard told degree candidates.</p>
<p>Penn State is exploring “options for celebrating the achievements of our students,” according to a university statement regarding its decision on final exams and various events planned for May.</p>
<p>“These decisions align with recommendations from the federal government that call for restricting of all gatherings of more than 10 people.” officials added.</p>
<p>“Graduation is a significant milestone for our students and while it may not be the same as our traditional ceremony, we are committed to finding the best way possible to recognize the achievements of our graduates,” Penn State President Eric J. Barron told campus. “However, as the world works together to slow the spread of COVID-19, these decisions must be made with public health at the forefront along with the health and wellness of our students, faculty, staff, their families, and our local communities.”</p>
<p>Pitt had hoped to hold ceremonies next month including an April 26 event for undergraduates in the Petersen Events Center. Officials said they intend to reschedule when it is safe to do so.</p>
<p>“We recognize that this is not how any of you imagined this year ending — without the time to celebrate together and say farewell to the friends, mentors and the University that has fostered and witnessed your academic and personal success,” Chancellor Patrick Gallagher said in a message to campus.</p>
<p>“Please be assured that the University is committed to celebrating our graduating students’ impressive achievements when it is safe to do so,” he added.</p>
<p>State System of Higher Education spokesman David Pidgeon said Wednesday that officials were not yet ready to announce a decision on commencements at the 14 state-owned universities. However, at least one in Western Pennsyvlania, Clarion University, began notifying seniors that it would look for alternative dates.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, Saint Vincent College <a href="https://stvincent.edu/student-life/coronavirus-update" target="_blank">said it had decided</a> to look for an alternate date for its ceremony in May.</p>
<p>The University of Pennsylvania’s president sought to reassure students.</p>
<p>“The day of your scheduled Commencement, May 18, should not pass without recognizing that you are now Penn graduates, which we will do virtually,” Penn President Amy Gutmann told campus. “We also will celebrate and honor you in person with Commencement ceremonies on Penn’s campus when it is safe and feasible to do so.”</p>
<p>She, like Pitt’s Gallagher, acknowledged students’ dashed hopes this semester, but told them,&nbsp;“your amazing Penn story does not end this way. I promise.”</p>
