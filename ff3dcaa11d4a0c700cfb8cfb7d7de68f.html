<h1>How Pitt women's basketball coach Lance White ended up courtside with Obama and Shaq</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even as a global pandemic raged on, forcing them to view the festivities digitally, some of the most recognizable figures in basketball and American life gathered courtside for game one of the NBA Finals on Wednesday night.</p>
<p>Front and center on a 17-foot LED screen along the sideline of the court at the ESPN Wide World of Sports Complex in Florida was former president Barack Obama. On either side of him were Shaquille O’Neal and James Worthy. Farther down the first row were Dwyane Wade and Robin Roberts. In the row behind them were, among others, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Clyde Drexler, Paul Pierce, Ray Allen and Pau Gasol.</p>
<p>Among that smattering of faces was, for many of the millions watching nationally, someone slightly less famous. But for a certain segment of Western Pennsylvanians, the man seated behind Manu Ginobili and in front of Dirk Nowitzki and Bill Walton evoked a feeling of ‘Hey, I think I know that guy.’</p>
<p>Indeed, they do. On Wednesday night, as the biggest event in American basketball tipped off, Pitt women’s basketball coach Lance White found himself in elite company, with his face placed alongside some of some of the biggest stars in basketball, politics and media, all with a national television audience watching along.</p>
<p>“I thought going into it we would just be a virtual fan sitting in one of those seats,” White said. “Hopefully, you’d be able to see yourself over the course of the game. Whenever that popped up and they started it, it was like, ‘What on Earth?’ I had no idea what I was getting into.”</p>
<p>Throughout the duration of the NBA bubble, the league has had virtual fans projected from large screens bordering the court, all of them watching their teams from the comfort and safety of their homes.</p>
<p>Which brings us to White. His wife, Melanie, had previously signed up to be a poll worker for the upcoming November election. Earlier this year, Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James, who had 23 points in his team’s win Wednesday night against the Miami Heat, formed a voting rights organization, More Than A Vote, that has recruited more than 10,000 poll workers like Melanie. To mark the occasion, the NBA had 40 first-time poll workers participate in Wednesday’s Finals game as virtual fans, with Melanie being selected as part of that group.</p>
<p>While thrilled for the opportunity, White and his family didn’t expect what awaited them, thinking instead they would have their picture plastered on a cardboard cutout in a seat or placed among other largely anonymous fans like themselves.</p>
<p>But as his wife was setting up the equipment in the family’s living room, getting ready for the game, White realized that wasn’t going to be the case.</p>
<p>“I walk by and she’s plugging it in and I go, ‘That looks like Dirk. I think that’s Dirk,’” White said. “She’s like ‘No, honey, these are poll workers.’ Then I keep looking and I go, ‘That’s Kareem. That’s Bill Walton. That’s Shaq. That’s D-Wade. That’s Robin Roberts.’”</p>
<p>It wasn’t merely that White was alongside former NBA MVPs and champions. All virtual fans were placed in a virtual conferencing meeting, giving them the opportunity to interact with one another. In White’s case, it gave the Lakers fan access to childhood heroes, allowing him to say hello to O’Neal and Abdul-Jabbar. The conversations were limited — White said most of the players on the call didn’t stay through most of it — but it was nonetheless surreal.</p>
<p>And that was before a previously teased special guest turned out to be Obama, who took questions from participants, be it Wade or one of the poll workers. O’Neal later asked him what he thought of the presidential debate the previous night, which White said Obama politely avoided opining on beyond complimentary words about his former vice president, Joe Biden.</p>
<p>As the game began and attention occasionally shifted to the screen on which he was appearing, White received a barrage of texts from friends and acquaintances, many of them echoing a common confusion.</p>
<p>“People started saying, ‘Was that really you?’” White said. “Yeah, I’m just hanging out with my friends.”</p>
<p>Over the course of the game, other members of White’s family, like his son Quentin, made appearances, giving them their own slice of the spotlight. It doesn’t hurt, either, that being courtside as James began his quest for a fourth NBA Finals ring is something White, with a laugh, said makes for a nice addition to future recruiting pitches.</p>
<p>For a lifelong basketball fan who now works in the sport, the chance to find himself in the digital proximity of Obama and members of the Showtime Lakers teams of the 1980s that fostered his obsession with the game was one he won’t soon, if ever, forget.</p>
<p>“That group is really what defined so much of my love for the game, watching those guys,” White said. “Now, a couple of them are on there. What a cool moment.”</p>
