<h1>Shaler teacher charged with identity theft</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Shaler Area Middle School teacher was charged with identity theft after allegedly stealing several of her co-workers’ identifications.</p>
<p>Jeannine Vittorino, 45, was charged Saturday with retail theft, identity theft, corruption of minors and other charges, according to court documents.</p>
<p>Several teachers at Shaler Area Middle began noticing their driver’s licenses went missing after they interacted with Ms. Vittorino, according to a criminal complaint. After one teacher went to a TJ Maxx store to make a return, store employees told her she was banned from making returns at all TJ Maxx stores.</p>
<p>That teacher ran her driver’s license through a software that tracks store returns, and noticed over a dozen suspicious transactions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When police checked store surveillance images, they saw multiple instances in which Ms. Vittorino made fraudulent returns, the complaint reads.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The Shaler Area School District is cooperating with law enforcement on this matter,” superintendent&nbsp;Sean Aiken said in an emailed statement.</p>
<p>Mr. Aiken would not comment on whether the district had taken disciplinary action against Ms. Vittorino because it is a personnel matter.</p>
<p>Ms. Vittorino’s preliminary hearing is set for Feb. 13.&nbsp;</p>
