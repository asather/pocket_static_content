<p>As neighboring states take different tactics on reopening restaurants closed by the COVID-19 pandemic, Eat’n Park Hospitality Group announced Thursday that it plans to begin offering dine-in service at locations on Ohio and West Virginia starting next week.</p>
<p>The Homestead-based restaurant chain also said it plans to reopen for takeout service a number of Eat’n Park locations that had been closed entirely by the shutdown orders, as well as offering takeout from The Porch restaurants in Oakland and in Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>The company’s restaurants in Pennsylvania will not be opening for dine-in service yet, because that’s not permitted under the yellow phase of the state’s tiered system for gradually allowing more operations to reopen.</p>
<p>But in Ohio, the state has said restaurants can fully reopen on Friday, as long as they follow certain limits, including&nbsp;parties of 10 or fewer and spacing between tables either by a barrier or 6 feet of distance, according to the Associated Press.</p>
<p>“As the quarantine period has progressed, more and more people have been looking to bring their familiar favorite restaurants back into their food life, so it’s the right time to reopen all our locations,” said Kevin O’Connell, Eat’n Park’s chief marketing office, in the announcement.</p>
<p>In April, Mr. O’Connell had said that the company lost 85% of its sales when the COVID-19 shutdown orders in mid-March forced it to close its dining rooms and move to takeout-only service. The company said it had initially laid off about 80% of its employees.</p>
<p>In an effort to bring in more business, the company that month added some grocery items to its takeout menu, offering things like milk, bread, toilet paper and fresh vegetables.</p>
<p>In addition to the Eat’n Park locations reopening for dine-in service on Tuesday, Hello Bistro, a salad concept also operated by the company, will reopen two Cleveland-area locations for dine-in and takeout service, according to the announcement Thursday.</p>
<p>Hello Bistro sites in State College won’t open again until the Penn State campus reopens.</p>
