<h1>Appeals court allows Texas to continue coronavirus abortion ban</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Overruling a federal judge, a divided appeals court Monday gave Texas permission to continue banning most abortions as part of a wider fight against COVID-19.</p>
<p>The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling, lifted a temporary restraining order imposed by U.S. District Judge Lee Yeakel.</p>
<p>The controversy flared after Gov. Greg Abbott issued a March 22 emergency order barring elective surgeries and medical procedures in hopes of freeing hospital space for COVID-19 patients and conserve gloves, gowns and breathing masks needed to protect health care workers during the pandemic.</p>
<p>One day later, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton announced that Abbott's order banned abortions unless a woman's life or health were at risk, an exception that applies to very few circumstances, and promised to pursue criminal charges against abortion providers who continued operating.</p>
<p>Providers canceled several hundred appointments and filed suit, leading to last week's ruling from Yeakel that barred enforcement of the policy as a violation of the Constitution and U.S. Supreme Court precedent.</p>

<p>Yeakel said the blanket ban on abortions could not be justified by a policy that would have little impact on preserving protective medical equipment that is rarely used by abortion providers. In addition, the vast majority of abortions are outpatient procedures that do not involve hospitals.</p>
<p>Yeakel also concluded that requiring Texas women to travel out of state for an abortion increased risks during a pandemic, and he said delays could increase the health risks associated with abortion and put the procedure out of reach for some women. Texas bans abortion beyond the 20th week of pregnancy.</p>
<p>Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton quickly appealed, and a divided three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit temporarily blocked Yeakel's ruling to allow time to weigh the appeal.</p>
