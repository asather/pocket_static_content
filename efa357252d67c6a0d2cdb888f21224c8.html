<h1>Merck joins race to develop coronavirus vaccines, therapies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PHILADELPHIA — Merck, a global leader in vaccine development, is joining the frenzied rush to vanquish the coronavirus, announcing Tuesday that it is working on two vaccine candidates and a potential drug therapy.</p>
<p>Merck, which is headquartered in New Jersey and has several facilities in Pennsylvania, is backing two vaccines that involve genetically engineering an inactivated virus as a vehicle to deliver proteins that provoke an immune response to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>Merck has acquired Vienna-based Themis, which is using a weakened strain of the measles virus as the delivery vehicle. Merck is also partnering with IAVI, a nonprofit research organization, on a coronavirus vaccine that uses VSV (vesicular stomatitis virus) as the delivery vehicle. VSV is the same technology on which Merck’s Ebola vaccine is built.</p>

<p>Both experimental immunizations are completing testing in animals, and should begin human testing later this year, Merck said in news releases.</p>
<p>Merck is also collaborating with Miami-based Ridgeback Biotherapeutics on an oral antiviral treatment that was invented at Emory University and has undergone initial human safety tests.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is an enormous scientific, medical, and global health challenge. Merck is collaborating with organizations around the globe to develop anti-infectives and vaccines that aim to alleviate suffering caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection,” Roger M. Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, said in a statement.</p>
<p>Around the world, research is hurtling forward on more than 150 vaccines and 350 drugs intended to relieve the pandemic’s devastation.</p>
<p>Merck had been conspicuously absent from the list of developers, including Pfizer, GlaxoSmithKline, Moderna, Inovio Pharmaceuticals, and research centers such as Philadelphia-based Wistar Institute and Thomas Jefferson University. But with more than 125 years at the scientific forefront and breakthroughs such as the cervical cancer vaccine Gardasil, Merck is a noteworthy addition.</p>
<p>New vaccines traditionally take a decade or more to come to market, from invention to approval to mass production. Nonetheless, experts have said a coronavirus vaccine using some of the latest technologies might be available by mid-2021.</p>
<p>Perlmutter sounded more cautious in an interview with STAT News. “I think the clinical development is going to take longer than people imagine,” he said. “And I hate to sound what some people may regard as a sour note, but I don’t want to overpromise.”</p>
