<p>ALTOONA — Joel Hanrahan continues to climb the organizational ladder.</p>
<p>According to multiple sources, Hanrahan on Thursday is expected to be named pitching coach for Class AAA Indianapolis. Last year, Hanrahan held the same position with Class AA Altoona, the move continuing his upward ascent.</p>
<p>Hanrahan started out as pitching coach with the Bristol Pirates (rookie league) in 2017, then was the pitching coach for the Class A short season West Virginia Power in 2018.</p>
<p>Hanrahan pitched for the Pirates for four seasons (2009-12) and was a two-time All-Star (2011-12), accumulating 82 saves during his Pittsburgh tenure. His 40 saves in 2011 were a club record until Mark Melancon had 51 in 2015.</p>
<p>The Pirates traded Hanrahan to the Boston Red Sox in 2012, when current Pirates general manager Ben Cherington was GM at the time.</p>
<p>Although he had a bit of a rough start, Hanrahan has really taken to the coaching thing. He’s proven adept at creating relationships with players, helping them improve and one day will likely wind up as a pitching coach in the major leagues.</p>
<p>“Working with the guys when the season wasn’t well and then working with them the next year,” <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/pirates/2019/07/12/Joel-Hanrahan-Pirates-Altoona-Curve-pitching-coach-Tommy-John-surgery/stories/201907120064" target="_blank">Hanrahan said this past summer</a>, “and seeing the adjustments that they were able to make and the information that you gave them the year before — you see that playing out the next year, it really keeps you wanting to come back and see the development of the guys.”</p>
