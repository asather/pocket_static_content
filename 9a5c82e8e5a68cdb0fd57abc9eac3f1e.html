<h1>Lake spill earns Mariner East pipelines another $2 million fine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection added a $2 million fine this month to the tally of penalties racked up by Sunoco Pipeline for violations during construction of its <a href="https://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/mariner-east-2-pipeline-horizontal-directional-drilling/" target="_blank">Mariner East 2 pipeline project</a>.</p>
<p>The fine, announced Thursday but issued on Jan. 3, is on top of more than $13 million that Sunoco, a subsidiary of Texas-based Energy Transfer LP, has already been levied by DEP for spills and other damage the company caused while installing its cross-state natural gas liquids pipelines.</p>
<p>The $1.95 million penalty is for a series of spills of lubricating drilling fluids in 2017 while the company was boring paths for parallel pipelines under Raystown Lake in Huntingdon County. More than 208,000 gallons of drilling fluids emerged in the lake, covering 8 acres of its bottom, DEP said.</p>
<p>“In numerous cases, the company failed to immediately report those releases,” DEP Secretary Patrick McDonnell said. Some spills were not reported until 537 days after they occurred, according to the <a href="http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Newsroom/NewsroomPortalFiles/DEP-COA_Raystown_Lake_01-16-2020.pdf" target="_blank">settlement document</a>.</p>
<p>On top of the fine, Sunoco will commit at least $1.15 million to improve fish habitat in Raystown Lake. It also will implement a plan to control invasive aquatic plants in 110 acres of the lake.</p>
<p>Energy Transfer spokeswoman Vicki Granado said the company is "pleased to come to an agreement with the DEP regarding our work at Raystown Lake," which she noted is an important recreational area.</p>
<p>"This will allow us to move forward to complete our construction activities in this area and others," she said.</p>
<p>The Mariner East project includes three pipelines that traverse southern Pennsylvania, carrying propane, butane and ethane from southwestern Pennsylvania shale gas wells to the Philadelphia area, mostly for export.</p>
<p>DEP recently issued Energy Transfer <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/powersource/2020/01/03/Energy-Transfer-30M-penalty-pipeline-explosion-permit-ban-Revolution-Mariner-East/stories/202001030137" target="_blank">a $30.6 million fine</a> for the explosion of its Revolution pipeline in Beaver County in September 2018. Under that agreement, DEP resumed reviewing environmental permits for Energy Transfer projects, including Mariner East, for the first time in nearly a year.</p>
<p>Ms. Granado said the company is working to “re-engage our construction crews and mobilize equipment” now that the permit review suspension has been lifted.</p>
