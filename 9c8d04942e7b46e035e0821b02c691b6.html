<h1>Not everyone is fully on board with Jason Zucker's trade to Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While the Penguins and their fans are mostly delighted by the arrival of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/10/pittsburgh-penguins-trade-minnesota-wild-alex-galchenyuk-jason-zucker/stories/202002100139" target="_blank">newly acquired winger</a> Jason Zucker in Pittsburgh, one important person back in Minnesota doesn’t love the move.</p>
<p>Carly Zucker — Jason’s wife and the mother of two of his children — is <a href="https://kfan.iheart.com/featured/overtime-with-carly-zucker/" target="_blank">a radio host at KFAN 100.3 FM</a> in Minneapolis and won’t be joining him in Pittsburgh. She went on the KFAN Power Trip morning show on Tuesday to discuss her feelings about the trade that sent her husband from the Minnesota Wild to Pittsburgh for Alex Galchenyuk, Calen Addison and a conditional 2020 first-round pick.</p>

<p>“You guys, this is going to be tough,” Carly said. “It’s just way more emotional than I thought it would be. I think we all kind of knew it was coming.”</p>
<p>The trade probably wasn’t a complete surprise because Jason had been in trade rumors for a while, including this summer when the Penguins were trying to trade Phil Kessel in a deal involving him. Kessel <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/11/jason-zucker-penguins-trade-reaction-alex-galchenyuk-wild/stories/202002110113" target="_blank">used his no-trade clause</a> to kill that deal, but Jason still wound up coming to Pittsburgh <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/02/10/Alex-Galchenyuk-trade-Jason-Zucker-Phil-Kessel-Pittsburgh-Penguins-Minnesota-Wild/stories/202002100144" target="_blank">partially in exchange for Galchenyuk</a>, the player the Penguins acquired from the Coyotes for Kessel.</p>
<p>But separating the family still can’t be easy for Carly, who can’t leave Minnesota because <a href="https://theathletic.com/867574/2019/03/14/jason-zucker-wild-trade-deadline-give16-carly-zucker/?redirected=1" target="_blank">she shares custody</a> of Jason’s stepdaughter, Sophia, with her ex-husband, according to The Athletic’s Michael Russo.</p>
<p>“We love it here,” Carly said. “The kids are here. It’s home.</p>
<p>“It just changes a lot at home,” she continued. “It’s hard to imagine doing life without him here. And he’s gone, he left right away, and he won’t be home again until after the season.”</p>
<p>Jason was expected to start in Tuesday’s Penguins game against the Lightning playing on Sidney Crosby’s line.</p>
<p>Though she clearly isn’t thrilled about Jason leaving Minnesota, Carly put out a statement on Twitter this morning expressing her excitement for the next chapter of her husband’s career.</p>
<p>“We are excited to be starting a new adventure in Pittsburgh,” she wrote. “We’ve heard great things about the Penguins organization and their incredible fan base. I can’t wait to experience #pensnation.”</p>
<p>This wouldn’t be the first time a Penguins player had to deal with a long separation from a significant other in another state. Just ask defenseman Zach Trotman, whose <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2019/12/06/Pittsburgh-Pirates-Zach-Trotman-wife-wilkes-barre-scranton/stories/201912060124" target="_blank">wife is the sports director</a> for an NBC affiliate in Flint, Mich., almost 400 miles away from Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“We support each other,” he told the Post-Gazette in December. “I would never ask her to give up her job and what she’s passionate about just so I could do mine. Obviously, she is the same way.”</p>
<p>It sounds like Carly is employing the same mindset with Jason’s new move, even if it’s not the most ideal thing for their family.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to live life as usual,” she said. “It’s not the end of the world.”</p>
