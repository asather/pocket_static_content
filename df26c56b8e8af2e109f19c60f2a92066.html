<h1>Wolf to issue stay-at-home order for Allegheny, hardest-hit counties</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>HARRISBURG — Gov. Tom Wolf plans to order residents of the state’s hardest-hit areas, including Allegheny County, to stay home to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused three deaths statewide, his spokeswoman said Monday.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf will issue the stay-at-home order for Philadelphia and its surrounding counties; Allegheny County, including Pittsburgh; and Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains, said spokeswoman Lyndsay Kensinger.</p>
<p>Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Details about the directive, which will cover 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, are expected Monday afternoon.</p>
<p>It’s the latest in a series of progressively tougher measures imposed by Mr. Wolf in the face of a global pandemic that state officials say threatens to swamp hospitals and spike the death toll. Mr. Wolf had already closed schools and ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to close their physical locations, an edict that state police and other government agencies began enforcing Monday morning.</p>
<p><strong>COURT DISMISSES LAWSUIT ON NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES</strong></p>
<p>Late Sunday, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Mr. Wolf’s authority to close businesses deemed nonessential.</p>
<p>Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have the shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed the edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights.</p>
<p>The court also said a legal challenge to Mr. Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges.</p>
<p>The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.</p>
<p>In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Mr. Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth — a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Mr. Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms.</p>
<p><strong>WOLF TESTS NEGATIVE FOR VIRUS</strong></p>
<p>Mr. Wolf recently tested negative for the coronavirus after being alerted to a potential exposure, his office said Monday.</p>
<p>The governor was tested after his office was contacted by someone who had been near Mr. Wolf and who was showing symptoms of the illness, a spokesperson said. That person was also tested and found to be negative, according to the office.</p>
<p>“The measure was taken out of an abundance of caution,” the spokesperson, Ms. Kensinger, said. “We do not have any evidence that the governor has been in contact with a person who has tested positive for COVID-19."</p>
<p>The governor is working remotely but is not in quarantine.</p>
