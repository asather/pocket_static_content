<h1>Analysis: Pirates' top-six hitters have struggled in different ways</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Amid a 4-14 start to the 2020 season, it’s easy to point fingers around the Pirates’ roster.</p>
<p>Yes, they’ve been unlucky and have been hit with the injury bug perhaps worse than many teams. But that’s mainly been&nbsp;on the pitching side of things.</p>
<p>What is abnormal — and perhaps more unexpected — is the other side of the ball.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ offense, specifically the top of its order, was expected to be one of the team’s strengths. So far, though, the Pirates are in the bottom five in the majors in batting average, runs and home runs. Their usual top-six hitters in the lineup — Adam Frazier, Kevin Newman, Josh Bell, Colin Moran, Bryan Reynolds and Gregory Polanco — have had individual high points but struggled as a collective. Infielder Erik Gonzalez has been the best hitter in the lineup by far. Phillip Evans was there with him, but he broke his jaw and is out for the season.</p>
<p>Of that top six, Newman has the best batting average at .246, and only Reynolds and Moran have positive Wins Above Replacement. Newman is also the only one of the six who has more hits than strikeouts, and none of them have double-digit RBIs.&nbsp;The manner of their individual problems can be broken down into a couple of different categories.</p>
<p>Polanco and Bell, for instance, are hitting the ball extremely hard when they make contact. Polanco is in the 98th and 97th percentile in Major League Baseball in exit velocity and hard hit percentage, respectively. Bell is a little lower in those categories, in the 84th and 73rd percentile.</p>
<p>But those two aren’t making contact very frequently. Polanco is striking out at a higher clip than almost anybody in the league. Similarly, Bell is near the bottom of the league in whiff rate, measuring the amount of swings and misses in relation to the total number of swings Bell takes.</p>
<p>Moran is in a similar boat, though he has a bit more leeway, given that he has been the Pirates’ best power threat this season with six home runs. Still, his whiff and strikeout rates are worse than optimal, even if his production has been good enough that his approach shouldn’t necessarily be called into question yet.</p>
<p>It stands to reason, then, that the solution for these issues could be improved plate discipline. If Bell, Polanco and Moran are punishing the balls they make contact with, then the ideal scenario would be to make pitchers work as much as possible in hopes that they eventually throw a pitch in their happy zone.</p>
<p>Bell, before the Pirates’ game against the Reds last Thursday, spoke to his outlook to try to optimize his at-bats moving forward.</p>
<p>“I feel like it’s all approach,” Bell said. “When you are trying to hit the ball to left-center field, you have just a little bit more time to make swing decisions. When you’re trying to pull the ball, you have to go a little bit earlier. For the most part, at least the at-bats I’ve seen, a lot of the pitches inside have been inside, so it looks like a strike, and it bores in off the zone. Everything away is pretty much away, standard, either two-seamers or changeups down and away. You have to be pick which side of the plate you’re going to try and command, try to dominate and go from there.”</p>
<p>The other side of the equation would be Frazier’s and Newman’s situations. Both have very good strikeout and whiff percentages, but their hard hit percentages and exit velocities are in the 16th percentile or lower among all MLB hitters.</p>
<p>Newman has struggled to put the barrel on the ball this season, with MLB.com having his barrel percentage at zero. Frazier has been making weak contact at a higher clip than league average, too.</p>
<p>Reynolds seems to be somewhere in the middle. His whiff and strikeout rates are at the low end of the league, and his exit velocity and hard hit rate are in the middle of the league. On the bright side, he has shown good plate discipline, with a walk rate well above league average.</p>
<p>All of these percentages and rates can seem a bit in the weeds, but the larger batting averages paint the main picture.</p>
<p>They have each shown flashes in their own right. The frequency with which they’ve done so has not been enough, though, and the Pirates’ offense has struggled as a result.&nbsp;That’s part of the reason they’re currently hitting .211, the second-worst mark in the majors.</p>
<p>What’s unfortunate is that this stretch of games is small, but in 2020, it’s 30% of the season.</p>
<p>The Pirates are going to give up on any of these hitters and cast them aside for the future, but if they hope to salvage some wins the rest of the year, they need the top of their lineup to quickly iron out those individual kinks.</p>
