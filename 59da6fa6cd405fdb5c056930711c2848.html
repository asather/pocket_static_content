<p>FORT MYERS, Fla -- A day that Pirates' manager Derek Shelton jokingly dreaded ended with him getting the last laugh against his old team on Saturday.</p>
<p>"It's great to be back here," Shelton said before the Pirates' 2-0 win against the Minnesota Twins. "I was only here two years, but a lot of these people are like family to me.</p>
<p>Shelton expected a long video montage produced by his friend and Twins manager Rocco Baldelli. There only two pictures on the jumbotron at Hammond Stadium-- one including Shelton wearing a pair of white jeans with a black silk shirt and a gold chain.</p>
<p>Once batting practice ended, the game flowed like most spring training games. The Pirates' entered the game against the Minnesota Twins with a 0-7-1 record. It was Shelton's first win in spring training as the Pirate manager.</p>
<p>Let's get into a few takeaways from the first spring training win for the Pirates.</p>
<p><strong>Holland makes a case for a starting role</strong></p>
<p>Derek Holland pitched 2 2/3 innings as the starter. The left-hander made easy work of a robust Twins lineup by recording outs on eight of the first nine batters he faced. Holland struck out Josh Donaldson and Ehire Adrianza on his first six pitches.</p>
<p>Holland "got into trouble" in the third with two outs. He wound up, leaving the game with the bases loaded. On the surface, this wouldn't seem to be an optimal outcome. Spring training, however, is a result where results don't matter as much as the process. Holland threw mostly offspeed pitches. He wasn't attempting to set up hitters.</p>
<p>"I got the work in that I needed to," Holland said. "I had a gameplan going into the third. Oscar (Pirates pitching coach Marin) and I agreed that I got the results in the first two innings. And it allowed me to throw some stuff I didn't get in my previous outing."</p>
<p>Holland also had a message for Pirate fans who are concerned about the lack of wins during the first week of games.</p>
<p>"We can't get caught up in wins and losses and all that crap during spring," Holland said. "Nobody gets crowned the champions of the Grapefruit or Cactus League. Nobody gets a Cy Young. People need to realize that. Guys are working hard out there."</p>
<p>"This is a time when we try new things. I'm going to go to war with these guys every single day. I know it's frustrating that we aren't winning. But we're doing what we need to get ourselves ready for the season, and that's what more important."</p>
<p>Shelton said before the game that Holland is squarely in the mix for a position in the rotation. It will likely come down to a battle between Steven Brault, Chad Kuhl, and Holland.</p>
<p><strong>Bullpen guys</strong></p>
<p>The Twins possess one of the most feared offenses in baseball. The Pirates pitchers mostly kept them quiet. Dangerous hitters like Josh Donaldson, Nelson Cruz, and Eddie Rosario got mostly kept in check. Blake Weiman only needed three pitches to work a strikeout when Holland left the bases loaded in the third. Rosario swung through an offspeed pitch for the strikeout.</p>
<p>Holland appreciated the effort against a man who hit 32 home runs in 2019.</p>
<p>"That's what spring training is all about," Holland said. "It was great to see Blake go and make those pitches. That is how you make a name for yourself. You want to show people that you can come in and get the job done. Guys like myself and the manager see that and keep that in there.</p>
<p>Richard Rodriguez looked to be in form with an easy fourth inning. The Pirates used nine pitchers in the shutout.</p>
<p><strong>Chad Kuhl</strong></p>
<p>Shelton had good news about Kuhl on Saturday.</p>
<p>"The thing that I saw from him today was a smile on his face," Shelton said. "I think it's the mental part of Tommy John as much as the physical. Being out on the mound and mentally coming off, I think, was draining for him."</p>
<p>Kuhl threw in a game for the first time in nearly two years on Friday. Kuhl pitched 2/3 of an inning and allowed two runs. Most importantly, his pitches looked sound, and he finished healthy.</p>
<p>"Today to be able to see him smile and to say he's got no soreness in the wrong places and there's no pain â€” so the fact that he was able to smile today was outstanding."</p>
<p><strong>More health updates</strong></p>
<p>Kyle Crick will make his spring training debut on Sunday against the Blue Jays. Crick's season ended after having extensor tendon repair surgery on his right index finger.</p>
<p>Crick will compete for a high-leverage spot in the Pirate bullpen.</p>
<p>"I look forward to throwing some of these new catchers and working with them a lot," Crick said. "And getting to know what they do best, what I do best so we can coordinate and get some outs this season.</p>
