<h1>Parishes mull ways to make up lost income, fellowship from fish fries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When a nearby Roman Catholic parish stopped running a fish fry this year, St. John Chrysostom Byzantine Catholic Church in Greenfield decided to start a Lenten meal tradition of its own, with baked fish supplemented with foods from its Slavic ethnic tradition.</p>
<p>It was a fundraiser, but it was more than that, said its pastor, the Rev. Tom Schaefer. It was an opportunity for neighbors —&nbsp;as well as drivers who pass the church on the Parkway East with its two towers topped by golden crosses —&nbsp;to finally get a chance to see the stunning interior of the church.</p>
<p>“I love to watch their expressions” as they see the multi-level iconostasis, or icon stand. “Their jaws drop,” said Father Schaefer.</p>
<p>But at St. John, as with other parishes around the region, the fish fries and other Lenten meals have been canceled, leaving parishes without the community-building activity that is a regional tradition, and also without a source of fundraising that they could have used as the nation heads into a coronavirus-driven economic slump.</p>
<p>This week, the bishops overseeing the Roman Catholic dioceses of Pittsburgh and Greensburg and the Byzantine Catholic Archeparchy of Pittsburgh directed parishes to cancel their fish fries and other Lenten meals. All cited the need for social distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>These guidelines also have led to churches livestreaming liturgies and doing whatever else they can to connect spiritually. But for an inherently physical act like eating together, that will have to wait.</p>
<p>And while people associate fish with Lent, there’s nothing to say they can’t eat it in the Easter season or beyond.</p>
<p>Father Schaefer said he asked parish lay leaders, “Wouldn’t it be fun in May or June to do something unique and say, ‘Come and join us for fish and more?’ The people loved the idea, so we may do something like that.”</p>
<p>Some other parishes are following similar plans, including those that have the freezer capacity to wait, or that had a limited inventory in stock.</p>
<p>“Our plan is whenever the coast is clear to have alternating fish fries for four weeks between the two places,” said the Rev. David Bonnar, administrator of the grouping of&nbsp;St. Bernard and Our Lady of Grace parishes.</p>
<p>At least one parish, St. Ferdinand in Cranberry, sent out word earlier this week it was selling its inventory of thawed and frozen fish to customers on a first-come, first-served basis.</p>
<p>At another grouping of four parishes in the North Hills and Beaver County, the parishes hope to make up for the cancelation with a later event, said the Rev. Jay Donahue, their administrator. The parishes include Ss. John and Paul in Franklin Park, Good Samaritan in Ambridge, Our Lady of Peace in Conway and St. John the Baptist in Baden.</p>
<p>“It’s just a great fellowship,” Father Donahue said. “There’s just so much fun to see everybody. Secondly it’s a great source of income. With no Mass, we have no income coming in from the baskets. it’s really putting a huge stress on paying the bills, keeping the lights on and meeting payroll.”</p>
