<h1>Business leaders urge more testing on call with president about reopening, sources say</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>When the first conference call of President Donald Trump’s economic advisory council on reopening the economy was held Wednesday morning, several business executives echoed a cry that health officials and state and local leaders have been making for weeks, according to two participants: The country needs more testing.</p>
<p>During the call with business leaders from retail, banking, financial services, hospitality and other industries, each executive was given a minute or two to provide his or her overview of what was needed to reopen the economy, according to the participants, who were granted anonymity to describe private communications. There appeared to be a wide consensus that more virus testing was needed to track who was infected and who might have immunity before employees could return to work.</p>
<p>But another issue of great concern to the executives on the call, one of the participants said, was the need to address the liability companies could face if employees were to get sick after returning to work. Workers who felt that they were brought back too soon or were not placed in an adequately safe environment could sue en masse. Details of the call were first reported by <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/business-leaders-tell-trump-to-dramatically-increase-coronavirus-testing-11586974130?tesla=y&amp;mod=article_inline" rel="nofollow">The Wall Street Journal.</a></p>

<p>Some executives were unable to join the call because of scheduling conflicts. David Solomon, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who was leading his own quarterly earnings call at the same time as the White House call, was one of them.</p>
<p>In an indication of his own viewpoint, Solomon — who noted during his earnings call that he had spoken to about 100 chief executives who were Goldman clients about the effects of the virus — said that “we have to rebuild confidence in people’s security and safety around the virus,” and that “unless people feel safe and secure and confident around the virus, the economic impact will continue in some way, shape or form.”</p>
<p>The White House began notifying members of Congress on Wednesday afternoon that they had been selected to serve on another task force to advise Trump on reopening the country. This one would be composed of Democrats and Republicans in the House and Senate.</p>
<p>In emails sent to offices on Capitol Hill, the White House Legislative Affairs Office did not so much invite the lawmakers — numbering at least a dozen — to participate in the task force as inform them that they were expected to serve.</p>
<p>Senate Democrats on Wednesday unveiled a $30 billion plan to vastly ramp up the development, manufacturing and distribution of testing across the country, saying they would push to include it in the next round of government relief.</p>
<p>Democrats said the national blueprint, which would include free testing and reporting mechanisms for testing and tracing, would be essential to eventually reopening the country.</p>
<p>“Each state can’t have its own separate plan,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said in a telephone news conference with reporters. “We need a national plan.”</p>
<p>The proposal would require the Trump administration to develop and enforce a national strategy to expand the country’s testing capacity and develop tests, and mandate widespread reporting about testing results, including tracking the demographics of people who tested positive.</p>
<p>It comes as the lack of testing capacity has <a href="https://slack-redir.net/link?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2020%2F04%2F06%2Fhealth%2Fcoronavirus-testing-us.html&amp;v=3" rel="nofollow">emerged as a signature failure</a> of the Trump administration’s response and now threatens to hamper efforts across the country to plan for an eventual reopening of the economy. The issue is likely to emerge as yet another flash point for debate as Democrats and Republicans negotiate a fourth sweeping aid package to respond to the crisis.</p>
<p>In California, officials say ramping up testing is a major priority before they can begin lifting stay-at-home orders there. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti announced Tuesday that anyone with symptoms could get a test in one day.</p>
<p>The state’s rate of infection and the number of deaths have been substantially lower than rates in other areas, but testing has been slower there than in New York, according to <a href="https://covidtracking.com/data" rel="nofollow">The Covid-19 Tracking Project</a>.</p>
