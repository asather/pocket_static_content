<h1>Analysis: Digging deeper into the Pirates’ offensive struggles</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s not to excuse the pitching.</p>
<p>The Pirates entered Thursday with two quality starts in 48 games, their starters going six innings four times and allowing 4.55 walks per nine, the worst mark in the history of the franchise. But with nine key pitchers either hurt or suspended this season, there’s at least some reason for the struggles.</p>
<p>The bigger elephant in the room is the offense, which had produced several concerning trends through 48 games. Strikeouts are up. Consistent contact is down. Key hitters have regressed. How bad is everything? Let’s take a look:</p>
<p>• The Pirates entered Thursday’s game against the Cardinals with the worst batting average (.218) and on-base percentage (.281) in the modern-era history (1900-present) of the franchise.</p>
<p>• They were also striking out 24.3% of the time, which held the same distinction, though it’s only fair to acknowledge that we’re only looking at about 30% of a full season here.</p>
<p>• Only three have had a lower OPS than this group’s mark of .625, and the last one of those came in 1917.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Pittsburgh’s problems are obviously multi-faceted, but the meat and potatoes of it goes like this: Pirates hitters are taking aggressive swings, but they’re missing entirely too much. Chasing has been an issue. So has their overall approach.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“It’s inconsistent,” manager Derek Shelton said. “There are times when we get on and off the fastball. That happens throughout the count. We’ll see ourselves take fastballs with two strikes, or we’ll take one early in the count. When you don’t stay on the fastball, it leads to timing and other issues.”</span></p>
<p>The Pirates have seen their success against certain pitches drop across the board, but it’s been most pronounced on breaking balls, with their slugging percentage against them going from .382 in 2019 to .287 this season.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">The Pirates are slugging .388 on fastballs (compared to .453 in 2019) and .280 (compared to .364 in 2019) on changeups. Meanwhile, their whiff percentage on all pitches went from 23.4 in 2019 (fourth-best in baseball) to 29.1 in 2020 (the fifth-highest).</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">That’s a lot, so let’s translate it into English.</span></p>
<p>There are swings, probably too many swings, and the Pirates far too often are coming up empty. They’ve been particularly susceptible to slower stuff, which could be happening because they’re having so many issues getting their swings off on fastballs.</p>
<p>“If you don’t hit the fastball, you don’t give yourself an opportunity to hit anything else,” Shelton said.</p>
<p>Since FanGraphs first began charting these numbers in 2002, the 2020 Pirates have the second-highest chase rate (32.3%) but the worst contact percentage (73.0). By a pretty good margin, too, as the 2013 squad (77.4) ranks as second-worst in contact percentage.</p>
<p>This year’s group also has the highest swinging strike percentage (12.8) by more than 2 percent, another indication that their issue isn’t aggression; if anything, they may be a little too aggressive.</p>
<p>At the same time, these Pirates have the best hard contact rate (34.2%) during that time, which further supports the theory that hitters seem to be swinging big, occasionally connecting big and also missing big.</p>
<p>The worrisome part here involves the multitude of strikeouts and the lack of individual improvement.</p>
<p>As a team, the Pirates are on pace to strike out 1,424 times over a 162-game season, which would be the most ever. Some of that should obviously be taken with a grain of salt because of how the game is being played these days.</p>
<p>But even if we look at percentage-based stats, it’s still ugly. Of their eight “regular” hitters, only Colin Moran has seen his strikeout percentage go down — from 23.3% to 23.2.</p>
<p>Gregory Polanco has obviously seen the biggest increase, a bump of 12.2% up to 41.5%, while Josh Bell is striking out 26% of the time, a 6.7% increase over 2019.</p>
<p>That can’t sit well with the Pirates, who have talked ad nauseam about wanting to help players improve. And not only has offensive improvement been elusive, but we’re talking about some serious regression here.</p>
<p>Consider of those same eight hitters, six have experienced a year-over-year drop in OPS, four of those by more than 200 points. The biggest has been Bryan Reynolds, a former National League Rookie of the Year candidate whose OPS is down by .282.</p>
<p>Hitting coach Rick Eckstein last year was lauded for his work — and appropriately so. He and others made significant strides with the Pirates offense last season and helped several players — most notably Bell — get better.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">It’s been a rough go this year for Eckstein and new assistant Mike Rabelo, although it’s not fair to put all of this on them; they’re not coaching players to chase pitches and miss them.</span></p>
<p>“He’s a really good hitting coach,” Shelton said of Eckstein. “We’re just trying to figure out why our guys are going through it. He did an unbelievable job last year, and we just need to figure out how we can go back to untapping those things.”</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">While it’s easy to look at the pitching and think that some good health could turn things around in 2021, the Pirates’ options on the offensive side are less clear. The only thing they know for sure is that 2020 has been bad results-wise, and it simply can’t continue.</span></p>
<p>“When you struggle offensively, there are millions of things that go through your mind on a daily basis,” Shelton said. “Having been a hitting coach, I know that and the psychology of it. Every day I think Rick and Rabs are challenging our guys to stay consistent and not let that vacillate.”</p>
<p><strong>Tucker concussed</strong></p>
<p>The Pirates before Thursday’s game placed Cole Tucker on the seven-day concussion list and recalled Jose Osuna from their satellite camp in Altoona.</p>
<p>In 18 games with the Pirates this season, Osuna is hitting .148 (8-for-54) with a double, home run and seven RBIs. He’s made five starts in right field, three as the designated hitter, three at third base, two at first base and one in left field.</p>
