<h1>Penguins defenseman John Marino to have surgery Monday </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>John Marino’s promising rookie season is being put on pause.</p>
<p>After meeting with team doctors on Monday morning, Marino is scheduled to have facial surgery on Monday afternoon, coach Mike Sullivan said. Sullivan said that there is currently no time frame for a return.</p>
<p>The injury occurred late in the third period on Thursday in Tampa Bay. After Marino scored to pull the Penguins within a goal, Lightning forward Steven Stamkos ripped a one-timer from the left circle that hit Zach Aston-Reese’s stick and ramped up into Marino’s cheek.</p>
<p>Initially, the Penguins believed Marino had escaped the scare with only stitches. However, after further evaluation, it was discovered the 22-year-old broke three bones in his left cheek, a source told the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>Marino has been one of the surprises of the Penguins’ season. He was acquired this offseason from Edmonton in exchange for a sixth-round pick. What initially looked like a low-risk move to add depth to a farm system that needed it quickly proved to be much more than that.</p>
<p>The rookie, who played at Harvard, made a rather seamless transition to the NHL. As a result, his role grew through the season. He went from a healthy scratch his first handful of games in the league to a critical member of the top four and an effective penalty killer.</p>
<p>Now, with Marino sidelined and Brian Dumoulin still recovering from ankle surgery, the Penguins once again will have to find ways to fill holes on a thinning blue line. Saturday’s game in Florida offered the first glance at how the Penguins will fill the void.</p>
<p>Juuso Riikola, who has been a healthy scratch since Justin Schultz returned from a lower body injury, earned a jersey on game night. He played next to Chad Ruhwedel in the third pairing. Meanwhile, Shultz moved to the second pairing to play with Marcus Pettersson, who was Marino’s regular partner the last couple weeks. Jack Johnson and Kris Letang made up the top pairing.</p>
<p>Should the Penguins choose to recall a defenseman, Zach Trotman would be one likely candidate. He was with the team earlier this year during a similar injury-plagued stint. Kevin Czuczman was also with the Penguins earlier this year and theoretically could help provide depth to the defense.</p>
