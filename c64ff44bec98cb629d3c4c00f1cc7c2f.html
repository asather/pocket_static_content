<h1>Perry South man charged in Troy Hill shooting</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Pittsburgh man was arraigned Sunday on an aggravated assault charge after a minor accident escalated to a fight and shooting that left a driver critically wounded in the city’s Troy Hill neighborhood over the weekend.</p>
<p>City police said John D. Withrow, 65, of Perry South was charged in the incident, which occurred around 10 a.m. Saturday on Lowrie Street at Tinsbury Street.</p>
<p>Police said a vehicle driven by Francisco Sanchez, of an unknown address, struck Withrow’s car, which was parked outside his daughter’s house on Lowrie. Withrow told officers he was inside his vehicle talking to his daughter on his cellphone at the time. Withrow said he and Sanchez quickly exchanged words before Sanchez parked his car nearby, got out and started walking toward Withrow and his daughter, who had rushed out of her house to see what the commotion was about, according to a criminal complaint filed in the case.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Withrow’s daughter told police that Sanchez appeared “agitated and aggressive” as he approached her father. According to the complaint, she said Sanchez swung at her father, who ducked and&nbsp;then pulled out a gun and shot Sanchez in the chin. Police said Sanchez dropped to the ground and Withrow called 911.</p>
<p>Sanchez was taken to Allegheny General Hospital, where he was in critical condition. A doctor treating him told police that a single bullet struck Sanchez’s chin and exited at the back of the neck, near his spinal cord, the complaint said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Withrow is being held at the Allegheny County Jail without bail. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for Nov. 24, according to court records.</p>
