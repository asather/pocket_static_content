<h1>Pitt mailbag: What are the best and worst case scenarios for this team?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Benjamin</strong>: Best case/worst case for w/l for conference games?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> My first couple of years on the beat, I did a best case/worst case scenario story, if only because I’m too cowardly to do predictions and that setup gave me a ton of wiggle room. This is the fourth Pitt team I’ve covered, and it’s the third of that bunch that has been hopelessly unpredictable. Say what you will about the 2017-18 squad, but you knew what you were getting with it.</p>
<p>I say all this to give myself even more cover should these be hilariously wrong. I’ll also add that this does not take into account any injuries beyond ones like Au’Diese Toney’s that currently exist. With all that noted …</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Best case</span></p>
<p>The ACC, for its (earned) lofty reputation, isn’t especially good this year. Duke, Louisville and Florida State all look strong, but Pitt has already beaten one of those teams, played another one tough on the road until the final minutes and the last of those three lost at home to Stephen F. Austin. The middle of the league is pretty weak, too. Virginia is rebuilding. So is North Carolina, which is also dealing with any number of injuries. This looks like one of the worst Syracuse teams in years. Boston College, Georgia Tech, Clemson, Wake Forest and Miami still haven’t gotten their 10th win.</p>
<p>The Panthers lose a couple games they maybe shouldn’t, pull off a couple of surprises and feast enough on the bottom half of teams in the league to get to 12 ACC wins. Even for a down year for the ACC, that puts them squarely on the bubble, perhaps even in the NCAA tournament, doubtful as I think this scenario is.</p>
<p><em>Final regular-season record</em>: 21-10 (12-8 ACC)</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;">Worst case</span></p>
<p>For as wide open as the conference is this season, the team in question in this exercise is still one that lost to perhaps the worst team the league has to offer, at home, no less (there was also that whole Nicholls State game). An already thin team starts to wear down as Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens struggle while trying to carry too much of the load. Ryan Murphy reverts to his cold outside shooting that plagued him for about a month in non-conference play. Justin Champagnie struggles with his shot, as well, and Gerald Drumgoole never fully recovers from his ankle injury that kept him out for eight games.</p>
<p>Bogged down by all those factors, Pitt beats some of the conference’s weaker opponents, but is plainly overmatched by many of its better ones. By the end of the season, it feels a whole lot like it did the year before, only without the optimism that comes with some of the team’s shortcomings being attributed to its best players being freshmen.</p>
<p><em>Final regular-season record</em>: 14-17 (5-15 ACC)</p>
<p><strong>Happy Honda Days</strong>: Can you tell me which games are “winnable” for Pitt? This is how I have gotten used to following Pitt’s conference schedule.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Pitt has already lost one of the games I would have considered winnable and won one that, had I known what Florida State would be at this point in the season, would have assumed it would have dropped.</p>
<p>In a season like this, I would say the stock answer would be that they’re all winnable. Granted, I don’t believe that to be true. The Panthers have already played one game I would have given them a 5% or less chance of winning — at Louisville — and have one more like that (at Duke on Jan. 28). There are some others I have an incredibly hard time seeing them win, even if I don’t have an exact percentage tied to it — home against Louisville, at Florida State and home against Virginia.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the games, to me, are varying degrees of winnable. As far as the most winnable ones, though, I’ll go with the following — home against Boston College, home against Clemson, home and away against Georgia Tech and home and away against Miami.</p>
<p><strong>Victor:</strong> Is Pitt still looking to bring in a PG for next year’s (2020) class/will they have an open scholarship to do so?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> Right now, Pitt does not have an open scholarship, with two players set to graduate and three players already signed. I will say, however, that given the transient nature of college basketball, you’ll see a roster spot open up. Where would the staff go positionally to try to fill that? Point guard would seem to make sense, though Delaware transfer Ithiel Horton, a 6-foot-3 guard, will be eligible and I would guess at this point that Xavier Johnson will be back next season.</p>
<p><strong>Cristiano</strong>: What would Xavier Johnson have to do the rest of the year to get him back on draft boards/ what do you think are the chances that happens?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I would say that cutting down on his turnovers and improving his overall decision-making would be paramount. Part of this comes from having more help than he did last season — the additions of Murphy, Champagnie and Eric Hamilton have all provided a nice boost — but he doesn’t seem to be the same offensive playmaker he was a season ago, or at least not a better one. A lot of those early draft projections were based on an expected amount of improvement from his freshman season that we just haven’t seen.</p>
<p><strong>Barry</strong>: Here is a softball for the mailbag: Who is/was your favorite player to cover?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’ll leave this to Pitt, since I can’t imagine many of you care much about guys I covered at Robert Morris or Duquesne (or especially anyone from my days covering America East basketball as a student journalist). This is based more on how they dealt with media than what they did on the court, though the people we talk to are invariably some of the team’s better players.</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Jared Wilson-Frame: A guy who had some invaluable perspective from having played basically every level of basketball in every part of the country. Someone whose age disguised his maturity.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Sheldon Jeter: I only covered him one season, but just a really open and honest person who would often provide a perspective I hadn’t thought of previously.</p>
<p><strong>3.</strong> Jamel Artis: Also only covered him for a season, but from a journalistic standpoint, there’s a lot to be said for a guy in “don’t give a damn anymore” mode. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2017/01/22/A-Brother-s-Keeper-Pitt-s-Jamel-Artis-uses-his-twin-brother-s-life-as-motivation-basketball-Panthers-ACC-Pitt/stories/201701220110" target="_blank">His backstory was fascinating</a>, too, making him a more nuanced person than I think many others saw him as.</p>
<p><strong>Corey</strong>: Any New Year’s resolutions for Pitt (or Pitt Twitter)? Or even new decade resolutions? Or you can get personal if you like.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think Pitt’s got any number of them. I’ll switch it up and focus solely on football, though, and I’ll say that program will want to get out of its current purgatory. Next season has justifiably high expectations, and anything short of at least nine wins (including the bowl game) would be disappointing. Pat Narduzzi is getting dangerously close to the situation Dana Holgorsen had at West Virginia, where he wasn’t winning enough to get an obviously bigger and better job, but he wasn’t losing enough to get fired. How he’s able to do next season will have a big hand in determining which direction his tenure goes.</p>
<p>For myself, I can’t even begin to think about new decade resolutions since I’ll be 40 at the end of 2029, which is terrifying. For this year, I’m going to try to spend less time on my phone, especially after 7 p.m. or so. It’s amazing how you can go on your phone to check something, forget what it is you were looking for as you continue to scroll through Twitter and look up to realize 20 minutes have passed.</p>
