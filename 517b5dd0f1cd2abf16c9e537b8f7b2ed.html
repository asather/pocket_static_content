<h1>Gerry Dulac: Expect the Steelers to navigate the upcoming salary cap crunch</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Kansas City Chiefs signed quarterback Patrick Mahomes to a 10-year, $450 million contract in July, the most lucrative contract in American team sports history and a deal that made him wealthier than seven countries.</p>
<p>Then, in the past eight days:</p>
<p>The Houston Texans signed quarterback DeShaun Watson to a four-year extension worth a maximum $160 million, the second-largest deal in NFL history.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Rams gave cornerback Jalen Ramsey the biggest contract ever awarded to a defensive back — a five-year, $105 million extension.</p>
<p>The Steelers signed defensive end Cam Heyward to a five-year, $75.1 million contract, the largest ever given a defensive player over the age of 30.</p>
<p>It certainly doesn’t appear that some teams are too worried about a flattened salary cap in 2021.</p>
<p>With the salary cap already scheduled to have a floor of $175 million in 2021 — nearly $35 million less than what might have been expected in a non-pandemic year — panic seems to have set in that many teams are going to be forced to have fire sales after this season, dumping high-salaried stars merely to get in compliance. The reason for the projected reduced cap: League revenues will decline this season because of the COVID-19 pandemic that will limit the amount of fans or keep them out of stadiums altogether, affecting everything from concessions and merchandise to the use of private luxury boxes and parking.</p>
<p>The Steelers are one of nine teams who are already projected to be over the salary cap for the 2021 season, according to overthecap.com, a website that tracks team salaries. So, just because they signed Heyward to his record deal, does that mean they won’t be able to sign any or just some of the three key players who are in line for new contracts after the season — All-Pro linebacker T.J. Watt, wide receiver JuJu Smith-Schuster and running back James Conner?</p>
<p>Of course not. Watt, an NFL Defensive Player of the Year candidate, is next in line now that Heyward is out of the way. And, so long as Smith-Schuster can regain his 2018 form with the return of Ben Roethlisberger, when was the last time the Steelers didn’t re-sign their No. 1 receiver?</p>
<p>Granted, it might be difficult to sign all three players, particularly Conner if he can’t make it through the season injury-free. And, if the cap does not rise significantly above $175 million, it will be hard to consider putting another franchise tag on Bud Dupree.</p>
<p>But, remember this: The Steelers rub up against the salary cap every year, as much as any team in the league. And yet they always seem to find a way to keep their stars — the core of the team — in place. They navigate the salary cap as deftly as a pilot in a wind storm, even though they will have paid out more than $225 million to Ben Roethlisberger over his career, according to overthecap.com.</p>
<p>If revenues are better than expected in 2020, if more fans are allowed to attend games, the minimum salary cap could increase next season. If not, the cap decrease could significantly impact veterans looking for a final contract and players on the back-end of their rookie deals looking for a big pay raise on their second contract.</p>
<p>Like many teams, the Steelers will have lots of maneuvering to do to stay within the salary cap in 2021. But, with many variables remaining within the league, and with their ability to manipulate the cap as well if not better than any team in the league, it might be wise to hold off on those fire-sale signs for now.</p>
<p><strong>Like father, like son</strong></p>
<p>“Did he tell you about the baseball?”</p>
<p>That was the first question Craig Colquitt asked the other day when he was talking about his son, Dustin, who is the Steelers’ new punter after spending all of his previous 15 NFL seasons with the Kansas City Chiefs.</p>
<p>Craig Colquitt was the Steelers punter from 1978 to 1984, winning two Super Bowls but missing the strike-interrupted 1982 season because he tore his Achilles’ tendon playing basketball. Dustin was born that year and spent the first 2 ½ years of his life growing up in Mt. Lebanon, going with his dad to Three Rivers Stadium the day before a game and, yes, even doing what some young boys are inclined to do when they are outside for extended periods and, uh, have nowhere to go.</p>
<p>“I did pee on the Three Rivers field,” Dustin Colquitt said.</p>
<p>Talk about an illegal procedure.</p>
<p>“I remember Calvin Sweeney yelled, he said, ‘Hey Cold Cuts — that’s what he called me — you can take the kid out of the country but you can’t take the country out of the kid,’” Craig Colquitt said over the phone the other day from his home in Lebanon, Tenn., about 25 miles east of Nashville. “I knew he was talking about Dustin. I turned around and there he is, his pants all the way down to his ankles, and he was peeing right there on the turf.”</p>
<p>While Dustin Colquitt can recall that slightly embarrassing moment, the remembrance he embraces most is when the late Steelers owner, Art Rooney Sr., took him into his office inside the stadium and gave him something he still has in his home in the Kansas City area.</p>
<p>“He takes me back to his office and he’s looking for football memorabilia stuff, something to sign for me since I was one of the only kids there,” Dustin said. “And he finds a Pirates baseball, which I still have to this day in my basement, and he signed it, ‘Dusty, one day you’ll be a superstar. Art Rooney.’”</p>
<p>Colquitt eventually went from the Chief to the Chiefs, but he never forgot his time in Pittsburgh and the memory of his dad playing for the Steelers. Now he is with his dad’s former team, becoming only the second father-son duo to ever play for the Steelers. The first was when former tackle John Brown’s son, Ernie, was in uniform for three games at the end of the 1999 season.</p>
<p>“I said to him, ‘You can’t make this up,’” Craig Colquitt said. “Ever since my sons got into professional football, or college it’s just been amazing, a fun ride. But to come full circle like this ...”</p>
<p>Probably Dustin’s only disappointment is having to wear jersey No. 4 and not his dad’s old number (5). Josh Dobbs reclaimed that when he was signed a day earlier than Colquitt.</p>
<p>Instead, Colquitt will wear the same number his younger brother, Britton, wore when he punted for the Denver Broncos, Miami Dolphins and Cleveland Browns. Britton now wears No. 2 with the Minnesota Vikings, in honor of the number his brother wore when he played in a franchise-record 238 games with the Chiefs.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, his dad will make the 45-minute drive to see him play when the Steelers play in Nashville Oct. 4 against the Tennessee Titans.</p>
<p>“I think it’s really cool because I stole all the stuff he used to put down in his desk area and I’ve put it in my bar over the years just to honor him,” Dustin said. “It’s really cool. It’s special. I wouldn’t say that he’s more excited, although he would tell you that he is. I’m pumped because I’ve been here before and watched his games. It was so long ago that I don’t remember, but I got to hear all the stories about Franco (Harris) and Terry Bradshaw, so this is kind of coming to life and I’m excited about the opportunity.”</p>
