<h1>From injury to scholarship, Pitt fifth-year senior Jake Zilinskas refused to quit</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jake Zilinskas, the latest Pitt walk-on to earn a scholarship, hasn’t played in an actual football game in five years.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly five years. If Zilinskas, a redshirt senior tight end who generated buzz during training camp, gets time in Pitt’s season opener Saturday, it’ll be four years, 11 months and 25 days since he strapped on his pads for something more than a scrimmage or practice. That’s 1,821 total days since his path to Pitt began with a dash, a dive and a whole lot of pain at “the old field in Kittanning.”</p>
<p>Every walk-on’s journey to a scholarship is long and tedious, tiresome and testing. But few suffered physically like Zilinskas.</p>
<p>On Sept. 18, 2015, Zilinskas, a quarterback at Indiana Area High School, bolted from the pocket. Armstrong Central defenders gave chase, but the senior scrambled 40 yards toward the end zone in the second quarter of a tight ballgame. Zilinskas had some time to think in the open field, and after traversing the rutted grass surface, he was met at the goal line. With a sore right shoulder, Zilinskas didn’t lower it and power through contact, instead trying to jump for pay dirt.</p>
<p>He scored, but at a cost. As Zilinskas flew toward the end zone, the opposing player on the goal line grabbed his right leg to try and stop him. When Zilinskas flipped and crashed down, his leg was pulled over his head — and his hamstring tore off his pelvic bone.</p>
<p>“I thought he landed on his shoulder. I wasn’t aware how bad it was,” said Mark Zilinskas, Jake’s father and Indiana’s former head coach. “Then he didn’t get up. He was screaming like I’ve never heard anyone scream before. I knew something was seriously wrong. I was just concerned for his well being.”</p>
<p>“The pain started at the top of my hamstring and it shot all the way down into my feet. It was burning,” the then-quarterback said. “I have never felt anything like that before in my life. I kind of blacked out. I remember laying there, but I was in so much pain.”</p>
<p>Zilinskas was carried off the field and into the locker room. There, a doctor examined him to make sure his hip wasn’t dislocated. If it was, Zilinskas said he would have been flown to Pittsburgh for emergency surgery. Throughout the evaluation, Zilinskas, flowing with adrenaline, asked if he could return to the field to play. Then he vomited in a sense of shock. Zilinskas called it “a bad scene” before eventually calming down.</p>
<p>The doctor confirmed that his hip was not dislocated, but Zilinskas needed crutches to return to the sidelines to support his teammates. A burning, shooting pain in his right leg never subsided as he watched Indiana lose 35-20.</p>
<p>After the game concluded, Dylan Stapleton — Zilinskas’ best friend and former top target at Indiana — approached his quarterback and gave him a hug. Not much was said between the fellow seniors, but tears flowed. Even without an official diagnosis, they both knew Zilinskas’ season was over.</p>
<p>“I could just see it in his eyes,” said Stapleton, a former James Madison tight end pursuing an NFL career. “It was devastating.”</p>
<p>Around 11:30 that evening, Zilinskas — still in his football jersey and pants at home — was examined by an orthopedic doctor, who urged for an MRI to be done as soon as possible. In the coming days, the scan validated the Zilinskas’ fears: Torn hamstring, out for the year.</p>
<p>It was a gutting injury. A first-team All-Greater Allegheny Conference selection as a junior, Zilinskas hoped to build on his 2014 campaign in which he led all Class 3A WPIAL passers with 1,609 yards. The 6-foot-2 prospect racked up 21 touchdown passes en route to interest from James Madison, Villanova, Albany, New Hampshire and other Football Championship Subdivision programs.</p>
<p>Zilinskas also looked forward to defending Indiana’s basketball crown. The Little Indians won the WPIAL Class 3A championship in 2014-15 thanks to Dylan and Riley Stapleton, as well as Zilinskas. Indiana’s 62-61 win over Beaver Falls at Petersen Events Center was a history-making day for the school, one Zilinskas hoped to repeat.</p>
<p>Instead, Indiana was bounced in the first round in 2016, and football offers never materialized for Zilinskas. He was in a wait-and-see mode with several schools prior to the injury. The FCS programs and Ohio from the Mid-American Conference needed to see more film before extending an offer. Playing only two full games as a senior, Zilinskas didn’t have enough tape to sway them.</p>
<p>The quarterback ended up at John Carroll University, a Division III program in northern Ohio. But not before significant surgery and rehab.</p>
<p>Zilinskas, who was “miserable” and felt as if his body was “paralyzed” days after the injury, underwent surgery to reattach his hamstring on Oct. 5, 2015. The procedure was conducted by Dr. James P. Bradley, the Steelers’ head orthopedic surgeon. It took the hobbling college hopeful three months before he could walk without crutches, forcing his father to set up a makeshift bedroom in the living room of the family’s two-story house.</p>
<p>“He was completely incapacitated,” the elder Zilinskas said. “... But he was determined to play again. We told him that he could overcome it. We knew it would be a long road back. And it sure was.”</p>
<p>Once he was able to drive himself, Zilinskas pushed through physical therapy at UPMC Rooney Sports Complexfrom February through June. He’d travel an hour and a half each way, three days a week, for 60 to 90-minute sessions. Zilinskas, a Pitt fan growing up who attended more than one Backyard Brawl, felt drawn to the Panthers’ indoor facility, which sits across a parking lot.</p>
<p>But when his rehab was complete and he was cleared to play football again — a feat in its own right — Zilinskas was off to John Carroll. Ultimately, the Division III program’s atmosphere was too lax for his liking. He spent the 2016 season in Ohio, not playing a down for the Blue Streaks and regretting his decision. In January 2017, he left and enrolled at Pitt, with the intention to walk on.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t stop thinking about playing for Pitt,” Zilinskas said. “The injury gave me more motivation to take a leap of faith.”</p>
<p>The walk-on joined as a quarterback and sat out in 2017 due to NCAA transfer rules. He switched to tight end in 2018 and provided depth at linebacker in 2019 before moving back to tight end this offseason. Zilinskas didn’t record a snap in those three years, serving only on the scout team. But the thought of quitting never crossed his mind.</p>
<p>Zilinskas — who followed his dad around at Indiana as a kid, helping with water at practice and sitting in on film sessions — loved football too much to be discouraged. Pitt coach Pat Narduzzi saw that side of Zilinskas early on, endorsing the tight end’s approach and predicting that he, too, has coaching in his future.</p>
<p>Zilinskas also has playing time in his near future. The redshirt senior expects to get in on Saturday when Pitt opens its season against Austin Peay at Heinz Field. He wasn’t listed on the Panthers’ Week 1 depth chart, but Zilinskas proved enough during training camp to earn both a scholarship and consideration on game days.</p>
<p>His teammates, including quarterback Kenny Pickett and former walk-on Jimmy Morrissey, have hyped up the pass-catcher on Twitter in recent weeks. Fellow tight end Lucas Krull said the 240-pounder isn’t scared to hit someone and showed “grit” during August. And Narduzzi, after awarding him a scholarship last week, mentioned Zilinskas’ Randy Moss-esque touchdown catch during a recent scrimmage and added that he “earned every dime, every penny.”</p>
<p>“I told him that it wasn’t because of that one catch. It’s more about all the little things he’s doing,” Narduzzi said of Zilinskas’ scholarship. “He’s had an incredible attitude for these four years, these four camps he’s been through. It’s not easy. Not many walk-ons make it to their senior year.”</p>
<p>And now that he’s here — five years removed from a crushing injury, significant surgery, rigorous rehab and rejection across all levels of college football — Zilinskas refuses to let this opportunity fall to the wayside.</p>
<p>These 1,821 days without a meaningful snap aren’t lost on Pitt’s former walk-on.</p>
<p>“It’s surreal to even think about it. I get chills,” Zilinskas said of playing for the first time since September 2015. “When I got injured, I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to play again, whether it was physically or just not receiving any offers. It’s been a long time. It’s been a long journey. It was a roller coaster. But it’s something I’ve always dreamed of.”</p>
