<h1>Pandemic-related uncertainties have people feeling anxious</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Isolation from friends and relatives.</p>
<p>Worries about losing one’s job — or struggling to keep it without adequate child care.</p>
<p>Fear of getting sick.</p>
<p>General unease about what the future holds.</p>
<p>If you have been feeling more stressed or anxious lately, you aren’t alone. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about not only challenges for peoples’ physical health but their mental health as well, according to doctors and experts.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“There are people with mental illness who are absolutely experiencing escalated symptoms because of the pandemic. There are also people who are reaching out and accessing us, who have never done so before, who don’t have some pre-existing mental health condition, because they’re experiencing new symptoms that look a lot like many other mental health disorders — anxiety, depression, fear,” said Liz Sysak, senior director of clinical services for crisis and emergency services at UPMC Resolve Crisis Services.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/" target="_blank">Kaiser Family Foundation poll in mid-July found</a> 53% of adults in the United States “reported that their mental health has been negatively impacted due to worry and stress over the coronavirus,” up from the 32% who reported feeling that way in March.</p>
<p>Among those who were hard-hit by COVID-19-related stresses: women with young children, people who have lost jobs, front-line health care workers, those with prior mental health or substance use disorders and people with low incomes, the poll found.</p>
<p>A UPMC spokeswoman said patient numbers for behavioral health services haven’t surged, though the general sentiment is people are more stressed, anxious and depressed, and anxiety related to COVID-19 is a concern. Statistics from Allegheny County do not show an increase in deaths by suicide during this time, compared to last year. Accidental overdoses are also down in 2020 compared to this point in 2019.</p>
<p>“The worry, the stress, the anxiety over not just the virus, but maybe employment, their kids being home from school, it just compounded different things,” said Christine Michaels, CEO of the Pennsylvania organization of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, NAMI Keystone PA.</p>
<p>The general uncertainty about the future has been hard for many individuals, she said.</p>
<p>“Well, things are never going to be normal. Well, we’re going to have a new normal. Well, what’s that going to be? Well, when can we go to a Steeler game? You, know, when can we do this?” said Ms. Michaels.</p>
<p>“Right now, the parents that have school-age children, August has been absolute hell for them. First of all, trying to be satisfied that their child would be safe, and then the school districts not knowing what they are doing, posting one plan, then two weeks later changing it because someone in the district tested positive for the virus, then they had to adjust; people can’t plan. They can’t conduct the daily business of their life because all of these things are out of their control.”</p>
<p>Additionally, that saturation of COVID-related information can be overwhelming and stressful, said Dr. Sysak.</p>
<p>“You can’t turn on the news or open the newspaper without hearing and reading about coronavirus and how it’s impacting the workforce, how it’s impacting the country, humanity. And I think that creates almost the perfect storm for somebody to become incredibly overwhelmed, because there’s no escape from it,” she said.</p>
<p>She advised just checking the news during a set period, and avoiding the 24/​7 news cycle.</p>
<p>Earlier on in the pandemic, when many in-person medical appointments were canceled, some people had a hard time accessing needed services, though with more telehealth appointments, that’s not a problem now, said Ms. Michaels.</p>
<p>“There’s help that’s available” for anyone, Dr. Sysak said.</p>
<p>Resolve is “for any human that is struggling to” process some of these complicated events.</p>
<p><strong>Getting help</strong></p>
<p>How do you know if it might be time to get help?</p>
<p>“Between coping pretty well and coping not so well, people will notice things like, they are different than usual and people notice it,” said P.V. Nickell, chair of psychiatry and the behavioral health institute at Allegheny Health Network.</p>
<p>“They’re more irritable, they may not be sleeping as well, they’re having a hard time concentrating on stuff they’re trying to do, they’re easily distracted, they’re not enjoying things that they ordinarily would. Those are things that I would hope give people pause and would get them to call their primary care doctor; if they have a mental health professional, call that person; or call Resolve or call to get an appointment with a psychologist or a psychiatrist to be assessed.”</p>
<p>Pennsylvania’s Department of Human Services has set up a help line, which has received thousands of calls since it launched in April.</p>
<p>People can call if they are in crisis, but it’s not only for crisis situations, and officials are intentionally not calling it a hot line for that reason, said Kristen Houser, deputy secretary for the Office of Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services at DHS.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to support people so they don’t find themselves in a crisis” and to prevent issues from escalating, she said.</p>
<p>Many callers are seeking information about mental health services, others are calling with COVID-19-related concerns, and others are seeking assistance with basic needs such as food and shelter. People can call for any kind of support, Ms. Houser said.</p>
<p>“Human connections are a key need for all of us; that is one of the services that this line is intended to provide,” she said.</p>
<p>“Not being able to interact in person with people, it takes a toll.”</p>
<p>While this has been a difficult time, Ms. Michaels said she does see some silver linings — a greater acceptance of telehealth has made it easier for people to get to therapy appointments, and virtual online meetings have helped NAMI serve more people. She also praised county and state leaders in getting out information about services that are available.</p>
<p>Dr. Nickell said he’s expecting mental health issues as people continue to navigate living with the virus and the ongoing economic fallout.</p>
<p>“I think we’re going to have a lot more stresses before we have some resolution,” he said.</p>
