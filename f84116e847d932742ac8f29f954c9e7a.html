<h1>Hired during the pandemic? It comes with its own problems</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On March 5, Kayla Hunter got the job. A week later, she learned she’d be working from her dining room table for the foreseeable future.</p>
<p>She was hired as a data analyst for JazzHR, a Chateau-based company that sells human resources software. The business was deemed non-essential, so the office overlooking the Ohio River was shuttered.</p>
<p>“No one knew what was going on, whether there would be layoffs or not,” she said. “Everything felt like a giant unknown.”</p>
<p>While COVID-19 has ravaged the job market —&nbsp;over 20 million U.S. workers filed for unemployment in May — the virus has also posed a challenging landscape for new hires and their employers, as the workers try to get comfortable in a world of uncertainty.</p>
<p>It took about a month before Ms. Hunter’s layoff fear subsided. After a few weeks, the company needed a centralized place to look at business metrics trending over time; subscribers to the software, job postings, sales figures and the like.</p>
<p>“So I created some data visualizations in week three, and the CEO still checks it every day,” Ms. Hunter said.</p>
<p>JazzHR’s other new hire shared a similar experience of finding her footing. Jaz White, a software engineer, was tasked with knocking out several bugs and fixes in her first week. It was “incredibly satisfying” to finish, but it uncovered a new problem. She wasn’t taking any breaks.</p>
<p>“It can be easy to feel pressured to be ‘on’ for eight hours a day, but that’s not realistic and not how people work,” she said. “I realized it’s OK to have a coffee break or chat with someone. I’m getting myself to do that so I can refresh my mind and I’m not hyper-focused in an unproductive way.”</p>
<p>Alexia Porche had the opposite problem. The 23-year-old Duquesne University student started as a summer clerk at law firm Metz Lewis LLC in mid-June, and she had to work remotely for the first two weeks. TV was a constant temptation, and her roommate was taking up her time.</p>
<p>“I have a cat, and she’s very demanding,” she said.</p>
<p>She got her first glimpse of the office on June 29, and her productivity has soared. She’s been doing research for upcoming cases and filed a lawsuit at the courthouse in her second week at the office. Ms. Porche had plenty to do, since nearly 80% of the firm’s employees were working from home when she returned.</p>
<p>“The comfort levels are all across the board,” said chief talent officer John Lewis. “There’s so much going on — social unrest, political things — we’re trying to be aware that any or all of these things are something that’s causing stress.”</p>
<p>New roles haven’t been limited to new hires. Leaders of Metz Lewis’s eight practice groups have become more involved with their coworkers. They now do routine check-ins to monitor how their teammates are handling the emotional impacts of remote work.</p>
<p>“The biggest thing is employees who are trying to manage a household where both parents have a career and kids home all the time,” Mr. Lewis said.</p>
<p>Other company leaders have taken on responsibilities that no one could have predicted. In the case of Innovative Systems, a data management company with offices in Pittsburgh and London, CEO Bob Colonna became a glorified pizza guy.</p>
<p>The company sent out an employee engagement survey in late February, promising free pizza to whichever teams got 100% completion first. Every employee in the company filled it out.</p>
<p>When the coronavirus hit and the company’s international offices shut down, Mr. Colonna went to great lengths to fulfill the promise he made to his employees, now scattered around the globe.</p>
<p>“We all got our pizza,” said Maryjane Kolic, Innovative Systems’ vice president of human resources. “Some of us got gift cards, did a delivery thing, some just asked for it to be donated to COVID causes. It was all out of his own pocket.”</p>
<p>Recent efforts to introduce new hires to the workplace haven’t always been as successful. Under normal conditions, JazzHR held weekly happy hours in the office. Those Friday afternoon events have moved to Zoom, and Ms. Hunter said the first tries were “awkward,” with 80 employees vying for attention on a single screen.</p>
<p>“When you’re in a room with 80 people, you can find a few people to talk to one on one. In a video call, you can’t do that,” she said. “It turns a socializing into a performance or presentation in a video call where one person has to be talking at a time.”</p>
<p>The formula’s been altered since then. Now employees form teams and play Zoom-friendly games together, like Jeopardy, Pictionary and Name That Tune.</p>
<p>The new folks at JazzHR, Innovative Systems and Metz Lewis are grateful for the workplace bonding activities their bosses have concocted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ms. Hunter’s old workplace, the Foundation Radiology Group in Downtown even reached out to her for advice about onboarding new employees remotely.</p>
<p>She told them to focus on combating employee isolation, which “can be a lot more intense.” Sometimes, all it takes is a quick video chat or phone call.</p>
<p>“Communication is so key. It’s so easy to forget about an employee if they’re just existing as a name in a chat box,” she said.</p>
