<h1>NHL, NHLPA hoping to get players back in team facilities by 'mid-to-later' May</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL is hoping to get its players back on skates in the coming weeks, but the timeline for them to play actual games remains complicated and unclear.</p>
<p>In a statement released late Wednesday, the NHL and NHLPA said that “given recent developments in some NHL clubs’ local communities,” they are targeting the “mid-to-later portion of May” for Phase 2 of their return-to-play plan.</p>
<p>Phase 2, the joint statement read, would allow players to return to small-group activities — including skating — at their respective team training facilities.</p>
<p>The news came after the NHL and NHLPA’s Return to Play Committee met earlier in the day and, “in line with guidance provided by medical experts and national and local authorities,” expressed optimism about moving to Phase 2.</p>
<p>The league has been in Phase 1, which is “self-quarantine” for players and hockey staff, since the NHL suspended play on March 12 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Everyone is expected to adhere to those guidelines until further notice.</p>
<p>“We are now looking ahead to a Phase 2. ... Provided that conditions continue to trend favorably — and subject to potential competitive concerns as between disparately situated markets — we believe we may be able to move to Phase 2 at some point in the mid-to-later portion of May,” the statement read.</p>
<p>Wednesday night’s statement added that the NHL and the NHLPA “have not made any decisions or set a timeline for possible return-to-play scenarios.”</p>
<p>This is obviously encouraging news, especially after considering the state of the U.S. and Canada a few weeks ago. With some local and state governments looking to loosen stay-at-home restrictions in the near future, players getting back on the ice would give hope that the Stanley Cup will still get handed out.</p>
<p>But since the restrictions and regulations will vary by city, there may still be teams looking for the green light to go back to work a month from now. That could be the “potential competitive concerns” to which the statement alluded.</p>
<p>Getting clearance to hold a full-squad training camp will be another hurdle.</p>
<p>And then there are the games, which almost certainly will be played without fans if the season resumes. The NHL may be homing in on having a few NHL cities host a bunch of games in a “bubble” setting in order to limit for hundreds of players, coaches and team employees their exposure to COVID-19.</p>
<p>But the league isn’t going to do any of that without the blessing of health experts and government officials — along with a thumbs-up from the players.</p>
<p>So, yeah, there’s still a lot to sort out before we will watch an NHL game again. But players being able to skate would be a step in the right direction.</p>
