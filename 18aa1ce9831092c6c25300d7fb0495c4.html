<h1>Penguins first-half superlatives: MVP, biggest surprise, best addition </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Remember those high school yearbook superlatives? Best dressed. Class clown. Most likely to succeed.</p>
<p>Well, we decided to put a little bit of a different spin on them. Sunday’s loss to the Florida Panthers represented game No. 42 of 82. As the Penguins officially turn the page to the second half of the season, it’s time for us to look back at the first 41. With a little inspiration from our yearbooks, here are some mid-season superlatives.</p>
<p><strong>First-half MVP:</strong> Jake Guentzel</p>
<p>The list of injured Penguins was long and significant during the first half of the season. It includes Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin, Bryan Rust, Nick Bjugstad, Kris Letang, Justin Shultz, Brian Dumoulin, Patric Hornqvist and more. But while all those bodies came in and out of the lineup, Guentzel was one of the stabilizing forces keeping a constantly changing team photo in focus. He was leading the Penguins with 43 points and 20 goals when he violently collided with the boards during Game 39. Even though the shoulder surgery that followed likely ended his season, the contributions he made to keep the team afloat while so many others were sidelined shouldn’t be forgotten.</p>
<p><strong>Most surprising performer:</strong> Tristan Jarry</p>
<p>The Penguins front office always believed that Jarry had the pedigree to one day become a No. 1 goalie in the NHL. But few could have imagined the 24-year-old from Western Canada would become the No. 1 goalie in the entire league this season.</p>
<p>At least according to the stats, he’s done exactly that through his first 20 appearances of the season. Among eligible goalies, Jarry is first in goals-against average (1.99) and save percentage (.935). He’s already wrested away considerable playing time from two-time Cup champion Matt Murray. With both goalies set to become restricted free agents at season’s end, it will be fascinating to see how the Penguins manage their goaltenders in the second half of the season — and beyond.</p>
<p><strong>Most likely to have a career year:</strong> Bryan Rust</p>
<p>This is an easy one. Truth be told, I was just looking for a way to give Rust a superlative because, man, has he been impressive. Though the speedy winger missed the first month of the season with a hand injury, he has shot up the stat sheet to become one of the team’s most productive players. Consider that his best goal-scoring season was 18 goals in 2018-19. With 17 this season, he’s pretty much guaranteed to shatter that previous best. The 30-goal mark feels realistic. Even 35 or 40 seems possible if he can stay healthy and continue on this torrid pace of 0.5 goals per game.</p>
<p><strong>Bounce-back player:</strong> Evgeni Malkin</p>
<p>In the first week of training camp, Malkin made a bold statement when he said, “I want to show to everyone I’m not done.” Through the first half of the season, he’s done exactly that — and then some. After a 2018-19 season that Malkin admits wasn’t his best, the star center is once again proving he belongs in the discussion with the league’s elite.</p>
<p>He currently ranks first among NHL players with 0.97 assists per game and seventh in the league in points per game (1.34). More importantly, he’s committed to playing a 200-foot game, not taking unnecessary risks and playing a complete team game. Because of all of those factors, Malkin is a big reason the Penguins sit in second place in the Metropolitan Division even though Crosby has missed seven weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Best offseason addition:</strong> John Marino</p>
<p>There are a number of good candidates for this superlative. Energizer Bunny Brandon Tanev is one. Dominik Kahun, who has overcome a slow start to become the Penguins’ sixth-most productive player, is another. But the obvious choice is Marino.</p>
<p>When the Penguins acquired Marino from the Edmonton Oilers this offseason in exchange for a sixth-round pick, it initially appeared on its face to be a low-risk move to add depth to a farm system that needed some defensive help. After the first half of the season, it’s safe to call that move an absolute heist. Marino’s emergence directly and indirectly has paid off many times over. Directly, he’s proven to be a reliable defenseman who has even played on the top pairing during several different situations when Letang and Dumoulin were injured. Beyond that, he basically made Erik Gudbranson expendable, allowing the Penguins to move his $3.5 million cap hit and create space for a possible move down the stretch. Because he’s just 22 years old, Marino’s game is still evolving. It will be interesting to watch how close he gets to his ceiling by the end of this season.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Most reliable:</strong> Brandon Tanev</p>
<p>In 42 games this season, Tanev has produced eight goals and 11 assists. Solid production. But to appreciate what Tanev brings to the Penguins, you have to look beyond those basic offensive stats. He leads Penguins forwards in penalties drawn (15), hits (161), hits taken (112) and blocked shots (42). These numbers don’t typically end up in the box score or on the highlight reel. But they’re the type of plays that win games and help make a team tough to play against. Better yet, Tanev is a non-stop bundle of energy and tightly coiled fast-twitch muscle who brings these qualities on a shift-by-shift basis. As one of just five players to participate in all 42 games, you know what you’re getting each time Tanev comes over the boards and it’s paying dividends for the Penguins on a nightly basis.</p>
