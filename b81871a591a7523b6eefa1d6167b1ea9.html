<h1>Pa. House votes to end Gov. Wolf’s closure order, replace with federal guidance</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A bitterly divided Pennsylvania House late Tuesday afternoon approved a measure to get rid of the business-closure system put in place by Gov. Tom Wolf to fight the coronavirus in Pennsylvania and replace it with less restrictive federal guidance.</p>
<p>Republican state Rep. Dawn Keefer of York County said the system put in place by Wolf, a Democrat, is “chaotic and confusing at best” and other Republicans called it illogical, poorly implemented and the source of despair for jobless people.</p>
<p>But Democrats were united in their opposition. Their leader, Rep. Frank Dermody, warned that if the measure becomes law, tens of thousands of workers will be in jeopardy as they go back to work during a virus pandemic.</p>
<p>“Many of them are going to die,” Dermody said.</p>
<p>The measure passed by a 107-to-95 vote largely along party lines. Two Republicans — Reps. Tom Murt and Todd Stephens — voted with Democrats to oppose the measure.</p>
<p>It now will go to the Republican-controlled Senate and, if passed there, would go to Wolf.</p>
<p>Tuesday afternoon, Wolf declined comment on the bill because he had not seen its final version. State Health Secretary Dr. Rachel Levine previously said the measure would “no doubt” lead to more coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Wolf, during a phone call with reporters, said he and lawmakers had a common goal of wanting to resume business the “right way.” In an apparent indirect reference to Levine’s warning, Wolf said, “If we don’t do this right, the economy is going to be in even worse shape than it is now.”</p>
<p>The Senate is expected to be in session this week. Without naming specific bills, top Senate Republicans said in a statement they planned “to consider legislation that will provide a safe path for re-opening the state’s economy.”</p>
<p>The House and Senate would both need a two-thirds majority vote to override a veto of any legislation by Wolf.</p>
<p>Many businesses and schools have been shut down for weeks across the country as the virus has spread rapidly. By Tuesday evening, nearly 2 million cases were reported worldwide, along with more than 125,000 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins University website.</p>
<p>But daily increases in case counts in Pennsylvania have been decreasing. The statewide case total Tuesday was 25,345, an increase of 1,146 cases, or about 5%, from Monday.</p>
<p>About 1.4 million unemployment claims have been filed in Pennsylvania since Wolf’s March 19 announcement of the shutdown of businesses deemed non-life-sustaining.</p>
<p>The measure approved by the House would replace the Wolf administration’s list of life-sustaining/non-life-sustaining businesses with less-restrictive guidance from the federal Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency.</p>
<p>An example of differences in the two approaches is how they treat construction.</p>
<p>On Wolf’s list, “residential building construction” is prohibited. But under the federal guidance, residential construction work is considered essential "to ensure additional units can be made available to combat the nation’s existing housing supply shortage.”</p>
<p>During the debate before the vote, Democrats said they understood the need to get back to work.</p>
<p>Rep. Matthew Bradford, D-Montgomery County, noted that the CISA list was labeled “advisory in nature” and he said it was not intended to be a final regulation.</p>
<p>“Do you really want to second-guess epidemiologists and the governor?” Bradford said.</p>
<p>House Majority Leader Rep. Bryan Cutler of Lancaster County said the purpose of the statewide quarantine was to buy time for the health care system to be ready for a surge of virus cases. He called it a “limited tool” and said the state needed a plan to move forward even as it was likely to face subsequent waves of virus cases.</p>
<p>Another Republican, Rep. Matt Gabler, whose district is in Clearfield and Elk counties, said joblessness would lead to drug abuse, alcoholism and depression.</p>
<p>“Giving hope is exactly what we are here to do today,” he said.</p>
<p>The House action came the day after Wolf and governors of other Northeast states announced a joint effort to plan for the reopening of their states when the coronavirus starts to subside.</p>
<p>The group expects to create a plan to guide the public health and economic comeback in the region. The top health official, top economic development official and governor’s chief of staff from each of the states were expected to start communicating Tuesday on the plan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Pennsylvania Department of Health on Tuesday reported 60 more deaths in the ongoing crisis, bringing the statewide toll to 584.</p>
<p>In the Lehigh Valley, the number of cases increased by 102 to 2,979, a one-day increase of about 4%. The breakdown of the total was 1,803 cases in Lehigh County and 1,176 cases in Northampton County.</p>
<p>The outbreak in Pennsylvania, as elsewhere, has been especially tragic among the elderly.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, a spokeswoman for Genesis Healthcare said in an email that 58 people have become infected at the company’s Lehigh Center in Lower Macungie Township and, among that group, 10 residents have died.</p>
<p>Among those who have died recently from complications caused by COVID-19 was 75-year-old Andrew Spevak III, a gregarious Bethlehem native known to many in the Lehigh Valley community from working the bar at ArtsQuest events.</p>
<p>Levine said during a news briefing Tuesday it has been difficult for the state to get data on the demographics of those who have tested positive.</p>
<p>About 60% of test results received by the state are missing required race and ethnicity information, according to Levine. She said a reminder that this data is a requirement was being sent to test providers.</p>
<p>Levine also said that requiring masks for supermarket customers and staff is under discussion by state officials.</p>
<p>Calculations using the state data showed Monroe County had the highest rate of infections per 100,000 residents in the state, followed by Lehigh, Luzerne and Pike counties, in that order. The rate of infection per 100,000 residents in Monroe was 497.44, followed by the other three counties with 488.2, 479.81 and 458.71, respectively.</p>
