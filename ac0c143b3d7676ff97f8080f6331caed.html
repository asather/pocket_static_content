<h1>Trump draws the lines </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The virtual Republican convention may give Donald Trump the boost that the Democratic convention did not give to Joe Biden.</p>
<p>The GOP event was very well produced and packaged, for one thing.</p>
<p>But, more to the point, the president and the Republicans drew sharp lines of contrast and actually made an argument.</p>
<p>The argument was simply this: Look at us. We <em>are</em> American nationalists, but we are hardly white supremacists. We have as much empathy as the next guy. But we stand, most of all, for freedom, order and jobs — whatever it takes to have a strong economy.</p>
<p>The brushstrokes of the argument are broad, but it is an argument.</p>
<p>Joe Biden’s case comes down to: Donald Trump has a fatally flawed character. I am not Donald Trump. Embrace, with me, love and light.</p>
<p>Basing his pitch on character and sentiment rather than issues is a gamble for Mr. Biden. So is a “front porch” campaign based on the dangers of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump nods to COVID-19 but will campaign. His deeper gamble is that tying Mr. Biden — a career politician with all the predispositions of a politician toward moderation and compromise — to the far left, with its Bible-burning and effigies of guillotines, can be accomplished. If Mr. Biden appears weak enough, or is weak enough, to let that happen, Mr. Trump will have some wind at his back.</p>
