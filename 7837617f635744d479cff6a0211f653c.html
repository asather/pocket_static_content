<h1>For some Pitt students this fall, hotels will serve as dorm halls</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh will use multiple hotels near campus this fall to enable it to honor housing guarantees for students seeking a residence, while reducing density in dorms to guard against COVID-19 transmission.</p>
<p>The property and facilities committee of Pitt’s board of trustees approved the plan as members met Thursday by conference call.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Meeting both of these goals — providing space for everyone who wants it and following the public health guidelines on de-densification — was a significant challenge,” said Matthew Sterne, vice chancellor for business services at Pitt.</p>
<p>“Working with the university’s Healthcare Advisory Group and community partners, we have found a solution to expand campus housing. While plans will continue to evolve as we learn more, this is a critical piece of our ability to bring students back to campus.”</p>
<p>University officials did not identify the hotels or their number. Pitt estimates it will cost $22 million.</p>
<p>About 29,000 students attend classes on Pitt’s main Oakland campus. There are approximately 6,000 residence hall students, according to university data.</p>
<p>Suite and apartment-style residence halls typically occupied by upperclass students will not need to be de-densified given room configurations, officials said. However, “a significant portion of first-year students will live in hotel residences expected to be within a 15-minute walk of campus,” according to a statement from the university.</p>
<p>Hotels will mimic campus housing, with 24-hour security and resident assistant and resident director staff for supervision, officials said. Pitt plans to update its shuttle routes to include service to those hotels.</p>
<p>Dining services will be revised, and there will be new concepts and choices, officials said. Remote ordering opportunities will be increased.</p>
<p>University officials said they are contacting residence students to apprise them of the changes and how they are impacted.</p>
<p>Jim Perricone, general manager of the Oaklander Hotel, said hotels entered a bid process about two weeks ago to put up rooms for the university.&nbsp;“With our occupancy down so much and the way that’s looking this year, it was a good way to take out some inventory,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Perricone said Pitt is looking for about 1,000 rooms, making it all but impossible for just one hotel to carry the load. He said a couple of Oakland-area hotels offered their entire inventory for the Pitt students.</p>
<p>“We’re hoping for more grad students toward our property since it’s a luxury hotel,” he said.</p>
<p>Hotels would have to meet certain requirements, changing the room configurations to two double beds, two desks and two closets.</p>
<p>Mr. Perricone said the bids were confidential between the hotels.</p>
<p>“We think within about two weeks we’ll hear more about what hotels were selected,” he said. “Usually the lowest bid wins.”</p>
<p>The Hampton Inn in Oakland is considering participating but no official offer has been extended, said Hampton sales manager Brock Dodson.&nbsp;“We’re unsure at this time,” Mr. Dodson said on Thursday.</p>
<p>The numbers will matter.&nbsp;&nbsp;“We’re potentially open to it. It needs to be economically feasible,” he said.</p>
<p>The Hampton Inn, which has 143 guest rooms, has served students in need in the past. Last year when SkyVue Apartments had an electrical fire, the hotel housed a sizable student population. That wasn’t through the university.</p>
