<p><strong>ALL WEEKEND</strong></p>
<p><strong>‘Little Shop’ opens</strong></p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the hottest musicals of the new decade from coast to coast is <strong>“Little Shop of Horrors,”</strong> and Pittsburgh is no exception. Pittsburgh Public Theater brings the monstrous musical comedy to the O’Reilly Theater, Downtown.</p>
<p>The Alan Menken-Howard Ashman show features a mix of local and New York actors, including Carnegie Mellon University grad Philippe Arroyo as Seymour, Lauren Marcus (Broadway’s “Be More Chill”) as Audrey and Pittsburgh actor Patrick Cannon as sadistic dentist Orin. Monteze Freeland is unseen but heard as the voice of the mean green man-eating plant, Audrey II.</p>
<p>It runs through Feb. 23 (times vary. Tickets: $31-$86, <a href="/ppt.org" target="_blank">ppt.org</a> or 412-316-1600.</p>

<p><strong>Lettuce entertain you</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lettuce</strong> — the self-described “genre-defying funk-jazz-soul-hip-hop-psychedelic-jam-art-rock-experimental-avant-garde” band from Boston — plays the Roxian in McKees Rocks, touring behind the Grammy-nominated “Elevate.”</p>
<p>Formed in 1992 while its members were attending a music program at Berklee College of Music, Lettuce debuted in 2002 and has become a favorite in the jam scene while also seeing its members branch out to play with Soulive and the Dave Matthews Band.</p>
<p>The band’s sixth studio album and first in three years is an instrumental groove record that leans on influences that include Tower of Power, Pink Floyd, the Grateful Dead, Miles Davis and Eno.</p>
<p>The Delvon Lamarr Organ Trio opens at 8 p.m. Tickets are $26; <a href="/roxianlive.com" target="_blank">roxianlive.com</a>.</p>

<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Alabama stars</strong></p>
<p><strong>Little Big Town</strong> stands out in the country world as one of the few popular acts with two female and two male singers in Karen Fairchild, Kimberly Schlapman, Phillip Sweet and Jimi Westbrook.</p>
<p>The quartet from Alabama, known for such hits as “Pontoon,” “Tornado,” “Day Drinking” and “Girl Crush,” plays a rare Downtown theater show at the Benedum, touring behind the new album “Nightfall,” which had a Grammy nomination for the feminist ballad “The Daughters” before it even came out.</p>
<p>In a statement, Schlapman talked about what drives Little Big Town: “From the first time we sat in the living room, it was amazing that we all gravitated to the harmonies we sing. In 20 years, we really have stayed with the harmonies we settle into organically.”</p>
<p>It begins at 8 p.m. A few tickets are available; <a href="/trustarts.org" target="_blank">trustarts.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Love songs</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Fiddlesticks</strong> turn to the sounds of Gershwin, Elgar and Mister Rogers for “Love Is In The Air,” a family concert at Heinz Hall, Downtown.</p>
<p>The PSO, conducted by Andres Franco with vocals by Katy Shackleton Williams, will illustrate how these great people/​composers expressed their love through music, and they’ll share photos of the people you love for a special slideshow on the Heinz Hall screen.</p>
<p>It begins at 11:15 a.m. Discovery Time Adventures begins at 10 a.m. Tickets are $16 to $28; <a href="/pittsburghsymphony.org" target="_blank">pittsburghsymphony.org</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cruisers turn 40</strong></p>
<p>Two years ago, Donnie Iris celebrated his 75th birthday with three nights at the Palace Theatre.</p>
<p>This year, with Iris about to turn 77, it’s another special occasion: the 40th anniversary of <strong>Donnie Iris &amp; the Cruisers</strong>. The band formed in 1980 after Iris’ stints in The Jaggerz and Wild Cherry and released “Back on the Streets,” featuring a lead track — “Ah! Leah!” — that went to No. 29 on the charts but has loomed much larger than that as the decades have gone by.</p>
<p>They went on to have more hits with “Love Is Like a Rock” and “My Girl,” not to mention radio tracks like “I Can’t Hear You” and “Do You Compute?”</p>
<p>We can expect the band to be tight and Iris to be in good voice, as usual.</p>
<p>Joe Grushecky and the Houserockers open at 7:40 p.m. at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg. Tickets are $32.40 to $77.40; <a href="/thepalacetheatre.org" target="_blank">thepalacetheatre.org</a>.</p>

<p>You have that chance at the 33rd annual City of Pittsburgh <strong>Mascot Skate</strong> at the newly reopened Schenley Park Ice Skating Rink. More than 30 mascots will hit the ice, including Iceburgh, the Pirate Parrot and the Penn State Nittany Lion, allowing parents to capture special moments on camera.</p>
