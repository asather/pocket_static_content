<h1>Wilkinsburg woman charged after fight over parking spot leads to woman being 'crushed' between two cars</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Wilkinsburg woman was charged and arrested early Tuesday after police said she fought with another woman over a parking spot, then used her car to strike a second woman — “crushing” her between two vehicles.</p>
<p>Tracey Shifflett, 35, was charged with several felony counts including attempted homicide, aggravated assault and aggravated assault by vehicle while DUI. She also faces a DUI charge, reckless endangerment and simple assault.</p>
<p>Police said they responded just before 3 a.m. to the 600 block of Holmes Street in Wilkinsburg to reports that someone had been struck by a car, and that a drunk driver was hitting vehicles and trying to leave the scene.</p>
<p>Shortly after police arrived, they saw two women engaged in a fist fight and another woman lying injured on the sidewalk, officials said.</p>
<p>The altercation began, police said, when Ms. Shifflett became upset that a car was parked in “her spot” after making it home early Tuesday. As Ms. Shifflett and the other woman fought, the woman’s mother got involved and broke up the brawl.</p>
<p>The two women then tried to get in their car and leave when Ms. Shifflett used her own vehicle to strike the mother before she could get into the car, police said.</p>
<p>The woman was "crushed" between two vehicles, and Ms. Shifflett accelerated her car so hard that she left “chunks of balled up rubber” and 20-feet of skid marks on the street, authorities said.</p>
<p>Eventually, the woman's daughter stopped Ms. Shifflett and prevented her from leaving the scene, police said. She was arrested along with Ms. Shifflett — but later released without charges — while her mother was taken to UPMC Presbyterian with a fractured pelvis and other serious injuries to her legs, police said.</p>
<p>Police said the woman’s daughter was also taken to the hospital with injuries to her face. She also had her shirt torn in the scuffle.</p>
<p>Ms. Shifflett was uncooperative and refused to take a field sobriety test, police said. Her eyes were red and glassy and she was slurring her speech. Officials said they could also smell alcohol on her breath.</p>
<p>She was found to be "highly intoxicated" after arriving at the Wilkinsburg police station, police said.</p>
<p>Ms. Shifflett was then taken to the Allegheny County Jail where she is being held without bail, court records show.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for Jan. 30 before District Judge Kim M. Hoots.</p>
