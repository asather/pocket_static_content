<h1>Broadway's Michael Campayno returns home to teach acting to students</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For those who just “gotta sing, gotta dance,” there isn’t always an obvious path. Pittsburgh native and Broadway star Michael Campayno is trying to help clear the way.</p>
<p>Campayno, a Carnegie Mellon University graduate who grew up in Forest Hills and Churchill, is teaming with Robert Michael, English teacher and director of the Moon Area High School drama department, to set up a series of instructive classes.&nbsp;It is aimed at middle school-age children, high schoolers and college students as well.</p>
<p>“It’s always been a huge passion project of mine,” he said.</p>
<p>Campayno, who worked for six years with a college audition company in New York, said the Broadway shutdown made him realize this might be the time to strike out on his own. He&nbsp;played Fiyero in “Wicked” and originated the role of Rob Camilletti in “The Cher Show” last year.</p>
<p>Although live theater is currently on hold in New York, Campayno was working on “The Other Two,” a comedy recently picked up by HBO Max for a second season. He is hopeful production will resume early next year.</p>
<p>Campayno admits he got a late start in musical theater. He didn’t begin until midway through Central Catholic High School, where winning a Gene Kelly award earned him notice.</p>
<p>“I didn’t have a mentorship or anything like that,” he said.</p>
<p>He and Michael participated in a recent Zoom interview that was sometimes interrupted by the sound of trains (Campayno was at New York City’s Penn Station waiting to go to Long Island for a teaching session). He said the core of their venture, <a href="https://www.wearethecollectivepgh.com/" target="_blank">The Collective</a>, is “the foundations of acting.”</p>
<p>“It’s honestly like a mini-Carnegie Mellon.”</p>
<p>Under social distancing protocols, they plan to have students meet once a week for eight weeks after school for two hours, beginning Sept. 14. Tentatively, in-person sessions will be at the Stage 62 theater complex in Carnegie, where there is a large outdoor area and a spacious downstairs space. Only 6-8 students will be in a class at one time.&nbsp;A free, 20-minute consult with Campayno and Michael is also offered.</p>

<p>There are three basic classes, all once a week. The Actor’s Profession is for high schoolers who hope to pursue theater in college or as a career. The Actor’s Process is also for high schoolers and is less intense. The Actor’s Beginning is for middle-school students. There is an eight-week virtual option as well.</p>
<p>“There is definitely room for everyone,” Michael said.</p>
<p>Prices range from $100 to $300 per week for most sessions, and group workshops are also offered. Sign up online at <a href="https://www.wearethecollectivepgh.com/" target="_blank">WeAreTheCollectivePgh.com</a> for scholarship auditions on Thursday.</p>
<p>“We are trying to understand the market right now,” Michael said of class size and pricing.</p>
<p>Though they acknowledged there are other, similar programs out there, Michael noted their emphasis is on middle school students who like to sing, dance or perform on stage. They need to understand that “acting is the basis for everything,” he said.</p>
