<h1>Sewickley councilman rapped over photo with armed protesters</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Sewickley Council President Jeff Neff is facing backlash after a photo of him posing with an armed group in military-style clothing circulated on the internet after a protest he attended on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More than 100 protesters gathered at the City-County Building Downtown to decry Gov. Tom Wolf’s business closures and stay-at-home orders. Mr. Neff, who is also running for the Republican nomination for the 37th state Senate district, said he attended the event with his wife to support small businesses. In one photo at the rally which was posted on Twitter by CityPaper’s Ryan Deto, Mr. Neff is seen holding his campaign poster in the center of a group known as the Iron City Citizens Response Unit holding military-style weapons.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In other photos, the same members of the group were seen wearing patches of insignia that included the Valknot – a symbol that some claim to have an association with white supremacist groups. According to the Anti-Defamation League’s website, the Valknot originally came from an old Norse symbol that often represents the afterlife. However, white supremacists have come to appropriate the symbol. When reached for comment, the Iron City group issued a statement that they were “taken aback” by how their logo cast them in a negative light and that they “publicly denounce any form of racism and will stand with any minority group should the need arise.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Neff said Friday he had no idea who they were when he first met the group on Monday and did not notice the Valknot symbol on their uniforms. “I didn’t even know what [the symbol] was,” Mr. Neff said.&nbsp;“I had to go research it.” He thought the group was originally there to promote the Second Amendment, but learned that they were small business owners who wanted to air their grievances over the shutdown of their businesses. He said the interaction only lasted three minutes, but it was long enough to get a photo of him posted on the internet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When people started reaching out to him asking about the photo, Mr. Neff first thought, “Why are they associating me with white nationalism? It’s not me, it never has been me,” saying that he’s never been part of a hate group.&nbsp;“I condemn any racism, not just white supremacy. . . . I condemn them all,” Mr. Neff said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Neff was also quickly met with criticism among his colleagues. On Thursday, borough council member Christine Allen said in a statement she is calling for an immediate special council meeting to address the&nbsp;“concerns and fears about the militia photo.” However, calling a special meeting requires either the presiding officer – who is Mr. Neff – or a total of three members to call the request. So far, she is the only one who has supported the request.</p>
<p>“I’m deeply concerned and stand in strong opposition to Jeff Neff’s disregard for public health, defiance of the stay-at-home order, and association with white nationalism,” Ms. Allen said. Over 100 residents have reached out to her sharing their concerns with the photo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sewickley Mayor Brian Jeffe said he’s heard from several residents and business owners about the photo and said they are all “appalled and outraged.”</p>
<p>“We are all in agreement that Sewickley is not fairly represented in the pictures,” Mr. Jeffe said.&nbsp;“We are a community that is known for its welcoming culture.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Jeffe said he believes Mr. Neff should step down from his position as the face of the council.</p>
<p>This photo comes to a surprise for community members, Mr. Jeffe said, as Mr. Neff has been a life-long resident and volunteer firefighter in Sewickley, a youth football coach and youth wrestling coaching assistant for Quaker Valley School District.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Neff said he’s worked hard to establish trust with the people of Sewickley, but now sees people questioning his character.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I feel bad that the people would believe this story of me. That’s the part that’s upsetting to myself and my family is that even one person in this borough would think that story is true,” Mr. Neff said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borough council vice president Todd Renner said in an email that he believes Mr. Neff’s explanation that he was not aware whom he was posing with.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Jeff has been a dedicated servant to Sewickley Borough for over 25 years and because of that will continue to have my support,” Mr. Renner said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Chairman of the Republican Committee of Allegheny County Sam DeMarco also responded to the controversy, saying that Mr. Neff made the mistake of attempting to use the “non-partisan rally” as a political event and created a “needless controversy that has obscured the larger message of the rally: that we need to put Pennsylvanians back to work.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Neff is running against Devlin Robinson in the June 2 GOP primary. Robinson campaign spokesperson Dennis Roddy said the photo is not an image that the Republican Party needs.&nbsp;“Not now, not ever,” Mr. Roddy said.&nbsp;“Jeff was the only person in the picture without a gun and he’s the only one who’s managed to shoot himself in the foot.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winner of the primary will run against Sen. Pam Iovino, D-Mt. Lebanon, in November’s general election.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the end, Mr. Neff said he doesn’t regret the photo.&nbsp;“I’m not a professional politician. I don’t have a huge team around me to sit there and say,&nbsp;‘Jeff don’t take a picture of that,’” Mr. Neff said.&nbsp;“God presents me with challenges and opportunities and I think this is his challenge to put me in check to what’s coming up ahead. People are going to be after me all the time.” For now, he said he’s working on reassuring and rebuilding trust with his constituents.</p>
