<h1>State Liquor Control Board reopening nearly 80 stores in yellow-phase counties </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is reopening some stores, in a limited fashion, to customers in counties in the northern part of the state that are in the yellow phase of Gov. Tom Wolf’s reopening plan.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PLCB board announced Wednesday that beginning Friday, 77 Fine Wine &amp;&nbsp;Good Spirits stores will resume&nbsp;limited in-store public access, following Mr. Wolf’s guidance for social distancing requirements and other&nbsp;best practices at businesses to mitigate the risks and spread of COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>All the stores will be cleaned and sanitized first, and will be outfitted with clear plastic barriers separating customers and workers at checkout. Workers will wear masks and gloves.</p>
<p>Customers also will be required to wear masks and practice social distancing, which will be communicated by signs in the stores. Signs also will direct one-way movement in aisles and discourage touching products unless the customer is purchasing them. No returns will be allowed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>No more than 25 people at a time —customers and workers -—will be permitted in a store, and smaller stores will have smaller limits. The first hour will be reserved for customers who are high-risk for COVID-19, including those who are 65 and older. Other customers are asked to shop later.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Locations of the 77 stores break down like this: four in Bradford County,&nbsp;six in Centre County, two in Clarion County, five in Clearfield County, two in Clinton County, four&nbsp;in Crawford County, two in Elk County, 15 in Erie County, two in Jefferson County, four in&nbsp;Lawrence County, seven in Lycoming County, two in McKean County, five in Mercer County,&nbsp;one in Montour County, four in Northumberland County, one in Potter County, one in Snyder&nbsp;County, one in Sullivan County, three in Tioga County, two in Union County, three in Venango&nbsp;County and one in Warren County. The full is available&nbsp;<a href="https://www.lcb.pa.gov/Consumers/Documents/Store_List_Open_Yellow.pdf" target="_blank">at the PCLB website</a>.</p>
<p>These stores will continue, as much as possible, offering curbside pickup, as will be the case at most of the system’s nearly 600 stores.&nbsp;Statewide curbside pickup sales from April 20 through May 5 totaled nearly 381,000 orders for $29.1 million in sales, including sales tax, according to preliminary, unaudited figures, the PLCB said. Customers also may continue to shop online at <a href="/finewineandgoodspirits.com" target="_blank">finewineandgoodspirits.com</a>.&nbsp;</p>
