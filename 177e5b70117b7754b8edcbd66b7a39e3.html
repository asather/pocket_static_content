<p>This fall, students attending Indiana University of Pennsylvania can expect on-campus instruction despite COVID-19, but individuals will not necessarily see all their classmates each time a course meets.</p>
<p>In announcing plans for the fall on Thursday, officials with the largest state-owned university in Western Pennsylvania said face-to-face classes will be delivered&nbsp;“teamwork style,” one of the ways living and learning will be different on the 10,600-student campus amid the ongoing pandemic.</p>
<p>IUP President Michael Driscoll, in a<a href="https://www.iup.edu/news-events/coronavirus-information/" target="_blank"> written and video message </a>to students and employees, said technology is being added to campus classrooms to support the changes. He offered an example of how the teamwork-style class will work:</p>
<p>“A class is divided into teams of students. Each team would physically attend class on a specific day, in classrooms sanitized and set up to maintain social distancing,” he said.</p>
<p>“On days when a team is not scheduled to be physically in the classroom, that team’s students would participate and interact with the class’s other teams via Zoom or similar technology.”</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll said the approach balances the importance of in-person learning with the need for social distancing to help students avoid the virus. As of Thursday, the virus has claimed more than 94,000 lives across the U.S.</p>
<p>His note did not specify what the largest class size allowable will be under the new approach and if masks will be specifically required in classes, dorms or walking around the campus.</p>
<p>However, Mr. Driscoll noted that IUP hopes to give each student a package including hand sanitizer and a mask, and that employees also will have protective equipment. IUP spokeswoman Michelle Fryling said planning related to classroom size is continuing.</p>
<p>Nationally, colleges already bracing for enrollment losses tied to the pandemic and a surge in joblessness have seen surveys suggesting the losses will be compounded if in-person instruction in some fashion is not restored. Surveys from one firm, SimpsonScarbourgh, <a href="https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/4254080/The%20April%20Replication%20of%20the%20National%20Student%20Survey%20by%20SimpsonScarborough.pdf?utm_campaign=COVID19&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;_hsmi=87169755&amp;_hsenc=p2ANqtz-8lzyTy21umnMVcr7vVvhGEWUNAJwSFJD-dnGJqtRUodGaBQJ7YdOf3_FPwvXvxh50B4fmb&amp;utm_content=87169755&amp;utm_source=hs_automation" target="_blank">projected losses could reach 20%.</a></p>
<p>At IUP, Mr. Driscoll said a survey of its campus population “confirmed for us that you want face-to-face instruction this fall.”</p>
<p>Under the university’s plan, all students in campus housing will have individual bedrooms, and in some cases individual bathrooms, with no more than two students per bathroom, Mr. Driscoll said. Dining spaces will be re-configured to accommodate the need to space out students.</p>
<p>Same-day testing for COVID-19 will be available at a medical center near campus, he said.</p>
<p>Information about the number of deposits so far for fall semester at IUP compared to this time last year was not immediately available from the university, nor was an estimate of what it will cost to make the classroom and residence hall changes.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, David Pidgeon, a spokesman for the State System of Higher Education, said officials by mid-June expect to make a more general fall announcement covering the 14 member state-owned universities.</p>
<p>Noting that the Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference regulates athletic schedules, he said the school is awaiting guidance from that group and the National Collegiate Athletic Association when teams can resume competition.</p>
<p>Mr. Driscoll said the university will need to remain flexible to any changes in public health needs that could impact the university this summer and fall. He said it will not a return to business as usual, but he expressed optimism.</p>
<p>“It feels good to tell you this,” he said. “I miss seeing students on campus.”</p>
