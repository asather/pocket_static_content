<h1>Scott commissioners discuss Cochran Road Starbucks plans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A new Starbucks store is planned for the site of the former Max and Erma’s restaurant along Cochran Road in Scott. Township commissioners discussed the plans on Tuesday.</p>
<p>A 2,500-square-foot Starbucks with a drive-thru is being proposed. The store would replace the 10,000-square-foot Max and Erma’s, which closed several years ago.</p>
<p>Michael Takacs of Bohler Engineering said the plans for the new coffee shop have been in the works for more than a year. One reason for the delay revolves around the new store warranting a left-turn lane and traffic signal on busy Cochran Road.</p>
<p>Mr. Takacs said historic traffic data shows the road already warrants a left-turn lane along the entire Cochran Road corridor based on the amount of traffic that travels it daily.</p>
<p>Mr. Takacs said a traffic count was set for May, but because of COVID-19 and many people not driving, there wouldn’t have been an accurate count.</p>
<p>He said it would be “challenging” to accommodate a left-turn lane the entire length of Cochran Road and pointed out the developer will be leaving it up to the state Department of Transportation to decide. He added that PennDOT currently does not have any such project for Cochran Road scheduled.</p>
<p>The new store would have only one point of entrance and exit, with the new driveway to be placed at the property’s current exit.</p>
<p>Commissioner Tom Castello said he thinks traffic would be worse along Cochran Road “because Starbucks is going to have more [traffic] in and out than Max and Erma’s did.</p>
<p>“I think it’s a good project. I’m just concerned,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Takacs said if PennDOT determines a turning lane is necessary for the project, the cost of that upgrade would be far beyond what the developer would want to spend.</p>
<p>Commissioners will vote on the final development plan for the Starbucks on Sept. 22. However, if PennDOT determines a turning lane is needed, Mr. Takacs said the redevelopment would not happen.</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t make economic sense,” he said.</p>
