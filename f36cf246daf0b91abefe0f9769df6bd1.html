<p>The Indianapolis Motor Speedway is putting a new spin on its classic high-speed car race.</p>
<p>In 2021, it will host the Indy Autonomous Challenge, a competition where student teams work to develop self-driving cars that can operate at speeds of 200 mph, maneuver the track and outrace their opponents.</p>
<p>Instead of professional drivers, students from around the world will be behind the metaphorical wheel. Instead of a flag to indicate a pit stop, signals will be sent instantaneously to the cars from a tower.</p>
<p>And instead of being piloted by drivers and crews, the cars will operate completely on their own.</p>
<p>“There is no human redundancy there,” said Matt Peak, managing director for Energy Systems Network, a nonprofit based in Indianapolis that works to discover and commercialize technology for the automation and energy sectors. It’s organizing the Indy Autonomous Challenge.</p>
<p>“Either your car makes this happen or smash into the wall you go,” Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>Along with Energy Systems Network and the Speedway, two Pittsburgh companies are serving as sponsors for the event: Canonsburg-based Ansys, a software company that makes simulation technology, and Aptiv, an automotive company that is building self-driving cars in Hazelwood Green.</p>
<p>Among the 31 participating teams from 37 universities is a 30-person group from the University of Pittsburgh made up of mostly undergraduate students involved in the school’s robotics and automation club.</p>
<p>Carnegie Mellon University, which is widely known for its work in autonomous technology, is not participating in the Indy Autonomous Challenge. But, the school is represented in a separate international autonomous vehicle challenge — the Roborace series. This competition is also designed to push the development of autonomous software and autonomous driving.</p>
<p>CMU will be the first U.S. team to participate in the series and anticipates competing later this year.</p>
<p>In Indianapolis, the Autonomous Challenge is a high stakes race that has $1.5 million in prize money on the line. But, just as important, students developing software for this competition could push the “state of the art,” Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>A self-driving car that can safely maneuver around a race track at 200 mph could lead to driver-assistance technology that helps humans maintain control of their own cars when they are traveling 65 mph on the freeway and a piece of lumber drops off the truck in front of them, he said.</p>
<p>Software required for the challenge would go beyond the self-driving cars that travel Pittsburgh’s streets today. Unlike those, the racing cars would not rely on a human in the driver’s seat to intervene if needed. And the new software must be able to process data at speeds much higher than those required to drive along the Boulevard of the Allies.</p>
<p>Culminating in a race on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in October 2021, the competition kicked off May 21 with the first of several rounds of challenges —&nbsp;most of which will come as a surprise to the participating teams.</p>
<p>Before getting on the track, students will rely on simulation tools to develop and test their software for scenarios they could encounter — like making sure the car can “see” its surroundings and imagining maneuvers other teams might make to cut them off.</p>
<p>The first challenge introduced the teams to simulation technology provided by Ansys. In February, the teams will use that technology to participate in the first digital race of the competition.</p>
<p>In the final race, the car’s software will have to be smart enough and have gone through enough test cases that it is ready for whatever it encounters, said Sandeep Sovani, director for the global automotive industry at Ansys.</p>
<p>“The cars, once they are on the track, out of the pit, they are on their own,” he said. “The race is completely hands off. Whatever happens in the race, it is controlled by the software that the students have written.”</p>
<p>That software will be the only thing differentiating the race cars. The physical car —&nbsp;a modified Dallara IL-15 racecar&nbsp;—&nbsp;and all the hardware will be the same for each team.</p>
<p>Teams will pay for their own vehicle, Mr. Peak said. He did not disclose how much each vehicle would cost.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p>The idea for the Indy Autonomous Challenge came about after conversations with the winner of another <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2017/10/17/darpa-urban-challenge-carnegie-mellon-university-red-whittaker-boss-2007/stories/201710160152" target="_blank">competition that pushed the envelope on autonomous vehicle technology</a>, the Darpa Grand Challenge in 2005, Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>The Darpa Grand Challenge, hosted by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, challenged teams to race a robotic vehicle through a difficult desert route. The competition was designed to create unmanned vehicles for military use and is now credited with kick-starting innovation in self-driving.</p>
<p>ESN hosted the leader of the winning team from Stanford University — Sebastian Thrun, who later went on to work with Google on self-driving technology, Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>As Mr. Peak remembers it, Mr. Thrun said there was “nothing on the horizon of that magnitude today,” so Energy Systems Network began developing a challenge that would excite students and inspire them to create technology to kick off another wave of autonomous milestones.</p>
<p>For the Pitt team, the new challenge was also met with initial skepticism.</p>
<p>The scope of the project and fast turnaround time caused the students to hesitate at first.</p>
<p>“Once you start dealing with things at that speed, at that scale, you really start dealing with a lot wider problems … and a lot of our assumptions that would work at a much slower speed start falling apart,” said Andrew Saba, a former Pitt student who is helping mentor the team. <strong><br></strong></p>
<p>Now, fully invested following some nudging from their faculty adviser Samuel Dickerson and team lead Nayana Suvarna, the group is starting to develop its “system architecture” to create a self-driving car that can operate at race speed and outmaneuver competitors.</p>
<p>The organizers accepted every team that applied as long as they met basic criteria, Mr. Peak said, and designed the competition so groups could reform and collaborate at any point.</p>
<p>Rather than eliminating teams or making it competitive to enter, ESN and its partners wanted to keep the door open and encourage collaboration that might breed more innovation, Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>That means there could be 31 cars on the speedway on race day.&nbsp;“That would be the dream,” Mr. Peak said.</p>
<p>But it is unlikely. “We’re asking these teams to do an extremely difficult challenge. This will definitely push the state of the art.”</p>
