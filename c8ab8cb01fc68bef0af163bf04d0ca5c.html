<h1>Search still on for alligators stolen from an Indiana County pet shop</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It isn’t easy to keep, feed and handle two big American alligators, and presumably it’s even harder to steal them.</p>
<p>The people who took a 6-foot-long female and 4-foot male from an Indiana County pet shop earlier this month are in some danger from big jaws and sharp teeth. Also, the alligators are at risk of being injured by improper handling and could have health issues from an improper diet, their owner said.</p>
<p>Mike Pearce said the big reptiles disappeared from their summertime outdoor enclosure at Pearce’s Pet Place in White Township sometime in the dead of night on Aug. 8. State police in the Indiana barracks are investigating.</p>
<p>“The police asked if it’s possible the alligators broke out of their pen. I said the alligators don’t know how to operate screwdrivers,” Mr. Pearce said. Twelve screws were removed to open the enclosure.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce’s biggest fear is that the people who stole the gators will simply release them into a creek or river because “the heat is on” in the investigation.</p>
<p>State police did not return calls for this story.</p>
<p>American alligators, native to Florida, Louisiana and other hot, swampy southern states, can survive in the “wild” of Western Pennsylvania for a while when air and water temperatures are relatively warm. Several times in recent years alligators have been rescued from area rivers and sent to alligator sanctuaries.</p>
<p>Alligators die in the cold temperatures of fall and winter. Because the Indiana alligators have been fed by people all their lives, it’s not clear whether they have the hunting skills to catch and kill enough fish and small mammals to survive.</p>
<p>At the pet shop, the alligators are fed large amounts of food, including rats and tilapia as well as other kinds of fish. Feeding them is somewhat costly.</p>
<p>They are not a breeding pair, Mr. Pearce said, adding that their size indicates they are too young to reproduce. Adult alligators grow to lengths of 10-15 feet.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce said he did not choose to own 6- and 4-foot alligators.</p>
<p>“Someone brought them to me a couple of years ago because they said they got too big,” he said. He took them in because “I have trouble saying no.” He has never named them.</p>
<p>The alligators weren’t for sale, “but people enjoyed coming to see them,” he said.</p>
<p>“Someone offered me $1,500 for the big female, but I didn’t sell because I didn’t think they had the facilities to take proper care of her.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce, 63, has been selling — and sometimes breeding — “exotics” at his pet store for 34 years. Right now his inventory includes baby bearded dragons and other reptiles as well as some young cockatiels and parakeets. He also has big pythons and a caiman — a reptile related to the alligator — named Survivor.</p>
<p>Five years ago, the now 35-year-old caiman was one of a small number of animals who survived a fire that destroyed the shop and Mr. Pearce’s living quarters on the second floor. It took him three years to rebuild and reopen in 2018.</p>
<p>Caimans are frequently mistaken for crocodiles or alligators, but they are a different species, native to Central and South America.</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce made muzzles for each of his alligators. The animals submitted to this calmly, because they knew he uses the muzzles to get them out of the outdoor enclosure to get a little exercise in the yard. He also uses the muzzles when he brings them inside in the winter.</p>
<p>Electric tape should not be used to keep their jaws shut because “it deforms their jaws,” he said. “I hurts when you pull it off.”</p>
<p>The female alligator is so tame that Mr. Pearce said he used to take her to gatherings where people could sit next to her. “She is always muzzled in public.”</p>
<p>Mr. Pearce told the state troopers, “I realize other crimes are a more important priority.” But he is concerned for the alligators.</p>
<p>“I am really bummed and I want them back,” he said. “If they were going to a big place where people knew how to care for them, I would be happy for them. But I fear that’s not the case.”</p>
<p>“These alligators are tame and gentle, but they are still wild animals,” said Amy Apjok, an Indiana businesswoman who helps Mr. Pearce with animal care and with the Pearce’s Pet Place Facebook page.</p>
<p>“When they are in a strange place, they may be scared of people who are scared of them,” Ms. Apjok said. “People or the animals could be hurt.”</p>
