<p>Imagine for one moment that the killing of George Floyd was not captured on video. In all likelihood, his unjust death would not have raised any red flags.</p>
<p>The Minneapolis police claimed in a news release that he had resisted arrest and then mysteriously entered into “medical distress.” The world would not know Floyd of the horrors enacted upon him were it not for the video, taken by brave bystanders.</p>
<p>But sometimes bystanders documenting police activity are singled out for punishment. In Seattle, Evan Hreha, who shot video of police macing a little girl during a protest on May 30, was arrested on suspicion of unlawfully discharging a laser pointer on June 6. He was held without bail, but later released.</p>
<p>Trumped up charges such as these work to dissuade people from video recording the police. But the First Amendment protects people’s right to document police activity. What’s more, recordings of the police are an essential accountability tool.</p>
<p>Prior to George Floyd’s death, more police body cameras was a popular proposal. But it is clear now that it is not enough.</p>
<p>When Louisville police killed David McAtee, an unarmed black man participating in protests on June 1, none of the officers involved had their body cameras turned on. The city’s police chief was fired because of the incident, but no charges have been filed.</p>
<p>It requires bravery to document police activity. People like Mr. Hreha and Ramsey Orta, who filmed the killing of Eric Garner in 2014, have been targeted by law enforcement and even imprisoned.</p>
<p>But people have a constitutional right to document police exercising official public duties. It is important to understand these rights, even and especially if others attempt to violate them. And, when an injustice is occurring, people have an obligation to document the events and make sure the world knows what happened.</p>
