<h1>Kane nursing home in Scott sees quick rise in COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Kane Community Living Center in Scott is reporting dozens of new cases of COVID-19 among residents and staff within the past several weeks.</p>
<p>According to figures from Allegheny County, which operates the Kane facilities, 52 residents and 8 staff members at the Scott location currently have the virus and one resident has died from it as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>The number of cases at the facility has risen significantly over the past two weeks. The Pennsylvania Department of Health reported on Sept. 23 only five positive resident cases, zero staff cases and zero deaths.</p>
<p>On Sept. 29, just one day before Allegheny County released its data, the DOH reported only 10 positive resident cases and zero deaths. Fewer than five staff cases were reported.</p>
<p>“The positive resident cases are recent —&nbsp;since Sept. 20-21. We can only speculate regarding the cause,” Kane Executive Director Dennis Biondo said. “Most residents and staff members are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.”</p>
<p>The Scott facility is the second of four Kane’s centers that has been hit hard by a significant COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>At its peak in mid-May, the Kane location at Glen Hazel reported well over 100 positive cases among residents and staff and almost 20 resident deaths.</p>
<p>The center has since stabilized, with Allegheny County reporting zero current active cases among residents and staff as of Wednesday.</p>
<p>Kane’s other two facilities at McKeesport and Ross have fared better. As of Wednesday, the McKeesport center has reported only one cumulative resident case, Ross has reported just three cases and both have reported six cumulative staff cases each, according to data on the county’s website.</p>
<p>The facility at Scott however has had the most cumulative resident tests by far and the second most cumulative staff tests among the Kane sites, with 1,981 tests and nearly 2,100 tests, respectively.</p>
<p>Although it is difficult to be certain of the cause of the recent spike in cases at the Scott facility, Mr. Biondo said testing ramped-up after the first few tests came back positive.</p>
<p>“Once initial recent positive resident case was identified, there was enhanced testing as required by regulations and guidance. Routine testing of all staff members is undertaken at least once every other week.” Mr. Biondo said.</p>
<p>Westmoreland Manor, a long-term care facility operated by Westmoreland County, similarly reported a spike in cases after new rounds of testing in mid-September.</p>
<p>Westmoreland Manor officials said that they began routine testing and contact tracing of its staff on Sept. 16 in accordance with requirements from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. By the following Tuesday, 32 residents and 3 staff members had tested positive for the virus.</p>
<p>As of Sept. 29, 54 residents and staff Westmoreland Manor have tested positive.</p>
<p>Seven members of the Pennsylvania National Guard were called in to help with testing by manor officials last week, and about 25 other guardsmen were also brought in to temporarily help with staffing at the facility.</p>
