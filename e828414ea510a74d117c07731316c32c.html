<h1>Paul Zeise: Patrick Mahomes is on the fast track to all-time great status</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Sunday, between all the bad commercials and much-talked about halftime show, we got to witness&nbsp;a superbly talented quarterback cement his status as the NFL’s biggest and brightest star.</p>
<p>If for some reason you didn’t know about Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes, you do now. And I’m wondering&nbsp;if Tom Brady’s record six Super Bowl titles is actually in jeopardy: Mahomes is the closest thing to Michael Jordan the NFL has ever seen. I mean that.</p>
<p>The NFL has produced hundreds of great, great players in my time. I’ve seen them all play, from Terry Bradshaw to Dan Marino to Barry Sanders to Terrell Davis to Emmitt Smith to Peyton Manning. There have been elite players, Hall of Fame players, players who changed the game.</p>
<p>I can honestly say I have never looked at one player and compared him favorably to Jordan. Much of that is a product of the sport, as football is the ultimate team game.Up until Mahomes came along, I didn’t think I would see a player who has the ability to be so dominant regardless of who his teammates are. Mahomes is Superman in a football uniform, the closest thing to Jordan, who dominated games and single handily lifted his team to championships.</p>
<p>I get a kick out of people who claim that somehow there was anyone other than Mahomes that was the Super Bowl MVP. The line is apparently because he didn’t have his usual stat line and threw a couple of interceptions. This kind of stuff makes me wonder if people actually watch the games and understand football.</p>
<p>There isn’t another quarterback I can think of that wins that game for the Chiefs on Sunday. The Chiefs could not block the 49ers or handle their&nbsp; pass rush. They couldn’t physically win battles up front. That’s usually a recipe for disaster for the offense, and for a while the 49ers were able to contain Kansas City. Mahomes had very few clean pockets to work with, but he still made his magic.</p>
<p>It was the ultimate example of — and I’ll say it in my John Facenda voice — “Great players aren’t great all the time. They’re only great when they have to be.”&nbsp; Mahomes kept the Chiefs alive the same way he kept play after play alive. Tom Brady is a great player, but we have seen that when things aren’t close to perfect around him — the line blocking, receivers running precise routes, running backs hitting the right holes — he becomes mortal. Ditto with Manning, Drew Brees and just about every great quarterback.</p>
<p>Mahomes is special. I knew that before Sunday, but watching him lift the Chiefs to their first Super Bowl in a half century just put him in a different category of elite in my mind. He did it on the biggest stage and against a team, to me, that was clearly superior to his. If you swapped&nbsp;the two quarterbacks, I think the 49ers win by at least three touchdowns.</p>
<p>Yes, football is the ultimate team game, but on Sunday, Mahomes&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 13.3333px;">proved he is the</span>&nbsp;NFL’s best and most dominant player.</p>
