<h1>Homestead man arrested for abuse of stepchildren</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A Homestead man has been arrested after a five-month investigation on charges of beating two stepdaughters and a 2-year-old stepson with a belt, among other abuses.</p>
<p>Randall Blair, 30, faces one count each of aggravated assault, strangulation and terroristic threats; two counts of simple assault; and three counts each of endangering a child and reckless endangerment.</p>
<p>One girl, 10, said Mr. Blair gouged her eye, causing a hemorrhage, while also drawing blood with his fingernail. She also was beaten with a black belt while lying in a fetal position, causing bruises on her thigh, shin and upper arm, along with a broken thumbnail. The 7-year-old stepdaughter also sustained bruising from beatings with the belt while also describing how Mr. Blair strangled her, according to the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The 2-year-old boy was found to have a scabbed abrasion on a cheekbone, and abrasions and bruising on his right upper ear, with possible bruising of his groin. He also tested positive for cocaine and a cocaine metabolite.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Examined by UPMC Childrenâ€™s Hospital physician, the children also were found to be underfed, having insufficient medical and dental care, all while living in an unsafe house whose conditions were described in the complaint as deplorable.</p>
<p>The 10-year-old stepdaughter said she and her siblings were fed only two meals a day, and not allowed snacks, with a typical meal consisting of a box of macaroni and cheese mixed with a can of tuna fish that had to be shared by five siblings.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigation began in August with charges filed Dec. 5.</p>
