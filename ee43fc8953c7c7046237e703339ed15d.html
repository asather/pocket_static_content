<h1>Trio of 1,000-point scorers leaving lasting legacy at Cornell</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bill Sacco has been coaching basketball since 1966, and for the most part, he has always done it the same way.</p>
<p>Now, more than 50 years into his career, Cornell’s boys basketball coach is learning to do things a little bit differently.</p>
<p>“[The players] call the plays. We have them, they call them,” Sacco said. “They have the feel of the game, they know what they want to call and want to run, so we kind of let that go. And if we get bogged down or something, then we’ll help them and say, ‘Hey, let’s try this.’ But they usually make all the calls.</p>
<p>“I’ve been doing it 50 years and I’m like, ‘Wow, this is quite different.’”</p>
<p>Although it’s not exactly unheard of, it’s certainly rare for a high school coach to defer play-calling duties to his players. That being said, the Raiders are no ordinary high school team.</p>
<p>With seniors Kaden DiVito (20.8 ppg), Isaiah Langston (18.6 ppg) and Zaier Harrison (16.6 ppg) calling the shots — and making them — there haven’t been many more exciting teams to watch in the WPIAL than Cornell this year.</p>
<p>Led by its trio of 1,000-point scorers, the Raiders made it back to the WPIAL Class 1A championship game for the first time in eight years. And although they lost their rubber match vs. Vincentian at Petersen Events Center, they had no trouble refocusing their attention on the state playoffs.</p>
<p>“We just put it behind us and said, ‘We didn’t win the championship at the Pete, but there’s another one that’s in sight,’” DiVito said. “We were able to regroup, and we’re making a good run right now.”</p>
<p>First, Cornell got back to its winning ways with a 74-29 rout vs. Saltsburg in its first-round PIAA playoff game. The Raiders then handed Elk County Catholic only its second loss of the season, 53-44, to set up a Class 1A quarterfinal showdown vs. Bishop Carroll that has since been postponed due to concerns over the spread of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Cornell’s state title hopes aren’t the only goals being put on hold, though. DiVito and Langston are on the verge of some monumental milestones that they might not have the opportunity to reach.</p>
<p>DiVito, who scored his 1,000th point early on in his junior season, is only 30 points away from scoring 2,000 for his career. Langston, meanwhile, recently joined DiVito and Harrison as members of the 1,000-point club, and the high-flying 6-2 guard/forward is on the cusp of pulling down 1,000 rebounds for his career as well.</p>
<p>Even if he doesn’t get the chance to pursue that feat, Langston can rest easy knowing what he and his best friends have already accomplished.</p>
<p>“It feels amazing, because growing up, you always want to make a name for yourself,” Langston said. “And I feel like me, Kaden and Zaier, we made a name for ourselves in the WPIAL. It’s just a really good feeling to be a part of history.”</p>
<p>Of course, the trio’s athletic pursuits aren’t limited to just the hardwood. Harrison was one of the best quarterbacks in the WPIAL last fall as he led the Raiders to the WPIAL Class 1A semifinals along with their first playoff win in program history — and Langston and DiVito served as his primary receiving targets.</p>
<p>“It’s nice, because we’re all in the same class and we’re close friends,” Harrison said. “The top basketball scorer at our school is Kaden, I’m the top quarterback in our school for passing yards, and Isaiah is up on the 1,000 points list with us, too.”</p>
<p>Despite the uncertainty surrounding the fate of the PIAA postseason, though, DiVito and his teammates aren’t worrying about what’s out of their control. Even if they have played their final game together, it’s safe to say they’ve accomplished what they set out to do before the season.</p>
<p>“We talked about it since [the summer], just really making our mark this year and going out on the highest note possible,” DiVito said. “Just trying to put Cornell on our backs and give them some exposure again for our final ride.</p>
<p>“Just enjoy it while we can, our last year of high school. You’ve got to go all out for it.”</p>
