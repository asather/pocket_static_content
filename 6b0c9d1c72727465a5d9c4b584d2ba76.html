<h1>Skills coach Ty Hennes relishes back-breaking work with Penguins</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As far as life-altering decisions go, this was one was a cinch for Ty Hennes.</p>
<p>Hennes in 2013 was on the verge of earning his doctorate from Parker College of Chiropractic Medicine in Dallas. He also had a job offer from USA Hockey.</p>
<p>Years earlier, Hennes was skating in the Detroit Red Wings organization when he gave up his NHL dream to become a sports chiropractor. Since his days at Boston College, he had been fascinated by the human body and advancements in sports science. Now, he could help injured athletes regain peak performance.</p>
<p>Soon, Hennes would have his doctorate in addition to staggering student loan bills that a career in coaching probably wouldn’t be paying off any time soon.</p>
<p>So what did he want to be? A doctor with a comfortable living? Or a coach?</p>
<p>Tuesday in Las Vegas, as he grinned wide while pushing the best hockey player of this generation in a grueling workout at T-Mobile Arena, it was clear that Hennes, now a skills development coach for the Penguins, picked the right path.</p>
<p>“My office, I think, is the best office in the world, being out on the ice,” Hennes said. “There can be some long days. But I wouldn’t trade it for anything.”</p>
<p>This season, there have been more of those long days than in years past. One of his many responsibilities with the Penguins, who hired him in 2015, is to help players who are rehabbing injuries return at full health and with little sign of rust. Their many injuries, including one to Sidney Crosby, have kept him busy.</p>
<p>His infectious joy for the game, his eagerness to learn and adapt and his perfect storm of a background, being both a doctor and an ex-player, have helped Hennes earn the trust of Crosby and teammates up and down the depth chart.</p>
<p>“I work with him all the time. He’s awesome,” Jared McCann said. “He’s a great skills coach, probably one of the best ones I’ve had. He knows the game so well. He’s skilled himself. He can make plays. He’s a player. He’s a player.”</p>
<p><strong>First lesson</strong></p>
<p>The September he started medical school, Hennes, for the first time since he was a toddler in North Dakota, was not a player, at least not first and foremost.</p>
<p>Hennes was about 9 when his family moved to the Seattle area. Washington was not exactly a hockey hotbed, so both Hennes and his classmates identified him as “the hockey kid.” He was a standout in football and baseball, too, good enough to earn scholarship offers in both sports. But he loved hockey.</p>
<p>He would go on to play at Boston College. The 5-foot-9 forward scored 16 goals and 42 points in four seasons and won an NCAA title alongside Brooks Orpik and Rob Scuderi in 2001. For two years, he juggled pre-med classes and a rigorous lab schedule with Hall of Fame coach Jerry York’s afternoon practices.</p>
<p>“I wasn’t the most skilled player. My work ethic and my skating ability helped me put it together. I never had a lesson growing up,” he said. “At Boston College, Ron Rolston was one of our assistant coaches. He was pretty big on individual skill development. He would take three or four of us out on the ice at a time.”</p>
<p>Those skill sessions planted a seed with Hennes, who was intrigued by the idea of working 1-on-1 with elite athletes and helping them grow as players.</p>
<p>After his senior year, he signed with the Red Wings as an undrafted free agent in 2004. That season, Hennes had seven goals and 11 assists at the ECHL level.</p>
<p>“My first year of pro was 2004-05. That was the lockout year [in the NHL]. I found out that life in the minor leagues isn’t so glamorous,” Hennes said. “And I knew that I would probably never be an NHL hockey player. I could only defer my seat at medical school for two years. I had that two-year window to accept.”</p>
<p>So Hennes was off to Parker College of Chiropractic Medicine in Dallas.</p>
<p><strong>Coaching roots</strong></p>
<p>When he started classes at Parker College, his old teammates were gearing up for NHL training camps. He started to get the itch, too. He decided he would scratch it by getting involved with an emerging youth hockey scene down in Texas.</p>
<p>The first team Hennes coached had a kid named Seth Jones, who later became an All-Star blue-liner for the Columbus Blue Jackets. Current NHLers Blake Coleman and Stefan Noesen, a Penguin earlier this season, were on that team, too.</p>
<p>In the ensuing years, he got involved with USA Hockey. He was asked to attend U.S. national player development camps. He spoke at coaching clinics. There, he first crossed paths with Mike Sullivan, a big supporter of USA Hockey.</p>
<p>“I was busy. But hockey was my release,” he said. “It was my way of getting away from the books. It helped me keep my sanity those six years in Dallas.”</p>
<p>Hennes said that in his third year of medical school, USA Hockey first offered him a full-time position. “But I needed to finish what I started,” he said.</p>
<p>When it was time for him to graduate, their offer was still on the table.</p>
<p>“It was an easy decision,” Hennes said. “I knew what I wanted to do.”</p>
<p>Hennes spent three years with USA Hockey. When the Penguins opened UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex in 2015, they brought Hennes aboard in a dual role.</p>
<p>He helped coach Pens Elite players and was part of other youth hockey initiatives at the facility. He also sharpened the skills of Penguins players and hit the road to help develop prospects down in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton and Wheeling.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Sullivan and the Penguins made him a full-time coach.</p>
<p>“He’s a chiropractor and happens to love hockey, so he decides to become a skills coach,” Sullivan said, chuckling. “But when you think in those terms, he has a real good understanding of biology and how everything functions, whether it be your neuromuscular capacity or the brain’s importance in motor skill development.</p>
<p>“I’ve yet to be around a skills coach that has a grasp of it as well as Ty does.”</p>
<p><strong>Valuable member</strong></p>
<p>It is Tuesday morning in Vegas and Crosby has been on the ice for a while now.</p>
<p>Hennes, whom the Penguins brought along on their recent road trip in large part to help inch Crosby closer toward a return, is pushing the superstar so hard that at one point Crosby jokingly asks if there is a defibrillator on the bench.</p>
<p>Hennes is all smiles as he barks out instructions and words of encouragement.</p>
<p>“It’s pretty special to have an attitude like that,” Zach Aston-Reese said. “He’s waking up early in the morning because [injured players skate] before everyone else. He just has a good attitude and his smile changes your attitude.”</p>
<p>Aston-Reese missed a chunk of last season with a broken hand. While on injured reserve, he spent a lot of time with Hennes, who homed in on his skating.</p>
<p>“Coming back, I felt so good. I felt fast,” the forward said. “He helps a lot of guys. This year, we’ve been unfortunate with injuries but you see guys come back and they don’t really miss a beat. I think that speaks volumes to what Ty does.”</p>
<p>His responsibilities are much more than working with the injured guys.</p>
<p>Hennes said that over the last five years, there has been a heightened interest in skills development at the NHL level, though some teams still don’t have a full-time staffer dedicated to that area. The Penguins, one of the more progressive clubs, saw they had something special in Hennes given his unique background.</p>
<p>Sullivan trusts him to take the lead in some of the team’s skills-heavy practices. Hennes will also provide drills for players to try in the offseason, whether it’s to help Bryan Rust become tougher to knock off the puck or McCann to get his shot off quicker. He still checks in on their minor-league affiliates regularly.</p>
<p>The 40-year-old coach laces up his skates between 40 and 50 times a month. If you bumped into him in a press box, with his muscular build in a well-tailored suit, you might think he was one the team’s healthy scratches that night.</p>
<p>Hennes has a hand in scouting, too. Once the amateur scouting staff narrows its prospect pool in the spring, he writes up a “skills portfolio” on each one.</p>
<p>“Ty wears a lot of hats for our team,” Sullivan said. “He’s an important coach.”</p>
<p>Hennes considers himself the “luckiest guy” on the ice. He has a blast helping players improve or return to action and, subsequently, the Penguins win games.</p>
<p>But if he ever gets bored doing this, he can always put that doctorate to use.</p>
<p>“It’s an expensive Plan B option with all the student loans,” he said with a laugh.</p>
