<h1>COVID-19 causing ‘very minimal’ but noteworthy funeral home backlog in Allegheny County</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s restrictions on gatherings have caused a manageable, yet noteworthy backlog at Allegheny County funeral homes and cemeteries.</p>
<p>Between 150 and 200 families in Allegheny County are currently waiting to celebrate their deceased loved ones with funeral services, said John Lester, president of the Allegheny County Funeral Directors’ Association.</p>

<p>Lester added that Allegheny County’s backlog figure is “very minimal” relative to what funeral homes in New York City and Philadelphia have experienced, given their cities’ exposure to the coronavirus. Allegheny County’s COVID-19 confirmed case count, as of Wednesday, stands at 1,545 — far fewer than Philadelphia County’s 15,218 and the 50,311 in Kings County (Brooklyn) alone.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen what New York has seen or even what Philadelphia has seen. So on that side, our numbers are going to be a lot lower,” Lester said. “But there is that backlog of people who were cremated that want to have a visitation later on and even ones who have been buried who want to have a celebration of life service at a later time. We’re going to see that in the backlogs there, along with whatever funerals are still coming in.”</p>
<p>Right now, the CDC recommends limiting gatherings for funeral visitation and Mass to 10 people. That has persuaded many families to postpone services and wait until restrictions are lifted so more people can attend.</p>

<p>Lester said funeral service limitations will loosen from 10 to 25 people on Friday, when Allegheny County and most of southwestern Pennsylvania enters the “yellow phase” of Gov. Tom Wolf’s statewide reopening process. That will bring both funeral directors and families a little more flexibility in having services sooner.</p>
<p>But Lester still expects to have a backlog whenever Allegheny County reaches the “green phase.” And when it does, he believes the funeral homes in the area will be prepared.</p>
<p>“In New York, I know people are calling funeral home to funeral home asking, ‘Can you take our loved one?’ And that’s where it is because the numbers are so great up there,” Lester said. “But over here, looking at where we’re at, we’re actually moving along pretty well. ... We haven’t gotten the storm, and I think the storm has passed us. I think for us it’s going to be a fairly easy transition to get the backlogs through.</p>
<p>“Now, when things open back up, do we get a second wave? Who knows? We’ll just have to address that when the time comes.”</p>
