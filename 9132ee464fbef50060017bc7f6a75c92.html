<p>LOS ANGELES — Los Angeles bars and nightclubs will close and restaurants must halt dine-in service and limit their business to takeout orders until March 31 as part of the city’s efforts to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus, Mayor Eric Garcetti said Sunday night.</p>
<p>Retail businesses, gyms and fitness centers will be closed, Garcetti said in a video news conference. Grocery stores, pharmacies and food banks will remain open.</p>
<p>The order was to go into effect midnight Sunday.</p>
<p>The announcement came on the heels of a request Sunday afternoon by Gov. Gavin Newsom urging bars, nightclubs, wineries and breweries in California to shut down operations. Newsom also called for the home isolation of people over age 65 and those with chronic disease — both high risk populations for the virus.</p>
<p>The governor said the request of older Californians was made in hopes of limiting their exposure to the virus, given that health officials have pointed out higher dangers for those who are older.</p>
<p>“We are prioritizing their safety,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>The new guidelines come following other broad efforts announced in recent days to combat the virus in California. Most of those have been taken on the local level, including the decision by dozens of school districts to shut down operations for the next two weeks or longer.</p>
<p>Newsom did not, though, mandate the closure of all restaurants in the state. In an afternoon briefing with reporters, he said 335 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in California with six people having died.</p>

<p>The new guidelines come following other broad efforts announced in recent days to combat the virus in California. Most of those have been taken on the local level, including the decision by dozens of school districts to shut down operations for the next two weeks or longer. On Friday, Newsom issued an executive order assuring those schools of continued funding during closures.</p>
<p>The governor said he would issue additional directives on Tuesday to schools that remain open and said he was especially focused on providing support to low-income families. He suggested some local school officials had not fully thought through the consequences when closing schools.</p>
<p>“It’s one thing to say you have a plan and it’s another to actually deliver that plan,” Newsom said.</p>
<p>Newsom acknowledged the outbreak of the virus was a fluid situation that state and local officials would need to continue to monitor the situation as events merit.</p>
