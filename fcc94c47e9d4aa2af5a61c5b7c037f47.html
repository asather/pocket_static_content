<h1>'One of a kind': How Pitt's Jeff Capel, ACC coaches will remember Kobe Bryant</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Jeff Capel learned of Sunday’s news with his players.</p>
<p>Pitt’s coach didn’t give a speech about the death of Kobe Bryant and the meaning of life on a moment’s notice. But Capel was there at the Petersen Events Center for the young men who grew up “idolizing” the Los Angeles Lakers legend. And he was available Sunday night, texting with and consoling the Panthers who reached out to him.</p>
<p>Capel, like Mike Krzyzewski, Jim Boeheim and his peers across the ACC, recognized Bryant as someone who was looked up to by those young and old. And on Monday’s coaches conference call, he called the tragedy of Bryant dying in a helicopter crash on Sunday in Southern California “a huge loss.”</p>
<p>“As a champion, a winner, a fierce competitor,” Capel said, when asked how he would remember Bryant. “But probably more so as a very loving father, and a guy that’s trying to make a difference in the world post-basketball.”</p>
<p>Later Monday afternoon, when Capel met with reporters at the Pete, he said it’s “hard to believe” Bryant is gone.</p>
<p>“It’s like a superhero dying,” Capel added. “Kobe was one of these guys that seemed invincible.”</p>
<p>Bryant — who was killed along with his daughter, Gianna, and seven others — was 41 years old.</p>
<p>Born in Philadelphia, Bryant starred at Lower Merion High School in Ardmore, where he achieved a reputation as the best high school player in the country. He won the 1996 PIAA state championship eight days before featuring in the McDonald’s All-American game at the Civic Center in March of ’96. Three months later — at 17 years old — he was drafted No. 13 overall by the Charlotte Hornets and subsequently traded to the Lakers. He played his entire 20-year career in L.A. and captured five NBA titles.</p>
<p>When Bryant entered the league out of high school, he did so with questions and eyebrows raised.</p>
<p>Florida State’s Leonard Hamilton, who coached the Washington Wizards in 2000-01, “admired” Bryant’s decision to forgo the college ranks. Wake Forest head coach Danny Manning — who competed against Bryant for nearly a decade — recalled Kobe’s introduction to the NBA being met with some hesitation.</p>
<p>“When you get to that level, you want to show that you belong. And he was no different. The only thing that was different about him was, he didn’t mind telling you that he was going to be great,” Manning said. “I think early on in his career, that rubbed people wrong. But as people got to see his work ethic, see what he was all about, see the sacrifices that he made, there became more of an appreciation.”</p>
<p>Manning, whose Demon Deacons hosted Virginia on Sunday, was told the crushing report as he left his postgame press conference. Walking off the podium, members of the media informed him of what happened — news he called “staggering.”</p>
<p>Cavaliers coach Tony Bennett was on the team bus with his players leaving Wake Forest’s Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum when news of Bryant’s death spread on social media. Bennett said he did not address his team then and there, but the suddenness of the moment was felt by everyone on the Virginia bus. To Bennett specifically, it served as “a reality check.”</p>
<p>“It makes you realize how precious life is and makes you think about your own mortality,” Bennett said. “All the lives that were lost, you just step back and you think. It’s so sad.”</p>
<p>Krzyzewski echoed that sentiment, calling Sunday “a tragic, shocking day” for all the families affected. Duke’s longtime coach added that he felt Bryant was a part of his actual family and “the USA basketball family.”</p>
<p>Krzyzewski helmed the national team for more than a decade, leading the team to gold medals in the 2008, 2012 and 2016 Olympics. During that time, “Coach K” and Kobe forged a friendship, one built on trust and being the father to daughters. One of Krzyzewski’s grandchildren adopted the nickname, “Mamba” — Bryant’s famous moniker — after meeting the Lakers star at the 2008 Olympics in Beijing.</p>
<p>Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim experienced something similar. Boeheim — a former assistant coach with Team USA — said his son, Buddy, a starting guard for the Orange, was a “Kobe fan right from the beginning” after Bryant met with the younger Boeheim at Olympic practices.</p>
<p>It was at those practices that Boeheim realized what kind of a player Bryant really was.</p>
<p>The coach met “Mamba” at Olympic qualifiers in 2007 in Las Vegas. Boeheim and Krzyzewski both said Bryant mentored the “young players,” including LeBron James, Carmelo Anthony, Dwayne Wade and Chris Bosh, during that time. And, according to Boeheim, Bryant’s work ethic — “We practiced once; he practiced twice,” the coach said — set the tone for what was dubbed, “The Redeem Team.”</p>
<p>“He’s just the most driven athlete that I’ve seen,” Boeheim said. “I think [Michael] Jordan was like that. But they’re really the two that stand out in my lifetime of basketball in terms of wanting to be the best and doing everything — everyone wants to be the best, but very few people do everything to be the best. And he did that. And he was determined that we were going to win that Olympics. He was not going to be denied.”</p>
<p>After disappointing bronze medals at the 2004 Olympics and 2006 FIBA World Championship, Bryant, the team’s captain, and Krzyzewski’s squad blew through the competition. Team USA won its first seven Olympic contests by an average of 30.3 points. But when the gold medal game against Spain got close, Bryant took over.</p>
<p>Up two with eight minutes to go, Kobe hit a double-pump jumper in the lane that Boeheim recalls as the play that “really won the game for us.” Bryant later hit a dagger 3 while fouled with three minutes left, completing a four-point play and extending Team USA’s lead to nine. The locked in superstar finished with 20 points in the national team’s memorable gold medal triumph.</p>
<p>“Kobe was one of a kind. He wasn’t like anybody; everyone was trying to be like him,” Krzyzewski said. “He was always in pursuit of special and the next moment. ... I’m heartbroken, really, as are so many millions around the world.”</p>
<p>After he retired from basketball in 2016, Bryant’s “next moment” included winning an Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 2018 — “Dear Basketball” earned the first-ever Oscars win for a professional athlete — and coaching his late daughter, Gianna.</p>
<p>To Manning, the fact that Bryant can no longer finish his post-basketball journey with his family is the “biggest tragedy” in all of this.</p>
<p>Capel felt that, too.</p>
<p>“A lot of guys have a hard time when they retire, especially someone that loves the game so much,” Capel said at the Pete. “It was interesting because it seemed like a seamless transition. He poured himself into other stuff. He had other passions. For goodness sake, the guy won an Oscar. Then the passion of his family.&nbsp;For me, I think that’s where it hit home the most, just the human side of it. I loved him as a player. I loved watching him.</p>
<p>“As a guy that has daughters, that has young kids — my oldest is 12 — and my kids travel with me to recruit sometimes, it hits close to home when you think about it that way.”</p>
