<h1>Thief who worked at Bettis lab deserves prison, feds say; lawyers want probation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Robert Lazur, who stole $250,000 in taxpayer money, should go to prison for his "brazen" crimes and not honoring the terms of his plea deal, the U.S. government said Wednesday.</p>
<p>But his lawyers say prison is not warranted, considering his lack of a prior criminal record and his various personal problems, and he should get probation.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazur, 31, of West Mifflin, was a logistics coordinator for BWXT Technical Services Group. The firm was a subcontractor for Bechtel Marine Propulsion Corp., a contractor at the Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory in West Mifflin.</p>
<p>He was working on a project at Bettis funded by the Department of Energy and used company credit cards and open purchase orders to make hundreds of purchases for himself. He sold some items on eBay, kept others and gave some to his friends.</p>
<p>He pleaded guilty last year to theft of government funds and faces sentencing May 27 before U.S. District Judge William Stickman.</p>
<p>His lawyers, William Difenderfer and Stephanie Noel, said he stole the money to be able to take care of his fiancee and a baby on the way. Mr. Lazur was also at a low point in his life, they said, dealing with the breakup of his parents, an alcohol problem and spending sprees at casinos.</p>
<p>The lawyers said that while a casual observer might see Mr. Lazur's thefts as motivated by simple greed, his conduct was really a "misguided and destructive form of self-medication."</p>
<p>To make matters worse, they said, Mr. Lazur's fiancee left him after the guilty plea appeared in the news.</p>
<p>They asked the judge for probation and home detention so he can continue working at a new job and pay restitution.</p>
<p>Assistant U.S. Attorney Lee Karl wants prison.</p>
<p>Mr. Lazur stole the money hundreds of times over two years, from January 2016 to December 2017, "and he only stopped because he got caught," Mr. Karl said.</p>
<p>"By any measure, this is a significant amount of criminal conduct and a serious crime," he said.</p>
<p>He also said Mr. Lazur has not done what he promised to do in his plea agreement.</p>
<p>As part of his deal, he was supposed to sell guns he'd bought with stolen money so that the funds could be used for restitution. He didn't do that and didn't respond to repeated calls by the government. Finally in March he called a deputy U.S. marshal to say he'd sold the guns and had sent a check to the U.S. attorney's office for $3,500.</p>
<p>No such check has arrived, the government says. Mr. Karl said any credit Mr. Lazur might have received for his guilty plea is negated by his lack of cooperation since.</p>
<p>"Indeed, the United States has wasted considerable time attempting to assist the defendant with his obligations, only to be repeatedly ignored," he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Karl asked Judge Stickman to give Mr. Lazur a "significant" prison term for the restitution issue and his "long course of fraud and lies."</p>
