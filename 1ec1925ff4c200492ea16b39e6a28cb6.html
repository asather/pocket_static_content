<h1>Nick Bjugstad returns to the Penguins' lineup after missing 46 games</h1>

<p>BUFFALO, N.Y. — The process took longer than the Penguins and he expected, but Nick Bjugstad was back in action Thursday against the Buffalo Sabres.</p>
<p>Bjugstad last skated for the Penguins on Nov. 15, when a core muscle injury he had dealt with for much of the young season became too much for him to bear. After he underwent surgery, the Penguins announced that Bjugstad would be out at least eight weeks. Nearly 16 weeks later, Bjugstad finally returned.</p>
<p>“I didn’t think I’d have that many nerves. I was a little nervous going into it, just because it had been so long,” he said. “I just wanted to go out and get my feet under me. That’s a fast team over there. We had our ups and downs. I thought I could have been a little better defensively. So we’ll brush up on that.”</p>
<p>He added: “Being back in the lineup, I’m very thankful. It’s been a long time.”</p>
<p>Bjugstad missed 46 games following his core muscle surgery. Prior to that, he had just one goal and no assists in 10 games. His nagging injury, which also landed him on injured reserve a week into the season, was presumably a factor.</p>
<p>After his recovery stalled in January and the Penguins pumped the brakes on his on-ice activity, Bjugstad resumed skating about three weeks ago. He finally joined his teammates at practice last week while the team was in California.</p>
<p>“I had a lot of off-ice training and on-ice training. So I think I felt like I was [physically] ready,” the 27-year-old said. “But at the same time, you’ve got to read and react, which you can’t really replicate in a lot of skates. It’s just good to get that first one under my belt and keep continuing to progress.”</p>
<p>The return of Bjugstad gives coach Mike Sullivan another versatile option for his lineup, which has lacked offense lately from the bottom two lines. Bjugstad is a skilled, 6-6 forward capable of playing center or on the wing.</p>
<p>On Thursday, he centered the third line, with Jared McCann and Patric Hornqvist on his wings. That trio played some good hockey down the stretch last season after the Penguins acquired Bjugstad and McCann from the Florida Panthers.</p>
<p>“We know how we all play,” he said Wednesday. “I’ll just see how that pans out. Jared, I know what he does. He works hard. He’s a skilled player.”</p>
<p>Bjugstad logged just over 11 minutes of ice time in his first game back and earned an assist by crashing the net before Hornqvist’s first-period goal.</p>
<p><strong>Tanev suits up, too</strong></p>
<p>Brandon Tanev, who missed Tuesday’s 7-3 win over the Ottawa Senators due to an illness and was not well enough to practice Wednesday, returned to the lineup against the Sabres. He skated on the line centered by Teddy Blueger.</p>
<p>Tanev leads all Penguins players in hits and is first among forwards in blocked shots. But entering Thursday, the winger had not scored in a dozen games.</p>
<p>With Tanev and Bjugstad suiting up, Sam Lafferty was the odd man out up front. Defensemen Chad Ruhwedel and Juuso Riikola were also healthy scratches.</p>
<p><strong>Praise for Rodrigues</strong></p>
<p>Since the Penguins acquired Evan Rodrigues from the Sabres on Feb. 24, he has played all three forward positions. Thursday, he lined up at right wing.</p>
<p>Sullivan had praise for Rodrigues before the forward faced his former team.</p>
<p>“He’s one of those utility guys that can play all three forward positions. He can kill penalties. He can take faceoffs,” the coach said. “Those guys are valuable, when you need guys to plug into the lineup out of necessity to fill certain roles or to fill certain needs based on where the team’s at on a given night.”</p>
<p><strong>Hey, you look familiar</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins faced off against Dominik Kahun, their former teammate who was sent to the Sabres last week in exchange for Rodrigues and Conor Sheary.</p>
<p>Kahun, who skated on the Sabres’ second line, credited the Penguins for making him a better player this season. Sullivan agreed that Kahun “improved a lot.”</p>
<p>“I give Dominik a lot of credit,” he said. “He works hard at the game. I think he’s a guy that really likes the game. He’s got an appetite to improve and get better. He did a good job for us when he was here. He is a good offensive player.”</p>
