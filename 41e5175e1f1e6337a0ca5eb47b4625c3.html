<h1>Post-Gazette game of the week: Fast start helps Pine-Richland roll past Upper St. Clair</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Like sporting events everywhere, something is missing from Friday night WPIAL football games this season due to the COVID-19 pandemic. If schools do allow spectators, it’s a smattering of fans.</p>
<p>But despite the lack of enthusiasm from a crowd, there is still an electric feeling surrounding Pine-Richland’s team. The Rams are simply providing it themselves.</p>
<p>Pine-Richland is having a ball so far. The Rams hammered an overmatched Fox Chapel team in the season opener. Then Pine-Richland went on the road Friday and handled one of the other top Class 5A teams in the state.</p>
<p>Pine-Richland was dominant in the first two-and-a-half quarters, jumped to a 27-point lead and then coasted to a 34-13 victory against host Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>Pine-Richland, the Post-Gazette’s No. 1 Class 5A team in the WPIAL and state, is 2-0 overall, 1-0 in conference and has outscored two opponents, 87-20. Upper St. Clair, the No. 3 WPIAL 5A team, dropped to 1-1 in the conference and overall.</p>
<p>“You have to create your own energy and enthusiasm,” Pine-Richland coach Eric Kasperowicz said. “It’s just not the same this year. I hope we can continue to create some energy. I don’t know if the Governor [Tom Wolf] makes all the rules. I know I don’t. But it just would be nice to get some people into games. If not, it’s on us to do what we need to do to create our own atmosphere.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;Pine-Richland used a potent offense and strong offensive and defensive lines to dominate the Panthers. Pine-Richland outgained Upper St. Clair, 451-237, and the Rams did that despite being a little sloppy in the final quarter and a half. In two games, Pine-Richland has gained 995 yards.</p>
<p>One of Pine-Richland’s standouts was senior defensive end-offensive guard Miguel Jackson. He had 3½ sacks and batted a pass in the air that ended in an interception.</p>
<p>“I try to get people hyped,” Jackson said. “There are no parents here at games and hardly any fans. It is what it is. But we have to create some type of atmosphere with our play. We’re playing as a team and we have to keep playing like that.”</p>
<p>Pine-Richland senior quarterback Cole Spencer had another big game, completing 19 of 31 passes for 245 yards and three touchdowns. Alex Gochis caught 6 passes for 64 yards. Pine-Richland played most of the game without standout receiver-defensive back Eli Jochem, who sustained an injury in the first quarter.</p>
<p>But Upper St. Clair played the entire second half without David Pantelis, a Yale recruit and another standout receiver-defensive back.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair quarterback Ethan Dahlem completed 17 of 29 passes for 224 yards, but much of that came in the second half when the game was out of reach. Upper St. Clair had only 103 yards in the first half and Dahlem, who also is an adept runner, finished the game with minus-10 yards rushing because of sacks.</p>
<p>“Our defensive and offensive lines — we were more physical. That was the difference-maker,” Jackson said.</p>
<p>It took exactly one minute for Pine-Richland to put its signature on this game. The Rams’ no-huddle offense is all about tempo and the Rams were in the end zone before the 100 or so fans in attendance blinked twice. Pine-Richland moved 77 yards in four plays in only 60 seconds.</p>
<p>Spencer threw two touchdown passes to Gochis of 6 and 8 yards in the first half.</p>
<p>But Pine-Richland also used an efficient running game. Caden Schweiger scored on two, 2-yard runs.</p>
<p>Upper St. Clair’s only points in the first half came when Pantelis took a short pass and turned it into a 28-yard touchdown with 3 seconds left in the first quarter. But it was Pine-Richland for the rest of the half — and most of the game.</p>
<p>Charlie Mill caught a 14-yard touchdown pass from Spencer on Pine-Richland’s first possession of the second half.</p>
<p>“The second quarter was awesome,” Kasperowicz said. “But we have to finish. That’s our theme this year. We had three dropped touchdown passes and were inside the 20 three times and didn’t score. We have to finish.”</p>
<p>But the start to the season is rather impressive.</p>
