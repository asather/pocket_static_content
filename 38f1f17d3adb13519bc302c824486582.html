<p>BEIJING — China locked down more than 35 million people in an increasingly urgent effort to halt the spread of the deadly coronavirus Friday, as the United States confirmed a second infected person and the respiratory illness found its way to Europe, where the first three cases were announced in France.</p>
<p>The pneumonia-like disease has claimed 41 lives — all in China — and infected more than 1,200 people there. An official at the World Health Organization told reporters that his organization has begun planning for an outbreak that will last for months.</p>
<p>Infections have been confirmed in France, South Korea, Japan, Nepal, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Taiwan and the United States.</p>
<p>At least 50 people are under observation for the illness in 22 U.S. states, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>The second U.S. patient is a woman, now in Chicago, who traveled to Wuhan, China, where the virus originated, in late December and returned Jan. 13, the CDC announced Friday. A few days later, she began to feel ill and saw a doctor. She was asked about her travel history, then referred to a hospital, which isolated her and arranged for testing.</p>
<p>The woman is in stable condition but will remain in the hospital mainly to ensure she does not spread the virus. On Tuesday, authorities revealed the first U.S. case, a man in his 30s from Snohomish County, Wash., who had recently returned from a visit to Wuhan. Authorities said they are monitoring 50 of the man’s contacts for signs of infection.</p>
<p>The CDC deployed a team to help with the Chicago case. The woman “has not had any extended close contact with anyone outside her home since returning, and that should be very reassuring to the public,” Allison Arwady, Chicago’s public health commissioner, told reporters Friday.</p>
<p>Health officials briefed about two dozen U.S. senators Friday. After that briefing, Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., called on President Donald Trump to declare the outbreak a public health emergency.</p>
<p>Although the outbreak is a “very serious public health threat, the immediate risk to the U.S. public is low at this time,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, told reporters in a briefing Friday.</p>
<p>Circumstances in the U.S. were overshadowed by the apparently deteriorating conditions in China. The Chinese medical system is struggling to cope with the outbreak, amid reports of overcrowded hospitals, stressed doctors and dwindling supplies.</p>
<p>A ban on travel was extended to 14 cities, with a total population of more than 35 million in central China’s Hubei province. Tunnels under the Yangtze River were blocked to stop the flow of traffic, and all ride-hailing services in Wuhan were halted at midday Friday. Only half the city’s taxis are allowed on the road each day.</p>
<p>China Southern, the country’s biggest airline, had already canceled flights in and out of Wuhan airport Thursday. The other two main carriers, Air China and China Eastern, said they would cancel all Wuhan flights from Friday until at least Feb. 8.</p>
<p>As the Lunar New Year began, authorities have canceled the temple fairs and festivals that normally accompany the nation’s biggest holiday. Large public gatherings could aid the spread of the airborne virus.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, state broadcaster CCTV led its midday news program with a report about a huge banquet in Beijing attended by President Xi Jinping and other Communist Party leaders. None of them was wearing a mask, and the report made no mention of the virus outbreak.</p>
<p>Other senior Chinese officials came under heavy criticism for their slow response to the outbreak. The mayor of Wuhan, Zhou Xianwang, allowed a huge potluck banquet to proceed Sunday, during a weekend when the number of confirmed infections shot up dramatically. The city had arranged a Lunar New Year meal featuring 14,000 dishes for more than 40,000 people — an event it hoped to get listed in Guinness World Records.</p>
<p>The Forbidden City in Beijing, which can admit 80,000 people a day and was entirely sold out for the holiday, has been closed until further notice. Shanghai Disneyland, which normally has 10 million visitors a year, announced Friday that it would shut down indefinitely starting Saturday.</p>
<p>Workers are racing to build a 1,000-bed hospital for people with the disease in Wuhan, an indication that Chinese officials expect, or already have, a much larger number of cases. It is modeled after a medical facility specially built in 2003 for patients with SARS, another respiratory infection that began in China and claimed more than 750 lives in more than a dozen countries. The new virus is closely related to the SARS coronavirus.</p>
