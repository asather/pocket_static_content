<html><head><title>Former Woodland Hills, Penn State RB Miles Sanders 'becoming a star' in NFL</title></head><body><p>EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Three rows from the top of MetLife Stadium, under cover and shielded from the swirling rain, Marlene Sanders was fitted with an NFL Films microphone. The mother of Philadelphia Eagles rookie Miles Sanders would be chronicled throughout her son’s Week 17 tilt with the New York Giants, for a feature on the budding star.</p><p>Sanders’ mother found out about the NFL Films piece that morning on her five-and-a-half hour drive from Pittsburgh to New Jersey. Just another experience in Sanders’ sudden, and somewhat expected, rise to prominence.</p><p>Sanders — a former Woodland Hills standout and Penn State tailback — is becoming a household name across the league.</p><p>The 2019 second-round pick has garnered rookie of the year buzz, especially recently as the focal point of Philadelphia’s NFC East title and playoff push. Sanders totaled 328 scrimmage yards and three touchdowns in crucial Week 15 and 16 wins over the Washington Redskins and Dallas Cowboys, respectively, and led all first-year players (ranking 13th overall) with 1,327 scrimmage yards for the season.</p><p>Now, Sanders will help guide the Eagles into this weekend’s wild-card round against the Seattle Seahawks. The former Swissvale Golden Flashes bell cow back injured his ankle in Week 17 and did not conduct interviews after the Eagles’ 34-17 win. But he told reporters in Philadelphia on Thursday that he should be good to go on Sunday.</p><p>“It’s the playoffs, man,” Sanders said. And the Pittsburgh native is looking to showcase on the national stage what’s been a known commodity locally since Pee Wee — an all-around skill set worthy of the respect it’s gaining at a rapid rate.</p><p>“Nobody was ready for Miles,” former Swissvale coach Craig Williams said. “And now he’s here.”</p><p><iframe src="https://giphy.com/embed/W3Sxw6dM5mVcyAcKC5" class="giphy-embed" allowfullscreen="" width="480" height="266" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>To be fair, though, Sanders didn’t pop up out of obscurity. This isn’t Boston Scott we’re talking about here. For those who were paying attention, the Eagles’ No. 26 was a stud from the jump.</p><p>After starring under Williams as a kid, Sanders was a four-year starter at Woodland Hills. He scored 59 touchdowns and racked up 4,573 rushing yards, a total that ranked fifth in WPIAL Class 4A history when he left for Penn State. Sanders, the Post-Gazette’s 2015 East Player of the Year, ended his career on a memorable run, powering the Wolverines to an 11-1 record.</p><p>Sanders’ final game at Woodland Hills was a WPIAL semifinal loss at the hands of Central Catholic — and one of his best friends, Damar Hamlin. The Pitt safety and McKees Rocks native got the better of Sanders’ squad on Nov. 20, 2015. But Hamlin never forgot how hard and how smooth Sanders ran, that day and every game of his illustrious WPIAL career. Hamlin said it’s “crazy” how similar Sanders’ current game is to what he did back when they were teenagers.</p><p>“It literally looks the same as when I first played him,” Hamlin said. “It’s just a testament to all the hard work he’s put in for years all the way back to high school. Just training and just him being who he is. When we talk about it now, we can’t even believe it.”</p><p>Sanders, the No. 1 all-purpose running back in the 2015 recruiting cycle, chose Penn State as his post-WPIAL landing spot, where he’d continue his steady rise. The blue-chip prospect hit a Saquon Barkley-sized roadblock, but he broke out in 2018 with 1,274 rushing yards and nine touchdowns as a one-year starter. Sanders decided to forgo his final season of eligibility and declare for the 2019 NFL draft, betting on and trusting in himself.</p><p>The payoff came on April 26, when Sanders had a second-round watch party at Dave and Busters in West Homestead. Hamlin was there. So was Pitt safety Paris Ford, Penn State defensive back Lamont Wade, the Steelers’ Marcus Allen and more family and friends from the area. And when Sanders got <em>the call</em> from Eagles executive Howie Roseman, the back broke down in tears, hugged his mother and popped a bottle of champagne.</p><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cj_KvE-wuGQ" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p><p>It was the start of what’s proven to be a perfect marriage. Sanders, after sitting behind Barkley for two seasons, craved an opportunity to keep his 2018 momentum going. And the Eagles, whose rushing attack ranked fifth-worst in yards per game last season, needed a spark.</p><p>Sanders struggled to provide that early on. His first two games with Philadelphia yielded only 62 scrimmage yards on 25 touches, and his lone lingering issue from Penn State showed up in Week 3, fumbling twice in the Eagles’ unexpected home loss to the Detroit Lions. It was then Sanders’ mother was introduced to the brutally honest and boisterous critics who populate Lincoln Financial Field’s crowds on a given week.</p><p>“We’re sitting there listening to them yell, ‘He’s a bust,’” Marlene Sanders said with a laugh. “Now if we could just go back and smack ’em in the face. ... We don’t hear those remarks anymore.”</p><p>That’s thanks to Sanders’ growth from the sobering performance. He hasn’t fumbled since. Instead, the rookie has emerged as a reliable offensive threat on a team defined by its season-long injury woes (Darren Sproles, Jordan Howard, Alshon Jeffery, DeSean Jackson, you name it).</p><p>Of Philadelphia’s non-tight end pass-catchers, Sanders has the most receptions (50) and receiving yards (509). His eight catches of 20 yards or more ranks first among NFC running backs, and his 818 rushing yards are third-most among all rookies.</p><p>Eagles quarterback Carson Wentz — the only quarterback in NFL history to throw for 4,000 yards in a season without a wide receiver recording 500 or more yards — has leaned on Sanders in more ways than one. And Sanders has flourished with the responsibility.</p><p>“I mean, you saw the talent right away,” Eagles center Jason Kelce told the Post-Gazette. “But what you’ve seen from him is the desire to be great, which is something you always love to see, and then the growth of taking the coaching, taking the minor things that really have caused him to take his game to another level. ... I think you’d be hard pressed to find another rookie that has had that playmaking ability that he’s had.”</p><p>“I’ve seen nothing but progression out of him,” fellow 2019 draft pick and tackle Andre Dillard added. “He just kind of exploded and shocked the whole world.”</p><p>Well, not the whole world.</p><p>Williams, his Pee Wee coach, isn’t surprised by the rookie’s come up. Neither is Sanders’ mother, who believes he “absolutely” deserves to be named the NFL’s Offensive Rookie of the Year. Of course, she might be a little biased. But if Sanders gets the nod later this month over Cardinals quarterback Kyler Murray and Raiders running back Josh Jacobs, it wouldn’t be without reason.</p><p>As Kelce stated in the MetLife Stadium visiting locker room, Sanders has been “lights out” for the Eagles. Watching proudly from afar, Hamlin concurred.</p><p>“He knew what he was capable of, and he believed in himself,” the Pitt safety said. “It goes to show anything is possible. We all have the same goals and same aspirations. For him to be the first one to make it out and actually be doing what he’s doing at this stage, he’s not just in the league. He’s producing. He’s becoming a star.</p><p>“He’s literally becoming a star.”</p><p><em>John McGonigal: jmcgonigal@post-gazette.com and Twitter @jmcgonigal9 </em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/psu/2020/01/03/Philadelphia-Eagles-Miles-Sanders-former-Penn-State-running-back-becoming-a-star/stories/202001030083</original_url>
