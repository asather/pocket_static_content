<h1> The need for compromise </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s good to see Gov. Tom Wolf reverse course and send $12.8 million in federal CARES Act assistance to Lebanon County.</p>
<p>The county will use the money to reimburse school districts and local governments for virus-related expenses, distribute grants to small businesses and nonprofits, and support economic development and behavioral health programs.</p>
<p>Mr. Wolf had refused to send the money, citing a decision by two Republican county commissioners to move the county into the yellow phase on May 15, ignoring his order that it remain in the red phase until May 29.</p>
<p>The number of new infections in Lebanon County subsequently doubled, and Lebanon was the last Pennsylvania county to move from “yellow” to the least-restrictive “green” phase in Mr. Wolf’s reopening plan.</p>
<p>However, while Mr. Wolf was trying to send a message to the commissioners, he ended up hurting Lebanon County residents who didn’t get the federal aid.</p>
<p>The commissioners filed a lawsuit last month in an attempt to force Mr. Wolf into releasing the money. The settlement was a much better alternative, saving taxpayers considerable money had the lawsuit made its way to court.</p>
<p>The settlement was approved by Republican Commissioner Bob Phillips and Democratic Commissioner Jo Ellen Litz, who had previously backed Gov. Wolf’s orders.</p>
<p>As part of the settlement, the commissioners agreed to launch a $2.8 million campaign to promote wearing masks.</p>
<p>However, the compromise didn’t please everyone. Commissioner Bill Ames, a Republican, refused to OK the agreement. Also, state Sen. Dave Arnold and state Reps. Frank Ryan, Russ Diamond and Sue Helm sent a letter out saying the “unilateral restrictions” were illegal and needed to be challenged in court.</p>
<p>Karen Groh, president and CEO of the Lebanon Valley Chamber of Commerce, disagreed, noting that the lawsuit would have taken more time and narrowed the December deadline for the county to use the CARES money.</p>
<p>While $2.8 million for the mask promotion is a “huge campaign for the size of our county,” there is an upside, Ms. Groh said.</p>
<p>“This money has the potential to support so many of our Lebanon County businesses in its delivery,” she added. “It is not only a valid reminder to wear a mask but also [represents] a huge influx of money into our local economy.”</p>
<p>It’s too bad that Lebanon County’s legislators have no idea of compromise, which is so essential to government. If they had their way, the residents of Lebanon County still wouldn’t have the money they so desperately need.</p>
