<h1>Looking for movies to watch? Check out these five with Pittsburgh sports cameos</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Pittsburgh sports teams and venues have made numerous appearances on the silver screen in recent years. Here are five of them if you’re looking for films with local ties to watch during this period of social distancing.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><strong>Sudden Death (1995) —</strong> A bit dated at this point, but as was pointed out in the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/other-sports/2020/03/28/Check-out-the-Post-Gazette-sports-staff-s-favorite-sports-movies/stories/202003290007" target="_blank">Post-Gazette staff’s list of favorite sports movies</a>, this one is overloaded with Penguins fan service. The plot revolves around the hero, Jean-Claude Van Damme, rescuing Civic Arena — and the vice president of the United States — from a terrorist plot during a Stanley Cup final game. This somehow leads to him fighting team mascot Iceburgh to the death, playing in goal for the Penguins briefly and causing the villain’s helicopter to crash through the Igloo’s open roof.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Broadcasters Paul Steigerwald and Mike Lange also get prominent speaking roles, narrating the game action before the game is abruptly stopped to escape the, you know, terrorists.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>The Dark Knight (2008) —</strong>&nbsp;There may not be a more iconic shot in Pittsburgh film history than the evil Bane blowing up Heinz Field as Hines Ward streaks toward the end zone to score a touchdown for the fictional Gotham Rogues.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UsoYwysCdfY" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Steelers including Ben Roethlisberger and Brett Keisel also make appearances during a creepy national anthem rendition before the carnage begins. Unlike the rest of the movies on this list, the Dark Knight was a certified blockbuster, so this one will have a place in the cultural zeitgeist for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Zack and Miri Make a Porno (2008) —</strong> The Seth Rogen-Elizabeth Banks rom-com never ventures inside any venues, nor does it show any game action. Rogen’s character, however, wears team gear throughout the movie before working as a paint ball target for paying customers outside a game at the Civic Arena. The scene includes a conversation with Craig Robinson’s character on the Arena’s exterior deck that overlooks Downtown. It triggers some nostalgia if you ever stood there on a cold winter’s night during hockey season, gazing out at what was once among the best views in the city. The movie also includes a drunken character’s super funny and super profane <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bw1qIza7QCc" target="_blank">soliloquy</a> about Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>She’s Out of My League (2010) —</strong> Another rom-com, another Penguins game. This time, Jay Baruchel’s awkward and goofy-looking protagonist realizes he’s on a double date with Alice Eve’s blonde bombshell event planner, whom Baruchel is stunned to learn is into him. Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin are among real-life Penguins who are shown during game action in what was likely the Civic Arena’s final season as the team’s home.</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-p-aebcuoYo" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Later, Baruchel and Eve are seen walking into a Pirates game at PNC Park. And a Pitt football helmet even pops up in a basement hockey scene.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Abduction (2011) —</strong> This time, the bad guys show up at a Pirates game at PNC Park in a thriller that stars Taylor Lautner, whose hero is forced to flee as a chase scene ensues on the stadium’s famous left field rotunda.&nbsp;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kQUXf8oO73I" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>Who among us has not wanted to bypass pedestrian traffic like that at some point? Eventually, Lautner leads the baddy out onto Mazeroski Way, where his character’s father whacks him with a sniper shot. Not quite as dramatic as Sudden Death, but it’s fun to see PNC Park’s sweeping vistas get the big-screen treatment they deserve.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Jack Reacher (2012) —</strong> No sports in this one. Just a sniper mowing down pedestrians along the river walk outside of PNC Park, prompting Tom Cruise’s character to investigate and pursue justice.&nbsp;</p>
