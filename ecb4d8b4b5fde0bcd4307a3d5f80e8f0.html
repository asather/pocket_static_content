<h1>Pittsburgh folk-punks Homeless Gospel Choir release timely anthem about being shut inside</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It’s just a little song about the end of the world and not wanting to go outside.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh folk-punk musician Derek Zanetti, who fronts Homeless Gospel Choir, wrote the high-spirited, anxiety-drenched rocker “Art Punk” over a year ago.</p>
<p>The song, released Friday with a video, certainly strikes a chord right in the midst of coronavirus social distancing.</p>
<p>The catchy, sing-along chorus has him singing, “Art punk, f--- up locked inside, in the middle of summer time/I don’t wanna go out!/I don’t wanna go out!”</p>
<p>He goes on to sing, “If I wasn’t so sure the world was ending/I’d live a lot more.”</p>
<p>Making it even more strangely of the moment, the video begins with images that resemble those virus cells that have been floating around.</p>

<p><em>Editor’s note: Video contains profanity.</em></p>
<p>“I wanted to write a song about the paranoia and anxiety that comes along with being a reclusive shut-in artist and not wanting to go out,” says the fast-talking singer-songwriter, who just went three days without going out of his Hazelwood home. “It’s so weird that this week, when everyone’s shut in, is when we planned to release it.”</p>
<p>“Art Punk” is the latest single from “This Land Is Your Landfill,” which is due on April 24 on A-F Records, the label run by Pittsburgh punk band Anti-Flag.</p>
<p>While the timing might be right for this single, the pandemic hits at a bad for a band launching an album cycle.</p>
<p>Homeless Gospel Choir, whose members are split between Cincinnati, Harrisburg and Pittsburgh, were to begin a spring tour in Fort Wayne, Ind., on April 9 that would hit the Midwest and Southeast through May. On the last tour, he says, they sold out 200- to-300 capacity clubs. Now, the plan is to move the tour to November.</p>
<p>“We spent two years working on this record, to have it out and to tour in April and May,” he says. “And now everything is halted, which is fine, for the betterment of humanity, but I just don’t know how to change the going of my gears.”</p>
<p>Rather than delay the record, they’re sticking with the April release date because they’ve already promoted it with singles and the records are already pressed.</p>
<p>“The presale is going great,” Zanetti says, “but I feel weird asking for people to buy something. Like, ‘Hey, come and buy my album. Oh wait a second, ya’ll don’t work? Ya’ll don’t have any money?’ It feels kind of dirty and gross.”</p>
<p>On the other hand, “This Land Is Your Landfill” might be exactly what his dedicated cult following needs.</p>
<p>“It’s about the end of the world, yeah,” Zanetti says. “It’s about the ocean levels rising and the polar bears not having anywhere to live and plastic in the water and being shut in. It’s a super panicky punk record about the end of the world.”</p>
