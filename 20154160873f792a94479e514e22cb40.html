<h1>Steelers release Christian Scotland-Williamson, former rugby star from London</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It would seem that Christian Scotland-Williamson’s storybook journey from London rugby star to Steelers tight end is over.</p>
<p>The Steelers announced Monday afternoon that they waived <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/joe-starkey/2019/05/30/Joe-Starkey-A-very-unusual-man-vows-to-help-the-Steelers-win-the-Super-Bowl/stories/201905310082" target="_blank">the unique 27-year-old project</a> who had been with the team since 2018 as part of the NFL’s International Player Pathway program with a non-football injury designation.. At 6-feet-9, 274 pounds, Scotland-Williamson certainly looked the part of an NFL player, but spent the past two seasons on the practice squad in a special spot exempt for foreign players trying to transition to the football field.</p>
<p>Taking Scotland-Williamson's place on the 90-man roster will be former Utah State standout Dax Raymond, his agent Ryan Downey confirmed. NFL Network first reported the Steelers were signing the 6-5, 255-pound Raymond, who spent last year on the Chicago practice squad but was waived in April.</p>
<p>Scotland-Williamson was eligible to spend one more year on the practice squad, though his odds of making the active roster were always long. Now that the Steelers have veteran Vance McDonald, shiny free agent signing Eric Ebron and 2019 fifth-round draft pick Zach Gentry at tight end, it was even more unlikely Scotland-Williamson would achieve his dream of playing in an NFL game.</p>
<p>But his tale of taking the leap from one physical sport to another is nothing short of fascinating. A well-schooled but jolly giant, Scotland-Williamson earned a Master’s degree in International Business before starting law school in his home country. Scotland-Williamson may not have been a polished route-runner and his hands might be a step below that of your typical NFL pass-catcher, but whether he lands with another team or not, he’ll forever be an interesting footnote in Steelers history.</p>
<p><strong>No fans at opener?</strong></p>
<p>Due to orders from New Jersey’s governor prohibiting gatherings of 500 or more people in the state, the New York Giants and Jets released a joint statement Monday saying there will be no fans at MetLife Stadium until further notice. That figures to include the Steelers-Giants game Week 1 in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
<p>“We support Governor Murphy’s decision in the interest of public health and safety an, until circumstances change, both the Jets and Giants will play our games without the benefits of fans in attendance,” the teams announced.&nbsp;“Although we would prefer to have fans at MetLife Stadium for our games, we will continue to work with Governor Murphy’s office and will provide updates if necessary.”</p>
<p><strong>Shortened preseason</strong></p>
<p>It’s possible the Steelers will play their first two games of 2020 at MetLife Stadium. According to NFL Network, the league has proposed to its players’ union that they play just one preseason game this year, and do so in what would traditionally be Week 3 of the exhibition slate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the Steelers, their Week 3 preseason game was scheduled to be at the New York Jets at 7:30 p.m. Aug. 28. Steelers rookies are to report to camp Tuesday, with quarterbacks and players rehabbing injuries joining them Thursday, followed by the rest of the team July 28.</p>
