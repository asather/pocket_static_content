<h1>Healthy Gregory Polanco expects to have shoulder, psyche tested</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Gregory Polanco thinks he knows what to expect when the 2020 season starts.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the opening series in St. Louis or shortly thereafter, the Pirates right fielder believes opposing players will be eager to test his surgically repaired left shoulder, the occasionally cranky joint that caused him considerable problems and cut short his 2019 season.</p>
<p>“Oh yeah, they will, for sure,” Polanco said. “And I’m ready for them.”</p>
<p>However, opposing runners trying to score or take third on a one-out single will hardly be the only test Polanco faces. Now 28 and hardly ever healthy, baseball itself figures to press its considerable weight on his broad shoulders, the expectations for Pittsburgh’s longest-tenured and soon-to-be highest-paid player continually growing.</p>
<p>Entering his seventh season, it’s become almost a yearly refrain: If Polanco can just stay healthy ...</p>
<p>When that has happened, the results have been impressive: 2.5 Wins Above Replacement (per Baseball-Reference.com) in 2015; 22 homers and 86 RBIs a year later; 23 home runs and 81 RBIs in 2018, including a stretch where he slugged .532 before — you guessed it — more injuries, with Polanco hurting his left knee and shoulder in a Sept. 7, 2018, game against the Marlins.</p>
<p>Polanco’s 2019 season was limited to just 42 games, during which he hit just .242 and looked like a shell of himself.</p>
<p>“I’ve definitely missed too much time,” Polanco said.</p>
<p>Spring training 1.0 and the subsequent quarantine time have seemingly been very good for Polanco, who has drawn rave reviews from coaches and teammates for his hitting, throwing and base-running.</p>
<p>Polanco said he spent much of his second offseason in Miami, Fla., working to increase the strength and mobility of his surgically repaired left shoulder.</p>
<p>“I worked so hard, and I’m feeling good now,” he said.</p>
<p>The throwing will be the biggest thing on which people will focus, at least until Polanco proves them wrong — or Pirates manager Derek Shelton has no other choice but to make Polanco his regular designated hitter.</p>
<p>There’s no more pain, Polanco said. No tightness, either. In fact, Polanco said he nearly feels 100% while throwing the baseball, dangerously close to where he was before.</p>
<p>“It feels better to know that you have your arm back,” Polanco said.</p>
<p>The plan, as of now, is to get something out of Polanco in right field, especially against right-handed pitchers. Guillermo Heredia has fared reasonably well against lefties throughout his career, and that could be a way to get him in the lineup. But in that case, it’s possible that Polanco could simply DH.</p>
<p>It depends, of course, on the functionality of Polanco’s arm.</p>
<p>“Definitely, I feel like I need to [prove myself],” Polanco said. “That’s me personally. I need to do better than I did in the past. ... I can do better every year. That’s the time that I need to step up and say, ‘OK, let’s do it now.’”</p>
<p>Having a healthy and productive Polanco at the plate would do wonders for the Pirates’ lineup. The 6-5, 235-pounder could provide protection for Josh Bell in the No. 4 spot while extending the order and giving Colin Moran — likely the No. 6 hitter — a chance to drive in runs.</p>
<p>A big focal point for Polanco thus far has been keeping his swing compact. When he struggles, it can tend to get a little long and loopy, leaving Polanco susceptible to pitches low and away, especially coming from left-handers.</p>
<p>That was a recurring issue for Polanco in 2019, as he struck out in 29.3% of his 167 plate appearances. Digging deeper, Polanco swung at a career-high 77.2% of pitches inside the strike zone, according to FanGraphs. Yet that aggressive mindset only translated into a contact percentage of 70.8, the lowest such mark of his career.</p>
<p>Polanco got so out of whack that he hit just .147 against breaking balls in 2019 and had a slugging percentage of .382 against them. His whiff rate, according to Baseball Savant, was a putrid 38.9% against breaking balls. Against offspeed stuff (mainly changeups), same deal: It was 38.3.</p>
<p>In that sense, it might be difficult to believe things will be different for Polanco in 2020. However, when asked why he believes he’ll be able to prove his doubters wrong, Polanco made a valid point.</p>
<p>“I’m healthy,” Polanco said. “Last year, I wasn’t healthy. This year, I’m healthy.”</p>
<p>The key for Polanco is patience at the plate.</p>
<p>When Polanco is seeing the ball well and letting it travel, suddenly turning his massive frame into the pitch, it generally has produced some excellent results.</p>
<p>Numbers good enough to create the belief that Polanco, if he stays healthy, could anchor the Pirates’ lineup and become a possible All-Star.</p>
<p>“He’s very important to our lineup,” Shelton said. “He's very important to our club. I think a lot of people forget that Gregory Polanco is only 28 years old, and he's had two years of injuries. Then going on top of it, he didn't have a ton of at-bats in the minor leagues.</p>
<p>"There are a lot of good things to come with Gregory Polanco. I'm happy with where he's at. I think he's poised to have a really big year."</p>
<p>Polanco said he doesn’t necessarily like serving as the DH — he’d prefer to play the field, too — but understands why that might make more sense for someone like him.</p>
<p>More than anything, Polanco knows that he needs to stay healthy. If he’s able to do that, there’s little question in his mind that the results will come.</p>
<p>“I trust myself,” Polanco said. “I trust the process and work that I'm putting in. I just need to mature and [translate] the work I did in the offseason to the season. With my talent, the talent that I have, sure, I can be a star in this league."</p>
