<h1>New developers of former Kaufmann’s store Downtown plan rooftop ice skating rink, other upgrades</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Two new developers have taken control of the sputtering rehab of the former Kaufmann’s/Macy’s department store Downtown with big plans to not only finish the work but also to add new amenities, including a rooftop ice skating rink.</p>
<p>The team of Philadelphia-based Lubert Adler Partners LP and Adventurous Journeys Capital Partners of Chicago intends to invest $40 million in the Smithfield Street landmark to make it “the premier Class A plus mixed use facility in Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>“Our goal is to restore it to its original splendor,” said Dean Adler, CEO and co-founder of Lubert Adler.</p>
<p>Mr. Adler said the new team, as controlling owner, is committed to jump-starting —&nbsp;and improving —&nbsp;a redevelopment that has been plagued by delays, lawsuits and liens over the past five years since Core Realty, another Philadelphia firm, acquired the building for $15 million in 2015.</p>
<p>The new team, which closed on the transaction this week, intends to finish the last third of the 311 apartments planned for the 13-story building as well as two levels of parking on the third and fourth floors.</p>
<p>There will also be three to four elevators running at all times for building residents instead of the lone one that has been a source of complaints and breakdowns.</p>
<p>On the first floor, Core, working with the new team, already has landed Minneapolis-based retailer Target to occupy a 22,000-square-foot spot under the old department store’s famous clock, which has been a meeting place for generations of Pittsburghers.</p>
<p>Mr. Adler said Lubert Adler and AJ Capital are working with two other major retailers to take space on the first and second floors but declined to name them.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the biggest change in the direction of the redevelopment under the new ownership involves the rooftop, where the team plans to build a Rockefeller Center-style outdoor ice skating rink that will be open to residents and the public alike.</p>
<p>“We want to create rooftop no one in Pittsburgh has ever seen before,” Mr. Adler said. “There won’t be a single building to have this kind of amenity.”</p>
<p>The new owners hope to reach out to high schools to see whether any have interest in using the rink. They also are thinking about teaming with local corporations on community outreach such as learn-how-to-skate classes.</p>
<p>“To me, you’ve got to create a unique social amenity that makes you one of a kind, and we want this building to be one of a kind,” Mr. Adler said.</p>
<p>In the summer, rooftop amenities will include a swimming pool and a garden.</p>
<p>At street level, Lubert Adler and AJ Capital are looking to add awnings and outdoor dining space to spruce up a dreary block that has fallen into disrepair with Core struggling to complete the redevelopment.</p>
<p>“The key to urban renaissance is, you’ve got to light it up on the street. The streetscape has to feel fully manicured and developed and revitalized with awnings and proper landscaping.”</p>
<p>The team also will redo a lobby completed by Core to add wooden floors and make other changes to bring it more in line with the history of Kaufmann’s.</p>
<p>“We believe [the current lobby] does not reflect the beauty or the grandeur of what the Kaufmann’s department store was,” Mr. Adler said. “We’re going to restore it. We want to bring the historical nature back.”</p>
<p>In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, “zoom” rooms will be added where residents can use the online service Zoom for meetings or chats. There also will be “private and secure” fitness spaces as well as private suites for coworking.</p>
<p>Lubert Adler and AJ Capital hope to finish most of the building by July and have the ice skating rink done by the end of 2021.</p>
<p>The team already has hired Charleston, S.C.-based Greystar to take over as manager of the apartments after residents complained about a host of issues, including a rodent infestation, nonworking elevators and other maintenance issues, and a lack of promised amenities.</p>
<p>Some residents have moved out, and others have withheld rent.</p>
<p>Mr. Adler offered assurances to those residents and others who have been frustrated by the pace of the development that things will change for the better.</p>
<p>He said Lubert Adler has more than $7 billion in equity and $20 billion in assets in its portfolio and invests on behalf of state pension funds and insurance companies.</p>
<p>Its core expertise, he added, is in the adaptive reuse of historic structures, with more than 20 buildings redeveloped in Philadelphia alone. A $200 million redevelopment there called 2400 Market Street is the headquarters of concessionaire Aramark.</p>
<p>“We are considered to be one of the leaders in adaptive reuse. The money’s in place, and we are already under construction,” he said.</p>
<p>AJ Capital owns the Graduate hotel chain that operates in many college towns, including State College. Its portfolio also includes hotels in Saint Andrews, Scotland, and New Orleans, Nashville, and Chicago as well as mixed-use projects.</p>
<p>Mr. Adler said all liens piled up by Core will be paid off. Core will remain as part of the investment group but will have no role in operating the development, which also includes a 160-room Even Hotel.</p>
<p>Lubert Adler and AJ Capital were drawn to the Kaufmann’s building because of its beauty and the economic opportunity.</p>
<p>“It’s unique. To me, it’s the crown prince, the crown jewel of Downtown Pittsburgh,” Mr. Adler said.</p>
<p>Core, which didn’t have the money to complete the project, turned to the new team after a deal with Florida-based Fontainebleau Development to acquire the property collapsed last spring.</p>
<p>Michael Samschick, Core president, said Lubert Adler and AJ Capital are “best in class” and have the wherewithal to finish the project, known as Kaufmann’s Grand on Fifth.&nbsp;“My only concern was to ensure that whoever I brought in to take on the role was of the highest quality to ensure that what was started would be completed,” he said.</p>
<p>John Valentine, executive director of the Pittsburgh Downtown Community Development Corp., said he was excited to hear about the new ownership and the ice rink.</p>
<p>“I think it’s going to be a transformational project for that part of town,” he said. “I absolutely love the idea of a rooftop ice skating rink.”</p>
