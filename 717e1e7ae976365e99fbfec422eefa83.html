<h1>Sen. Casey plans infrastructure, jobs package as area’s construction industry warns of cuts</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., used the Pittsburgh region as a backdrop on Wednesday to call for a sweeping federal jobs program to boost the U.S. economy, modeled on the Great Depression-era public works program that built and maintained a range of infrastructure needs across the country.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey — whose other recent legislative proposals on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/health/2020/02/06/Unveiling-five-freedoms-Casey-launches-policy-agenda-for-America-s-children/stories/202002060007" target="_blank">children’s health care</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/politics-nation/2020/03/23/Washington-pandemic-COVID-19-coronavirus-war-defense-production-act-spending/stories/202003220046" target="_blank">manufacturing</a>&nbsp;hark back to the New Deal and World War II era — is drawing up legislation to introduce this fall that would provide sustainable work for the unemployed through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</p>
<p>The program would be designed after the Civilian Conservation Corps with more modern provisions to ensure higher wages, skills training and equity in hiring. The goal would be to employ at least 40% of people without jobs, he said, while allowing&nbsp;local officials to tailor the program to the needs of their regions.</p>
<p>In a call with reporters, Mr. Casey pointed to the persistently high unemployment in Western Pennsylvania, a region of the country experiencing a high demand for construction projects to fix roads, bridges and waterways.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh region’s unemployment rate stood at 12.5% in June, with 145,800 people counted as jobless, according to the most recent seasonally adjusted data from the Pennsylvania Department of Labor and Industry.</p>
<p>“We haven’t seen these numbers since the early 1980s when we had a steel crisis, and all of the economic calamity that came with that,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>“We need to recognize we have a jobs crisis caused by the virus and also caused by inaction by federal officials in Washington,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey acknowledged infrastructure packages have been stalled in the Senate, where he blamed the Republican majority for opposing them.</p>
<p>In June, House Democrats pushed through a $1.5 trillion bill, called the Moving Forward Act. That package passed with support from just three Republicans.</p>
<p>Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Peters, railed against the plan’s provisions that aim to fight climate change as “far-left Green New Deal initiatives” and opposed provisions like $325 million for electric school buses and $100 million for housing programs.</p>
<p>And there remain wide spending gaps between the two chambers: A bill to reauthorize the Highway Trust Fund, for example, has a gulf of nearly $213 billion. Congress must reauthorize the fund, which relies on declining funds from the federal gasoline tax, by Sept. 30.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Construction jobs, with their outdoor worksites and natural social distancing, have bounced back in recent weeks. In June, Pittsburgh-area construction jobs were down 5% compared with June 2019, whereas hospitality jobs were down 35% from 2019.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But COVID-19 has added some urgency into the age-old debate in Congress over how to pay for infrastructure investment.&nbsp;State transportation agencies like the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation lost tolling and tax revenue after people were ordered to stay home, leaving the budget for state projects uncertain.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a July 20 letter to Congress, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials estimated state transportation revenue losses of $37 billion through fiscal year 2024, with an estimated loss of $16 billion this fiscal year. The group wrote that it expects the recovery period to be longer than it thought in spring 2020.</p>
<p>“We’re standing on the cliff of a crisis,” said Vince Tutino, president of New Castle-based Lindy Paving, the largest supplier of asphalt in the region for construction projects.</p>
<p>Mr. Tutino, who joined Mr. Casey on the call, noted PennDOT District 11, encompassing Allegheny, Beaver and Lawrence counties, projected funding to come up $200 million less than expected from 2021-2024. That could be a big hit, and Mr. Tutino said he anticipates projects being cut 25% to 45%.</p>
<p>“If these statistics sound negative, it’s because they are,” he said. “It is understood the federal highway money is simply insufficient to maintain Pennsylvania’s transportation network.”</p>
<p>Asked for his outlook on a broad-based infrastructure package — or a shorter-term infusion of cash for state agencies — Mr. Casey said a core group of Senate Republicans have been resistant to any new funding for state and local governments.</p>
<p>“The help for state transportation departments will be dependent upon that larger dynamic,” he said. “Ask the Republican majority.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Mr. Casey is pushing ahead on a jobs program bill, which a spokeswoman said will be introduced sometime in the fall.</p>
<p>President Franklin Delano Roosevelt created the CCC in 1933 as a voluntary employment program for young jobless men. Over nine years, the program put 3 million men on public works projects like building roads, planting trees, building water storage basins, clearing and reseeding grazing lands, fighting forest fires and performing other environmental engineering services.</p>
<p>At that time, FDR “didn’t wait around and hope there was some private-sector magic wand that was going to make things better,” Mr. Casey said. “He acted, and I think that’s what we’re going to need in the coming months.”</p>
