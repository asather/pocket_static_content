<h1>Recent coronavirus cases spur Norwin School District to close 5 buildings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Norwin School District will close five buildings after seven cases of coronavirus were reported across the district within the past two weeks.</p>
<p>In a letter sent to families Tuesday, Superintendent Jeff Taylor said that while the district was going to announce plans to return to fully in-person learning Wednesday, it is instead announcing the temporary closure of Norwin High School, Norwin Middle School, Hillcrest Intermediate School, Hahntown Elementary School and Sunset Valley Elementary School due to the new cases.</p>
<p>The school buildings will be “deep cleaned” Friday and over the weekend and are expected to reopen Oct. 13.</p>
<p>Students who attend those schools will learn remotely until they reopen.</p>
<p>The closures come after the Pennsylvania Department of Health told the district about five new cases among Norwin students, in addition to two cases that were announced Oct. 1, Mr. Taylor said.</p>
<p>The new cases mean that the district has exceeded the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s recommended number of cases allowed within a 14-day period.</p>
<p>Mr. Taylor also said any students who participate in athletics or activities at the closed schools should expect information from their coaches or advisers as to how they will be impacted.</p>
