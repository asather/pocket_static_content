<h1>Coach Don Shula will be forever linked to Steelers history</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Don Shula was born in Painesville, Ohio — Cleveland Browns country — but so much of what he accomplished in his career can be intrinsically linked 120 miles away with the Steelers.</p>
<p>That includes being influential in hiring the greatest coach in Steelers history.&nbsp;But it was also Shula’s Miami Dolphins teams that stood in the way of the Steelers making two more Super Bowl appearances, most notably during the Dolphins’ perfect season in 1972.</p>
<p>Shula, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/05/04/don-shula-dies-90-miami-dolphins-coach/stories/202005040065" target="_blank">who died Monday at age 90</a>, recommended to late Steelers owner Art Rooney Sr. in 1969 that he hire Chuck Noll, who had served as a secondary coach/defensive coordinator on Shula’s staff for three years with the Baltimore Colts. It didn’t matter to Shula that Noll, who was 37, would be the youngest head coach in the NFL at the time.</p>
<p>“I felt Chuck was going to be a head coach and he had everything [the Rooneys] would be looking for, so I didn’t hesitate to recommend him,” Shula said years later.</p>
<p>Shula said Noll was so intelligent — “He knew everything about everything” — that he used to call him “Knute Knowledge” after legendary Notre Dame Coach Knute Rockne.</p>
<p>Shula leaves behind a legacy that includes being the winningest coach in NFL history (328 victories in 33 years). His winning percentage (.677) is second all-time behind George Halas (.682) among retired coaches.</p>
<p>“Don Shula was the patriarch of the Miami Dolphins for 50 years,” the Dolphins said in a statement. “He brought the winning edge to our franchise and put the Dolphins and the city of Miami in the national sports scene.”</p>
<p>To the Steelers, Shula will always be affectionately remembered as the man who recommended their Hall of Fame coach. Noll won 193 games in 23 seasons, but his four Super Bowl victories were twice as many as former boss. Noll, however, was 5-9 in head-to-head matchups with Shula, including 1-2 in games that mattered most.</p>
<p>The lone victory came in a 1979 AFC divisional round game when the Steelers defeated the Dolphins, 34-14, at Three Rivers Stadium, on the way to their fourth and final Super Bowl victory under Noll.</p>
<p>That game served as some small atonement for a crushing defeat seven years earlier when Shula’s Dolphins beat the Steelers, 21-17, in the AFC championship on a Miami-like 70-degree day at Three Rivers Stadium. It was eight days after the most incredible moment in Steelers history — Franco Harris’ Immaculate Reception against the Oakland Raiders.</p>
<p>The game is most remembered for a trick play by the Dolphins in which punter Larry Seiple ran 37 yards on a fake punt early in the second quarter to set up a touchdown that tied the game at 7-7. The victory allowed the unbeaten Dolphins to advance to Super Bowl VII, where they beat the Washington Redskins to complete the first and only perfect season in league history.</p>
<p>“We had position, momentum, everything when that happened,” Noll said after the game. “That changed the game.”</p>
<p>Noll had another chance to beat Shula and advance to the Super Bowl in 1984 when the Steelers advanced to the AFC title game after beating the Denver Broncos at Mile High Stadium. That victory spoiled what was being viewed as a marquee matchup between Denver’s John Elway and Miami’s Dan Marino in the conference championship.</p>
<p>This time, Shula did not need a fake punt to beat his former assistant. The Dolphins trounced the Steelers, 45-28, a game in which Oakland native Marino threw for 421 yards and four touchdowns.</p>
<p>Shula and Noll would meet five more times after that — all in the regular season — with the Dolphins holding the edge, 3-2.</p>
<p>Shula handed the Steelers several disappointing defeats during his career. But he made up for it by delivering to them one of the greatest coaches in NFL history.</p>
