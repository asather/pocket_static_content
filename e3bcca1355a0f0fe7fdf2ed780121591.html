<h1>Best Pittsburgh concerts this week: King Princess, Citizen Cope, Don Felder, Cheap Trick</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>MONDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Thrice:</strong> The fourth from Thrice. That’s on the agenda when the hardcore/screamo punk band from Orange County, Calif., turns up at Stage AE, North Shore. Thrice is celebrating the 15th anniversary of fourth album “Vheissu,” which found the band transitioning from hardcore and incorporating more electronics. Thrice tops a bill with the fellow Warped Tour vets ​mewithoutYou along with ​Drug Church and ​Holy Fawn. Doors at 5:30 p.m. $25/$29; ticketmaster.com.</p>

<p><strong>WEDNESDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Citizen Cope:</strong> At a show at San Francisco's Fillmore, Carlos Santana told Clarence Greenwood, aka Citizen Cope, to “stay away from the two H’s — heroin and helicopters,” warning they could prove fatal to rock stars. “Heroin and Helicopters” is the title of the first album in seven years from Citizen Cope, a thoughtful singer-songwriter who mixes rock, blues, folk and soul. Carnegie Lecture Hall, Oakland. 8 p.m. $49; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>THURSDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Leyla McCalla:</strong> Born in New York to Haitian immigrant parents, the singer-songwriter and multi-instrumentalist moved to New Orleans and delved into Creole music as a member of the Carolina Chocolate Drops. From there, she’s focused on a solo career that has included “Vari-Colored Songs,” a tribute to Langston Hughes. She plays the Warhol Theater, North Side, at 8 p.m. $20/$15 members &amp; students; Visit warhol.org</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Don Felder:</strong> Felder joined The Eagles as lead guitarist in 1974 for the “On the Border” album and was with them for six years before the band split. He took part in 1994 “Hell Freezes Over” reunion, but was dismissed from the band in 2001, setting off a mad flurry of lawsuits over payment. He just put out a third solo album, “American Rock ’n’ Roll,” on which assembled an all-star guest list that includes Slash, Richie Sambora, Joe Satriani, Mick Fleetwood, Bob Weir, Alex Lifeson and more. He brings the thorwback rock album to Jergel’s, Marshall. 8 p.m. $45/$48; jergels.com.</p>

<p><strong>Chris Janson:</strong> How many country guys would do a song called “Drunk Girl” and have it say “Take a drunk girl home … let her sleep all alone”? Not many. That’s why Janson is a little different. On top of that, he rocks harder than most of them. He plays the Palace Theater, Greensburg, touring behind his third album, “Real Friends.” 7:30 p.m. $39.75-$69.75; thepalacetheatre.org.</p>
<p><strong>Andre Costello and the Cool Minors:</strong> Costello, who sat through four straight laser-rock shows at Buhl Planetarium as a high school kid, is back at the Carnegie Science Center with a second round of his own laser spectacle. He did it two years ago when he released “Resident Frequencies”; this time it’s a set of new songs and old favorites. 7:30 and 9 p.m. $20; costelloandthecoolminors.com.</p>
<p><strong>The Girlie Show:</strong> In its eighth year as an indie showcase of female performing artists, The Girlie Show is celebrating the 100th anniversary of the 19th Amendment, granting women the right to vote. This edition, at Hambone’s in Lawrenceville, features songwriters Liss Victory and Toria Susan; poet/actress Joanna Lowe; comedian Liz Tripoli; and live painting from Weaver Art. “Shows composed entirely of men remain common,” Victory said in a statement. “The Girlie Show continues as a response to this. I see our show as a deeply meaningful element of the Pittsburgh arts scene and the cultural community at large.” 7 p.m. $5 online; $10 at the door; girlieshow2020.brownpapertickets.com.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY-SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Satan’s Fall:</strong> Stewart Copeland, former drummer of The Police, has partnered with the Mendelssohn Choir of Pittsburgh to create a new oratorio, “Satan’s Fall.” The new work follows Lucifer’s fall from grace as imagined by John Milton in “Paradise Lost” and will premiere on Friday and Saturday at the Roxian Theater in McKees Rocks. This collaboration is another in a string of creative programming by the Mendelssohn, which has also presented a Bob Dylan oratorio and a concert exploring Pittsburgh’s Underground Railroad connections. 8:30 p.m. Friday; 8 p.m. Saturday. $40 to $150 at themendelssohn.org.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>

<p><strong>King Princess:</strong> She’s about to head to Europe to play massive venues with Harry Styles. Before that, the artist born Mikaela Straus will bring the tour for her debut “Cheap Queen” to Stage AE, North Shore. The 21-year-old from Brooklyn grew up in studios as the daughter of recording engineer Oliver H. Straus Jr. and was signed by Mark Ronson to his Columbia imprint Zelig Records. Her first single, “1950,” “an ode to untold queer histories,” was streamed more than 250 million times, setting the stage for a ballad-centric debut album establishing her as a poppier Fiona Apple. Despite her sound being fairly straight-forward, Rolling Stone called her “a new breed of queer pop icon.” Kilo Kish opens. Doors open at 7 p.m. Tickets are $27.50; $30 day of show; ticketmaster.com.</p>
<p><strong>En Vogue:</strong> The R&amp;B group known for such hits as “Hold On,” “Free Your Mind” and “Whatta Man,” plays the Love is Red: Valentine’s Extravaganza at the August Wilson African American Cultural Center, Downtown. The current lineup is a trio of original members Terry Ellis and Cindy Herron with Rhona Bennett. Lead singer Dawn Robinson left En Vogue for a solo career in 2011 and Maxine Jones followed a year later. The event is a black-tie fundraiser for the Kappa Endowment Scholarship Fund of Western Pennsylvania with an after-party featuring the Kevin Howard Band and DJ Nate the Barber. 8 p.m. Tickets start at $103.75; KappaLoveIsRed.com</p>
<p><strong>SUNDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cheap Trick:</strong> The Rock and Roll Hall of Famers can usually be found opening for Heart or some other classic rock band in Burgettstown. The Palace Theatre gives you a headlining set with the Rockford, Ill., filled with the hits — “I Want You to Want Me,” “Dream Police,” “Surrender,” etc. — along with new songs and choice covers. With Rookie. 8 p.m. $79+; thepalacetheatre.org</p>
<p><strong>The Exile Follies:</strong> John Doe, Grant-Lee Phillips, ​Kristin Hersh — the well-respected members of X, Grant Lee Buffalo and Throwing Muses, respectively — bring The Exile Follies to Club Cafe, South Side. It’s been a while since the last solo record from Doe — 2016’s “The Westerner” — while Hersh and Phillips both released new material in 2018. Rather than being on stage together for the duration, they’ll use the transitions between solo sets to collaborate. “The old tradition of songwriters in the round, where everyone sits in a circle and swaps songs was hard for any one of us to imagine,” Phillips has stated. “We came from the sticky clubs, where the speakers were always on the blink and chairs were a liability. We decided to tweak it a bit.” 8 p.m. $30; clubcafelive.com.</p>
