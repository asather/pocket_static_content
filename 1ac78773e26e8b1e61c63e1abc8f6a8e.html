<h1>Modi announces rescue package that would amount to 10% of India’s GDP</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced on Tuesday a $300 billion economic rescue package for a nation that has been relatively spared by coronavirus infections but economically devastated by the pandemic.</p>
<p>Modi, who made the announcement in a televised address, did not provide many details about the package, which would amount to about 10% of India’s GDP. But he said it would help all classes of business, from farmers and migrant laborers to big companies.</p>
<p>“It’s overdue as the economic impact on India is going to be quite severe,” said Arvind Subramanian, a former chief economic adviser to Modi.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>Subramanian said that India could afford to spend the money through a combination of bond issuance, borrowing overseas and central bank spending because the country is not heavily indebted internationally. And he said India had no choice.</p>
<p>Modi also urged Indians to become more economically self-reliant and referred to Mohandas Gandhi’s self-sufficiency campaign nearly 100 years ago that boycotted British textiles.</p>
<p>“Who can stop us from becoming a self-reliant India?” he said.</p>
<p>The country has reported <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/world/asia/india-coronavirus-cases.html" rel="nofollow">more than 70,000 cases and more than 2,200 deaths</a> from the virus. India’s strict nationwide lockdown and the global turmoil from the coronavirus pandemic have hit the country’s economy hard, casting millions of very poor people out of work. Out-of-work laborers are pouring out of cities and heading back to rural villages where they hope to rely on family members to survive.</p>
<p>Modi said the finance ministry would announce the specifics of the relief package in the coming days.</p>
<p>Many Indians were listening to Modi’s speech desperate to hear if the lockdown, imposed in late March and set to expire on May 18, would be lifted. But Modi did not directly address it, instead saying that the next version of the lockdown would be governed by a different set of rules.</p>
<p>India did reopen parts of its huge rail network on Tuesday, running a limited number of trains as it looks at easing a nearly seven-week lockdown despite a continuing rise in coronavirus infections.</p>
<p>Special trains departed from several large cities, including New Delhi and Mumbai. Passengers were allowed to enter the stations only if they were asymptomatic and cleared thermal screening. They are required to maintain social distancing on board and are given hand sanitizers when they enter and leave.</p>
<p>Indian Railways also is requiring that passengers download a government-run contact tracing smartphone app before boarding the train. Critics say the Aarogya Setu app endangers civil liberties in how it uses location services and centralizes data collection.</p>
<p>Thousands of passengers waited in long, serpentine queues outside New Delhi’s railway station, the hub of India’s rail network. Police in riot gear tried to maintain social distancing and citizen volunteers offered water bottles to passengers who lugged heavy bags. Station workers sanitized the area with disinfectants.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about what happens next. At least I will be with my family,” said Ram Babu Kumar Singh, who works as an air conditioning mechanic in New Delhi but whose home is in eastern Bihar state. “If I stay here for long, I will die.”</p>
<p>Singh was among many who expressed relief over the resumption of train travel, which was suspended in late March along with road and air services as part of the nationwide lockdown. Its strictness helped keep confirmed coronavirus infections relatively low. But in recent days, as the lockdown has eased and some businesses have resumed, infections and deaths have shot up.</p>
<p>The decision to open select train lines was made Sunday.</p>
