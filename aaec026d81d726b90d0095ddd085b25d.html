<h1>Steelers eager to get Eric Ebron into their 'offensive mix'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers will get their first look this week at their new tight end, Eric Ebron, even if it is just for COVID-19 testing and some individual drills.</p>
<p>Their most significant free-agent acquisition will be among the rest of the veterans who will report to Heinz Field for training camp Monday, and his arrival will give the Steelers an opportunity to return to an offensive scheme that can utilize multiple tight-end sets — something that disappeared in 2019.</p>
<p>It also gives them a second NFL-quality tight end to pair with veteran Vance McDonald, giving the Steelers what could be their best tight-end tandem in decades.</p>
<p>What’s more, they will find out if he is fully recovered from an ankle injury that bothered him all of last season, when he played in only 11 games and eventually shut down his season in November.</p>
<p>“We are excited about acquiring him and adding him to our offensive mix,” coach Mike Tomlin said. “He’s a talented guy with a unique skill set for the position.”</p>
<p>Like all NFL teams, the Steelers won’t be able to start utilizing what they envision for Ebron and McDonald until their first padded practice Aug. 17. But just having him around, working with Ben Roethlisberger and doing something other than having him in virtual meetings will be the first step in helping to re-energize their offense.</p>
<p>The Steelers were so determined to do that — and return to the way they used to play — they signed Ebron to a two-year, $12 million deal in free agency. At the time, it was assumed by many the Steelers planned to part ways with McDonald, who has been oft-injured in his previous two seasons with the team. On the contrary, it was part of a plan to make them more diverse on offense, help the running game and give Roethlisberger another big target to improve their red-zone production.</p>
<p>After leading the NFL in red-zone touchdown percentage in 2018 (73.47%), the Steelers dropped to the bottom league last season, scoring on just 35% of their chances inside the 20.</p>
<p>“I always feel comfortable when I have two tight ends, dependable, that can equally be good in the pass and the run,” said offensive coordinator Randy Fichtner, who said he was excited to actually meet Ebron in person. “I like Eric, I like everything about him.”</p>
<p>Not only do the Steelers have two of the top 20 paid tight ends in the NFL — Tampa Bay with Rob Gronkowski and Cameron Brate is the only other team with two — they also have a tight end in Ebron who can line up almost as a wide receiver. The Steelers did that on occasion with McDonald, whose ability to run after the catch and break tackles is his best attribute. Ebron is more of a down-the-seam threat.</p>
<p>More important, they have the ability to use two tight ends in formation, something they got away from the past couple seasons. For example, the Steelers used four different tight ends for 1,184 snaps last season — their fewest in years and nearly 300 snaps fewer in 2016 when their tight ends were Jesse James, Xavier Grimble and the oft-injured Ladarius Green.</p>
<p>“I think that automatically puts you in that position,” Fichtner said. “Now again, availability is always the biggest issue when you play that really tough position. You have to play it somewhat like a race car. But you have to be able to be a Ford truck, too. They play in a world that’s very physical, and their availability will allow us to utilize two tight ends, if not more. And that will be awesome.”</p>
<p>General manager Kevin Colbert said the Steelers really liked Ebron when he was coming out of North Carolina in 2014 but knew they had no chance to draft him (he was the 10th overall pick by the Detroit Lions). Colbert called him a “super-talented, pass-receiving tight end” who will be a big asset — figuratively and literally — in the red zone.</p>
<p>Two years ago, Ebron had the best of his six NFL seasons, catching 66 passes for 750 yards and 13 touchdowns with the Indianapolis Colts and quarterback Andrew Luck. Now he gets to work with Roethlisberger, and the Steelers are enamored with the possibilities.</p>
<p>“We’re excited about carving out a role and highlighting those talents,” Tomlin said. “Some of it may include multiple tight end personnel groups, some of it may not. He’s a viable receiving option and one we are going to be excited about getting familiar with utilizing.”</p>
