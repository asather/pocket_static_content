<h1>Paul Zeise's sports chat transcript: 08.20.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Let’s chat</p>
<p><strong>Mercury</strong>: I haven’t heard many comments by MLB players about what it’s like playing with no fans. Is it just me or is some kind of gag order in effect? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I don’t think so, I just think they don’t care that much about it. It isn’t that big of a deal to them</p>
<p><strong>High School Fan</strong>: How many student athletes catching the Covid will it take to shut down all High School sports in the fall? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have no idea. I hope it isn’t “one case must shut down!!!”</p>
<p><strong>Buster</strong>: Is it possible the lack of adrenaline focus provided by ballpark crowds is contributing to so many dreadful batting averages? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I just think there was not a lot of rhythm to spring training. Players didn’t get a lot of swings in and I think it is just a choppy season</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Hi Paul, Though I certainly don’t think you are a hack :). I will disagree with your notion that it is a lack of leadership from School Admins/ADs or Gov office that is preventing HS sports from finding a way to play this fall. You don’t have HS kids these days so maybe you aren’t seeing the plans that schools have put out there just to get the kids in classrooms. In case of my kids HS, to play sports would mean ignoring a lot of precautions they have set for classrooms. To further the point, how does a school district like PPS, Lebo, or BP, that are keeping students completely home the first nine weeks, say that is OK to come to school for sports but not math. If schools can play sports while still following their own precautions then sure let them play. But I would bet not one public school in Allegheny county could do so (maybe tennis and golf ok). <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Actually I coach girls basketball. I have 10th graders. We have an organization of 18 teams. We’ve practiced 2 times a week for ten weeks. We have had games nine weekends in a row. Maybe I have an idea what I’m talking about in this regard. Kids are fine</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: disclaimer I have kids playing HS sports and will let them do so if allowed. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Exactly. We don’t shut down schools when a few kids get the flu</p>
<p><strong>Jack, Florida</strong>: I see only three NFL teams do not have any players opting out of playing because of the virus the Steelers are one of them. Who are the other two. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Falcons and Chargers</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: The Steelers finished 8-8 last season. In games that Big Ben did NOT start they were 8-6. In Big Ben’s one full game against the Patriots in the opener the Steeler offense score 3 points. Was Big Ben hurt before the game against the Seahawks? Is there reason to think he will be above average this season? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He was hurt before the season clearly. He was never really healthy so it is hard to go off of that last year.</p>
<p><strong>Hank W</strong>: Paul, in all seriousness... what are the Pirates doing? Are they rebuilding, tanking, auditioning or do they sadly have no clue as to how to run an organization? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Wow that’s a million dollar question.i think they are just playing the hand they were dealt, which isn’t a good one</p>
<p><strong>ALB</strong>: I know the NFL practice squads have been expanded this season to include veterans who normal wouldn’t be on it. Will other teams be able to claim those veterans? <br> <strong>Freedom</strong>: Thanks for the chat Paul. Any truth to some of the reports about concerns over Ben’s repaired elbow? Supposedly it’s affecting his deep ball? Hoping it’s fake news. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I have not been over to training camp yet. It sounds like in talking to Ray and Batko that it isn’t an issue and they are just bringing him along slowly. It isn’t a hard pitch count but it kind of is. They don’t want him throwing too much</p>
<p><strong>Gene</strong>: Do you know exactly what happened to Dotson’s knee? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Sounds like a minor issue and not much to be concerned about</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: I understand your point that your league is doing well and not disagreeing that sports in general imay be fine but you didn’t address the issue that you have called people out for having a lack of leadership...should schools ignore the precautions they put in the classroom to allow sports? Should a school that is closed for corona be allowing sanction sports? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I just feel like the “precautions” are designed to make it impossible to go to school. They should shut down now because it is set up to fail</p>
<p><strong>retguy18</strong>: Paul.....No question today, but much appreciation for your levelheaded response to so much of what is going on in the culture, how it affects sports, and life in general. Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Thanks I just try and use common sense as much as possible. I don’t like overreacting to things or hyperbole</p>
<p><strong>High School Fan</strong>: Do you see fans at High School games? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Maybe very limited fans. Like a small percentage.</p>
<p><strong>Vicki</strong>: If Dotson’s injury is not serious, do you think the Steelers are planning on giving him significant playing time? Thank you. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I don’t unless there is an injury. I think they will bring him along slowly! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: We have more questions right?</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: How is your 10th grade team doing? Any future stars on your team! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: We are OK. We have some kids who will play D-1 college hoops and others who will play smaller college. It is a lot of fun that’s for sure</p>
<p><strong>Lenny</strong>: Hey Paul...just wondering what you think of the PGA tour so far. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I love it. I love all the younger players coming on. I love watching matches without “in the hole” idiots around ever green. I think the Masters is going to be a lot of fun</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Paul, Good morning. Can a FB player from the Big Ten or the Pac 10 transfer to a team in a conference without having to set out a year? They allow that if the coach leaves? Why not for a Pandemic? Thanks! <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: No I think the NCAA has made it clear they will frown on that.</p>
<p><strong>Krugerrand</strong>: While Jack’s point is fair about the school education requirements ... many of the same people that want to close schools for ‘not being safe’ are fine with Day Care being open. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Like I said - if you want it to fail it will</p>
<p><strong>Chris</strong>: Hi Paul, any reason why Josh Taylor isn’t on radio and KDKA as much as was before? I would think with his versatility, he would be utilized more. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I think the radio is because they had to lay off part timers because of COVID. He is back doing Fri and Sat</p>
<p><strong>Barry J</strong>: is it true that Craig Meyer can windmill dunk? <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: I heard that too! He is a great athlete and can hoop too. No question that he can dunk it!!</p>
<p><strong>Jock Sutherland</strong>: Did you see Aaron Donald on Hard Knocks the other night on HBO? Incredible shape for a defensive lineman. I sure hope his nephew Elliott Is doing the same workout plan. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: He is a beast no doubt. My goodness he is built like a brick. I think he is in pretty good shape LOL</p>
<p><strong>Travis</strong>: Hi Paul, thanks for doing the chats. I’ve been enjoying watching the NBA playoffs. There’s been some great games and amazing individual performances. It’s also nice to see T.J. McConnell and Steven Adams get some recognition as well. <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Yes and Cam Johnson had a nice season too. We have some good players from here that’s for sure <br> <strong>Zeise</strong>: Hey thanks for the chat!! We will do it again soon</p>
