<h1>Years of political pressure in Washington to bolster the Butler Works</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The century-old Butler Works melts, casts, rolls and finishes steel annually across a 1,500-acre footprint and 3.5 million square feet of building space. In recent years, however, its owners have complained of threats from foreign steel producers — and betrayals from Canada and Mexico — that erode its ability to produce steel for the nation’s power grid.</p>
<p>In 2016, AK Steel, the longtime owner of the plant, became the last U.S. manufacturer of electrical steel used in the production of electric transformers, after its only U.S. competitor, Pittsburgh-based Allegheny Technologies Inc., closed that production line the year before. Only AK Steel’s Butler Works and its smaller plant in Zanesville, Ohio, could supply the domestic power grid.</p>
<p>Yet the federal trade investigation announced on May 4 on behalf of the two plants was the result of several years of advocacy by company officials and lawmakers in Washington —&nbsp;evidence of the slow-moving nature of trade policy despite having a White House ready to disrupt it.&nbsp;</p>
<p>President Donald Trump pledged during a 2016 campaign stop near Pittsburgh to <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/career-workplace/2016/04/16/Trump-promises/stories/201604160020" target="_blank">“bring back” the steel industry</a> in part by declaring unfairly traded steel imports a threat to national security. Mr. Trump imposed U.S. tariffs on steel imports from most countries in March 2018, an opening salvo to broader trade war with China.</p>
<p>But the long road to secure protections for the Butler Works, which was pushed the plant to the brink of closure this year even before the COVID-19 pandemic, spotlighted the complications of erecting a leak-proof trade barriers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It also showed the importance of lawmakers and staff on Capitol Hill.</p>
<p>Since 2017, Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Butler, pressed for a trade investigation with the Commerce Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After Cleveland-Cliffs bought AK Steel,&nbsp;Mr. Kelly’s wife, Victoria Kelly, purchased stock in the company — a spokesman for Mr. Kelly called it&nbsp;a gesture of goodwill for a struggling company. Some congressional ethics experts said could constitute a violation of the House Ethics Code.</p>
<p><strong>Golden opportunity</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after Mr. Trump took office, AK Steel, based near Cincinnati, joined the rest of the steel industry in seizing a long-sought golden opportunity.</p>
<p>In April 2017, the Commerce Department initiated an investigation under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, to determine whether imports of steel were a threat to U.S. national security.</p>
<p>Power grid components are critical to national security, Roger Newport, then the CEO of AK Steel, testified to the Commerce Department the following month.</p>
<p>The lobbying worked — partially.</p>
<p>When Mr. Trump announced 25% steel import tariffs in March 2018, they included electrical steel. But the trade penalties did not contemplate imports of slightly altered electrical steel sheets that can be stacked, wound and slit.</p>
<p>AK Steel and its lobbyists immediately raised the issue with lawmakers and the department, calling it a “loophole” in the Section 232 tariffs. Foreign producers would circumvent the tariffs by simply cutting up the steel or by routing the components through third countries, like Canada and Mexico.</p>
<p>A torrent of letters, meetings and plant tours followed.</p>
<p>In April 2018, Mr. Kelly, who lives a short drive away from the plant, toured the Butler Works in work clothes: a navy jumpsuit, yellow hard hat and goggles.</p>
<p>He vowed to fight for additional trade protections. “Butler’s existence over the years comes down to this plant,” he said, according to a Butler Eagle report.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly joined Rep. Troy Balderson, R-Ohio, who represented AK Steel’s Zanesville plant, to pen letters and arrange meetings through the fall of 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>The company met with the Commerce Department, led by financier Wilbur Ross, known as the “king of bankruptcy” for buying depressed steel assets during the 2002-2003 industry downturn. It met with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, led by Ambassador Robert Lighthizer, a longtime steel industry lobbyist at a Washington law firm and former Capitol Hill staffer.</p>
<p>In the Senate, Pennsylvania Democrat Bob Casey — who toured the Butler Works in August 2017 to talk trade policy — joined Sens. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, and Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio to press for protections.</p>
<p>AK Steel spent a total of $738,000 in 2018 and $919,000 in 2019 on lobbying expenses, with the Section “232 electrical steel loophole” listed as a major topic of discussion with lawmakers, according to disclosures. The United Auto Workers, which represents some 1,200 Butler Works employees, joined the lobbying effort, too.</p>
<p><strong>‘Unthinkable ... unforgivable’</strong></p>
<p>Still, nothing happened.</p>
<p>Federal data showed U.S. imports of products made from electrical steel, almost all of which come from Canada and Mexico, increased to $201 million in 2019, more than double the level in 2016. Without a proportionate increase in demand, AK steel’s lawyers cited the numbers as clear evidence of circumvention.</p>
<p>Through the spring, lawmakers engaged like never before, according to four people involved in the discussions on Capitol Hill who requested anonymity to openly describe the negotiations.</p>
<p>Cleveland-Cliffs, which had announced in December its intent to acquire AK Steel for $1.1 billion, turned up the heat. At the Congressional Steel Caucus in March, Cleveland-Cliffs CEO Lourenco Goncalves told lawmakers he would shut down the plants in Butler and Zanesville if the Commerce Department failed to act.</p>
<p>Mr. Goncalves — answering a question from Mr. Kelly and addressing the caucus’ chair, Rep. Conor Lamb, D-Mt. Lebanon — said: “I’m telling you right now, Chairman Lamb … I promise they will be gone, if I don’t get help.”</p>
<p>Mr. Gonclaves’ warning of layoffs were getting closer to reality. In mid-April, as the economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic sent the steel industry into a spiral, the company had drafted layoff notices for the Butler Works, according to three of the people involved in discussions.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, in an interview with the Post-Gazette in March, vented his frustration.</p>
<p>That the U.S. would be dependent on foreign steel to build transformers “is unthinkable and unforgivable and anybody that stands by and watches that happen needs to take their fingers out of their ears,” Mr. Kelly said. “This is an assault on our national security.”</p>
<p><strong>Moving heaven and earth</strong></p>
<p>The most feasible option left was to request the department conduct an entirely new Section 232 investigation into electrical steel imports on behalf of Cleveland-Cliffs. A separate investigation on behalf of a company is unusual and would require heavy advocacy by the company and lawmakers.</p>
<p>“It’s like moving heaven and earth,” said one person familiar with the talks.</p>
<p>Sometime in mid-April, Mr. Kelly and Mr. Balderson enlisted the help of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the House minority leader, who set up a phone call with White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, according to three of the people. Mr. Meadows, a former Republican House member who joined the White House in March, then arranged another meeting between Cleveland-Cliffs and the Commerce Department.</p>
<p>Spokespeople for Mr. McCarthy did not return requests for comment. The White House also did not respond.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes, department officials responded favorably.</p>
<p>On April 28, department officials notified Cleveland-Cliffs it would announce an investigation in short order, according to a timeline drawn up by the company and provided by a person involved with the negotiations.</p>
<p>On May 4, the department publicly announced the investigation, acknowledging “inquiries and requests from multiple members of Congress as well as industry stakeholders.” Mr. Ross, in a statement, promised a “thorough, fair, and transparent review to determine the effects on the national security.”</p>
<p>A spokesperson with the Commerce Department declined to comment.</p>
<p>The department is still reviewing investigating imports and, by law, has as long as 270 days from the launch of the investigation to release its decision. However, three congressional staffers involved with the negotiations said a conclusion was almost certain to come before the Nov. 3 presidential election.</p>
