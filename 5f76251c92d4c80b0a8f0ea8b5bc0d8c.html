<h1>William “Willie” Baker | 'Southern gentleman' who made his way north to become a successful businessman</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>William “Willie” Baker ran the longest operating black-owned business in the Homewood-Brushton area, but he represented much more than that.</p>
<p>A Southern gentleman who survived the racist Jim Crow era, Mr. Baker served as a substitute parent for some kids in the neighborhood, as well as an iconic figure and widely admired businessman.</p>
<p>For more than 52 years, his Baker’s Dairy store on Hamilton Ave., offered more than just groceries and neighborhood gossip. He used it to teach lessons to scofflaws and fed the hungry.</p>
<p>His free deli sandwiches were the only meal some children would eat that day. At Christmas, he would give away the broken and disused bicycles that he’d spent the year collecting and refurbishing.</p>
<p>That was Mr. Baker, 79, of Homewood, who died April 29 of complications from Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
<p>“Until the day he passed, my dad helped people when they needed it,” said his son Curtis Baker, of West Mifflin, who continues running Baker’s Dairy and other businesses with family members.</p>
<p>The youngest of four, William Baker was born and raised in Montgomery, Ala., by a single mother.</p>
<p>As a boy, he was accidentally hit by a car, severely injuring his head, right arm and right leg. He spent months in the hospital recovering, his son said.</p>
<p>“My grandmother didn’t have much money, but she was able to save enough to send him to a specialist in Birmingham, Alabama,” he said.</p>
<p>By the time he was in high school, Mr. Baker had fully recovered, and then some.</p>
<p>“He played high school football as a linebacker,” his son said. “He was so tough that they didn’t let him practice with the other players because he would hurt them without meaning to.”</p>
<p>In 1959, following his high school graduation, Mr. Baker left Alabama and&nbsp;came to the Hill District to work as a jitney driver for his uncle and to get away from segregation and oppressive laws in the South, his son said.</p>
<p>“There was a lot of prejudice and the KKK, and that’s why he moved up here, to escape that,” he said.</p>
<p>While he was working in the Hill District, Mr. Baker frequented a restaurant owned by the family of waitress Patricia E. Gardner. She took his breath away, his son said.</p>
<p>“My mother was flirting with him. He was a good ol’ Southern boy and she was tickled with his accent,” Curtis Baker said. “My dad was a Southern gentleman, and they were taught at a young age to treat women with respect. He said he fell in love with her the first time he saw her.”</p>
<p>The couple married in August of 1960 and Mr. Baker enrolled in business classes at the Community College of Allegheny County.</p>
<p>“He really didn’t want to work for somebody else, he knew he wanted his own business,” his son said. “He learned the ins and outs of business, and from there he landed a job at Country Bell. He started meeting people, and they started liking him.”</p>
<p>Mr. Baker learned the ropes of the dairy business and customer relations by delivering milk for Country Bell. Eventually, he rented a space on Brushton Ave., where he opened the first Baker’s Dairy in 1968.</p>
<p>But, when the landlord raised the rent a couple of years later, Mr. Baker bought property on Hamilton Ave., where he opened a second store. At the same time, he capitalized on the relationships he and his wife had cultivated in the Hill District and opened a third store at the corner of Centre Ave. and Kirkpatrick St.</p>
<p>“At one time, we had three stores,” his son said. “My mom ran the Brushton Avenue store and other family members worked at Centre while my dad ran the Hamilton store. My dad employed people from the neighborhood, but he always had a family member handle the register and the money.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Mr. Baker closed the other stores and focused on Baker’s Dairy on Hamilton Ave., where he set about purchasing the properties and empty lots that surrounded his building.</p>
<p>He converted a former auto body shop into Mr. B’s Car Wash and his wife opened Images Art Gallery on Frankstown Ave.</p>
<p>Mr. Baker was also one of the first local black businessmen to open an arcade, his son said, at the site of a former laundromat near his store.</p>
<p>“It was called The Rip Off,” he recalled. “It had games like Pac-Man and pinball machines and pool tables. He was one of the first African Americans to have a full-fledged arcade.”</p>
<p>A grocery store and delicatessen that specializes in dairy and deli products, Baker’s Dairy also sold penny candy, canned goods and even homemade desserts. It was a safe haven for all in the neighborhood, Curtis Baker recalled.</p>
<p>“We never had drug dealing or gangs,” he said. “My dad chased all of that away. It’s where we grew up. I started selling penny candy when I was four years old and by the time I got to school, I could count better than I could read.”</p>
<p>Mr. Baker often helped people in tough times by giving them gratis groceries and sandwiches, his son remembered.</p>
<p>“I would notice that some of the people who I made sandwiches for didn’t pay and I’d ask him about it. He said, ‘Son, don’t worry about it.’ He never told me why, but I figured out they were hungry and didn’t have any money. But, when they got back on their feet —&nbsp;it didn’t matter if it was a week later or a year later —&nbsp;they would always come back and pay for whatever he gave them.”</p>
<p>His father had a unique way of punishing kids who stole from his store, Curtis Baker said.</p>
<p>“He wrote their name on the wall. He called it ‘Baker’s thieves,’” he said. “The only way we would take their name off is if their mother came down and talked to dad. They never stole again, that’s for sure.”</p>
<p>Later in life, they would often return to acknowledge Mr. Baker for the tough love, his son said.</p>
<p>“Many, many of them came back to thank him,” he said.</p>
<p>Along with bicycle and toy giveaways, Mr. Baker often hosted community appreciation parties with games, food and entertainment, and he even coached a Little League tee-ball team.</p>
<p>A non-smoker and teetotaler, Mr. Baker taught his children to hold themselves to a high standard and to remember their place in the community, his son said.</p>
<p>“He had Southern values; he was a no-nonsense, tough man, but he never hollered at anybody. He would pull you aside for a quiet talk,” he said. “He kept me many times from losing my temper and I finally learned why. He did that to show us that no one person is bigger than the business. He was a kind man and a great father.”</p>
<p>Along with his wife and son, Mr. Baker is survived by his sister Mary Jones; his daughters Deidre Baker Abbey, Regina Baker, and Shannon Muqtadir; his sons Erik, Jeffrey, and Brandon; 14 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.</p>
<p>He was preceded in death by his brothers James Canty and Joe Williams and his son Frederick L. Washington.</p>
<p>His funeral was private, due to current health restrictions.</p>
