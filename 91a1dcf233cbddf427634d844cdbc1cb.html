<h1>Norfolk Southern details plans to replace Merchant Street rail bridge</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Norfolk Southern Railroad is seeking public comment on its plans to replace the 115-year-old bridge that carries 36 trains daily over Merchant Street on the North Shore.</p>
<p>A 27-minute <a href="http://www.nscorp.com/content/nscorp/en/in-your-community/the-pittsburgh-vertical-clearance-projects/public-involvement-process--merchant-street-bridge-project--.html?utm_source=Master+list&amp;utm_campaign=a5474c11a8-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2018_1_4_COPY_01&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_d8e3aff8a8-a5474c11a8-1210676577%20" target="_blank">video</a> that explains and shows the deteriorating steel structure and plans for replacing the bridge is available to the public, and a public comment period is open until Aug. 26. The video offers that opportunity, and the railroad provides this phone number in case anyone has technical difficulties: 412-893-7041.</p>
<p>The work would begin in the spring of 2021 and be completed in the fall. It is being funded, either in full or partially, by a $20 million grant from the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation. A spokesman for Norfolk Southern did not respond to queries about the total amount of the construction budget.</p>
<p>The railroad states that Allegheny Commons Park on the North Side will not be used for staging for the Merchant Street project and that the park will not be impeded in any way.</p>
<p>A component of replacing the Merchant Street bridge would be to lower the roadway beneath it by 26 inches so that the current clearance could increase to 11 feet, 3 inches.</p>
<p>The railroad states in the video that an inspection in 2018 showed "significant steel corrosion in cross-girder columns and the riveted trough structure."</p>
<p>With the planned improvements, there is capacity for 70 trains a day and that current conditions could not accommodate anticipated increases in freight requirements.</p>
<p>Without the bridge replacement, it states, "Increased maintenance demands would cause more disruptions on the Fort Wayne line."</p>
<p>During construction, rail traffic will continue, but Merchant Street will be closed to vehicular and pedestrian traffic.</p>
<p>The project will include a wider sidewalk and two bicycle lanes that would be open to vehicular traffic, new lighting and pointing of the sandstone support wall.</p>
<p>Norfolk Southern for a decade has been planning reconstruction of several other bridges along that line, two of which are above tracks going through Allegheny Commons Park. Those bridges are considered part of the railroad's Pittsburgh Vertical Clearance Project, which has come under fire from nearby residents in part because the company proposes lifting roadway bridges to accommodate double-stacked train cars below and because of pollution and potential hazards they say will be caused by increased rail traffic.</p>
<p>Opponents have requested that the company lower its tracks instead.</p>
<p>The company has isolated the Merchant Street bridge replacement from its other vertical clearance projects, asking for public comment about those at a later date.</p>
<p>But Rail Pollution Protection Pittsburgh, a grassroots group formed by Glenn Olcerst and Barbara Talerico, residents of the Central Northside, rejects Norfolk Southern's assertion that the Merchant Street bridge should be separate. They said that it is part of the chain of bridges that affect 27 neighborhoods and 175,000 residents.</p>
<p>They said the video presentation is not an adequate form of a town hall meeting, of which Mr. Olcerst said the railroad had promised several.</p>
<p>"In December 2018, Barbara and I were promised three community town hall-format meetings would be scheduled in February or March," he said.</p>
<p>“On Feb. 7, 2019, we met with Rudy [Husband, a Norfolk Southern vice-president] at our home and he promised three meetings would be scheduled for April or May.”</p>
<p>Those meetings were not held.</p>
<p>In the absence of in-person meetings, Mr. Olcerst said, virtual town hall meetings on a platform such as Zoom would have given the public a chance to give feedback in real time with representatives of the railroad and the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.</p>
