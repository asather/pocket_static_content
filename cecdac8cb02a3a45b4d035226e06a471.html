<h1>Arconic ready to split into two companies on April 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Arconic Inc. is poised to officially split into two companies on April 1, CEO John Plant said Monday as the Pittsburgh-based aluminum parts producer for aircraft and cars reported higher profits for the fourth quarter on slightly lower revenue.</p>
<p>Revenue was $3.4 billion for the quarter, down 2% from $3.47 billion a year earlier.</p>
<p>Net income was $309 million, or 70 cents per share, up from $218 million, or 44 cents, in the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Excluding special items such as restructuring costs, per-share profits were 53 cents vs. 33 cents. That was a notch lower than the consensus estimate on Wall Street of 54 cents per share.</p>
<p>The breakup of Arconic was announced in February 2019 in the wake of the company’s failed sale to a private equity firm. The new operations will be called Howmet Aerospace — which will include the engineered products and forgings segment — and Arconic Corp., which will be formed from the rolled products segment.</p>
<p>Arconic Corp. will be run by current group president of global rolled products Timothy Myers. A CEO for Howmet Aerospace hasn’t been announced, but Mr. Plant has said he intends to remain at the helm “through separation and beyond.”</p>
<p>For the full year, Arconic Inc. posted profits of $470 million, or $1.03 a share, down from $642 million, or $1.30, in 2018.</p>
<p>On Monday, the company issued earnings guidance for 2020 of $2.22 to $2.42 a share, excluding special items, on revenue of $13.9 billion to $14.2 billion.</p>
<p>The guidance was at the low end of what analysts were expecting, reflecting the uncertainty over when Boeing will restart production of the grounded 737 Max airliner.</p>
<p>Arconic was formed in 2016 when Pittsburgh’s Alcoa split in two.</p>
