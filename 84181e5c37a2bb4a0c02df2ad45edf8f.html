<p>Bruce Baker loved to tell stories — except his own. He left that to his friends, students, the thousands of physically disabled people to whom he gave a voice and, finally, to the unusual house where he lived and died May 7 at age 77.</p>
<p>Six years ago, designer Lynn Smith called to tell me about her latest project —&nbsp;organizing and displaying thousands of books, artworks and other items in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/homes/2014/10/11/Renovation-creates-new-home-by-joining-two-existing-ones/stories/201410110026" target="_blank">a 6,000-square-foot house that merged two smaller ones</a>.&nbsp;But there was a catch to writing that story: I couldn’t identify the owner or the house’s location, other than it was in the South Hills.</p>
<p>I agreed, and met Bruce. He was quirky, shy yet talkative and just plain fascinating. But there was nothing plain about the interior of his house.</p>
<p>The foyer alone featured a huge, restored brass chandelier recovered from a Sewickley house and antique, hand-colored maps of 1500s Spain, 1600s Wales and 1700s Paris. Many of the walls were jammed with paintings and other artwork. Some were by Western Pennsylvania artists; others were collected during his travels around the world, mostly to teach Minspeak to assistive technology language teachers.</p>
<p>This system of symbols allows people with disabilities such as cerebral palsy to communicate verbally, often for the first time. Produced with Prentke Romich Co. and available in nine languages, Minspeak patents and copyrights made this former high school Latin teacher a very wealthy man.</p>
<p>Being rich was Bruce’s childhood dream. He grew up in Hampden, a Baltimore neighborhood “one ZIP code away from the blue bloods,” says his first cousin, Bailey St. Clair of Glen Arm, Md. When you’re an only child, your cousins become like siblings, and Bailey was his big brother.</p>
<p>“He wasn’t very athletic, but he was really good at chess. I’m four years older. By the time he was 12, he could put me away,” Bailey says.</p>
<p>Bruce loved language from an early age, starting with the slang used by his beloved mother, Jessie.</p>
<p>“Take it easy, Breezy,” she would say when I was driving,” says Bob Conti, a vice president at Semantic Compaction Systems Inc., the Castle Shannon company that Bruce founded.</p>
<p>A photo in Bruce’s dining room shows him at age 8 or 9 in his Sunday best, holding a chicken.</p>
<p>“His grandmother had a farm,” Lynn says. “I think it’s the only animal he ever touched.”</p>
<p>Bruce was the smartest kid in his graduating class at Logansport High School in Indiana, his fellow <a href="https://www.tributearchive.com/obituaries/12924334/Dr-Bruce-Roland-Baker" target="_blank">alumni say on his tribute page</a>.&nbsp;His father, Roland, moved the family often because of his job with the Pennsylvania Railroad. It brought the family to Western Pennsylvania, and after he and Jessie divorced, Bruce moved in with his mother. He majored in Latin and minored in Greek at Wabash College in Indiana and earned a graduate degree in French language and literature at Middlebury College in Vermont.</p>
<p>Bruce taught Latin for several years at Allegany High School in Cumberland, Md., but also squeezed in European culture, history and other topics that fascinated him.</p>
<p>“I didn't learn any Latin, but he helped me discover a lot about myself — especially how to nurture and follow my own curiosities, and that it can be cool to be ‘intellectual,’” a former student wrote on his tribute page.</p>
<p>In the late 1970s, Bruce met Bob and merged his love for languages and hieroglyphics with nascent computer technology to give nonverbal people a voice. Bob was training as a legal secretary.&nbsp;They created the Minspeak prototype on an IBM Selectric typewriter in the living room of Jessie’s modest house, which became half of Bruce’s mansion 30 years later. His mother lent him $5,000 or $10,000 (accounts differ) to start his company.</p>

<p>So began Bruce’s “mission” of helping people communicate. On his tribute page, several teachers say his seminars changed their lives and those of their students. And vice versa. His favorite Latin proverb was “Docendo discimus,” which means “By teaching, we learn.”</p>
<p>“He would come back from a seminar and say, ‘Bobby, you won’t believe what I learned!’” Bob says.</p>
<p>Bruce, who could speak at least a smattering of seven languages, never stopped learning. He asked his decorator for more bookshelves than any client she has ever had.</p>
<p>“And he has read every one!” Lynn says.</p>
<p>Travelers who bring back art or souvenirs often put them on a shelf and never look at them again. Not Bruce.</p>
<p>“He’s the only person I’ve ever known who truly loved his stuff,” Lynn says. “He loved the provenance of things. He would say, ‘Isn’t this the most gorgeous silver tray you’ve ever seen?’”</p>
<p>After Bruce died, Lynn invited Dr. Lori Verderame to appraise only the most valuable items in his house. It took Dr. Lori, a regular at the Pittsburgh Home &amp; Garden Show, two full days.</p>
<p>Bruce was famous for his generosity, paying for vacations, reunions and college educations for friends and relatives or their children. His health declined quickly after a fall in his house two weeks before he died, but he made sure to set up payment for the cost of upcoming surgery for a loved one.</p>
<p>Bailey attended one of his cousin’s seminars years ago.</p>
<p>“He pointed to me in the back and said, ‘I got the brains, he got the looks …,” Bailey says.&nbsp;“When we talked, he never talked down to me. Sometimes he talked over my head, but he never talked down to me.”</p>
