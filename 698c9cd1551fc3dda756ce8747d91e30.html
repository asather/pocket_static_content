<h1>Five things to know about the Steelers'  Week 2 opponent, the Denver Broncos</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Steelers will look to stay on the winning track when they face the Denver Broncos in their home opener Sunday at Heinz Field. Here are five things to know about the AFC West squad coming off a Week 1 loss.</em></p>
<p><strong>Melvin Gordon is looking strong —</strong>&nbsp;The Pro Bowl back formerly of the Los Angeles Chargers was efficient in his debut with his new team Monday night, piling up 78 yards on 15 carries in a loss against Tennessee. That’s a gaudy 5.2 per tote. His first-quarter fumble that led to a Titans touchdown was a glaring blemish, to be sure. The production, however, is there, signaling that Gordon will be the second tough back the Steelers will have to figure out how to stop in as many weeks.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Jeudy, too —</strong>&nbsp;The 21-year-old Alabama product was the Broncos’ choice at No. 15 in the first round of the draft back in April, and he’s making an instant impact on the passing game. Jeudy hauled in four passes for 56 yards Monday night, putting him behind only Noah Fant in the Denver half of the box score. And if history is any indication, it shouldn’t be too long before he finds the end zone. He scored 26 times in just three seasons with the Crimson Tide, a testament to his ability to turn any pass into a long gainer. He’ll be a playmaker to remain aware of all afternoon.</p>
<p><strong>Von Miller is missing -—</strong>The All-Pro linebacker underwent surgery late last week for an ankle injury suffered in practice Sept. 8. He’s certainly out for the game Sunday and possibly the entire season. And the Broncos pass rush is already missing him dearly. The defense notched just one sack in the loss to Tennessee, with Jeremiah Attaochu stepping up to get his team on the board. Miller had eight sacks last season, a step back from at least 10 in each of the previous five but still a sign of how dangerous he can be. Ben Roethlisberger will be glad not to see him coming off the edge.</p>
<p><strong>Drew Lock is the man at QB —</strong>&nbsp;The second-round pick got his shot at the end of last season and made the most of it, passing for 1,020 yards and seven touchdowns against seven interceptions in just five games. He got off to a decent start Monday night, too, throwing 33 times for 216 yards and a score. Like Daniel Jones’ numbers last week, Lock’s don’t exactly jump off the page, as his coaches appear to be taking a similarly cautious approach to calling his plays. The flashes are there, though, so it will be interesting to see if the Steelers defense can force him into mistakes similar to those Jones made in a losing effort for his New York Giants.</p>
<p><strong>Courtland Sutton’s injury is worth monitoring —</strong>&nbsp;Denver’s leading receiver last season missed the opener Monday night because of a sprained AC joint. His status was up in the air all last week and figures to remain uncertain throughout this one, so keep an eye on him. Sutton was a revelation a year ago, posting 72 receptions for 1,112 yards and six touchdowns in his second season. He figures to be a key part of the passing attack again if he’s able to play.</p>
