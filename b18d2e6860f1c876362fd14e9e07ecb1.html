<h1>Matt Vensel's Penguins chat transcript: 06.19.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Hello, Pens fans. Excited to talk hockey. It's Friday, so I'm feeling frisky. My takes might heat up above lukewarm. Anyway, go ahead and leave your questions and we'll get going at noon. As always, I plan to chat with yinz for an hour if the questions keep coming. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK, let's get started. Only one question in the queue. Fire away, folks.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Which players now are not skating in Pittsburgh? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Since these Phase 2 workouts are optional, the Pens have not released a list of who has been in the building. Based on the photos and videos the team has shared, we know that one group is Crosby, Guentzel, Sheary, Dumoulin, Marino and DeSmith. Another group is Malkin, Rust, McCann, Letang, Jack and Murray. I wouldn't read into Letang being paired with Jack. I believe Kris was a later arrival to UPMC66, after the first group had already been chosen. To avoid potential cross-contamination if someone gets COVID-19, they probably don't want to shuffle groups around right now. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm told there is at least one more group of players that has been cycling through the building this week. It could just be bottom-liners and potential "Black Aces" like goalie prospect Emil Larmi. I'm not sure why the Pens aren't sharing photos and videos of those other players. Maybe they've been having bad hair days. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: For more on what they're actually doing during Phase 2, check out the story I wrote about that yesterday. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/18/Pittsburgh-Penguins-NHL-Phase-2-Ty-Hennes-Sidney-Crosby-Jake-Guentzel/stories/202006180146" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/18/Pittsburgh-Pen...</a></p>
<p><strong>Joe</strong>: Any idea which player tested positive for Covid? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: No. The Penguins haven't shared that information and I don't blame them for it. For matters like this, players deserve privacy and the right to decide whether that information gets put out there. I do think there could be a benefit to a high-profile athlete sharing his or her story about the coronavirus as our country begins to open up and cases spike in some areas. But, again, it's up to the player.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Thoughts on the flexibility for players to return during this period that’s currently being negotiated by the NHL/NHLPA and have any Pens expressed concern or hesitation? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Great question. I've talked to a handful of players and coaches and they have all said they are comfortable with the protocols in place right now. GMJR said a few weeks ago that no player, at least at that point, had expressed reservations about playing. But as a dad and beer-league hockey player, I'm skeptical. The close quarters of a hockey rink, the locker room and the benches are not exactly ideal for social distancing, especially when sweaty dudes are gasping for air. As a father of two little ones, I do not yet feel comfortable getting back on the ice. Obviously, these guys are wired differently and there is a ton at stake for them. But I'm sure there are players on the team, possibly dads, who are at least a little nervous about playing. I believe players should be allowed to opt out if they don't feel comfortable and it sounds like there is a good chance that will be included in the agreement the NHL and NHLPA come up with. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: You wonder, though, if any NHL players will be brave enough to say no to suiting up given that there will surely be some fans and media who rip them, and also that the players may feel like they are letting their team down. In an ideal world, everyone would understand. But we clearly aren't living in an ideal world right now.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: what do you think the chances are that a bunch of players contract the virus during the training camp and the whole playoffs are scrapped? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I don't know what the odds are, but I will say that it is certainly a worry. The NHL isn't too concerned about the dozen or so known players who have contracted COVID-19 over the past three months because everyone is still pretty isolated. But if that starts happening during the training camp phase, as you said, it will really test how badly the league and the players want this to happen. Anyway, I'll again caution that just because we have a playoff format and a tentative date for the start of camps (July 10), there are no guarantees we see an NHL game anytime soon. Sorry to be a buzzkill.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Any word on if Horny is in Sweden? Marcus seems to still be there. Are Swedes more hesitant to come back ? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I'm honestly not sure about those two guys. Considering that the Penguins haven't shared any photos or videos of them, it makes me think they aren't here. Especially Hornqvist, who is one of the most popular athletes in town. As you probably know, ice rinks have been open in Sweden for a while now, so many NHL players have been working out there. Plus, I wouldn't blame anyone for staying in their home countries until there is more certainty and a concrete start date for Phase 3. The question is what kind of quarantine they will have to go through when coming back overseas before camp.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: There seems to be 5 goalies at practice (or there will be) if reports are correct. How many goalies do u think the Pens are going to carry into the playoffs? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: There have been reports that, to avoid an EBUG situation, NHL teams will be allowed to carry at least four goalies on the playoff roster. So that's one reason why there are so many goalies in town. Also, the Pens want a goalie with every group of players for practice, right? Anyway, the top three are Matt Murray, Tristan Jarry and Casey DeSmith. I'd guess that Dustin Tokarski, who has NHL experience and pretty well in the AHL this season, would be ahead of young Emil Larmi on the depth chart. But that's merely a hunch.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Outside of the financial implications for all involved parties, isn't having the playoffs and awarding the Stanley Cup an exercise in futility because of the potential lousy playing conditions, potential lack of fan interest and the possible cancellation of the remainder of the playoffs should there be another outbreak. Besides, this season will always have an asterisk attached to it. No cup winner during the lockout season didn't seem to be a problem so why not wait until next season? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Sorry, but I think talk of an asterisk is complete and total nonsense.</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Do you think the Pens are as good as some of the East favorites in the tournament like Tampa Bay, Boston and the Caps? <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: I think Boston and Tampa Bay were the top two teams in the East before the pause. Philly was on fire, but I still think the Pens have the better team. The Caps are the Caps. I think those five teams make up the short list of serious contenders in the East. But after a long layoff and with this quirky playoff format, all bets are off. I'm not saying the Canadiens or the Blue Jackets are going all the way. But talented teams with young stars like the Leafs or the Rangers could surprise. The playoffs should be a blast if we get there. Fingers crossed.</p>
<p><strong>Ron J</strong>: Matt I always look for u &amp; Mike ‘s podcast . Thanks I really enjoyed your article on Emil Larmi he’s seems to be a funny guy . <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Ron J? Is this my father-in-law? Thanks for the kind words, Ron. Mike DeFabo and I have a lot of fun talking hockey on the North Shore Drive podcast. Be sure to check it out, folks, if you haven't already. <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: And, yes, Emil is a total nut, in a good way. Here's my profile of the young Finnish goalie, who had a turbulent first year in the U.S. but his NHL dreams and sense of humor remain intact. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/11/emil-larmi-penguins-goaltender-prospect-finland-hockey-nhl-return/stories/202006110085" target="_blank">https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/06/11/emil-larmi-pen...</a> <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: Any more questions, Pens fans? No one has ripped Jack Johnson yet... <br> <strong>Matt Vensel</strong>: OK, that's it for today. Thanks for joining and stick taps to everyone who submitted questions. As usual, there were some good ones. We'll do it again soon. In the meantime, stay safe out there.</p>
