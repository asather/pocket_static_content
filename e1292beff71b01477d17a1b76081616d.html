<h1>Ben Roethlisberger 'definitely sore,' but his arm feels OK after first game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It is not easy for teams who open the season on a Monday night to have a short week for the next opponent, especially when there were no preseason games for players to get their bodies acclimated to actual game contact.</p>
<p>That is especially true for a quarterback who hadn’t played in a game in nearly a year.</p>
<p>Which is why Ben Roethlisberger said his body felt as though he was involved in something more than a game after Monday night’s season-opening victory against the New York Giants.</p>
<p>“I said today I feel like I was just in a car accident; yesterday I felt like I was in a train wreck,” Roethlisberger said on Wednesday. “Hopefully tomorrow it will feel like I fell off a bike. I’m definitely sore. The good news is my arm is the only thing that doesn’t hurt. That’s good.”</p>
<p>Roethlisberger’s return from elbow surgery got off to a rousing start. He passed for 229 yards and three touchdowns without an interception and spread the ball to nine different receivers. His touchdown to JuJu Smith-Schuster in the second quarter was his first since the season-ending game of the 2018 season.</p>
<p>However, Roethlisberger admitted to having some rust with pocket awareness against the Giants, something that comes from not having any contact during the preseason. He gets a chance to knock off some more of the rustiness on Sunday in the home opener against the Denver Broncos.</p>
<p>“It’s not like I played perfect,” Roethlisberger said. “Sometimes I got up into pocket too quick. I didn’t have the same feeling I’m used to having. I think that comes from not getting hit even in practice.</p>
<p>“Defenders don’t hit you in practice so I think you lose some of that feel of where you can slide, where you can step to. I think that will come back with the more reps and plays you get into.”</p>
