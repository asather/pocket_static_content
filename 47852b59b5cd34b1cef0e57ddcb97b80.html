<h1>Feeding souls on a socially distant Sukkot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Late on a sunny afternoon on Tuesday, small clusters of visitors gathered in a makeshift shelter in Rabbi Yisroel and Chani Altein’s backyard, behind their brick, gabled home in Squirrel Hill.</p>
<p>As they do every year, the Alteins were hosting guests during the weeklong Jewish festival of Sukkot, which Jews observe with food, prayers and social gatherings in shelters known as a Sukkah.</p>
<p>Normally the family would be hosting bigger crowds, but in this pandemic year, they adapted their observance of the ancient custom with the help of something more modern, a shared online spreadsheet, so that guests could schedule their visits throughout the late afternoon and evening. That way guests could wear masks and keep their social distances, yet make social connections.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Usually a shelter “is easily filled with three rows of tables,” said Rabbi Altein of Chabad of Squirrel Hill. “We try to fit for as many meals as we can, 30-40 people in here, to get everyone in.&nbsp;But this year, obviously, we couldn’t put together all the guests.”</p>
<p>By spacing out the visits according to half-hour intervals,&nbsp;“everyone could spread and be where they need to be ... make a blessing on the food, on the Sukkah, eat, spend a half-hour, schmooze with someone.” The Sukkah was well-appointed with pastry snacks, soft drinks and the ritual items of the holiday, including a lulav — a&nbsp;palm branch to which willow and myrtle sprigs are attached —&nbsp;and a citrus fruit known as an etrog.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ancient, weeklong festival of Sukkot (the Hebrew plural for&nbsp;“tabernacles” or&nbsp;“booths”) follows closely after the solemn day of atonement, Yom Kippur. Jews have commemorated the holiday by constructing a Sukkah (singular of Sukkot), a temporary shelter whose roof is at least partly open to the sky. The holiday is associated with the harvest and also commemorates the shelters used by the biblical Israelites in the wilderness after their escape from slavery in Egypt.</p>
<p>Margy Beerman of Shadyside appreciated the gathering. She has regularly attended the Chabad synagogue and appreciates that the Alteins invite attendees to take part in Orthodox ritual observances but don’t insist everyone do as they do.</p>
<p>“They’re more spiritual than about the dogma,” Ms. Beerman said.&nbsp;“They’re always inclined to feed our souls.”</p>
<p>Deborah Alpern of Squirrel Hill visiting with son Avi, 9, and daughter, Naomi, 7, agreed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“They’re always finding unique and creative ways to still celebrate, yet safely,” she said.</p>
<p>As per custom, the Sukkah is a simple structure, made of wooden beams, walled with tarp and roofed with bamboo that was spaced apart enough to let in the sunlight or moonlight&nbsp;— or rain, although there’s been little of that during this balmy week.</p>
<p>“I like how there was a roof but it was made out of sticks,” Avi said.</p>
<p>Sukkot concludes Friday and is followed by Simchat Torah, in which Jews complete the annual cycle of readings from the Torah and begin the next year’s cycle.</p>
