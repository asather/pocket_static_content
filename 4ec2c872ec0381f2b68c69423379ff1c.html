<p>PORTLAND, Ore. — Several hundred people broke away from a massive peaceful protest in Portland, Oregon, late Tuesday and engaged in a confrontation with police officers guarding a public building.</p>
<p>Police Chief Jami Resch said in a video message posted on Twitter that members of the smaller group tried to tear down fencing set up to protect a facility that holds the police headquarters and a county jail and threw bottles, bats and mortars at officers.</p>
<p>Police declared an unlawful assembly and set off flash-bang grenades and tear gas.</p>
<p>It wasn’t clear how many arrests, if any, had been made.</p>
<p>The violence was in stark contrast to a rally and march earlier in the evening. Thousands of people laid down on a major bridge spanning the Willamette River for nine minutes and their bodies covered almost the entire span of the bridge.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The crowd then proceeded to Pioneer Courthouse Square for a peaceful rally before the much smaller group broke away.</p>
<p>Portland Mayor Ted Wheeler canceled an 8 p.m. curfew earlier Tuesday after praising protestors for Monday night’s demonstration, which was largely peaceful.</p>
