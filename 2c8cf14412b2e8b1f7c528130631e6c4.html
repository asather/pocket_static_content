<p>A tense two-hour confrontation between Pittsburgh police and a prominent activist at the center of recent protests outside Mayor Bill Peduto’s Point Breeze house ended peacefully near there Friday night when officers and civilians were able to persuade Lorenzo Rulli to end his barricade in his car and surrender to officers.</p>
<p>Mr. Rulli, 24, whose legal name is Shawn Lateff Green, was awaiting arraignment Saturday morning on three misdemeanors and three summary charges that police say he committed during the standoff and in two previous hours -- all of which played out live on social media as the defendant streamed from his vehicle.</p>
<p>In an affidavit of probable cause, police said Mr. Rulli’s blue Chevrolet Cavalier was pulled over on Hastings Street near the mayor’s house&nbsp;at 8:14 p.m. “for the safety of the public and Green himself." Police said they suspected Mr. Rulli might be in a mental health crisis because “in his live-streaming ‘Facebook’ and ‘Instagram’ posts, [Rulli] has stated that he has been off of his medications and is bi-polar, often threatening to kill police and die in confrontations with police.”</p>
<p>The affidavit said that for two hours officers and citizens had observed Mr. Rulli driving around the neighborhood “shouting vulgarities and racial slurs into his megaphone at the neighbors, the mayor and police” all the while broadcasting on social media. “[Rulli] was exhibiting dangerous, unstable and schizophrenic behavior,” police said.</p>
<p>Despite being told he was under arrest, Mr. Rulli refused to leave his vehicle for two hours until officers aided by attorney Paul Jubas and activist Brandi Fisher were able to persuade him to surrender to police officers.</p>
<p>“It was a dramatically escaping situation. We’re lucky that so far things haven’t gone wrong,” said Mr. Jubas, who is not Mr. Rulli’s attorney but was asked by the Allegheny County district attorney’s office to go to the scene. “At the end of the day, everyone is thankful that things didn’t go south."</p>
