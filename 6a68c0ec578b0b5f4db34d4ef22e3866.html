<h1>More banks sign on to program pledging breaks to customers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Three more banks with local operations have joined a state aid initiative, pledging to offer certain breaks to customers struggling financially during the pandemic.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh-based Dollar Bank, Indiana, Pa.-based First Commonwealth Bank, and Rhode Island-based Citizens Bank have committed to the program, called the “PA CARE Package” initiative. Pittsburgh-based PNC Bank, Pennsylvania’s biggest bank, was the first to support the program when it was launched a week ago.</p>
<p>Under the program, financial institutions must offer certain assistance to Pennsylvanians facing financial hardship. That includes:</p>
<p>• Expanded loan availability for small and medium-sized businesses.</p>
<p>• A 90-day grace period on mortgage payments and on other consumer loans such as auto loans.</p>
<p>• Relief from fees and charges, such as late and overdraft fees, for 90 days.</p>
<p>• A 60-day moratorium on foreclosures, evictions and vehicle repossession.</p>
<p>• No adverse credit reporting for taking relief on consumer loans.</p>
<p>For more information on the program, visit www.attorneygeneral.gov/COVID19.</p>
