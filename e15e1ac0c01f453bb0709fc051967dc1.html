<h1>HBO reportedly passing on Steelers for 'Hard Knocks'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>So much for the Steelers finally ending up on&nbsp;“Hard Knocks.”&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/29005702/sources-hard-knocks-get-rams-chargers" target="_blank">ESPN reported Tuesday</a> that the HBO show instead will follow the Los Angeles Rams and Chargers during training camp this summer. It will mark the first time the series has offered its uncensored, inside look at two teams in the same year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Steelers were considered a leading candidate to appear in the series for the first time because 2020 marks a rare occasion that they meet the NFL’s loose eligibility requirements. Usually, teams that missed the playoffs the previous two seasons, are not led by a first-year head coach and have not appeared on the program in the last 10 years are selected.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That criteria appears to have gone out the proverbial window this season, as both the Chargers and Rams made the playoffs in 2018, with the Rams advancing all the way to the Super Bowl.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, it’s still an open question whether training camps will actually happen at all in 2020 as the sports world continues to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If the season proceeds as planned, however, the Rams and Chargers should deliver a unique viewing experience as they move into their new home at Sofi Stadium.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Last year,&nbsp;“Hard Knocks” followed the then-Oakland Raiders’ drama-filled camp as they welcomed former Steelers receiver Antonio Brown in an offseason trade. Brown ended up forcing his way off the team after a controversy involving his helmet.&nbsp;</p>
