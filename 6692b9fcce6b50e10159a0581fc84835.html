<h1>Bowers prosecutors push back at defense bid for jury info</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Federal prosecutors, in court filings late Friday evening, pushed back against demands by lawyers for Robert Bowers for information on the grand jury that indicted him in the Tree of Life massacre, and for data on the potential trial jury.</p>
<p>In a series of four filings responding to defense demands,&nbsp;U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and prosecutors in his office also took the opportunity to reiterate their hope for a trial date in 2020,&nbsp;“to protect the victims’ rights and to ensure justice.”</p>
<p>Mr. Bowers, 47, faces&nbsp;63 counts of civil rights and firearms offenses in relation to the Oct. 27, 2018, attack on the Tree of Life synagogue, in which 11 worshipers were killed. In August, federal prosecutors filed a&nbsp;Notice of Intent to Seek the Death Penalty.</p>
<p>The defense, according to the prosecution filings, wants, among many other things, the names of the grand jurors and the&nbsp;“juror qualification and summons forms for persons summoned to potentially become [grand or trial] jurors in this case.” The prosecution has concluded that the defense plans to use that information to challenge jury selection.</p>
<p>The prosecution, citing information from the Clerk of Court, responded that juror forms&nbsp;“are replete with personal identifying information” that should not be disclosed.</p>
<p>The prosecution also objected to defense requests for more information on testimony before the grand jury by first responders, information gleaned from interviews with Mr. Bowers’ family members, and the effects of the shootings on the victims, among other things.</p>
<p>"He is not entitled to an exact accounting of the specific evidence that the United States will present to prove each element, and the law is clear that no such accounting is required in order to prepare a defense,” the prosecutors wrote.</p>
<p>According to their filings, the prosecutors have given the defense 24 rounds of discovery, including Mr. Bowers’&nbsp;Gab.com postings, emails, images of cell phones and computers, thousands of crime scene and search warrant photographs and many reports of statements and interviews.</p>
<p>The prosecution noted that records of Mr. Bowers’ electronic communications many not be complete.&nbsp;"On October 27, 2018, prior to his commission of the charged crimes, the defendant utilized encrypted operating systems and applications and made efforts to erase the contents of his electronic devices,” they wrote. “As a result, the United States was unable to retrieve substantive information from his electronic devices."</p>
<p>Mr. Bowers’ defense team could not immediately be reached for comment.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Donetta Ambrose has not scheduled the case for trial, saying she wants to wait until all motions are resolved.</p>
