<h1>Allegheny College says it will reopen this fall</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Allegheny College plans to re-open for on-campus living and instruction in the fall after an extensive review of strategies to do so safely during the COVID-19 pandemic, officials announced Thursday.</p>
<p>Students and employees were notified of the decision Thursday morning in a message from president Hilary Link.</p>
<p>“We have undertaken a comprehensive&nbsp;and extensively detailed planning process that will continue throughout the fall, including&nbsp;consultation of a wide array of public health and pandemic experts, to be able to create as safe an&nbsp;environment as possible on campus,” Ms. Link said. “We fundamentally believe that the fact-driven, innovative&nbsp;and collaborative teaching, learning and thinking for which Allegheny is known is needed more&nbsp;than ever to address such challenging global events.”</p>
<p>In recent weeks, a number of colleges and universities have announced with varying degrees of specificity their intent to bring students back to campus for some form of in-person instruction.</p>
<p>Since April, efforts at Allegheny have been underway to assess potential health and safety impacts to the campus and to those in Meadville and Crawford County. A range of individuals were consulted in areas including epidemiology, medicine, global health, governmental and alumni, officials said.</p>
<p>Allegheny College is a national liberal arts college that enrolls about 1,800 students, all of whom are in housing on or near its Meadville campus.</p>
<p>School officials said they are evaluating “residence hall occupancy, dining hall protocols, classroom&nbsp;occupancy, mitigation and containment strategies such as testing, isolation and contact tracing,&nbsp;and behavioral and travel modifications” to promote health and safety during the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p>“As committed as we are to resume on-campus living and learning, and as confident as we are&nbsp;that we have a number of unique factors that allow us to do so safely, our return to campus must&nbsp;factor in realistic contingencies for the college to be nimble and responsive to ever-changing&nbsp;global health circumstances,” Ms. Link said.</p>
