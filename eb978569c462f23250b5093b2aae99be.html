<h1>City schools considering longer shutdown, cancellation of graduation ceremonies</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools are making preparations in case the district or the state decides to keep schools closed beyond the initial two-week period amid the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Schools in the city and elsewhere have been providing meals during the shutdown, but many districts, including Pittsburgh Public, have not required continued instruction for students.</p>
<p>That could change if the shutdown is extended, which Pittsburgh Public Schools spokeswoman Ebony Pugh said the district was&nbsp;“contemplating.”</p>
<p>Ms. Pugh said the district will have to receive direction from the state Department of Education on certain matters, including what will be required of students who are eligible to graduate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Also&nbsp;“under consideration,” Ms. Pugh said, is the cancellation of high school commencement ceremonies — scheduled for June 13 and 14 — as well as other major events toward the end of the school year.</p>
<p>“It’s definitely on our radar that we have multiple large events at the end of the year,” she said.</p>
<p>Numerous universities across the country, <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/education/2020/03/18/Penn-State-commencement-Jordan-Center-COVID19-coronavirus-Barron-Beaver-Fayette-New-Kensington/stories/202003180100" target="_blank">including the University of Pittsburgh and Penn State University</a>, have already announced postponements to their spring commencement ceremonies.&nbsp;</p>
