<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>THE SCOOP</strong></span></p>
<p>Not since Jeannette’s Terrelle Pryor has the WPIAL had an athlete as highly recruited in football and basketball. Gallagher is considered one of the top 50 sophomores in the country in both sports. An all-conference wide receiver and defensive back as a freshman, Gallagher is making the move to quarterback this season, giving Laurel Highlands a dynamic dual-threat. His basketball exploits are well known. As a freshman, he averaged 22.7 points a game, was named first-team all-state, and led Laurel Highlands to its first WPIAL title since 1968. In the championship, he made two free throws with 4.8 seconds left to give the Mustangs a 52-51 win.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>COLLEGE TALK</strong></span></p>
<p>Gallagher has football offers from Pitt, Penn State, West Virginia and Michigan. Many schools are recruiting him to play receiver. He holds basketball offers from Pitt, Illinois and Rhode Island.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>OUR QUESTIONS, HIS ANSWERS</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Do you get the Terrelle Pryor comparisons much?</strong> I’ve known TP since I was younger. I don’t know if it was his cousin or a good friend of the family, but he played on my baseball team. (Terrelle) gave me his Jeannette helmet when I was a little kid. I’ve followed him for a long time.</p>
<p><strong>You spent some time with him last month. What was that like?</strong> It was great. He gave me a lot of advice that I’ll need through my process and setting goals. I really needed that. He gave me a better look at things.</p>
<p><strong>What advice did he give you?</strong> To be a leader, outwork people and be the voice of the team.</p>
<p><strong>What should people expect out of Laurel Highlands this season?</strong> I think we’re a very athletic team. The line is doing a great job of getting better. Everyone is working hard. I think Laurel Highlands is going to do something in football and surprise people just like we did in basketball.</p>
<p><strong>That WPIAL championship win. How many times have you watched the replay?</strong> Man, I’d probably say 20-30 times. It’s exciting every time I watch it.</p>
<p><strong>You were the first freshman ever picked to the Post-Gazette’s Fabulous 5 team. What did that mean to you?</strong> It’s definitely a blessing and a huge expectation. Honestly, I didn’t know anything about the Fab 5 until eighth grade. It’s a huge thing in Western Pa. Going into my ninth-grade year, our goal wasn’t to win the WPIAL title. It was just to make the playoffs. Just doing that and surprising a lot of people was a blessing.</p>
<p><strong>If you were to play another fall sport, which one would it be?</strong> I’d say probably soccer because I wouldn’t be that good at cross country.</p>
<p><strong>You have to make a decision today of what sport you’re playing in college. What’s your choice?</strong> If the decision was right now and they told me I could do both, I’d do both.</p>
<p><strong>One school that hasn’t offered you that you really hope does?</strong> Well, for football, I was an Ohio State fan when I was younger. I think that would be big for my family. But at the end of the day, I’m going to do what’s best for me. I don’t want people to think I’m going to go there if they offer me. For basketball, my dad is a huge Kentucky fan, so that would be great.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration-line: underline;"><strong>AND FINALLY</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>You used to be AAU teammates with Bronny James. Do you still stay in touch?</strong> We talk a little bit. It’s just hard with him being out in the big world.</p>
<p><strong>Are you a big Lakers fan?</strong> I’m a big LeBron fan. My favorite NBA team is actually the Kings. I’m a big De'Aaron Fox fan. And if I said I rooted for the Lakers, people would say I was a bandwagon fan.</p>
