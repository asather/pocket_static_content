<h1>Ex-PNC employee admits to robbing multiple PNC branches with accomplice</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A former PNC Bank employee admitted to a federal judge on Tuesday that she carried out a series of armed robberies at PNC branches with a friend who had once worked with her as a home health aide.</p>
<p>Jasmine Parrish, 30, of Pittsburgh, pleaded guilty to five counts related to bank robberies in West Mifflin, McCandless, Penn Hills and Bloomfield that yielded nearly $100,000.</p>
<p>She and Donna Poremski had initially been charged in state court last year but the case was adopted by the U.S. attorney's office and a grand jury indicted both in January 2019.</p>
<p>The case is a relatively rare example of women carrying out armed bank robberies; the vast majority of bank holdups, especially those involving guns, are the work of men.</p>
<p>Authorities said that between January 2018 and Nov. 21, 2018, the pair held up PNC branches on Clairton Boulevard in West Mifflin, McKnight Road in McCandless, Rodi Road in Penn Hills and Liberty Avenue in Bloomfield.</p>
<p>Parrish admitted that she and Ms. Poremski conspired to rob the first three locations. She also admitted that she drove a female juvenile to Bloomfield and wrote a demand note for her to use to rob the PNC on Liberty Avenue there on Nov. 21, 2018.</p>
<p>During the first heist of the West Mifflin PNC on June 23, Parrish and Ms. Poremski tried to conceal their identities by dressing in Middle Eastern clothes, including wearing hijabs over their faces. Parrish also carried a cane and wore a surgeon's mask with a tube connected to an oxygen tank.</p>
<p>The two women walked up to a teller station and passed a demand note while threatening that they had a bomb. Surveillance footage also shows Ms. Poremski holding what appeared to be a gun. The two women ordered the tellers to empty their cash drawers and then forced them into the vault, where they were ordered to put money into a suitcase.</p>
<p>Parrish admitted that she and Ms. Poremski stole $61,124 in that robbery, an unusually large amount. Most bank robberies yield a few thousand dollars.</p>
<p>In the robberies in McCandless and Penn Hills, Parrish admitted that she walked in wearing a disguise to case the banks, after which she said Ms. Poremski robbed them.</p>
<p>In the McCandless holdup, Parrish carried a gun and demanded money from the tellers. Ms. Poremski then directed employees into the vault to put money in a bag. Parrish admitted that the two women got away with $35,500 in that robbery.</p>
<p>In the Penn Hills case, Parrish said that Ms. Poremski demanded money from the tellers and threatened to use a gun, although she never showed one. The women stole just $350 in that case.</p>
<p>In all, Parrish said, the pair stole $97,000 from the three banks. No money was stolen in the final robbery in Bloomfield, which was the bank where Parrish had previously worked. In that case, the juvenile passed the demand note that Parrish wrote for her but left before taking any money.</p>
<p>U.S. District Judge Nora Barry Fischer set sentencing for July 2.</p>
<p>The case against Ms. Poremski is pending.</p>
