<h1>Pitt is still learning how to navigate late-game situations like Saturday's loss at N.C. State</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>With fewer than four minutes to play Saturday in a game it had led by seven only a handful of minutes earlier, Pitt trailed NC State, 68-63. The Panthers had fallen behind in a game they once controlled and their chances at a win slipped with every elapsed second, but, with the ball and a manageable deficit, they still had a chance.</p>
<p>Handed an opportunity to get within a possession following a Wolfpack turnover, Xavier Johnson stood with the ball at the edge of the midcourt logo at PNC Arena. With teammate Eric Hamilton setting a screen, Johnson drove to his left. He got a few feet inside the 3-point arc, where, with a defender trailing him closely, he stepped back, created some space and hoisted up a shot while standing on the line. It hit off the backboard and then the back of the rim before ending up in the hands of an NC State player.</p>

<p>It was, by any measurement, a bad shot — a player shooting 26.7% on 2-point jumpers this season pulling up with 17 seconds remaining on the shot clock with a shot that could have been worth more points had he stepped back a foot or two. Johnson’s misguided attempt at rallying his team isn’t why Pitt lost the game; there were too many other factors that had contributed to it and the sophomore point guard, with 13 points and just two turnovers in 39 minutes, was one of the reasons the Panthers were even in such a position.</p>
<p>What that play and that moment symbolized, though, was a team very much still learning how to navigate such late-game situations, when every shot, every pass, every dribble and every movement takes on an added meaning.</p>
<p>“We’re getting better,” Pitt coach Jeff Capel said. “We’re not there yet. We’re getting better. We still don’t have the experience, certainly the experience of winning. We’ve won some close games this year where we’ve had to make some free throws, make a shot, make some shots, get a few stops and all of those things. But we’ve also lost some in those situations. We have to continue to learn and get better. I think we’ve made some strides, but obviously we’re not where we want to be.”</p>
<p>Statistically, Pitt has fared better in close games this season. Last year, even as it endured a 13-game losing streak near the end of the season, it was largely competitive. It was within six points of major-conference opponents at the under-eight media timeout 10 times, but went just 2-8 in those contests. In nine such matchups this season, it is 6-3.</p>
<p>In the 13 games this season it has been leading or trailing by six points or fewer with four minutes remaining, it is 7-6. In those minutes, the Panthers are shooting 41.5% from the field, up from the 40.4% they’ve shot at all other times this season, committing about two turnovers and holding opponents to 40.9% shooting, compared to 42.7% in all other situations.</p>
<p>There are times, though, when late-game miscues or a failure to execute in those crucial final minutes has cost them dearly.</p>
<p>In a Jan. 14 loss to Louisville, they made just three of their 14 shots in the final four minutes of regulation and overtime, depriving them of a win in a game in which they led by seven with fewer than four minutes remaining. They had five turnovers in the final four minutes of a brutal Nov. 9 loss against Nicholls State. Most recently, in the NC State loss, it missed six of its final nine shots, with two of its makes coming in the final seven seconds after the game had effectively already been decided.</p>
<p>“I just think it’s something you have to learn how to do,” Capel said. “Winning is hard. It’s really hard. In our game, you have so many things that can impact winning or losing. Our game is really, really unforgiving. In our game, you can lose in more ways than in any other sport. I think there are so many things that can go into it.”</p>
<p>“Knowing how to win,” a sentiment expressed as a fact by any number of people, isn’t really a skill. Basketball, as Capel mentioned, is different than other sports in that it has so many moving, converging variables that makes chance less of a factor, but winning a vast majority of close games year after year isn’t sustainable. Take Washington, to use one example. Last season, the Huskies were 7-3 in games decided by six points or fewer on their way to a 27-9 record and an NCAA tournament appearance. This season, they’re 1-10 in such games and are 13-16 overall, despite adding a top-10 recruiting class and rising to the top 20 of the polls earlier this season. After finishing 13th in KenPom.com’s luck rating last year, they’re last among 353 Division teams this year.</p>
<p>There are things that aid a team in late-game situations, though, the kind of scenarios that can make a season a success or a disappointment. Perhaps the most important thing is experience. A team that has played together in those decisive situations, particularly in games with weightier consequences, is theoretically more comfortable in such moments. Pitt is still a team that, while not as young as it was last season, is still being carried largely by sophomores and a freshman that are prone to plays like Johnson’s shot. They’ve played in close games and done so together, but there have only been so many and few, if any, have been particularly meaningful.</p>
<p>In a team like Virginia, Capel sees a helpful example. Since starting the season 12-6, the Cavaliers have gone 9-1, including a 7-0 mark in games decided by six or fewer points (one of which came against Pitt). With several key players back from its national championship-winning squad of last season, Virginia has players who have experienced the game at its highest level. The Panthers have a long, long way until they get to that point, but losses like the one to the Wolfpack can ideally provide lessons that can be used when faced with such a situation again.</p>
<p>“I think because of experience, they can be calm, they can have poise, they can do all of those things because they’ve been through it,” Capel said. “Teams that have experience, teams that have experience in winning, they’ve learned how to win those close games. They understand maybe a little bit more the importance of every possession. They don’t get rattled. They don’t get sped up. They understand they’ve got to do it together. All of those things, I don’t think that’s a skill. I think that’s just learned experience together.”</p>
