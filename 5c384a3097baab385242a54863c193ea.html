<h1>White House lawyers proclaim Trump's innocence, question Democrats' impeachment motives</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — The White House legal team opened arguments on Saturday in President Donald Trump’s impeachment trial by saying Mr. Trump did “nothing wrong” and that House Democrats had “hid evidence” in the last three days that would have proved the president’s innocence.</p>
<p>“They have the burden of proof, and they have not come close to meeting it,” said White House Counsel Pat Cipollone at the start of a two-hour session on the floor of the U.S. Senate.</p>
<p>He portrayed the Democrats’ efforts to remove Mr. Trump from office less than a year before Americans go to the polls as “the most massive interference in an election in American history.”</p>
<p>Mr. Trump’s defense lawyers attempted to undercut arguments presented by a team of six House Democrats for nearly 24 hours over the last three days.</p>
<p>Democrats have asserted that Mr. Trump abused his power by freezing nearly $400 million in security aid to Ukraine and by withholding a coveted White House meeting in an attempt to pressure the American ally to dig up dirt on former Vice President Joe Biden. Mr. Biden is running against Mr. Trump in this year’s presidential election.</p>
<p>After a 12-week impeachment inquiry last fall, the House of Representatives voted in December to impeach Mr. Trump on two articles: abuse of power and obstruction of Congress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But Mr. Cipollone said on Saturday that conclusion was wrong, calling attention to parts of the summary of Mr. Trump’s July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky.</p>
<p>The summary, which the White House released last September, includes talks between the two leaders about broad anti-corruption efforts, and U.S. efforts to push Europe to do more to help Ukraine.</p>
<p>“Yes, you are absolutely right,” Mr. Zelensky told Mr. Trump, according to the White House summary of the call, read aloud by Mr. Cipollone. “Not only 100 percent, but actually 1,000 percent.”</p>
<p>Mr. Zelensky went on to tell Mr. Trump he had recently told German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron “they are not doing quite as much as they need to be doing” and that “I’m very grateful to you for that because the United States is doing quite a lot for Ukraine.”</p>
<p>The White House strategy attempted to rebut claim House Democrats’ claim that Mr. Trump cared only about his re-election prospects and that the president diverged from established U.S. foreign policy in temporarily freezing the aid to Ukraine.</p>
<p>Jay Sekulow, an attorney for Mr. Trump, pointed to several other instances in 2018 and 2019 that the Trump administration had decided to temporarily freeze or renegotiate military aid to other countries.</p>
<p>Aid was held in those cases, Mr. Sekulow said, due to concerns that those countries were not sharing enough of the burden in fighting corruption, terrorism or other problems identified by U.S. officials.</p>
<p>Aid was withheld to Afghanistan, Pakistan, Lebanon, El Salvador and South Korea, he said. Such decisions were routine practice, he said, pointing to sworn testimony by Fiona Hill, a Russia expert formerly at the National Security Council, and other witnesses called by House Democrats to testify in the impeachment inquiry.</p>
<p>Therefore, Mr. Trump acted within his right to question the nearly $400 million in military aid due to Ukraine, he said.</p>
<p>“To say the president of the United States was not concerned about burden-sharing, that he was not concerned about corruption in Ukraine ... the facts establish exactly the opposite,” Mr. Sekulow said.</p>
<p>White House lawyers also claimed Ukrainian officials could have felt no pressure because they were unaware of the hold on U.S. aid at the time of Mr. Zelensky’s July 25 phone call with Mr. Trump.</p>
<p>The aid to Ukraine was ultimately released and Mr. Zelensky got his meeting with Mr. Trump at the United Nations General Assembly meeting in Poland on Sept. 25.&nbsp;The importance to Mr. Zelensky of having that meeting in the Oval Office specifically was overblown by Democrats, Mr. Sekulow said.</p>
<p>The lawyers said Mr. Zelensky publicly described the July 25 phone conversation — while sitting beside Mr. Trump at the UN meeting — as a “good phone call” and “normal” and insisted that “nobody pushed him.”</p>
<p>The Democrats “think you can read minds,” Mr. Sekulow said. “I think you look at the words.”</p>
<p>That argument resonated with some Senate Republicans.</p>
<p>“Now you know the rest of the story,” Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., told reporters after the session concluded. The defense team exposed, Mr. Lankford said, the Democrats’ case relied on “innuendo” and “secret motivations and presumptions” instead of facts.</p>
<p>By presenting a different view of what witnesses said, the White House strategy could complicate a looming fight over whether the Senate should vote to call witnesses or issue subpoenas for documents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Senate Democrats have been demanding four key witnesses testify as part of the trial, a move Senate Republicans have resisted. On Tuesday, the Republican-controlled chamber voted down a slew of Democratic attempts, by repeated 53-47 party-line votes, to obtain more information.</p>
<p>The Senate will revisit the question as soon as Thursday.</p>
<p>Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters he thought “the case for witnesses and documents has gotten even stronger” with the White House defense. The lawyers’ insistence that Mr. Trump should have been able to cross-examine witnesses lends weight to the Democrats’ push to call them, he said.</p>
<p>Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said the lawyers’ focus on the July 25 phone call gives senators a limited view of Mr. Trump’s scheme.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In particular, Mr. Casey said, he wants to see a cable written by Bill Taylor, former acting U.S. ambassador to Ukraine, expressing concerns to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the president’s actions.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“A lot of the facts could be better considered if we had witnesses and documents,” Mr. Casey said in an interview after the session. “You often see the corruption after you’ve seen the totality of the evidence.”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., has questioned the need for witnesses. Mr. Toomey said on Saturday he would support a witness if they could resolve a disputed key fact — “the resolution of which would change my mind on my final conclusion.” &nbsp;</p>
<p>So far, he said, nothing in the case would benefit from witnesses. The White House team merely provided “more complete testimony,” rather than leaving key facts open to dispute, he explained.</p>
<p>“The Democrats left out all the elements that contradicts their narrative,” Mr. Toomey said.&nbsp;“It’s clear the impeachment managers intended to mislead with the witness testimony.”</p>
<p>One point of agreement between the two sides: the seriousness of the decision before the Senate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Cipollone, facing all 100 senators who are confined to their desks, said the president’s removal would result in unprecedented upheaval.</p>
<p>“They’re asking you to tear up all of the ballots across the country,” he said. “I don’t think they spent one minute of their 24 hours talking to you about the consequences of that to our country.”</p>
<p>The defense lawyers portrayed the House impeachment inquiry as a rushed, unfair process that denied the president due process rights.</p>
<p>“They had a timetable to meet, they wanted to have impeachment done by Christmas,”&nbsp;said Patrick F. Philbin, deputy counsel to the president.</p>
<p>Mr. Philbin also attacked the credibility of the whistleblower and faulted Democrats for not launching an inquiry into that person’s potential bias or political motive for filing the report.</p>
<p>He suggested Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. — who as chair of the House Intelligence Committee led the impeachment inquiry last fall — could have been colluding with that person.</p>
<p>Mr. Schiff “had a reason to not have that inquiry,” Mr. Philbin said.</p>
<p>After the session, Mr. Schiff called that notion&nbsp;“nonsense.”&nbsp;He said that he followed the law by referring the whistleblower to the intelligence community’s inspector general.</p>
<p>“When you don’t want yo talk about your client’s guilt, you attack the prosecutors,” Mr. Schiff said. “It’s a fairly elementary strategy.”</p>
<p>The Senate is scheduled to convene on Monday afternoon for more arguments by the White House team.</p>
