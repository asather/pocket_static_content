<h1>Through highs and lows, conditioning the key for Duquesne</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For a team that is 12-2 and off to its best start since 1971-72, Duquesne can be hard to figure out.</p>
<p>Take, for example, the Dukes’ last four games. They beat Saint Louis and Davidson this past week, two teams picked to finish near the top of the Atlantic 10. Before that, however, Duquesne took its only two losses of the season consecutively against UAB and Marshall — two teams the Dukes probably feel they should beat.</p>
<p>And none of that even mentions that Duquesne started the season on a 10-game winning streak that not many would have seen coming.</p>
<p>So it’s an odd team to project, even for coach Keith Dambrot.</p>
<p>“I think this team, if you check everything, has been consistently inconsistent,” Dambrot said Tuesday.&nbsp;“So we’ve shown that we can play with anybody in the world. We go to West Virginia, we play pretty good. We scrimmage Kent [State], we play pretty good. And then we’ve shown other times where we can play with anybody that’s not very good. So what we’re trying to do is just become more consistent, and we’ve become a little bit more consistent in practice, so my gut tells me we’ll be more consistent in the game.”</p>
<p>The key to Dambrot is conditioning.</p>
<p>Before the season began, when he discussed forwards Michael Hughes and Marcus Weathers, he talked about their conditioning being keys to success. On Tuesday, Dambrot was asked about Weathers’ success — he leads the team in scoring with 14.4 points per game and rebounding with 8.1 boards per game — and he credited Weathers’ improved conditioning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The same goes for the team as a whole.</p>
<p>“After we lost the two games, we worked really hard on our conditioning. We felt like we were a little disjointed, just in practice time, being in Pittsburgh,” Dambrot said. “We were gone so much that our conditioning slipped, so we worked on our physical conditioning and then our mental conditioning, which a lot of times, my dad used to tell me when I was a kid, when you’re tired, that means the other guy’s tired, and that’s what separates the men from the boys.</p>
<p>“... I don’t think we’re a soft team, but I think we could be mentally tougher, and I think we’ve kind of worked on both sides of it.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>While that can seem cliche, it makes sense given this particular team.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dukes have just seven players who average more than 12 minutes per game. To put it in some greater perspective, Duquesne gets 28.6% of its minutes from its bench, which ranks 242nd out of 353 teams in the country.</p>
<p>“Our bench has to improve,” Dambrot said.&nbsp;“I mean, we have to play more people. We have to get more contributions. We have to shoot the ball. I think we have to shoot the ball off our bench even better. I think if we shoot the ball, we become a very difficult team. If we don’t, we become a good team, but not a great team. I’ve said that all along.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>With that, if there’s a game in which the Dukes’ conditioning could become important, it’s Wednesday’s matchup with St. Joseph’s Brooklyn. The Hawks are 3-11 and 0-2 in conference play, but for all their faults, they play exceedingly fast.</p>
<p>The Hawks’ game plan is to speed their opponent up, get as many possessions out of the game and shoot a ton of 3s — nearly 50% of all their shots are 3-pointers.</p>
<p>There are flaws to St. Joe’s style, as is obvious with its record. It shoots a lot of 3s, but it hasn’t made a ton of them. Thus, the Hawks have scored more than 70 points just four times all season.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Duquesne needs to be ready to play at a higher tempo if the game calls for it, which lends credence to Dambrot’s emphasis on conditioning.</p>
<p>If they are able to keep their wind, the Dukes have a very good chance to take another step toward the success they want to have this season.&nbsp;</p>
