<h1>As merger progresses, Mylan easily tops analysts' forecast for Q4 earnings</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Net revenue for pharmaceutical giant Mylan N.V. rose 4% to $3.16 billion for the three months ending Dec. 31, up from $3.04 billion a year ago, topping analysts predictions for the quarter.</p>
<p>In its last full-year earnings report as a standalone company, Mylan, which has corporate offices in Cecil and Hertfordshire, England, reported total revenue of $3.19 billion for the three months, up 4% from a year ago.</p>
<p>Earnings per share for the period were 4 cents, which compared to 10 cents per share for the fourth quarter of 2018.</p>
<p>Thomson Reuters Corp. had forecast earnings of $1.28 for the quarter and Mylan beat the estimate by returning $1.40 per share. Net sales for each of the drugmaker’s units rose between 3% and 9% for the period.</p>
<p>Mylan shares closed Thursday down 86 cents at $18.68.</p>
<p>In a conference call with investors after the markets closed Thursday, CEO Heather Bresch said the company’s business exposure in China, where the coronavirus outbreak is centered, was limited.&nbsp;“However, given the global nature of our supply chain, operations and businesses, our results could potentially be impacted” in the coming months, she said.</p>
<p>Still, the company’s top 20 or 25 products are not dependent on China at all, Mylan President Rajiv Malik told investors.</p>
<p>The company is forecasting total revenue as a standalone company between $11.50 billion and $12.50 billion for 2020, a 4% increase from mid-2019. Mylan is no longer providing earnings per share guidance.</p>
<p>In July, Mylan announced plans to merge with Pfizer’s Upjohn unit, which includes off-patent, branded and generic business. The deal, which will create a company to be called Viatris, is expected to be completed by mid-2020, when Ms. Bresch, 50, the first female CEO of a Fortune 500 pharmaceutical company, will retire.</p>
