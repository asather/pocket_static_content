<p>The Baltimore Ravens announced Wednesday <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/ravens/bs-sp-ravens-season-ticket-deferrals-20200708-2qbm53ihcnetddwpx2b7phwfqi-story.html" target="_blank">they will limit capacity</a> to 14,000 at M&amp;T Bank Stadium, should the NFL allow fans this season. While the Steelers aren’t going that far yet, they are ready to say that any fans who might step into their stadium this year will do so wearing a mask.</p>
<p>“Our goal is to still have fans at Heinz Field this year with the understanding that social distancing, as well as all fans being required to wear masks, will play a role in the capacity to ensure a safe atmosphere,” team spokesman Burt Lauten said in a statement. “We will continue to work with the NFL and public health officials to finalize plans for fans to attend our home games.</p>
<p>“We are communicating with our season ticket holders to make them aware of the digital ticketing process we will employ this season at Heinz Field for a more flexible solution as we prepare for potential reduced capacity. We will continue the process of allowing our fans to opt out of their 2020 season tickets if they feel they are <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/steelers/2020/07/01/steelers-season-ticket-holders-covid-19-pandemic-options/stories/202007010114" target="_blank">uniquely affected by the current situation</a>.”</p>
<p>Season-ticket holders received an email Wednesday evening with more information about the opt-out process.</p>
<p>“At this point, we would like to make you aware that you have the option to apply for a full refund for the 2020 season while still retaining the ability to renew your season ticket location in 2021, and if applicable, any associated seat licenses,” the email reads.</p>
<p>From there, ticket holders can click to a screen that takes them to a refund application page, which includes&nbsp;“Reason(s) for Request to Place Season Ticket Account on Hold for the 2020 NFL Season Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic.”</p>
<p>“Please explain in detail below why you want to place your season ticket account on hold for the 2020 NFL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic,” the page reads. “Your explanation will not be shared with anybody outside of the Steelers’ organization.”</p>
<p>In the fine print, applicants must agree to certify that the information they provide is truthful and accurate; the Steelers are under no legal obligation to grant their request; and the team can sell or otherwise use their tickets for the 2020 season. Lastly, they can choose either to have their 2020 payment refunded or applied to 2021.&nbsp;</p>
