<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 09.30.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, we're going to start our chat in just a few minutes so get those questions ready.... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Ok, here we go....</p>
<p><strong>Northside Jim</strong>: O-Line looks much improved from last year, however the threat of the deep passing game is opening running lanes as well. What say you? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The threat of the deep passing game is always there with 7 back. That makes everybody look better.</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed</strong>: With DJ most likely out this week, more offensive snaps for Claypool &amp; McCloud? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Claypool from scrimmage, McCloud on special teams.</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed</strong>: Do you enjoy coach's press conference better via zoom or live? As a fan, I enjoy it better via zoom because you now can actually hear the questions being asked a lot clearer. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Well, there you go Ed. After 5 weeks of zoom, I can tell you there is not a lot to like about it. But that's where we are and that's the way we have to roll.</p>
<p><strong>Joe P</strong>: Do you think there will be fans for The Steelers home games in October? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Definitely.</p>
<p><strong>Ray-ray</strong>: Why is it so difficult to not block in the back on kicks and punts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Guys are trying to make plays against other guys they are running to keep up with. It happens.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - Run game looked better against the Titans. Why was it more effective in your opinion? Opponent, OL, better mix of play calls, better use of 3 RBs? Likely combo of these factors..so what would you put as #1? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm guessing you meant Texans. Part of it was the opponent. They had been allowing nearly 200 yards a game rushing so you had to think there were going to be opportunities to run the ball. But I'm sure there were some of those other factors as well</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Why is Jaylen Samuels on the roster and why is he getting a red zone carry on third and one? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He's on the roster because he's the best pass-catcher of the RBs, but if you're going to run on 3rd-and-1 use one of your other backs. I'm sure the thinking was, 'We'll fool 'em. They'll think it's a pass cause 38 is in the game and we'll cross' em up with a run.'</p>
<p><strong>Guest</strong>: Did Vince Williams play fewer snaps in the second half and did that contribute to the improved defensive play? I don’t think he should be on the field on second or third down unless it’s very short yardage. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: The improved defensive plays comes from Vince Williams being in the game, not out of the game</p>
<p><strong>Hilton</strong>: What are you hearing is the most likely scenario for .sunday's game? I heard an option as moving to .tuesday. How's that fair? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Anything is possible. Wouldn't be surprised if the game was moved to Monday night to give the Titans an extra day. I know this, the league wants to play the game at its scheduled time, if at all possible</p>
<p><strong>Kyle</strong>: Steelers don't have a receiver in the top 40 in the league. Do you like the use everyone mode or the old throw it to AB 20 times a game? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Doesn't bother me either way. Shouldn't bother you or anyone else either when they're 3-0.</p>
<p><strong>Big Ed</strong>: GM Gerry! Do you expect a similar defensive game plan vs the titans as in the steelers opener verse the giants? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think the difference is the Titans try to do more than just use Henry. But they better slow him or its going to be a long day.</p>
<p><strong>Chuks</strong>: How was Chuks so successful against JJ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Chuks stood his ground, got good leverage and uses his hands well</p>
<p><strong>Kevin</strong>: What changes did Pitt's D make from the 1st half to the 2nd! From dud D to dominant D. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It was in their coverage. They took away that crossing route that was so open in the first half by disrupting Texans' bunch formation at the line of scrimmage, not letting them get in their routes.</p>
<p><strong>Angela</strong>: Any word on Johnson in the protocol. Ray Ray doesn't look too bad if he has to fill in on special teams but doesn't catch passes. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Too early to know.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa</strong>: Edmunds still doesn't have a turnover. Are you expecting Pitt to decline his option year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They still have another year to make that decision.</p>
<p><strong>Lance</strong>: Has McFarland jumped the line to backup Conners? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is going to get more playing time, that's for sure. But I think it depends on the type of defenses they're facing which back they think might be more effective in certain situations.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Greetings Jerry. I live outside of the 412 area and did not get to see Titans game - only highlights. Overall, it seems like coverage teams have improved this year despite loss of some key contributors from last year's team New talent infusion that brings more speed to the equation seems to have addressed an concerns in this area. Have you seen improvement from your seat as well on coverage teams? Also, how did Ray Ray look on punts - catch it clean? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: McCloud was more than fine on punts. A good replacement for DJ, who I think is one of the best in the league. The coverage teams have been very good. More speed has been a reason, yes.</p>
<p><strong>Cameron</strong>: With .johnson most likely out, do the .steelers go more with .ebron and McDonald? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't know that's the reason they used the TEs more against Texans, and might against Titans. If DJ can't play, that will directly affect James Washington and Chase Claypool. They will see more time.</p>
<p><strong>Melanie</strong>: Tuitt seemed to have a good game .sunday. Is he fully back from his injury last year now? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: He is fully back.</p>
<p><strong>Ron</strong>: Thoughts on Feiler at left guard? That Seems to be the Pitt's O-line weakness. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: My thoughts aren't the same as yours.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Bush seems to struggle in pass coverage vs te's and rb's. Is there another option for Pitt? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Next</p>
<p><strong>Phil</strong>: Thoughts on the call to not attempt the 50 plus he fg to go up 10 and seal the win with a pass. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I had no problem with any of the decision-making against the Texans.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: Did the Chiefs show a gameplan on Monday that the Steelers can replicate to beat the Ravens? Also, Patrick Mahomes is a true joy to watch. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yeah, shut down Lamar Jackson and getting a 14-point lead. And yes he is. That's the difference between KC and Ravens. If KC gets behind by 14 or even 21, no problem. Mahomes can bring you back quickly with his arm. Not the case with Jackson if he has to throw all the time. Don't get me wrong, I really like Jackson. I think he's darn near unstoppable, especially when the Ravens have the lead.</p>
<p><strong>Mary</strong>: Thoughts onPitt continuing to throw on 3 rd and 4th and 1's? Snell seems built for that role. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Whatever it takes. And I saw Snell get stuffed once.</p>
<p><strong>Amy</strong>: Tomlin continues to blow challenges and waste timeouts, especially in the 2nd half. Any chance they change their replay guy out mid-season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think so. I thought that was a good challenge, BTW. Looked like Ben got the stretch for the first down.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Hi Gerry - Would be interested to know your process for your weekly picks? Do you watch alot of tape? Do you leverage views of others? What is your process? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I try to pay attention to what each team does, see how the offense and defense performed. I don't watch tape. Not enough time in the day. Or the inclination to do so.</p>
<p><strong>Melissa</strong>: Ray-Ray seems better on kickoff returns than Johnson. Will he keep that job when Johnson's recovered? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: McCloud is the primary kick returner. He is really good at it -- top speed and one cut. No jukes or hesitation.</p>
<p><strong>Larry</strong>: What more can be done to get fans to home games! Having 10k would help a lot against the better afc teams. Titans will have fans vs Pitt <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Check with the governor</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Fichtner's playcalling was better against the Texans, but I don't understand why the steelers always run with the ball in the second down and 17 as exemple like Sunday ... It is afterwards almost impossible to have a first down in the 3rd down <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It's all part of trying to outwit the other guy</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Bobby</strong>: So who technically is the backup QB ? Is it Rudolph ? Dobbs ? Hodges ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: There is no technicality about it. Rudolph is the No. 2 QB. Duck is on the practice squad.</p>
<p><strong>Marty keller</strong>: Who will replace tj watt against the titans <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: TJ is fine. It's his brother Derek who might not play.</p>
<p><strong>Questfor7</strong>: I’m a little concerned about the pass defense the first 3 games. Particularly, in the first half. Seems like Jones, Driskell and Watson had little trouble finding open receivers. Do you attribute this to poor pregame preparation but nice in game adjustments? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think the defense has done a good job of preparing (Giants) and adjusting (Broncos and Texans). I would suggest you not worry too much about the pass defense.</p>
<p><strong>RJT</strong>: The secondary has received criticism. I personally thought that their play was okay and their exposure was a byproduct of blitzing. However I started to worry a bit after the first half of the Texans game. But after the second half I walked away feeling pretty good about the secondary. What day you? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I say contrast your view with the previous question. I also say your view is more to the correct point.</p>
<p><strong>Nitro</strong>: Gerry - Why don't the Titans practice at a local college facility if there are worries about the building? What does the NFL dictate from a building perspective when it comes to COVID? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They are not allowed to do that. Part of the NFL protocol. They are not allowed to have "in-person" activities anywhere -- either their facility or some other place -- through Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Mike</strong>: Do you think the steelers are going to continue to be careful with Conner as in the last game(He played 66% of the snap)?...I hope since it's important that he stays healthy <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don't think trying to keep him healthy is the reason. The reason is more giving other players like Snell (Broncos) and McFarland (Texans) a chance to make some plays</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats Gerry. Dumb question but if the Titans shut down the facility how do they practice and if they don't how is that fair? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don't and those are the rules they've been told about since this whole thing happened. Maybe the person who contracted the virus, and apparently brought it to others, should have been more dilligent about what he does or where he goes.</p>
<p><strong>Emilio</strong>: Wouldn't it be appropriate sportsmanship for the Steelers not to have in person training for the Titans game? To not have an unfair, unearned advantage? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Now that one might just go to the top of all-time list!!</p>
<p><strong>elcid97</strong>: With our scheme/talent/personnel is there anything we take from the Chiefs' success against Lamar on Monday night? It kinda seemed like the Ravens beat themselves on offense in a lot of ways are there takeaways for Tomlin and Butler? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I can promise you this, the Steelers spent their offseason studying ways to limit/stop Lamar Jackson. They've been pretty good about ti so far anyway.</p>
<p><strong>just wonderin</strong>: how did Vince Williams end up in coverage on Brandin Cooks? Seems like that's a bad mistake. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Agreed. A week earlier he was matched against Jerry Jeudy. That's the game the Steelers are taking with him in the game. And opponents are trying to create those mismatches with him, believe me. But those were extreme mismatches.</p>
<p><strong>PhilCanada</strong>: Love the chats, Gerry. This draft class is showing some real promise. Claypool, Highsmith McFarland, Dotson... quite the start! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes it is. For having only six picks, not bad.</p>
<p><strong>Steeler in Virginia</strong>: I really like how many weapons this team has and how the ball was spread around so much against the Texans. But sometimes a team needs a star to step up and dominate when it matters most. After three games, who is that WR/RB for this team in your opinion? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That would be 7 and 19. Haven't you noticed that connection again?</p>
<p><strong>Uncle Bobby</strong>: Was Ryan Switzer signed by anyone ? He was a legend in these parts ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not yet. He's still out there, far as I know</p>
<p><strong>NC Steel</strong>: Gerry, Do you agree that Decastro is the best OL on the team, and by a lot? His return seemed to energize the running game which we so needed. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I'm not sure I would say that. That whole line is built around Pouncey. You can make an argument for DeCastro, for sure though. He's very good. A pro's pro. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, we're out of time. have to run. Let's try it again next week.</p>
