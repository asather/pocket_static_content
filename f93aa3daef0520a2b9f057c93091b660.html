<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., on Thursday asked the Trump administration to work with grocery stores to speed up deliveries to people enrolled in food stamps amid the COVID-19 pandemic, calling on the U.S. Department of Agriculture to ensure grocers are not denying people from making online orders.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey, in a letter sent to Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue and five&nbsp;grocery and retail trade associations, said a constituent called his office to say he was denied from buying groceries online because he was enrolled in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.</p>
<p>“Traveling to a grocery store during this crisis is simply not possible for many SNAP participants, including seniors, immunocompromised individuals, families who lack reliable transportation and individuals with disabilities,” Mr. Casey wrote in the letter.</p>
<p>“All retailers are able to offer online ordering, and this option must be made available for SNAP&nbsp;participants as well,” he said. That can be done by processing a SNAP beneficiary’s card either at the time of pickup from&nbsp;the store or when the groceries are delivered to them, Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>“We must do everything we can to address these barriers by leveraging existing flexibilities and partnering with the retailers who have the ability to provide much needed grocery delivery services to all who need it,” he wrote.</p>
<p>Also on Thursday, Mr. Casey held a digital town hall with constituents through Facebook Live, where he fielded questions for nearly an hour.</p>
<p>He said during the live video there are still not enough tests for the novel coronavirus.&nbsp;“There was a real breakdown, a real failure by federal agencies to get the tests out,” Mr. Casey said. “There are still not enough nationwide.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said he was focused on helping craft the third economic package to address the economic downturn and health care strains. That bill, which could total $1.2 trillion, could include a temporary ban on foreclosures and also an emergency open enrollment period — maybe 30 days long — for people to sign up for health care plans on the government exchanges.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said he received a question from a constituent in northwestern Pennsylvania who faced a shortage of ventilators and other medical supplies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“This bill has to meet those basic needs,” he said.&nbsp;“Democrats in the Senate want a Marshall Plan,” he said, referring to the spending package passed by Congress to rebuild Europe after World War II.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey has also called on protections for seniors and people with disabilities. He plans to announce measures Friday to protect children.</p>
