<h1>Pitt AD Heather Lyke on fall football: 'Trends ... are not where we want to be'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke retreated to a quiet room in the clubhouse at Laurel Valley Golf Club on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>After watching Dan Marino, Jimbo Covert and Pitt coaches tee off at the Panthers’ annual outing, Lyke opened Zoom to a virtual room full of reporters. And before anyone had a chance to ask for themselves, Lyke addressed the “gazillion dollar question” that former players and donors asked her earlier that morning: Will there be a fall football season?</p>
<p>“The trends in our country are not where we want to be,” Lyke said of the COVID-19 pandemic. “Right now, we’re just not in an ideal spot. ... I’m an optimistic person, but I wouldn’t say I’m overly confident that we are going to (have football in the fall).”</p>
<p>That’s been the growing fear nationally, too. But as everyone waits for a definitive decision on the season, Pitt remains “in the mode of returning to play,” Lyke said.</p>
<p>On Friday, the Panthers will begin walkthroughs and meetings with the coaching staff, officially starting the six-week preseason schedule approved by the NCAA in June. The next step would be a four-week training camp beginning on Aug. 7 — though Lyke said she’s “not optimistic” that will be a traditional camp by any means, with 100-plus players unlikely to practice together.</p>
<p>From mid-June up until this point, the Panthers have been conducting involuntary workouts with only the team’s strength and conditioning staff. Pitt welcomed players back to campus June 8, where they quarantined for 14 days before kicking things off at the South Side facility. Pitt started with workout sessions of a maximum of 10 players, a limit that has since been loosened to 25 players. The program planned to expand workouts to 50 players, but Gov. Tom Wolf’s restrictions on Allegheny County due to escalating positive cases nixed that.</p>
<p>Unlike Ohio State, North Carolina and other schools across the country, Lyke said Pitt has not needed to pause its involuntary workouts at any point. “Knock on wood,” the athletic director added. “So far, we have not had to contemplate that.”</p>
<p>However, contrary to that of Clemson, Notre Dame, Penn State, Oklahoma and other Power Five programs, Pitt football does not publicly report or announce its COVID-19 testing results. When asked how many tests have been administered, Lyke said she didn’t have a “running count.” Players were evaluated during their initial 14-day quarantine, and those who were symptomatic were tested, with any asymptomatic players having the option for a nasal swab or antibody test.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Lyke added that athletes who are on campus have not been asked to sign a COVID-19 waiver or pledge. In addition, any athlete who elects not to play in 2020-21 due to coronavirus concerns will have their scholarships honored by the university, a team spokesman confirmed two weeks ago.</p>
<p>“The safety of what we’re doing is paramount,” Lyke said. “We’d love to have everyone back and things to be a new normal. But we’re taking it day by day.”</p>
<p><strong>Fans in the stands?</strong></p>
<p>If — and it seems like a big if at this point — there is college football in the fall, the next natural question is whether or not there will be anyone in the seats to watch.</p>
<p>The Pennsylvania Department of Health said last week that a number of professional and college sports teams submitted plans to have fans in the stands. When reached for comment through a team spokesman, Pitt offered the following response: “We are working in concert with the Steelers and Heinz Field on continued communications with the governor’s office.”</p>
<p>Lyke confirmed that on Thursday, saying Pitt and the Steelers have worked on a plan for what a socially distanced Heinz Field would look like. The athletic director said that, based on projections, Heinz Field could accommodate 15,000 to 20,000 socially distanced spectators.</p>
<p>But don’t get your hopes up, ticket holders.</p>
<p>“We are <em>steps</em> away from any chance of doing that at this point in time,” Lyke said. “Our No. 1 priority is trying to focus on our team and our student-athletes and the schedule and see if we can really manage through that piece of it to start.”</p>
<p><strong>No cuts</strong></p>
<p>At this point, Pitt athletics has not furloughed anyone, Lyke said. The department’s administrators and coaches have not been asked by university chancellor Patrick Gallagher to take any pay deductions. And Pitt’s varsity sports? They’re all safe for now, too.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Stanford announced it would cut 11 varsity sports due to financial ramifications caused by the pandemic. Connecticut eliminated four teams in June as a money-saving measure. And Cincinnati axed men’s soccer back in March.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cutting sports has become somewhat of a trend in recent months.&nbsp;But Lyke said she does not anticipate losing any of Pitt’s 19 sports.</p>
<p>“Really fortunately, we are not in a position at all to make those tough, tough decisions,” Lyke said. “Our university has been extraordinarily supportive. Our board of trustees has been equally supportive of the value that athletics brings to Pitt. ... Fortunately, we’re in a really good position that the university is very financially sound and making wise decisions with regards to finances moving forward.”</p>
<p><strong>Keeping options open</strong></p>
<p>A college football season, should it come to fruition, would look and feel pretty different.</p>
<p>The Big Ten and Pac-12 already committed to a conference-only slate in the fall. Stadium’s Brett McMurphy reported shortly after the Big Ten’s announcement that the ACC is expected to do the same, though the conference has yet to make a final decision on its fall slate.</p>
<p>Lyke said ACC commissioner John Swofford and the conference’s athletic directors have discussed “every iteration you could come up with” in regards to playing football.</p>
<p>A conference-only schedule? Yep. Geographic pods to limit travel? Mhmm. A spring season? Absolutely on the table.</p>
<p>Lyke said while Pitt could “definitely manage” a spring season, it would be a logistical challenge for everyone involved, especially other schools that share fields and facilities. The notion of playing in pods — say Pitt gets a home-and-home series with Syracuse, Boston College, Louisville and Notre Dame — could, theoretically, save on travel expenses if teams decide to bus to games instead of charter flights. Of course, the root of that idea stems from a conference-only approach, in which the ACC can regulate testing protocols and adjust to potential postponements with greater flexibility.</p>
<p>Lyke didn’t rule out non-conference games in 2020, however unlikely. She’s been in touch with officials from all four scheduled non-conference opponents — Miami (Ohio), Marshall, Richmond and Notre Dame — and noted that playing any of those schools would be contingent upon the opponent adhering to the ACC’s COVID-19 protocols prior to taking the field.</p>
<p>That probably wouldn’t be an issue for Notre Dame, considering the Irish have been linked to joining the ACC for the 2020 season. Richmond, meanwhile, won’t face Pitt on Sept. 19 at Heinz Field after the Colonial Athletic Association canceled fall sports. The CAA will allow its teams to independently schedule games, but Richmond’s entire football schedule on its official website reads: “Canceled.”</p>
<p><strong>Near future</strong></p>
<p>The NCAA’s Board of Governors will reportedly meet Friday, during which it could cancel fall sports championships. This would nix the Football Championship Subdivision (FCS) playoffs, among other competitions.</p>
<p>Since it is not administered by the NCAA, that potential decision wouldn’t affect the College Football Playoff, and the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) teams could stage a season. Still, athletic directors across the country, including Lyke, are urging patience from the board — fearful of what might come next.</p>
<p>“There’s some hope that, you know, let’s wait and try and assess things as much as possible,” Lyke said. “A month ago, you might’ve said, ‘Hey, we’re ready.’ We were all trending down. The numbers were going down everywhere, and then suddenly, three or four weeks later, we’re setting record numbers across the southern states. I think it’s so hard to predict.</p>
<p>“So the longer they can wait, I think everyone’s a little more hopeful that they wait to really cancel things. Maybe it does change. Maybe the trend does go in a different direction. But I don’t know honestly what they’re going to do. And if they do cancel fall championships, it’s a domino to how do we manage football? And what do we do from there?”</p>
