<h1>Mt. Lebanon boys basketball takes down Upper St. Clair despite short blackout in gym</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just over two minutes into the third quarter Tuesday, the lights went out in Mt. Lebanon’s gym.</p>
<p>“Somebody, a little kid probably, got their fingers on [an outlet] and was pushing on the buttons,” Mt. Lebanon coach Joe David said.</p>
<p>Soon after, the lights went out on Upper St. Clair’s 10-game winning streak.</p>
<p>Jake Hoffman scored 21 points to help No. 3 Mt. Lebanon defeat No. 5 Upper St. Clair, 63-56, in a showdown of arch rivals and two of the top teams in Class 6A.</p>
<p>With the win, its fifth in a row, Mt. Lebanon (11-3, 5-0) took over sole possession of first place in Section 2. Upper St. Clair (12-2, 4-1) lost for the first time since falling to Pine-Richland on Dec. 10.</p>
<p>It was a payback game for Mt. Lebanon, which was thumped by Upper St. Clair, 71-45, at home on senior night last season. It was the only section loss for a team that went on to win the WPIAL championship.</p>
<p>The seniors on that team have since graduated, but Hoffman and Blaine Gartley both started in that game. Hoffman said the group had not forgotten about it.</p>
<p>“Going in, we had the guys rally. We knew this would be a huge win for us. We knew we had to come out with a lot of energy,” Hoffman said.</p>
<p>Gartley scored 11 points Tuesday and fellow senior Joey King had 14.</p>
<p>Hoffman, a senior guard, has been terrific this season, averaging 22 points a game. He made two 3-pointers and scored 10 points in the first quarter to vault Mt. Lebanon to a 21-10 lead. The Blue Devils were 8 of 13 from the field.</p>
<p>But Upper St. Clair came out with a vengeance in the second quarter, going on a 10-0 run to pull within 21-20. Luke Gensler and Andrew Casey buried 3-pointers and Zack Kingseed scored a pair of baskets.</p>
<p>David then called a timeout to try to stop Upper St. Clair’s momentum.</p>
<p>“We really wanted to find Gensler and we let him free for some 3s,” David said. “It was a 10-0 run and we just weren’t executing. I think we did a better job on him in the second half. He’s a very nice player and you have to find him.”</p>
<p>Mt. Lebanon went on to outscore Upper St. Clair, 10-4, the rest of the half to take a 31-24 halftime lead.</p>
<p>There was 5:37 left in the third quarter when the lights went out and eventually started flickering. A delay of three or four minutes took place before David got them turned back on fully.</p>
<p>“I didn’t know I was the only one who knew how to control the lights in Mt. Lebanon,” David said, laughing.</p>
<p>Landon Rauch then scored to pull Upper St. Clair within five at 33-28, but that’s as close as the Panthers would get.</p>
<p>Gensler finished with five 3-pointers and 22 points. Rauch added 13 points, Kingseed 10 and Casey 9.</p>
<p>“We missed too many layups,” said Upper St. Clair coach Danny Holzer. “In the first half, we missed seven layups. The main part is they have some length and we had a hard time finishing inside, but if we make a couple of those early, we wouldn’t have gotten into that hole.”</p>
