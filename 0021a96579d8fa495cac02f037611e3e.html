<h1>WPIAL reaches verdict on incident during Leechburg-Propel Andrew Street basketball game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The WPIAL is content with actions taken by Leechburg and Propel Andrew Street after their boys basketball game last month was stopped in the final minute when the Propel Andrew Street coach pulled his team off the court.</p>
<p>The WPIAL had a hearing Monday with coaches and administrators from both schools after a Jan. 17 game at Leechburg was stopped with 46 seconds remaining. Propel Andrew Street coach Donnell Wilkins had received his second technical foul and was ejected from the game at that point. He then pulled his team off the court.</p>
<p>Propel Andrew Street administrators investigated allegations from a fan that a Leechburg fan made racial taunts at Wilkins during the game. The WPIAL decided to bring both schools in to hear about the situation.</p>
<p>“We listened to both schools and they both took a proactive approach to handling the situation, and taking steps about the future,” WPIAL associate executive director Amy Scheuneman said. “We accepted their actions.”</p>
<p>Scheuneman said the claim of a racial taunt could not be substantiated by Leechburg administrators or game officials.</p>
<p>Under PIAA and WPIAL rules, a coach who is ejected from a contest is ineligible to coach the next contest. Scheuneman said Propel Andrew Street also suspended Wilkins for one more game because he took his team off the court.</p>
<p>“The [racial taunt] claim came a day later from a spectator,” Scheuneman said. “This case is an example and a reminder to all schools that things should be addressed as they happen. We do not have an investigative body that can investigate a situation days after it happened.</p>
<p>“If something is going on at a game, it needs to be brought to the attention of the administrators that are present at the event so it can be handled in a timely fashion at the event.”</p>
