<p>General Electric Co. is closing its 3D research center in Findlay and transferring the work to Cincinnati due to the pandemic.</p>
<p>The closure of the GE Additive Pittsburgh facility will be conducted in phases through March 2021, the Boston, Mass.-based industrial giant said.</p>
<p>“Due to the unprecedented impact COVID-19 has had on our business and our ongoing efforts to streamline our operations, we are relocating our strategic print services business from Pittsburgh” to GE Additive Cincinnati, a spokesman said in an email Thursday. “The decision to relocate was difficult to make, particularly in the current environment.</p>
<p>“GE will provide impacted employees with comprehensive benefits packages, including transition support to new employment or other opportunities within locally based GE businesses, where appropriate,” he said.</p>
<p>He declined to disclose how many people work at the 125,000-square-foot facility, previously known as the GE Center for Additive Technology Advancement.</p>
<p>When the facility opened in 2016 promising at least 50 jobs, it was touted as a hub for developing new ways to use 3D printing and other so-called additive manufacturing technologies to design and make a wide variety of products, and for helping to make Pittsburgh a leader in advanced manufacturing.</p>
