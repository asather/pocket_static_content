<h1>Post-Gazette series wins major award, is sweepstakes winner in state contest</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s multistate investigation into sexual abuse among separatist Amish and Mennonite communities, reported in the “Coverings” series last year, has been awarded the G. Richard Dew Award in the Pennsylvania NewsMedia Association’s 2020 Keystone Media Awards contest.</p>
<p>The series started with a single email query to Post-Gazette religion editor Peter Smith asking the newspaper to look into the issue. Over the next six months, Mr. Smith, former Post-Gazette public safety reporter Shelly Bradbury and photographer Stephanie Strasburg did the research, met victims and reported on dozens of cases of childhood sexual abuse and criminal cover-up.</p>
<p>The Dew award is given to an individual or organization that has made an outstanding contribution to the community through articles that demonstrate improvement in the quality of community life, enhancement of public understanding of the role of the news media and journalistic responsiveness to matters of public interest.</p>
