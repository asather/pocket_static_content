<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An East Hills woman has been charged after her children — ages 2 and 3 — were found wandering alone earlier this week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Police were sent to a home in the 2300 block of East Hills Drive around 3:20 p.m. Tuesday after a Facebook video showed a stranger had found an unsupervised boy and girl&nbsp;walking around shoeless with minimal clothing on in the neighborhood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tevanna Keith, 22, was later identified as the mother of the toddlers and charged with two counts of endangering the welfare of a child.</p>
<p>A woman who found the kids Tuesday drove them to local a security office. Ms. Keith arrived and and “slapped the older child on the side of the head” before taking the children away, police said. An arrest warrant was issued for Ms. Keith on Tuesday night, and she was arrested the following day near her East Hills residence, police said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon her arrest, the children were found in good health with no injuries, police said.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing is set for March 25.</p>
