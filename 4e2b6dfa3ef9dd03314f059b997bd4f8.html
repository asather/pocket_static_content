<h1>Students living in part of Litchfield Tower B at Pitt are placed in quarantne</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The University of Pittsburgh has placed students living on three floors of its Litchfield B high rise under quarantine amid infections whose rate is causing concern on a campus that overall has reported relatively limited COVID-19 cases this fall.</p>
<p>The high rise is part of Litchfield Towers, a complex of three circular dorms rising above Fifth and Forbes avenues that collectively hold nearly 1,900 students, making it the largest residence location on the main Oakland campus. Officials as of Friday reported nine infections there in 10 days.</p>
<p>Litchfield B, at 22 stories, is the tallest of the three structures and <a href="https://www.pc.pitt.edu/housing-services/university-owned-housing/litchfield-tower-b" target="_blank">houses 769 mostly first-year students</a> in double rooms, according to the university’s web site. Pitt has reduced density in its dorms this fall to allow for social distancing, and each of the three floors now has 20 students.</p>
<p>“Students are not permitted to leave their room except to use the bathroom, to get a COVID test or for medical emergencies,” Pitt spokesman Patrick McMahon said Monday. “Meals are delivered daily.”</p>
<p>There have been no additional positive tests since the quarantine was put in place Friday evening. How long it remains will depend on results of testing taking place Monday.</p>
<p>Since Aug. 1, Pitt has logged 253 positive test results among students, of which 39 cases are active. Six new cases among students were reported since Wednesday.</p>
<p>This spring and summer, officials including Pitt Chancellor Patrick Gallagher stressed the need to react nimbly as infection rates on campus and in the city change, so the university can continue hosting students and offering a mix of remote and in-person classes.</p>
<p>“This is an example of our system working as we had hoped,” Mr. McMahon said. “We were able to respond quickly to these cases and take targeted mitigation and containment efforts, which we think will help us avert a larger problem.”</p>
<p>The three-floor quarantine part of mitigation efforts extending to the entire building, said David Seldin,&nbsp; assistant vice chancellor of communitions at Pitt.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“All other residents of Tower B have been asked to socialize only with pod mates or friends on their floor,” he explained.&nbsp;“All residents of Tower B are scheduled for COVID-19 testing.” The testing began at 9 a.m. Monday.</p>
<p>There was a reference to the Litchfield cases in a report that accompanied <a href="https://www.coronavirus.pitt.edu/healthy-community/campus-cases" target="_blank">Friday’s Pitt COVID-19 Dashboard update</a>, a report that indicated the rate of infections has been trending downward. The&nbsp;5-day moving average of positive cases per day went from 5.2 to 2.4 with six students testing positive since Wednesday.</p>
<p>“Although the overall number of cases have declined ... we have seen an increase in cases in Tower B,” according the report from Pitt’s medical response office. “We are proceeding with mitigation, testing and containment strategies — but we cannot test or investigate our way out of this pandemic.”</p>
<p>Pitt reported no new faculty of staff cases and said the 39 infected students are in isolation. The Oakland campus enrolls about 29,000 of Pitt’s 34,000 students.</p>
<p>Penn State University, meanwhile, said <a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">over the weekend </a>it will push back by a week the start of the spring semester in January, following other universities including Pitt. Spring break week has been removed from Penn State’s 15-week semester.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Friday, Penn State put total COVID-19 cases at 2,681, up from 2,124 a week earlier, an increase of 557 the last seven days.&nbsp;The 640 active cases include new positive results this week and others for which test results from a previous reporting period had been pending</p>
<p>Nearly all the cases are on the main University Park campus, with nearly 50,000 students.</p>
<p>Officials on public and private campuses across Pennsylvania and beyond have bulit into reopen plans various mitigation contingencies to curb the spread of the virus on a campuswide or targeted bases, including quarantining certain residences.</p>
<p>Last month, for instance, Gettysburg College asked its students to stay in their rooms for all but takeout meals, restroom breaks and COVID-19 testing, as tests revealed 32 infections out of 896 tested by the school with 2,600 students. The University of Conneticut took similar steps in September.</p>
<p><a href="https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html" target="_blank">About 210,000 Americans have died as of Monday </a>from the coronavirus, according to an interactive tracker from Johns Hopkins University.</p>
