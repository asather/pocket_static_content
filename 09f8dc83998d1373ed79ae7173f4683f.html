<p>Allegheny County Treasurer John Weinstein is extending a discount on real estate taxes until the end of April and suspending court enforcement for some businesses in an effort to ease the economic burden of COVID-19.</p>
<p>Mr. Weinstein announced on Thursday that the 2% discount for property owners will be in effect until April 30, extending the discount beyond the initial March 31 deadline.</p>

<p>The office is encouraging residents to pay online at&nbsp;<a href="http://www.AlleghenyCountyTreasurer.us" target="_blank">www.AlleghenyCountyTreasurer.us</a>, where payments will be processed without fees when made by electronic check. Public office hours have been reduced to weekdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. All mailed tax payments must be postmarked by April 30 to be eligible for the discount.</p>
<p>The treasurer also will suspend new court enforcement actions to collect delinquent drink, hotel and car rental taxes&nbsp;“to&nbsp;avoid placing any additional strain on struggling, often small businesses&nbsp;during the current pandemic and time of economic uncertainty” -— though the taxes will continue to be collected as scheduled, according to the announcement.</p>
<p>“So much of our economy is tied to the service sector, which is being hit particularly hard right now,” Mr. Weinstein said in a press release. “Restaurants are transitioning to take-out or delivery only or shutting their doors entirely. Travel and tourism are declining. By doing the right things to help reduce the spread of coronavirus and flatten the curve, it’s forcing local businesses to make difficult decisions. We’re always willing to work with any business to bring them into compliance, but for now, if this means one business can keep even one more employee who can then keep food on their family’s table, it’s the right call.”</p>
