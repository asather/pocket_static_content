<h1>Steelers sign receiver Ray-Ray McCloud, cut Penn State product Saeed Blacknall</h1>

<p>The Steelers have made a special move at wide receiver.</p>
<p>As they near the end of their first week of full-contact practice, they announced Friday morning the signing of former Clemson standout Ray-Ray McCloud. The corresponding move was the release of another wide receiver, Penn State alumnus Saeed Blacknall.</p>
<p>McCloud’s likeliest path to the final roster is through the return game. The 5-foot-9, 190-pound sixth-round pick in 2018 served as Clemson’s punt returner in college and played the same role last year for the Carolina Panthers. In six games last season, McCloud averaged 8.221 yards on 10 punt returns and 21.8 yards on eight kick returns. The Steelers almost certainly have their primary punt returner in Diontae Johnson, but the kick return job could be up for grabs.</p>
<p>As a rookie, McCloud played in 10 games and caught five passes for 36 yards for Buffalo but didn’t make the roster the next summer. The Panthers picked him up but waived him last October, so the Bills brought him back for their practice squad. McCloud was released again last month when teams had to cut their preseason rosters from 90 to 80 players.</p>
<p>It’s a minor move for the Steelers, but a major one for football fans in one part of the country. McCloud gets to reunite with Johnson and Deon Cain, Steelers receivers who are also from the Tampa area. Cain and McCloud played together in youth football, then at Clemson, and both are longtime friends with Johnson. Now, all three will share the field in the NFL, at least in practice.</p>
<p>As for Blacknall, he didn’t figure into the conversation at wide receiver much but had special teams potential. Think Johnny Holton last year and Darrius Heyward-Bey before that. The 6-2 Blacknall, signed after making some big plays in the XFL, made at least one impressive special teams stop this week that drew Mike Tomlin’s attention, but perhaps it wasn’t enough to keep him in the mix.</p>
<p>McCloud, who ran a 4.53 40-yard dash coming out of Clemson and worked out for the Steelers earlier this week, will wear No. 14. He turns 24 in October.</p>
