<h1>Clergy, bound by trauma, talk on racism</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Growing up in Eastern Pennsylvania, the Rev. Eric Manning said he was naive about how he was viewed as an African American in mostly white schools and other settings.</p>
<p>“I always thought I would be judged on the content of my character,” said Rev. Manning, pastor of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, S.C.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He had many white friends in high school and college who he felt “accepted me for who I was,” but “then reality sets in and you&nbsp;see you are a black male who may be judged just because you are a black man.”</p>
<p>Rev. Manning spoke in an hourlong Facebook Live conversation on race with Rabbi Jeffrey Myers of Tree of Life / Or L’Simcha Congregation in Pittsburgh Wednesday night. The conversation will be archived at Facebook.com/treeoflifepgh.</p>
<p>Tree of Life and two other congregations sharing its building lost 11 members when an anti-Semitic gunman attacked Oct. 27, 2018.</p>
<p>Mother Emanuel was attacked by a white supremacist on June 17, 2015, who murdered nine people at a Bible study, including its then pastor.</p>
<p>As spiritual leaders of traumatized congregations, Rev. Manning and Rabbi Myers have developed a bond, exchanging visits and cooperating in ventures such as Wednesday’s discussion.</p>
<p>With the fifth anniversary of the Charleston shootings coming up, Rev. Manning said,&nbsp;“many would have thought we were further, but we’re not.”</p>
<p>That said, “we should not become weary” in trying to overcome racism and police brutality, he said.</p>
<p>The discussion was initiated in response to the death of George Floyd, for which a former Minneapolis police officer is charged with murder, and the worldwide protests that have followed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rabbi Myers said before the event his goal was to listen. “Over the past 18 months, I’ve come to learn you need to learn from the victims’ voices and take note of what they’re saying,” he said.</p>
<p>Rev. Manning had multiple anecdotes of experiencing racism.</p>
<p>One of his rude awakenings came after he performed with his college band in a parade and, looking for his mother afterward, was stopped by a police officer because he was walking through a car dealership lot. The officer only let him go after checking his identification and questioning him repeatedly.</p>
<p>"In my naive state, I thought he was just being sincere asking those questions, not to see if I was up to no good,” Rev. Manning recalled.</p>
<p>As recently as when he moved to Charleston in 2016, filling the pulpit held earlier by the minister slain in the 2015 attack, Rev. Manning said he was stopped by a police officer one evening after court proceedings for the gunman in the attack.</p>
<p>He was stopped, the officer said, for having an expired registration.</p>
<p>Rev. Manning said he explained who he was and that the officer suddenly became deferential, realizing the pastor had the mayor and police chief&nbsp;“on speed dial.”</p>
<p>Rev. Manning said he hopes to assist the current youth-led movement in ensuring such microaggressions cease.</p>
<p>“As long as I have breath in my body, I have an opportunity to speak, and I have an opportunity to speak truth to power,” he said.</p>
