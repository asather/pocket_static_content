Johns also had a big game. The two combined for 52 points as Quaker Valley defeated New Castle, 74-63, in a Class 4A Section 2 contest in front of a packed house at Quaker Valley.</p><p>“Can Do” Adou, a 5-foot-10 combo guard, made three 3-pointers in the first 3:30 of the game, finished with a game-high 30 points and extended his perfect streak of made free throws this season to 42 of 42. Johns is a 6-2 guard who also can play the point or off the ball. He scored 22 points and made 7 of 8 free throws.</p><p>Between Theiro and Johns, they made 18 of 26 shots and 13 of 14 free throws. Sophomore forward Markus Frank added 15 points as Quaker Valley, the Post-Gazette’s No. 2 WPIAL Class 4A team, lifted its record to 7-1 and 3-0 in section. New Castle, the three-time defending WPIAL 4A champ and ranked No. 3, dropped to 5-4 and 1-2.</p><p>“We couldn’t guard them,” New Castle coach Ralph Blundo said. “If you want to beat this Quaker Valley team, you have to guard the ball well. We’ve guarded the ball well for 10 years, but we didn’t guard it well against them. We were trying, but give credit to Quaker Valley.”</p><p>Thiero played point guard most of the first half, but it was Johns who took over at the point in the second half as Thiero moved off the ball. Then Quaker Valley has Jack Gardinier, another sophomore who can handle the ball.</p><p>Thiero averages 18.3 and Johns 17.5 while Frank leads in scoring at 18.5. Thiero and Johns were part-time starters a year ago when Quaker Valley lost to New Castle in the WPIAL title game for the third year in a row.</p><p>“K.C.’s role has changed significantly this year,” Quaker Valley coach Mike Mastroianni said. “We lost two 1,000-point scorers from last year [Ryan Stowers and Dan Conlan], but it isn’t a surprise to us coaches what K.C. is doing. We just didn’t need him to do that last year, but we knew he was capable of being a playmaker.”</p><p>Thiero was making plays everywhere early in the game. He could be a handful for the rest of the WPIAL if he grows some in the next few years.</p><p>“I think he’s pretty good at his size now,” Mastroianni said with a laugh.</p><p>Thiero had 19 points in the first half and the Quakers outscored New Castle, 16-7, in the final 4:30 of the half to grab a 40-29 halftime lead.</p><p>The lead grew to 14 points at one point in the second half, New Castle came back and sliced the deficit to 54-48 early in the fourth. But New Castle could get no closer. Quaker Valley spread the court on offense, showed patience on almost every possession and eventually had a player make a play off a drive.</p><p>“I try to do my part, but I think our young guys play like seniors, too,” Johns said.</p><p>Freshman guard Isiah Boice led New Castle with 19 points, junior forward Sheldon Cox added 18 and sophomore guard Mike Wells 16. New Castle shot only 37 percent (11 of 30) from the field in the first half.</p><p>“I thought Adou making those shots early was big,” Mastroianni said. “Just with a young team, understanding our history with New Castle, to feel some confidence and settle in early was big.”</p><p><em>Mike White: mwhite@post-gazette.com and Twitter @mwhiteburgh.</em></p></body></html><original_url>https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2020/01/03/Quaker-Valley-knocks-off-New-Castle-in-WPIAL-basketball-showdown/stories/202001030151</original_url>
