<h1>Bruins dominate Penguins to snap Pittsburgh's four-game winning streak</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>BOSTON — Twenty-four seconds.</p>
<p>Those quick ticks off the clock were all it took for the Penguins to take a one-goal lead over the Boston Bruins Thursday night at TD Garden. In just his second game back from core-muscle surgery, Sidney Crosby ripped a slap shot from the left circle past goalie Jaroslav Halak.</p>
<p>Twenty-four seconds. Those fleeting seconds might also represent the entire duration the Penguins outplayed the home team in a 4-1 loss.</p>
<p>“If we play like we did tonight, we’re not going to win many hockey games, no matter who we play against,” Patric Hornqvist said. “We have to be more hungry.”</p>
<p>The Penguins and Boston entered Thursday night as two of the Eastern Conference’s best teams. Boston led the Atlantic Division with 66 points, while the Penguins sat in second place in the Metropolitan Division with 63. But for much of the game, Boston looked like the separation between the two teams was much greater than the three points in the standings would suggest, the divide even wider than the five points in the standings by the end of the game.</p>
<p>With depth scoring, production from one of the league’s top lines and a suffocating forecheck, the Bruins stormed back to snap the Penguins’ four-game winning streak in dominant fashion and drop their record to 29-13-5.</p>
<p>“There were certain points where we felt like we got out-played,” Crosby said. “We definitely had some chances. we could have gotten into the game. Overall, if you look at our power play and probably just zone time in general, they probably controlled more.”</p>
<p>The tide began to turn moments after Crosby’s goal. The Penguins were forced to kill back-to-back penalties charged to Zach Aston-Reese and John Marino. Putting an opponent on the power play is never advisable. It’s especially not a good idea against the Bruins, who have the league’s second-most efficient power-play unit.</p>
<p>The Penguins snuffed out both of those power plays thanks in part to a couple of fantastic saves from Tristan Jarry. But the ice had been tilted heavily in Boston’s direction — and for good.</p>
<p>“It was hard. We couldn’t get guys on the ice,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said. “... You couldn’t really establish any sort of flow.”</p>
<p>Boston eventually tied the score at 1-1 just over 10 minutes into the game. Center Sean Kuraly ripped a shot on goal that changed directions off Penguins defenseman Jack Johnson’s leg.</p>
<p>Just over two minutes later, Boston took its first lead. After the Penguins failed to get the puck out of their own zone, Karson Kuhlman picked Teddy Blueger’s pocket and ripped a shot. Par Lindholm provided the redirection in front to give the Bruins a 2-1 lead.</p>
<p>The game could have gotten away from the Penguins much earlier had it not been for Jarry. The goalie who stole the No. 1 goalie job from Matt Murray and became a first-time All-Star looked every bit deserving of the accolade most of the game. He ended the night with 29 saves, including several Grade-A Boston opportunities.</p>
<p>In a physical game, tempers flared and emotions eventually bubbled over. The two teams combined for a dozen penalties in the first two periods alone. Bruins fourth-line winger Chris Wagner, especially, drew the ire of the visitors. Twice he went to the box. He also clobbered Brandon Tanev high and hard, sparking a scrum but no penalties on either side.</p>
<p>The escalation reached the point that Hornqvist, an agitator who somehow never had been in a true fight in his 12-year career, ended up dropping the gloves. Earlier this year, he got tagged with his first fighting major. But that was more of a wrestling match than anything else.</p>
<p>Hornqvist made sure he got his money’s worth this time. He and Torey Krug, who were penalized for roughing, came out of the box and started throwing haymakers.</p>
<p>“It was a hard game,” Hornqvist said. “I think we both were a little frustrated. That’s hockey.”</p>
<p>Even a fight from an unlikely source couldn’t spark the Penguins.</p>
<p>Just 3:19 into the third period, the Bruins’ potent top line cracked through. Talented veteran center Patrice Bergeron ripped a shot over Jarry’s glove hand to extend Boston’s lead to two goals, essentially sealing the game. Brad Marchand, the left winger on that top line, tacked on an empty-netter.</p>
<p>The Penguins continue their road trip Friday when they visit the Detroit Red Wings, who are without question the worst team in the league. Then, they’ll be back in Pittsburgh for a Sunday afternoon game against the Bruins, the final meeting of the regular season.</p>
<p>Surely, some of the emotion from this game is bound to carry over.</p>
<p>“Off the start, we’ve got to be physical. We’ve guys that are capable of it,” Aston-Reese said. “… [Hornqvist] dropped the gloves tonight. Maybe it’s a matter of someone dropping the gloves early on and settling down the game.”</p>
