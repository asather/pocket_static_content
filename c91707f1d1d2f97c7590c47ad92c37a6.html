<h1>Gene Therapy: Campaign 2020: It's all over save for the Facebook posturing</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>These annoying calendars keep insisting it’s 2020, the year I said I’d finally start paying attention to the race for the White House, but as usual, I’m already too late.</p>
<p>It’s over and Trump won, according to Facebook, which as you know, is the only thing that matters in 21st century America, even if Facebook has to say so itself.</p>
<p>Maybe this escaped you early in the week, but an internal Facebook memo first published in the New York Times and generated by one Andrew Bosworth, a Facebook VP, concluded that Facebook was probably responsible for President Donald Trump getting elected in 2016 and that the Trump campaign’s singularly effective use of Facebook’s advertising platforms, “may very well lead to the same result” in 2020.</p>
<p>Mr. Bosworth apparently takes no joy in knowing this, much less saying it.</p>
<p>“As a committed liberal I find myself desperately wanting to pull any lever at my disposal to avoid the same result," Mr. Bosworth wrote in the memo, in which he cautioned against pulling any levers. “As tempting as it is to use the tools available to us to change the outcome, I am confident we must never do that or we will become that which we fear."</p>
<p>Again, too late. You’ve become an entity that can change history with the bump of an algorithm. Fear it now.</p>
<p>But just for the hell of it, like it still matters, let’s in the space remaining try to situate ourselves in the election process, take a look back to see how we got to a place where Facebook is running the culture, the country, and much of the world, and look boldly forward to oblivion.</p>
<p>C’mon, it’ll be fun.</p>
<p>It is 297 days until the election. It is three days until the final Democratic debate before the Iowa caucuses. It is always approximately eight minutes before Mr. Trump tweets something intemperate about one of those potential opponents. It is 23 days until those Iowa caucuses, 31 days until the New Hampshire primary, 52 days until Super Tuesday (when there are 16 primaries), 108 days until the always too late Pennsylvania primary, 184 days until the severely anticlimactic Democratic National Convention, and 226 days until the even less climactic Republican National Convention, unless you enjoy playing Finger the Future Felon from the lineup of Trump operatives. No fair picking the president because there’s just no telling how many times he’ll be totally exonerated again between here and there.</p>
<p>When all of that ends, the real dirt will start to come out.</p>
<p>Now let’s look back to Feb. 4, 2004, just 15 years ago this winter, when, from his Harvard dorm room, Mark Zuckerberg and his cohorts at the school for really really smart kids launched Facebook in its initial contrivance. As explained by one of his buddies, Arie Hasit, to an Israeli publication in 2009, Facebook started because “We had books called Face Books, which included the names and pictures of everyone who lived in the student dorms. At first, he built a site and placed two pictures or pictures of two males and two females. Visitors to the site had to choose who was ‘hotter’ and according to the votes there would be a ranking.”</p>
<p>Really, really smart kids.</p>
<p>You might find it offensive that a comingling of sophomoric banalities would, in 15 years, turn into a force that could turn Democracy on its head, but how do you think the producers of “Are You Hot?” feel?</p>
<p>Don’t remember the TV show “Are You Hot?”</p>
<p>Maybe because it only lasted a year, but using the same hormone-heated paradigm, how did it fail? On “Are You Hot, the Search for America’s Sexiest People” Americans willing to put their perceived hotness before a panel of judges including Lorenzo Lamas did so with relish. Even in a country growing dumber by the minute, America somehow wasn’t having “Are You Hot?” but a year later, it was ready for Facebook.</p>
<p>By the way, if you remember that the lone “Are You Hot?” winner was New Orleans actress Chantille Boudousque, that probably doesn’t mean you should try out for “Jeopardy!”. The show’s main contribution to the culture was that it inspired a Saturday Night Live spinoff on which the hotness of Betty Boop was assessed against that of Yosemite Sam. How could I make that up?</p>
<p>OK back to the future. This week Facebook officially decided not to limit how political ads can be targeted (as Google has, and Twitter banned them altogether). Also, Facebook won’t be fact checking them.</p>
<p>This comes less than three months after Mr. Zuckerberg dined with Mr. Trump in Washington, after which Mr. Zuckerberg insisted that he was not lobbied by the president to stick to his policy. If you’ve forgotten Facebook’s policy, it’s that anybody can say anything on this platform and do anything on Facebook Live including live stream the slaughter of 51 people in two New Zealand mosques, and if Facebook isn’t totally fine with it, some remedies will be discussed, but they probably won’t be very effective.</p>
<p>To be fair, Facebook has made some modifications. First time offenders of its stricter protocols on Facebook Live can now be suspended.</p>
<p>Oooh.</p>
<p>So as we wade into the 2020 campaign, remember it’s not about Democracy, leadership, statesmanship, vision, courage, management, character, intelligence, empathy, resilience, discipline and self-control – this isn’t even about politics anymore.</p>
<p>It’s about who, inside or outside the USA, can best manipulate Facebook.</p>
<p>God Bless America.</p>
