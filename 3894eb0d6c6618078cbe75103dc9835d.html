<h1>Parkway East ramp to Business Route 22 to close Monday for emergency repairs</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The outbound Parkway East ramp onto Business Route 22 in Churchill will be closed beginning Monday for up to three weeks for emergency repairs.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Department of Transportation spokesman Steve Cowan said the ramp, which is a main outbound route to the Wilkins and Monroeville business districts, had been reduced to one lane after crews discovered a serious drainage problem a few weeks ago. The problem is washing out the base under the ramp and new drainage must be installed, Mr. Cowan said.</p>
<p>Allison Park Contractors, which is on retainer to the department for such problems, will install new drainage and rebuild the road, Mr. Cowan said. The ramp is scheduled to close at 7 a.m. Monday, weather permitting. Work could last until July 10 but the contractor is hoping to be done sooner, he said.</p>
<p>The recommended detour takes traffic to the next exit at Monroeville, where traffic empties onto Route 48 at the intersection with Business Route 22.</p>
