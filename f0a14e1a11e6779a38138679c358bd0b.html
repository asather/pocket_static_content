<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Anti-Flag will unveil six of their classic festival shows as part of the “Quarantine Sucks, Let's Party” digital tour.</p>
<p>The streams, which begin Friday and run nightly through June 30, will also feature the members of the Pittsburgh punk band chatting live. They run at 6 p.m. Eastern at <a href="https://veeps.com/" target="_blank">veeps.com</a>.</p>
<p>The streaming schedule is</p>
<p>June 26: Hellfest 2013</p>

<p>Tickets are $10. The All Access Package includes the Live at Red Rocks 2018 show, a limited edition 'Quarantine Sucks, Let's Party' t-shirt, and a tour laminate.</p>
<p>Anti-Flag said in a statement: "At times of societal unrest, Anti-Flag have always looked to the punk rock community and work of our shows for solace. Because we can't tour right now, we wanted to find a way to stay connected and share our collective stories. These shows travel across the globe, and throughout years. We look forward to watching them with you, and regaining the energy we get from the show to have the strength and optimism to keep fighting for a better, more just world!"</p>
<p>The band, which would have spent the summer touring Europe, played its last show before the pandemic on March 11 in Ottawa, Canada. Its AntiFest release show for new album&nbsp;“20/20 Vision,” scheduled for March 28 at the Roxian, was canceled.</p>
