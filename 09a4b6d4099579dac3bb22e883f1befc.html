<h1>Report: Black youths in Allegheny County continue to enter juvenile justice system at higher rates than whites</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>New data released Monday by the Black Girls Equity Alliance shows Black girls and boys in Allegheny County continue to be referred to the juvenile justice system at much higher rates than white children locally and at higher rates than Black youths nationwide.</p>
<p>According to the report, Black girls ages 10-17 in Allegheny County are 10 times more likely than white girls to be referred to the juvenile justice system. Black boys are 7 times more likely to be referred than white boys.</p>
<p>Referrals include those from magisterial district judges and from schools.</p>
<p>Referrals are 56% higher for Black girls in Allegheny County than those nationwide and 23% higher for Black boys compared with referrals of that group of children nationwide, the report said.</p>
<p>The data doesn’t come as a stunning revelation to Kathi Elliott, convener of the alliance, who said more programs and supports must be put in place to reduce the number of children who land in the system at an early age.</p>
<p>“We’ve known for many years that there’s a disproportionate rate of Black children referred to juvenile justice and the child-welfare systems,” said Ms. Elliott, who led a virtual briefing on Monday to discuss the report’s findings.</p>
<p>“We’re definitely focused on solutions at this point.”</p>
<p>Ms. Elliott is the chief executive of North Side nonprofit Gwen’s Girls, which provides in-school and out-of-school supports mainly for disadvantaged young girls and teens.&nbsp;It also has some offerings for boys.</p>
<p>To reduce referrals to the juvenile justice system, Gwen’s Girls is developing a program called ROSES —&nbsp;which stands for resilience, opportunity, safety, education and strength —&nbsp;that provides advocacy and a curriculum for youth involved in disorderly conduct cases at school or in the community so they can avoid formal referrals and charges.</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh Public Schools —&nbsp;the largest source of referrals for Black girls in the county — the majority of arrests by school police are for disorderly conduct charges that include infractions such as excessive noise, obscene language and other items that the Black Girls Equity Alliance report characterized as “typical teenage behaviors.”</p>
<p>“That could be something like a kid who’s walking the hall and becomes disruptive,” said Ms. Elliott. “Those behaviors and incidents are not really criminal, but there are no supports to address them in the school building. The first response is to call the school police and or file charges.”</p>
<p>The ROSES program, which includes a minimum 12 weeks of behavioral assessment and instruction, is designed to be “pre-referral, not post-adjudication ... to prevent recidivism and going further into the [juvenile justice] system,” said Ms. Elliott.</p>
<p>She aims for it to be implemented in the city schools and the Clairton, McKeesport and Penn Hills school districts.</p>
<p>Ghadah Makoshi, community advocate for the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania, believes schools need to adapt programs like that to reduce referrals and address individual behaviors rather than sending youths into the justice system —&nbsp;especially for disorderly conduct charges.</p>
<p>Though Pittsburgh Public Schools and many other districts are currently supplying remote instruction or a hybrid model now due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some of the underlying causes for juvenile justice referrals are still present in the community and in some cases have become heightened, said Ms. Makoshi.</p>
<p>“Virtual school doesn’t mean kids don’t have traumas,” she said.</p>
<p>Many children’s families — particularly in the Black community —&nbsp;are coping with the health and economic fallouts from COVID-19 and children are also aware of the racial tension that sparked widespread protests after the death of George Floyd while in police custody in May.</p>
<p>“If we open schools and the first thing students see is police officers, and you deal with trauma by criminalizing students rather than supporting them, we’re just furthering this inequity,” said Ms. Makoshi.</p>
<p>Sara Goodkind, a faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh School of Social Work, said a primary takeaway from the report is that “in Pittsburgh and Allegheny County, we are over policing our Black youth and need ways to help and support young people without punishing them.”</p>
<p>The alliance — an initiative of Gwen’s Girls whose members include legal and child welfare advocates, university researchers and other community stakeholders — launched in 2016.&nbsp;Funding for research and initiatives has been provided by the Heinz Endowments, Pittsburgh Foundation and FISA Foundation.</p>
<p>The alliance will hold a virtual town hall on Zoom from 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. Thursday in which police, juvenile probation officers, judges, school officials and others will discuss the report’s finding and recommendations.</p>
