<h1>Sturgill Simpson, Tyler Childers go their separate ways at Petersen Events Center</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>It was A Good Look’n Tour and a strange affair Wednesday night at the Petersen Events Center, where Sturgill Simpson brought a hard rock band to a country show.</p>
<p>Either that, or Tyler Childers brought a country band to a hard rock show.</p>
<p>However you want to look at it, we saw a guy who was the new face of alt-country just a few years ago pushing in one direction and another on the rise with his homegrown East Kentucky&nbsp;— produced by the first guy.</p>
<p>There’s no question Childers’ approach was more crowd-pleasing. This was the biggest Pittsburgh crowd he’s ever played to and, as they say on Twitter, they were there for it, wildly cheering him on and shouting out the words. You could picture him playing to a full lawn in Burgettstown in the not-too-distant future.</p>
<p>Glued to the mic with a baseball cap pulled over his face, the 28-year-old Childers may not be the most dynamic performer, but he brought a band built for a honky tonk, and they ripped. Steve Earle had his “Copperhead Road”; Childers took us down “Whitehouse Road,” where there’s some cocaine, in one of the most rousing songs in the set.</p>
<p>That 75-minute set kept building in momentum and tension as he and the crew heated up on the banjo-driven “House Fire” and even more fiery, fiddle-powered “Honky Tonk Flame,” channeled Bob Dylan &amp; The Band on “All Your’n” and did the Charlie Daniels Band proud on a set-closing cover of “Trudy.”</p>
<p>A half-hour later, it was time for Simpson to lay some “Sound &amp; Fury” on us, and once the band rolled out — dressed in red with Simpson in a sharp, black Western suit — that began on a puzzling note with the staccato riff of “Best Clockmaker on Mars.” Last we checked that was track six on the new album, which we thought we were getting in its entirety.</p>
<p>This fourth album, which sounds like Jimi Hendrix meets ZZ Top meets The Cars in 2019 with occasional hip-hop beats, plays beautifully as one high-octane 41-minute piece, with each song splicing into next. So why was it starting in the middle?</p>
<p>“We’ve been playing the record,” Simpson — having greeted us with “How yinz doin’?” — told the crowd a few songs in. “We decided to switch it up tonight, make it a little looser for you.”</p>
<p>Looser is one word. “Disjointed,” as someone noted on Twitter, is another. Breaking it up with slower songs like “Welcome to the Earth (Pollywog),” “It Ain’t All Flowers” and Willie’s “I’d Have to Be Crazy” in rather haphazard fashion sapped the energy of the new stuff and, to some extent, the show.</p>
<p>I didn’t take an exit poll on the many flannel-wearing people walking out early, but it was either:</p>
<p>a) They were there for Tyler Childers.</p>
<p>b) They liked Sturgill Simpson when he was country and don’t get what he’s doing now.</p>
<p>c) It was getting late on a work night and they don’t live nearby.</p>
<p>d) They were out of beer money.</p>
<p>e) All of the above.</p>
<p>Despite the erratic pacing of the show, Simpson’s talent ultimately prevailed because he’s got four things: a baritone to die for; deep, psychologically twisted songs; a band that could have been the Stax house band; and the guitar chops to go up against anyone. Whether it was a sizzle or a slow burn, Simpson scorched the Pete on just about every song.</p>
<p>They ranged from the Southern-rock “Voodoo Chile” of “Brace for Impact (Live a Little)” to the Pink Floyd dramatics of “Ronin” to driving synth-rock of “Sing Along.” Before exiting, Simpson, with a shredding climax, made damn sure we’d be hearing-impaired for at least a day and a half.</p>
<p>We can only guess where Sturgill, who’s been throwing shade at his label and the touring industry, is heading next.</p>
<p>We can predict that Tyler is heading for some grass.</p>
