<h1>Penguins sign defenseman Marcus Pettersson to long-term deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Penguins took a step to lock down their defensive future on Tuesday when they agreed to a five-year contract extension with 23-year-old Marcus Pettersson.</p>
<p>The deal doesn’t kick in until the beginning of the 2020-21 season, meaning it won’t impact salary cap space for the rest of this campaign. Once it goes into effect, the new deal will carry an average annual value of $4,025,175 and run through the 2024-25 season.</p>
<p>“In just over a year, Marcus has had a significant impact on our defensive group,” Penguins general manager Jim Rutherford said in a statement. “He is young, reliable and smart, which is important in today’s game. Marcus is part of our young core and it was important to get him signed long-term.”</p>
<p>The Penguins initially acquired Pettersson from Anaheim on Dec. 3, 2018 in exchange for Daniel Sprong. The organization quickly identified him as a defenseman with upside whom they wanted to keep in Pittsburgh longer term.</p>
<p>It’s no secret that Pettersson’s representatives and the Penguins had hoped to sign the big, left-handed defenseman to a multi-year deal before this season. However, because the Penguins were pressed right up against the upper limit of the salary cap, both sides decided to find a short-term solution. On the eve of preseason training camp, Pettersson inked a one-way contract with the NHL squad that carries an average annual value of $874,125.</p>
<p>Per NHL rules, once Pettersson signed that deal, the two sides weren’t allowed to negotiate a long-term contract until Jan. 1. But once the ball dropped, the window was back open to make a deal. Within a month, the two sides came to an agreement.</p>
<p>Pettersson said in early January that Pittsburgh reminds him of his hometown, Skellefteå, Sweden. Now, it will be his home long term.&nbsp;Last year, Pettersson lived in the Strip District when he first arrived in the Steel City. He said on football Sundays he could feel the excitement in the city.</p>
<p>“I love Pittsburgh,” Pettersson said. “Big sports town. That’s for sure what makes this town come alive, when the sports teams play well.”</p>
<p>Though he’s only been in Pittsburgh 14 months, Pettersson has been part of that success. Since being acquired, he has the second-most points and third-highest plus-minus (plus-17) among Penguins defensemen.</p>
<p>During a season in which injuries have ravaged the Pittsburgh roster, Pettersson is also one of just five Penguins — and the only defenseman — who has played in all 50 games.</p>
<p>For most of the season, Pettersson has worked his way into a top-four role on the blue line. With Brian Dumoulin and Justin Schultz injured, he’s currently playing on the second pairing with rookie John Marino.</p>
<p>“He’s a good two-way defenseman,” Penguins coach Mike Sullivan said a few weeks back. “He’s got an offensive upside to his game. He defends pretty well. He’s mobile for as big as he is. He has great gaps. He’s got a good stick.”</p>
<p>One of the intriguing aspects about Pettersson is that he’s still young. He’s only 23 years old and has played in just 156 NHL games. That means he probably still hasn’t reached his ceiling yet.</p>
<p>In particular, Sullivan said he sees ways that Pettersson’s offensive game can continue to evolve.</p>
<p>“We’re trying to help him continue to grow his offensive game because we think he’s capable,” Sullivan said. “He’s still a young defenseman in this league. He’s continuing to learn and grow in some of the added responsibilities that we’re giving him. We think Marcus is a terrific defenseman and he’s good on both sides of the puck.”</p>
<p>Time will tell what Pettersson’s deal means for the rest of the Penguins’ defensive corps. This offseason, Pittsburgh will have to make at least one big decision, when Shultz becomes an unrestricted free agent. He’s currently playing out the last year on his deal with an average annual value of $5.5 million. Juuso Riikola, who has added depth during this injury-plagued season, becomes a restricted free agent at season’s end.</p>
<p>Elsewhere on the defense, Kris Letang is signed through 2021-22 and carries an average annual value of $7.25 million. Brian Dumoulin is signed through 2023-24 with an average annual value of $6 million. Jack Johnson is signed through 2022-23 with a $3.25 average annual value. Marino makes $925,000 and is under contract through 2020-21. Chad Ruhwedel is signed through 2020-21 and carries a $700,000 cap hit.</p>
