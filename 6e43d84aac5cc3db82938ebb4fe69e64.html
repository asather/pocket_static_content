<p>Thoughts and prayers poured in from across the U.S. after the nation woke up to the startling news that President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump had both tested positive for COVID-19 early Friday.</p>
<p>Members of both parties of Pennsylvania's congressional delegation wished the president well.</p>
<p>“I am very concerned by President Trump’s announcement that he and the First Lady have tested positive for COVID-19," Rep. Mike Doyle, D-Forest Hills, said in a statement. "I wish them both a speedy and complete recovery."</p>
<p>Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., tweeted the president's message to say he was “sending along best wishes to President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump on a full and speedy recovery.”</p>
<p>Democratic Sen. Bob Casey, of Pennsylvania, reiterated the hope that the president makes a full recovery.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 is a serious illness that has impacted millions of American families. I wish President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump a speedy recovery following their positive test. I will keep them in my prayers,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>As early as March, Mr. Toomey spearheaded a national awareness campaign, along with Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., to encourage Americans to wear masks as a way to protect themselves and others from COVID-19.</p>
<p>Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said he and second lady Gisele "wish a rapid, full recovery to the President and First Lady."</p>
<p>"Any sarcastic, cruel, or celebratory sentiments are wholly inappropriate and violate basic decency," Mr. Fetterman wrote Friday on Twitter.</p>
