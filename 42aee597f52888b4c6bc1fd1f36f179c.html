<h1>Random history, speed demons and more: Observations from Pitt's 55-0 win over Austin Peay</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Typically, around 55 college football players see the field for each team per game. Sometimes it gets to 60, between the 22 offensive and defensive starters, backups and special team contributors. Pitt eclipsed 60 during last year’s Central Florida game, trying (and succeeding) to keep up with the Knights’ up-tempo offense.</p>
<p>But on Saturday, the Panthers dictated the tone en route to a bit of random but telling history. In Pitt’s 55-0 win over Austin Peay, 70 players saw the field. That’s the most of any game in Pat Narduzzi’s 66-game tenure.</p>
<p>Of course, Narduzzi’s Panthers have never throttled a team like they did Austin Peay. It was Narduzzi’s largest margin of victory and oddly enough his first shutout as Pitt’s head coach. Narduzzi said his team wanted to make a Week 1 statement that it was “different,” and by several metrics it did.</p>
<p>But numbers aside, Saturday felt different. Not just because of the empty stadium or coaches wearing masks on the sideline. There were moments in the second half of Saturday’s game that Pitt hasn’t been accustomed to experiencing the last five years.</p>
<p>Gavin Thomson — a redshirt freshman walk-on from Central Catholic — recorded his first career reception in the third quarter. Thomson caught a bubble screen, put a cornerback on skates with a shimmy and bolted for a 13-yard gain. Thomson, ushered out of bounds on his own sideline, was greeted by helmet taps and a chorus of ooh’s and ahh’s by a handful of starters.</p>
<p>On Austin Peay’s ensuing drive, backup safety Erick Hallett snagged his first career interception. The redshirt sophomore ran over to the sideline, still cradling the football, and found senior Damar Hamlin holding Pitt’s turnover hoop. Paris Ford, Patrick Jones II and other veterans crowded around in anticipation of Hallett’s windmill dunk.</p>
<p>In the fourth quarter, Westinghouse grad and true freshman Dayon Hayes mauled Austin Peay’s backup for his first career sack. And a couple minutes later, freshman Ben Sauls booted his first career extra point. Narduzzi actually called timeout earlier in the quarter after redshirt senior Alex Kessman lined up for a routine PAT. He wanted to get Sauls in then, but a botched snap made Sauls wait a little longer.</p>
<p>In a normal season, some of these little moments probably don’t happen. But with a blanket waiver by the NCAA making this campaign a freebie in terms of eligibility, there was no four-game redshirt limit holding Narduzzi back from rotating in as many players as possible.</p>
<p>And after a hectic, uncertain offseason with pressure on every player to practice social responsibility, Saturday served as an earned reward for the likes of Thomson, Hayes, Hallett and Sauls.</p>

<p><strong>Speed demons</strong></p>
<p>“We’ve got more speed,” quarterback Kenny Pickett said postgame. “We’ve talked about guys running by people, getting some separation. Obviously I think that will be a huge asset to our game.”</p>
<p>It sure was on Saturday. In the Panthers’ first game without Maurice Ffrench, fresh faces backed up a sense of optimism that the speedster’s shoes will be filled. And they might not need to be filled by one person.</p>
<p>Jordan Addison, Pitt’s true freshman starter in the slot, was Pickett’s favorite target with Taysir Mack and Lucas Krull out with injuries. Addison had seven catches on eight targets, including three looks on Pitt’s opening drive. He didn’t have a breakaway play, but he showed his wheels in spurts, including a 15-yard carry.</p>
<p>Maryland transfer D.J. Turner <em>did</em> have a breakaway play — a 51-yard touchdown catch-and-run after a coverage bust. Shocky Jacques-Louis and true freshman Jaylon Barden got in on the action, too. Behind a max protect set, Pickett found Jacques-Louis streaking down the seam for a 68-yard gain. And on his final throw of the day, the starting signal-caller connected with Barden on an inside post for another 68-yarder.</p>
<p>“I love playing with him,” Pickett said of Barden. “We had that play dialed up all week. ... When you get the call and you see the look that you want, I mean, we got the same look that we practiced. He just did his job, and I had to put it out there for him.”</p>
<p>Even considering the opponent, Pickett’s three downfield dimes in the first half were impressive. For reference, Pitt’s quarterback had only four passes of 50 yards or more in 12 games last season. He might surpass that mark next week against Syracuse.</p>

<p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p>
<p>•&nbsp;While Pickett hung out on the sidelines with a red hat and headset on, Davis Beville and Joey Yellen spent the second half handing the ball off.</p>
<p>Beville, a redshirt freshman and four-star recruit in Pitt’s 2019 class, took the first backup snaps and completed 3 of 5 passes for 13 yards. Yellen, an Arizona State transfer and redshirt freshman, completed 2 of 3 passes for 19 yards. Nick Patti — who dealt with minor injury issues during training camp, per Narduzzi — did not play.</p>
<p>Beville didn’t make any mistakes, while Yellen fumbled a snap and was nearly picked trying to force a downfield throw. But opportunities for both to throw were sparse, making it difficult for Beville or Yellen to do much damage — good or bad — in the battle to be Pickett’s backup.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Similarly, Pitt’s cornerbacks weren’t tested too much. Sophomore corner A.J. Woods was beat on a 57-yard gain in the first half, a misstep Ford told him to “flush” and move on. But other than that, Pitt’s pass-rush didn’t let Austin Peay starter Jeremy Oatsvall settle, bullying the FCS offensive line with relative ease.</p>
<p>We’ll find out more about Woods, Marquis Williams and Rashad Battle in the weeks to come.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Austin Peay’s special teams unit went on another adventure.</p>
<p>The Governors, who were down three long-snappers in their Aug. 29 game against Central Arkansas, struggled yet again. In the fourth quarter, Pitt running back Todd Sibley blocked and returned a punt for a touchdown. Austin Peay’s next punt was also blocked, even if it doesn’t technically go down as a block.</p>
<p>Cole Deeds, the Governors’ punter, dropped the snap, paused, started to run with it, then bailed when he saw Pitt linebacker Brandon George at the line of scrimmage waiting for him. Deeds tried to get off an abrupt punt, but slipped in the process. The helter-skelter attempt hit George in the chest, the linebacker gathered the loose ball, and he returned it to Austin Peay’s 2-yard line.</p>
<p>It felt like the Benny Hill theme song should’ve been playing in the background.</p>

<p><strong>Injury report</strong></p>
<p>Pitt had seven players missing due to “COVID-19 related protocols,” but Mack and Krull were not among them. Narduzzi said he expects to have both back next Saturday.</p>
<p>“We were playing it safe with (Krull) today,” Narduzzi added. “He could’ve gone if we wanted him to, but we chose to hold and get him to 100%. We didn’t want 99% of Lucas Krull.”</p>
<p>However, Narduzzi did not address Habakkuk Baldonado’s future availability. The defensive lineman who logged four sacks last season went down with an injury in the first half and didn’t return to the game.</p>
