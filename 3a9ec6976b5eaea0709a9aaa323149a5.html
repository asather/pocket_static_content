<h1>Allstate agents lend a hand at Squirrel Hill Food Pantry </h1>

<p>Somer Obernauer cannot bear the thought of children going hungry.</p>
<p>“There are a lot of white-collar workers who are laid off or their businesses are shuttered,” said Mr. Obernauer, whose Allstate insurance agency is in Mt. Lebanon.</p>
<p>He’s one of nine local Allstate agents who raised $1,100 through social media and donated it to the<a href="https://www.jfcspgh.org/services/squirrel-hill-food-pantry/" target="_blank"> Squirrel Hill Food Pantry</a>, one of eight programs run by Jewish Family and Community Services. The Allstate Foundation also provided $20,000.</p>
<p>The money raised will pay for 63,000 meals, said pantry director Matthew Bolton. Usually, the pantry serves between 300 to 400 households a month. With record unemployment, it’s seeing an additional 40-60 families each week.</p>
<p>“I have not seen this in my lifetime — the sheer volume of people who are suddenly out of work. We’re seeing people from everywhere,” Mr. Bolton said, adding that many of them had never used such safety net programs before.</p>
<p>“We do have some families asking if they can shop twice, for this month and next month.&nbsp;People are trying to maximize their time out,” he said.</p>
<p>Located at 828 Hazelwood Ave., the pantry is open 9 a.m.-12:15 p.m. Monday through Friday&nbsp;and 1:30-3 p.m. Tuesday and Thursday. The phone number is 412-421-2708.</p>
<p>To cope with food shortages, the pantry diversified the vendors it uses. Its three employees have had to contend with changes in food supply, procurement, distribution and receiving.</p>
<p>“We’re lucky to have a strong staff that have been here since day one. No one has taken a day off,” Mr. Bolton said, adding that the pantry stopped using volunteers to reduce the spread of the new coronavirus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We’ve been able to maintain our hours of operation since this happened.”</p>
<p>The pantry uses its buying power to buy produce, canned vegetables, frozen beef, shelf-stable milk, frozen blueberries and powdered Gatorade. “Thirty percent or more of our total pounds are fresh produce,” Mr. Bolton said.</p>
<p>The Allstate donation continues the company’s commitment to the food pantry and similar charities across the country.</p>
<p>“This is only one virtual fundraising effort that Allstate is doing.&nbsp;They are doing it nationwide,” Mr. Obernauer said.</p>
<p>The other local Allstate agents were: Jo Snider, Monroeville;&nbsp;Chris Tomley, Murrysville; Jim Bower and Cyndi Walker, both of South Park, and Pittsburgh agents Brian Ralph, Marty Randal, Dana Richter and John Tomaino.</p>
