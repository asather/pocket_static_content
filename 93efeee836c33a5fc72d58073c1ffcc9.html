<h1>WATCH: Seton Lasalle's Emma Walsh nails game-winning, half-court buzzer beater</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>While most of the country was busy last night watching Joe Burrow and LSU win a <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/Pitt/2020/01/14/Joe-Burrow-LSU-Heisman-season-beat-Clemson-42-25-Trevor-Lawrence-national-title/stories/202001140077" target="_blank">college football national championship</a>, many probably missed a highlight for the ages in their own backyard.</p>
<p>The Seton LaSalle and South Park’s girls basketball teams were locked in an overtime duel last night with neither of the WPIAL Section 2, Class 3A schools willing to budge an inch.</p>
<p>With four seconds to go, Seton LaSalle was down 53-51 with the ball under their own basket. Junior Emma Walsh took the inbounds pass, dribbled to half court and drained a long 3-pointer that lifted the Rebels to an improbable 54-53 victory over the Eagles.</p>
<p>The crowd went wild, and the shot was so awe-inspiring that multiple people who saw it on Twitter tagged ESPN and “SportsCenter” accounts to try to get it featured on the network’s daily roundup of the top 10 plays in sports.</p>
<p>Walsh sounded both happy and humble after her heroics went semi-viral.</p>
<p>She might have been slightly upstaged by those two pesky Tigers teams battling it out in New Orleans last night, but Walsh’s shot created a memory that will last her and the entire Seton LaSalle community a lifetime.</p>
