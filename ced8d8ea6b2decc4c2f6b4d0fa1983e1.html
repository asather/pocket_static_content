<h1>After White House briefs Senate on Iran strike, Pa. senators split on Trump's strategy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., said he left an 80-minute Capitol Hill intelligence briefing by top Trump administration officials on Wednesday without hearing clear evidence of <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/nation/2020/01/08/Trump-nation-address-Iran-attack-iraq-US-bases/stories/202001080111" target="_blank">an imminent attack by Iran</a> on the United States that justified the killing last week of Iran’s top general.</p>
<p>Walking out of that same closed-door briefing, Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said he felt satisfied that officials made the right call. In fact, he had called President Donald Trump earlier in the day to commend him for the tough decision.</p>
<p>The officials “certainly convinced me that there were large-scale attacks that we’re very far along in the planning and very likely to be executed in the near future,” Mr. Toomey said. “The timing was very, very soon.”</p>
<p>Neither senator — who held separate calls with reporters within an hour of when the afternoon briefing concluded — would discuss in detail what the officials shared with them, citing the classified nature of the intelligence.</p>
<p>But the split opinion reveals a larger divide in how the two political parties are assessing the fallout from the U.S. strike that killed Iranian Quds Force commander Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad on Jan. 2. The strike prompted widespread vigils and angry protests in Iran, bringing long-simmering tensions between the U.S. and Iran to a boiling point.</p>
<p>Hours before Wednesday’s briefing, the Pentagon confirmed Iran shot missiles at two U.S. military bases in Iraq, an act Iran said was retaliation. Mr. Trump, in an address to the nation on Wednesday, said the strike caused no casualties and promised new sanctions on Iran.</p>
<p>As senators left the briefing, Democrats stressed the need for diplomacy and expressed alarm at what they viewed as Mr. Trump’s sudden escalations.</p>
<p>House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the House would hold a floor vote Thursday on a war powers resolution that would restrain Mr. Trump’s ability to take further military action against Iran without Congressional approval. Ms. Pelosi called for “an immediate, effective de-escalatory strategy that prevents further violence.”</p>
<p>Mr. Casey co-sponsored a <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-joint-resolution/63/text" target="_blank">resolution in the Senate</a> that has the same effect. That bill was introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., last week after Mr. Soleimani’s killing.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey said questions still loomed regarding the Iranian threat against the United States, the options officials presented to Mr. Trump and the outcomes taken into consideration with each option.</p>
<p>His confusion was not for lack of seniority: The briefing was led by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Defense Secretary Mark Esper, CIA director Gina Haspel, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Gen. Mark Milley and Director of National Intelligence Joseph Maguire.</p>
<p>The officials gave presentations, then the senators could ask questions. By the time the officials departed to head to another meeting at the White House, Mr. Casey said, “what was left was a lot of senators writing to get answers to their questions.”</p>
<p>“I was frankly rather surprised” that the officials were not prepared to answer basic questions, Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>He argued the world was safer under the 2015 nuclear pact negotiated by former President Barack Obama that Mr. Casey said headed off the threat of war and prevented Iran from quickly developing nuclear weapons. Mr. Trump terminated that deal.</p>
<p>“My assessment is the administration is on a path to regime change,” Mr. Casey said. “It’s clear the Trump administration acted without a Congressionally approved authorization of military force,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey, meanwhile, argued the Trump administration had a clear strategy and Mr. Soleimani’s killing fit into it.</p>
<p>For one, Mr. Toomey said, the strike eliminated a uniquely powerful leader who was directly responsible for American military deaths and murder of Iranian protesters. Mr. Toomey characterized Mr. Soleimani as a charismatic micromanager who directed multiple militant groups in other countries and could influence Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei to support attacks.</p>
<p>The forcefulness of the strike also will deter future Iranian attacks on Americans, he said.</p>
<p>“When our intelligence folks learned that they were playing an even more dramatic escalation, it would have been irresponsible not to respond to that very, very grave threat,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
<p>“Does that mean [Iran] can’t pull off an attack? No,” Mr. Toomey added. “But it makes it much more difficult for them. There’s a whole new level of deterrence that didn’t exist before.”</p>
<p>Mr. Toomey acknowledged a full-scale war with Iran would require Congressional approval — but no one is seriously suggesting that option, he said.</p>
<p>On the phone call with Mr. Trump on Wednesday, Mr. Toomey said he praised the president’s restraint.</p>
<p>“The president did not want to a engage in military conflict if he could avoid it,” Mr. Toomey said.</p>
