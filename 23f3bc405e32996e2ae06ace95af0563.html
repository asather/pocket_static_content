<h1>As residents hold out hope for a normal summer, organizers grapple with canceling historical events </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Although Gov. Tom Wolf has outlined <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/state/2020/04/22/Pennsylvania-Governor-Wolf-color-coded-plan-begin-reopening-lockdown-coronavirus/stories/202004220164" target="_blank">a three-phase plan</a> to begin relaxing restrictions on businesses and residents that could go into effect for some parts of the state after May 8, community organizers and officials have already begun canceling Memorial Day celebrations, Fourth of July parades and historical summer community festivities.</p>
<p>For Butler County farmer Mary Elizabeth Snow, COVID-19 has put her and her children’s hard work that they’ve put towards entering this year’s Butler Farm Show in jeopardy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking care of pigs and sheep isn’t about making a living for Ms. Snow, who has been farming for nearly a decade. Instead, she uses farming to teach life lessons to her three children as well as the children that she instructs in the Mars Space Pioneers, a 4-H STEAM club.&nbsp;The group has been raising charity animals to be seen and judged in the Butler Farm Show.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The annual goal to donate winnings to a local youth camp from the farm show event that dates back over 70 years is still very much attainable for Ms. Snow. Despite traditional summer events such as holiday parades, community days and fairs being canceled around the region due to COVID-19, the Adams educator is still holding out hope that her kids still will have a farm show to participate in.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I don’t want them to have to consider canceling the farm show,” Ms. Snow said. “We want to have something nice to hold onto. We haven't even gotten to summer yet and things are being canceled already. My daughter [is] worried sick, asking almost every day if it will be canceled. But as a farmer, no matter what, it’s still our job to raise animals and keep going.”</p>
<p>Canceling events that thousands of people look forward to each year has become a reality for many organizers in surrounding counties.</p>
<p>Peters Manager Paul Lauer said council members’ decision to cancel Community Day, a late June event that draws up to 7,000 people, was difficult, but was ultimately made in the best interest of the public.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I think that as we can see by what the governor is doing, we will slowly but surely open things up ... but that doesn't necessarily mean that our community or any community in Western Pennsylvania can safely host an event that would attract thousands of people in close quarters right away,” Mr. Lauer said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He commended the residents of Peters for staying resilient and obeying social distancing orders despite the restlessness felt around the state and country as people pressure lawmakers to end the shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Peters&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/04/23/Peters-Township-declares-disaster-emergency-COVID-19-pandemic/stories/202004240005" target="_blank">declared a disaster emergency</a> at the same April 13 meeting that canceled Community Day as well as its annual&nbsp;“Touch a Truck” kids event.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“There will be a risk factor [for public gatherings] until there is a vaccine or some type of means to effectively treat COVID-19,” Mr. Lauer said.&nbsp;“Until that occurs, it is prudent not to get together in large quantities.”</p>
<p>Uncertainty caused by the coronavirus also pushed Cranberry to cancel its&nbsp;Cranberry Township Community Chest Community Days. The township said Tuesday that the three-day event that draws nearly 30,000 people in mid-July, was called off so that officials can&nbsp;“concentrate on the challenges the coronavirus presents to the community.”</p>
<p>With Memorial Day fast approaching, officials from Beaver to New Brighton; South Hills; White Oak; Aspinwall and Monroeville already have made the call to cancel parades and festivities that were to take place on the federal holiday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Monroeville also joined Brentwood in its decision <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/south/2020/04/21/Brentwood-Borough-cancels-July-4th-activities/stories/202004210069" target="_blank">to cancel its Fourth of July celebrations</a> that traditionally bring tens of thousands together for parades and fireworks displays.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In Greene County, Waynesburg residents who look forward to the annual Rain Day Festival will have to settle for a virtual option this year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Borough Manager Mike Simms said the Rain Day committee “wasn’t happy about” canceling the annual street festival that commemorates an old legend that it always rains in Waynesburg on June 29.</p>
<p>“They’ve been considering this ever since the pandemic started,” Mr. Simms said.&nbsp;“[The committee] schedules so many things,&nbsp;bands and what not, so we can’t just wait until the last minute to cancel these acts.”</p>
<p>Instead, the committee is working with the entertainment to set up livestream options for the community to enjoy.&nbsp;“We are hoping to bring favorite pieces of the Festival experience to life online for 2020,” read a statement on the <a href="http://raindayfestival.com/" target="_blank">Rain Day Festival website</a>. “As this new planning process has just begun some of our ideas consist of having live entertainers, contests, interviews, and so much more! This celebration will go on rain or shine just not the traditional way.”</p>
<p><strong>Pretty good odds</strong></p>
<p>As Ms. Snow continues to instruct her children and 4-H campers on her 150 acres of farmland, she is proceeding through the pandemic business as usual with hopes that the Butler Farm Show will take place -— a gamble that still has pretty good odds.</p>
<p>President Ken Laughlin said&nbsp;the event that draws an average of 50,000 people will still go on as planned August 10-15.</p>
<p>“We plan on having a show,” Mr. Laughlin said Friday. “What restrictions we may or may not have to abide by, we don’t know yet. But contracts are signed and everything is lined up as far as that goes.”</p>
<p>Mr. Laughlin said his board hasn’t given themselves any deadline dependent on the state’s stay-at-home orders that would make them decide to cancel, but they are prepared to make certain restrictions to the functionality of the show if need be.</p>
<p>“Restrictions will depend on what the governor lines up for us,” he said. “If there are no restrictions come August, we would go on as normal. If there are still [social distancing] restrictions, we would have to make it work.”</p>
<p>In the meantime, Ms. Snow and her three kids —&nbsp;Daisy, 13, Rosemary, 11, and AJ, 8 —&nbsp;are selling raised garden beds and boxes that they’re making out of materials found in their mom’s junkyard, Ms. snow’s refurbishing company, Girl On a Hill. The money is going towards feed and supplies for the farm animals.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Even if there doesn't end up being a farm show, the fact that they're doing the work towards it makes me very proud as a mom,” Ms. Snow said. “It is showing me that they love farming more than just about anything and they want to push to show their animals.”</p>
