<h1>Why Pitt's Pat Narduzzi believes eligibility rule is 'a no-brainer'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the middle of Friday’s practice, Pat Narduzzi chatted with one of his players who voiced a concern that’s crossed every athlete’s mind over the last few weeks: “That’s if we play.”</p>
<p>Narduzzi, incredulous at the notion there wouldn’t be a season, emphasized then and there that Pitt will play come September. That’s the plan, at least. But both privately and publicly, while maintaining the mindset that the Panthers are taking the field, Narduzzi has recognized the struggles his players and others have faced with an uncertain fall season.</p>
<p>“They’re reading Twitter and one day everything is good and the next day the Big Ten cancels,” Narduzzi said Friday. “They’re looking at each other saying, ‘Are we next?’”</p>
<p>Players have asked similar questions, too. Should I opt out? Should I practice? If we play only a few games, does that count as a year of eligibility? For those worried, the NCAA is taking a step to assuage their fears.</p>
<p>The NCAA Division I Council voted Wednesday to recommend that all fall athletes be given a free year of eligibility no matter how much they compete this fall, winter or spring and the rule was approved by the NCAA Board of Governors on Friday. It will ensure that athletes aren’t docked one of their four years of eligibility in a COVID-affected situation that’s totally out of their control.</p>
<p>The NCAA made a similar change back in March when spring sports were axed by the pandemic. Those affected athletes were permitted an extra year of eligibility. Seniors didn’t go against teams’ scholarship counts, and schools had to individually determine how much financial aid would be offered.</p>
<p>Narduzzi, who tweeted in support of the change last week, gave another thumbs up on Friday.</p>
<p>“When you talk about education and the opportunity to play another year, I think it’s a no-brainer,” Narduzzi said on a Zoom call with reporters. “It just gives them comfort. ... Because everyone wants to know what it means for them.”</p>
<p>When asked if Pitt athletic director Heather Lyke — who sits on the Division I Council — is in favor of the rule, Narduzzi said “no question about it,” which is important because there are obvious financial and logistical ramifications for facilitating another year for fall athletes.</p>
<p>Carrying more than the normal 85 scholarship football players for the 2021 season would be costly. With a 2021 recruiting class incoming, 20 to 25 more players will join college programs. The average Football Bowl Subdivision scholarship is worth about $36,000 per year, according to a 2016 survey conducted by ScholarshipStats.com.&nbsp;So athletic departments could be looking at increased commitments of six to seven figures for football alone.&nbsp;And that doesn’t include equipment, meal plans and travel.</p>
<p>Some schools might not want to take on that financial hit. Some won’t be able to — even if they wanted — because of the pandemic. Narduzzi, meanwhile, didn’t sound concerned.</p>
<p>“The kids are more important. We’ll worry about that later,” Narduzzi said. “This is a different year. It ain’t normal. We’ll deal with that. That’s just a financial thing. I don’t think anybody’s going to be like, ‘Oh, financially we can’t do that, so the heck with the kids.’ No, that’s the wrong decision. You bite the bullet, raise some more money, do what you’ve got to do. It’s a year you wonder if there will be fans in the stands and you just don’t know, but it doesn’t matter. Money doesn’t matter when it comes to student-athletes. It’s all about the student-athlete.”</p>
<p>At least one of Narduzzi’s players agrees with him. On Thursday, Pitt linebacker Phil Campbell championed for the new rule.</p>
<p>“It’s just not fair for a lot of the players because these are circumstances we couldn’t control,” Campbell said. “For me, I want to play so badly. But if our season gets cut short, I’m going to feel a little disappointed. I definitely think that’s the fair way to go.”</p>
<p><strong>Roster, position battle updates</strong></p>
<p>Pitt has not released a training camp depth chart, but Narduzzi offered a peek behind the curtain after the Panthers’ 11th practice.</p>
<p>Freshman wide receiver Jordan Addison is starting in the slot with Taysir Mack, Shocky Jacques-Louis and Jared Wayne battling for the two outside receiver positions. Addison, a 2020 four-star prospect per 247 Sports, enrolled in January, was around for Pitt’s abbreviated spring ball and has grown considerably in that time.</p>
<p>“People need to watch out for him early,” Narduzzi said. “I think he’s a special kid.”</p>
<p>Addison is also contending for Pitt’s open kick returner and punt returner roles, vacated by graduated speedster Maurice Ffrench. Freshman running back Israel Abanikanda, along with Addison, has the “inside track” at kick returner, while the young receiver and sophomore ball-carrier Vincent Davis battle to field punts.</p>
<p>Redshirt senior Chase Pine is holding down the starting middle linebacker spot but is being pushed by redshirt sophomore Wendell Davis. Whoever starts there will be flanked by Campbell and Cam Bright.</p>
<p>Former Penn State safety John Petrishen, who transferred to Pitt last August, will provide depth behind Campbell and Bright, as he’s moved from the secondary to outside linebacker. Judson Tallandier has also switched from cornerback to safety.</p>
<p>At defensive tackle, it’s still a “wide open” competition between Devin Danielson, Tyler Bentley, David Green and Calijah Kancey for the role Jaylen Twyman left behind. Twyman, who opted out of the season to prepare for the 2021 NFL draft, will not count toward Pitt’s scholarship count because he’s not taking classes, Narduzzi confirmed.</p>
<p>That open scholarship could be used to reward a current walk-on or possibly bring in a transfer from a school that’s not playing football this fall.</p>
<p>“If we have a scholarship left and it’s the right player at the right position, no question about it. We’ve always got our ears open,” Narduzzi said. “But I haven’t heard that there are a lot of kids going in the portal. Which is good. I’m glad they’ve got faith with where they are. And I think this rule makes it easier for those kids to say, ‘I’m not going into the portal.’”</p>
<p><strong>Non-conference game on?</strong></p>
<p>Narduzzi isn’t just focused on Pitt playing in the fall; he’s focused on the season starting Sept. 12. Problem is, Pitt doesn’t have an opponent lined up for Sept. 12.</p>
<p>When the Mid-American Conference canceled its fall slate two weeks ago, Pitt lost its Sept. 12 opener against Miami (Ohio). With the season so close, there was a thought that it would be too logistically difficult for the Panthers to replace the RedHawks.</p>
<p>However, Narduzzi said Pitt is “still working” on finding an opponent.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of things going on with the testing they have to do. So we’ve got to find the right team,” the coach said. “We’re not jeopardizing anything. Our kids’ safety is what’s most important. We’re going to find someone we can trust.”</p>
<p>The ACC mandates that not only all non-conference games this year must be played in the member’s home state, but the opposing team must also follow the conference’s COVID-19 protocols. As of Friday, those protocols require testing every team member once a week, 72 hours before a game.</p>
<p>But Narduzzi said the ACC is “talking about” making those requirements stricter, enforcing two PCR (nasal swab) tests per week with Friday antigen testing as well.</p>
<p>“For now, we’re full steam ahead,” Narduzzi said. “We all have to believe there’s a season on the 12th. I have no question we’re playing on the 12th.”</p>
