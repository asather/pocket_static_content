<h1>Ross police officer's social media activity under review</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The social media activity of a Ross police officer is being probed by authorities after he reportedly made Facebook posts in early May mocking “leftist” protests, just weeks before nationwide demonstrations were sparked by the death of George Floyd.</p>
<p>The posts were made on May 6 by Sgt. Joseph Serowik, but didn’t appear to be linked to a specific incident. Mr. Floyd died on May 25 at the hands of a Minneapolis police officer.</p>
<p>Sgt. Serowik has since “voluntarily disabled his Facebook page in order to preserve it and prevent any changes,” according to Ross Township police spokesman&nbsp;Sgt. Brian Kohlhepp.&nbsp;Public trust is of “paramount importance,” he said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. The posts, although no longer available online, have been forwarded to the township solicitor for review.</p>
<p>The posts came to light when 90.5 WESA-FM reported the activity to township officials. The station said Sgt. Serowik reposted several memes. One featured photos of protesters and a woman aiming a gun, superimposed with the question, “Why do conservatives own guns? Because Leftists block freeways, loot, throw Molotov cocktails, turn over cop cars, burn cities… and think this behavior is socially acceptable.”</p>
<p>“While many people express opinions across the spectrum on social media, public employees are not afforded the same rights,” Sgt. Kohlepp said. “Township employees are prohibited from having relation to their employment on their social media. These posts by Sgt. JJ Serowik do not reflect his status as a township employee. Posts like this are discouraged and may be a violation of township policy as they can be construed differently by different people and subject to the interpretation of those viewing them.</p>
<p>“We support an environment of inclusiveness and work hard to promote that throughout our daily duties and interactions with the public, however they may be. Township employees are to maintain the highest level of professionalism and to be respectful to all.”</p>
<p>Sgt. Serowik could not be reached for comment, and is “not able to comment as it would be a violation of police policy,” Sgt. Kohlepp said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sgt. Serowik has interacted with protesters recently during his employment at the department, and has assisted with blocking traffic at an intersection “so that a pre-panned driving protest could pass safely through the area.”</p>
<p>In Sgt. Serowik’s Army career, he has been tasked on multiple deployments to work in promoting relations between the United States military and residents of the foreign host nations, Sgt. Kohlepp added.</p>
<p>The Ross Township Police department continues to “support peaceful protests and protestors,” Sgt. Kohlepp said.</p>
<p>“In these instances, we have worked with protest organizers before, during, and after organized protests,” he said. “During these events, we have remained in the area of the protest for their safety as well as the safety of spectators and the general public.”</p>
<p>WESA also reported that another video reposted May 10 by Sgt. Serowik showed a short clip of a man driving a vehicle to the Phil Collins song “In the Air Tonight.” As the song hits a drum solo, the car suddenly jolted as if rolling over a series of obstructions in the road. The video was labeled “When protesters [are] blocking the road but I got a job to do,” according to WESA.</p>
<p>According to the township’s employee social media policy, “employees are prohibited from posting content that is inconsistent with their duties and&nbsp;obligations.” The&nbsp;following activities on the internet, intranet, and extranet are prohibited and may result in&nbsp;disciplinary action, the <a href="http://www.ross.pa.us/DocumentCenter/View/77/Personnel-Policies-and-Procedural-Manual-PDF?bidId=" target="_blank">policy</a> states.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Use for personal gain or for commercial activity unrelated to the Township.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Sending privileged information or restricted information</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Sending material that is threatening, intimidating, hostile, or offensive in nature.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Viewing or sending of lewd material.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Violating copyright or trademark laws.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Attempts to infiltrate another organization’s computer system.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Any activities not specified here that are in violation of Township policies or federal, state, or local laws.</p>
