<h1>AMC theaters, summer movies rearrange schedules again</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The AMC Theatres movie chain is taking a cue from the delayed releases of Disney's "Mulan" and Christopher Nolan's "Tenet" to push back its reopening to July 30.</p>
<p>In pushing back the recently announced reopening by a couple of weeks, the world's largest movie chain also took note of the uptick in COVID-19 cases in many states that have now slowed the comebacks of some businesses.</p>
<p>Most of AMC’s 600 theaters will now reopen on July 30, with “Unhinged," starring Russell Crowe, leading the way on screens. All theaters in the chain now are scheduled to open Aug. 12, for the live-action “Mulan,” followed by the thriller “Tenet” on Aug. 21.</p>
