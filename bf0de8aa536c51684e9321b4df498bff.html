<h1>Bloomfield club Howlers will close in August, move to East Liberty</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Howlers, the Bloomfield club that is home to the indie-rock, punk, metal and Americana scene, is moving to East Liberty.</p>
<p>The final shows there will take place during Little Italy Days in mid-August.</p>
<p>Bloomfield’s loss of the venue&nbsp;comes after the closures of the former Bloomfield Bridge Tavern and the storefront that held music stores Jim’s Records and Juke Records.</p>
<p>Owner Susan Coe said, “We got a new landlord and he refused to give us a long-term lease, but we talked him into staying until August.”</p>
<p>Coe says Howlers will move to East Liberty, where she also owns the Peace, Love &amp; Zen Holistic Wellness Center. She did not reveal the location but said it will be about the same size as Howlers, that it will have a different look and will book a range of bands from punk to metal to country.</p>
<p>Mary Jo Coll, who began tending bar there 15 years ago and eventually took over the bookings, plans to retire. During her time at Howlers, she became a mother figure to the bands. The Harlan Twins even wrote a song about her called “Mama Jo.” Coll also had a hand in booking the now-dormant RANT (Rock All Night Tour) festival.</p>
<p>When Howlers first started doing live music, Coll said, “the stage was a couple drum risers pushed together. Bands ran their own sound. Sue upgraded the sound system and hired good techs to run it, and built a new stage. I got us an online presence and we went from just a punk dive to a viable venue.”</p>
