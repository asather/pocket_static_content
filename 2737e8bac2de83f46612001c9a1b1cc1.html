<h1>Gov. Wolf: More than half of mandatory race, ethnicity data still unreported across Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite a mandatory requirement from the Pennsylvania Department of Health that race and ethnicity data be included with COVID-19 test results, Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday said more than half of that data is still unreported across the state.</p>
<p>The governor, in a statement released Monday, called for COVID-19 healthcare providers and medical facilities conducting tests to follow the health department’s order.&nbsp;He also asked for more robust, free and accessible testing for minorities and vulnerable populations.</p>
<p>Roughly 69% of data is still unreported with little to no data regarding ethnicity, the governor said.&nbsp;Information about patients, including date of birth, phone numbers, race and ethnicity, are required with each COVID-19 test.</p>
<p>“All Pennsylvanians deserve the same access to testing and treatment during the COVID-19 pandemic. That’s regardless of race, income, location, and every other factor,” Mr. Wolf said.&nbsp;“The goal for this task force is to help communicate issues with how the pandemic is affecting the state’s minority and vulnerable populations.”</p>
<p>He acknowledged notions that the virus seems to be hitting minority populations — particularly African-Americans —&nbsp;hardest across the country and anecdotally in the state. However, health officials lack the statistics needed to determine the severity of this issue in Pennsylvania, Mr. Wolf said. He said more medical professionals need to collect and report this information.</p>
<p>A newly-formed Health Disparity Task Force is working with the state Department of Health’s Office of Health Equity to learn how to tackle these issues, Mr. Wolf said.</p>
<p>Lt. Gov. John Fetterman said the task force has held three meetings so far, and their biggest concern is improving data collection and increasing access to free testing.</p>
<p>State health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said in an April 14 press conference the information is “very important data to help us make informed and data driven, public health decisions.” It’s needed to help paint&nbsp;a complete picture of pandemic in the state. But outside of age, gender and place of residence, data, racial and ethic details have been “very difficult” to collect from medical professionals, she said.</p>
<p>Dr. Levine said information is collected manually from providers in laboratories, or from automated reporting processes.</p>
<p>“We also need to make sure our vulnerable populations have equal access to testing,” Mr. Wolf said in a statement. “By identifying issues, like testing locations and hours of operation, and providing information on these locations to our minority communities, we can make sure testing is accessible to everyone. ...And we need to make sure testing is available to everyone, regardless of means, previous medical care, or existing relationships to a physician. This will help us identify difficult-to-detect cases.”</p>
