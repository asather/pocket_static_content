<h1>COVID-19 drive-thru tests 100 people in 2½ hours</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh region got a small taste Monday of just how desperate people are to be tested for COVID-19 when the region’s first drive-through test site opened on the North Shore.</p>
<p>With little notice beyond social media posts and a few paragraphs on news websites the night before, the Central Outreach Wellness Center, a nonprofit health clinic on the North Shore, screened about 150 people in just 2 ½ hours Monday, ultimately taking samples to be tested for COVID-19 from about 75 of them, said Dr. Stacy Lane, founder of the clinic.</p>
<p>Dr. Lane, who took many of the samples herself standing outside the clinic’s office on Anderson Street, said she saw and hear “a lot of fear” from the people who came through the line.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are wanting to be tested just to know,” she said. “But we can’t just test everyone one to help them with their own peace of mind right now with a limited resource.”</p>
<p>Quest Diagnostics, the private commercial lab that does testing for the clinic, had supplied the clinic with 100 testing kits total that it could use at its three locations in Pittsburgh, Washington and Aliquippa.</p>
<p>They were out of test kits and had to start turning people away at all three locations by 1:30 p.m., Dr. Lane said, though she hopes to have more in the coming days to be able to open up the drive-through test site again.</p>
<p>Dr. Lane said the idea to do the drive-through came last week “when word got out that we had testing available here” through Quest.</p>
<p>“When we realized no one else was able to test [people without doctors’ notes] but us, we realized, maybe we should be testing everyone we could,” she said.</p>
<p>The goal, she said, was “to avoid having people go to their doctor’s office and contaminate the office to get a note.”</p>
<p>Unlike the other health systems or doctors’ offices in the region, Dr. Lane’s clinic did not require a doctor’s order to be tested on Monday.</p>
<p>People were tested if they showed up and qualified based on some basic screening questions –what symptoms they had, questions about recent travel and possible contact with someone with COVID-19 – as a way to try to test the highest-risk people.</p>
<p>Once a swab was taken from each person, they were asked to self-quarantine until test results come back near the end of this week.</p>
<p>The clinic’s experience comes a day before UPMC opens its testing site on the South Side on Tuesday morning for people who have reached a much higher bar: First they’ll need an order from a doctor to get a test, then a UPMC infectious control expert will interview them to see if they qualify.</p>
<p>Dr. Lane said “from a public health standpoint we thought having a doctor’s note was an unnecessary step in the process.”</p>
<p>Still, she said understood why UPMC is requiring a note from doctors first.</p>
<p>“I think they’re like the rest of us, trying to figure out a way to use a very limited resource” of testing, she said. “So I won’t fault them, and I hope they would fault me.”</p>
<p>However, she said: “I do hope that UPMC will ramp up quickly and loosen their testing rules.”</p>
<p>The goal for her clinic, UPMC’s test site, and others she hopes will open soon and begin testing hundreds if not thousands a day, is all the same.</p>
<p>“I think [COVID-19] is already here. We’re all going to be exposed to some level,” she said. “But I hope we can limit it.”</p>
