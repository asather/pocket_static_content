<h1>'Let's take a shot': Why Pittsburgh is in contention to host NHL playoff action</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In the weeks that followed the March 12 shutdown of the NHL season due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the league let its 31 teams know it was considering having multiple “hub cities” be neutral-site locations if the season were to resume and encouraged them to submit bids. The Penguins started scrambling.</p>
<p>“We thought, ‘What better place to get this all started again than Pittsburgh?’ ” Penguins president and CEO David Morehouse told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>The process would be unlike another of the others they had done, with little time to put together a bid and a lot of uncertainty due to a nationwide health crisis that shuttered the city. But the organization liked its chances.</p>
<p>In their pitch to the NHL, the Penguins pointed to three things they hope will put them over the top: modern hockey facilities, experience hosting major events and their partnership with health-care giant UPMC.</p>
<p>That Pittsburgh is not currently a COVID-19 hot spot is also a critical factor.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot going for Pittsburgh, so we said, ‘Let’s take a shot,’ ” said Penguins VP of communications Tom McMillan, who helped put together the bid.</p>
<p>On Tuesday, NHL commissioner Gary Bettman revealed that Pittsburgh was one of 10 cities still in consideration. The NHL plans to pick two hub cities to host its unique 24-team postseason tournament. Conference affiliation will not be a factor in that decision, so both cities could be west of the Mississippi River.</p>
<p>Bettman said he anticipates a decision in three to four weeks. He also said&nbsp;the NHL has not yet selected cities because “things are rapidly evolving” and “we want it to be based on the best-available information at the time.”</p>
<p>Bettman added the hub cities will ultimately be chosen based on “COVID-19 conditions, testing availability and government regulations.” Allegheny&nbsp;County Executive Rich Fitzgerald says the region is in relatively good shape there.</p>
<p>“As we are starting to open up, in the yellow [phase] and hopefully we’ll be green in a couple more days, we’ve seen our numbers remain low even as we went into yellow,” Fitzgerald said Wednesday, a day when Western Pennsylvania reported two new COVID-19 deaths. “I think this will be a good boost and a shot in the arm for this region to see something like that come here.”</p>
<p>Other NHL markets in contention are Chicago, Columbus, Dallas, Edmonton, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Toronto and Vancouver.</p>
<p>“We knew there would be competition,” McMillan said. “There’s a lot of good cities. Everybody has their selling points. We think ours are very strong.”</p>
<p>Added Morehouse: “Obviously, we think Pittsburgh’s the best hockey town in the country. We’re honored to be a finalist, and we’d love to be chosen.”</p>
<p>The NHL is certainly no stranger when it comes to hockey in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>Since PPG Paints Arena opened in 2010, the Penguins have hosted an NHL draft, World Cup of Hockey games and the NCAA’s Frozen Four. You may recall there being a couple of Stanley Cup finals in the building too. Plus, in the past decade, the Penguins put on two outdoor games at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>But this hurried process was unlike bidding for those events.</p>
<p>“It’s not the kind of annual bid you make where you know all these categories,” McMillan said. “We didn’t have much time. It’s a very complicated, one-of-its-kind scenario. Our whole senior staff was involved. We kind of dropped everything for a while and were just working to put this together very quickly.”</p>
<p>In the PowerPoint presentation Morehouse gave to league decision-makers, the Penguins highlighted their experience hosting big-time hockey events.&nbsp;PPG Paints Arena and the City of Pittsburgh met the league’s requirements for things such as NHL-caliber locker rooms, team meeting space, available practice ice in the area and the number and quality of hotels downtown.</p>
<p>“They’re very familiar with and comfortable working in our environment,” McMillan said. “We knew that would be a plus. There would be no question marks in their mind that we would be able to pull this off logistically.”</p>
<p>The Penguins also made sure to tout their partnership with UPMC. The team’s practice facility in Cranberry, UPMC Lemieux Sports Complex, is the NHL’s only practice rink in the same building as a medical facility.</p>
<p>“We have access to their doctors and their specialists and their infectious disease specialists,” McMillan said.</p>
<p>For safety reasons, fans are not expected to be allowed in the hub arenas, so Pittsburgh being selected should not cause a major logistical headache amid a pandemic when it comes to public transportation and larger crowds.</p>
<p>The NHL has indicated each team will be allowed a traveling party of 50. It has not been decided whether families will be permitted to stay with players and team employees in hotels. Assuming they are not, and also factoring in essential NHL employees, that should be fewer than 1,000 people here.</p>
<p>“They’ve got a pretty good plan in place,” Fitzgerald said. “I think the state feels comfortable with it. We certainly feel comfortable with it locally. … This isn’t like what they’re talking about in Charlotte, bringing in 50,000 people in for the Republican convention or something like that.”</p>
<p>Still, the Penguins needed buy-in from political and business leaders as the city was designing its own plans to eventually emerge from the pandemic.</p>
<p>“There’s a lot of cooperation here. They’re not on an island,” Fitzgerald said. “The city, the county, our health people, our VisitPittsburgh and our hotel industry, everybody’s kind of working together to make it work as best we can.”</p>
<p>That includes Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto, who on Tuesday issued this statement: “The city supports the NHL getting back to business safely. Our focus is on resuming activities in a way that is safe for fans, players, residents and all personnel.”</p>
<p>Now, the city awaits word on whether it will host another major hockey event.</p>
<p>“What a great thing it would be for not only the Penguins, but the city, to be on the forefront of starting to come out of this,” McMillan said.</p>
<p>“We’ve got great support from the business community and our political leaders, and, obviously, we think Pittsburgh’s the best hockey town in the country,” Morehouse said. “We’re honored to be a finalist and we’d love to be chosen as one of the hub cities.”</p>
