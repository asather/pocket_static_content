<h1>ACLU urges Pa. officials to collect, release race, ethic data of COVID-19 cases</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In nearly three-quarters of Pennsylvania’s COVID-19 cases, the infected person’s race and ethnicity is unknown — an&nbsp;“unacceptable” statistic during the pandemic, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania told commonwealth officials Wednesday.</p>
<p>The organization sent a letter to Gov. Tom Wolf and Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine emphasizing that the absence of demographic data makes it&nbsp;“difficult to fully understand COVID-19’s impact on Black and brown Pennsylvanians” who disproportionately experience poorer health, social and economic outcomes than other segments of the population.</p>
<p>“While public health officials recommend working from home to stop the spread of the virus, only 20 percent of Black workers and 16 percent of Latino workers are able to work from home. ...&nbsp;Black people are also more likely to be uninsured and live in communities without access to quality healthcare facilities, leading to disproportionate rates of chronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, and diabetes,” the letter stated, citing Bureau of Labor statistics and a <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/04/07/coronavirus-is-infecting-killing-black-americans-an-alarmingly-high-rate-post-analysis-shows/?arc404=true" target="_blank">Washington Post analysis</a>.</p>
<p>“Given the vast disparities across the country, it is likely that Black people and other communities of color are dying disproportionately in Pennsylvania, too. In order to effectively address this pandemic and direct resources where they are most needed, government officials and entities must standardize, collect, and release race and ethnicity data surrounding COVID-19,” the letter later continued.</p>
<p>The availability of racial or ethnic data in cases of the novel coronavirus at the county level has been <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/health/coronavirus/spl/coronavirus-covid-19-demographic-data-pennsylvania-geographic-race-20200417.html" target="_blank">released in piecemeal fashion across Pennsylvania</a>, as reported by Spotlight PA, a collaboration between the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the Philadelphia Inquirer and Penn Live/Patriot News.</p>
<p>Allegheny County, which has its own health department, includes race and ethnicity&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alleghenycounty.us/Health-Department/Resources/COVID-19/COVID-19.aspx" target="_blank">in its reporting</a>, though that information remains unknown in 30% of the county’s 1,088 cases as of Wednesday. Sixteen percent, or 173 cases, were among black residents. The black population of Allegheny County is 13.4%.</p>
<p>Nationwide, as of April 15, only 33 states and the District of Columbia were reporting race and ethnicity data of confirmed COVID-19 cases and deaths, according to the <a href="https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-policy-watch/growing-data-underscore-communities-color-harder-hit-covid-19/" target="_blank">Kaiser Health News tracker</a>.</p>
<p>The state’s Department of Health sent a notice last week to health care providers urging them to collect race and ethnicity among other demographics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We hope that this will increase race and ethnicity data being reported through the laboratories to the department. We are also looking to work through other means to have access to demographic data for those who already have been tested,” said Nate Wardle, department spokesman.</p>
<p>The ACLU of Pennsylvania briefly noted privacy concerns over locations of COVID-19 cases shared by state and county health officials with police, fire and paramedics.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“[W]e know from other states that COVID-19 is disproportionately impacting people of color, so now the government is going to identify and isolate those communities,” a written statement from Andy Hoover, the organization’s spokesman, read in part.</p>
<p>Emergency management officials are required to sign an agreement to not disclose this information outside of the intended use, Mr. Wardle said in response to the concern.</p>
<p>Allegheny County announced on March 31 that the addresses of COVID-19 cases would be flagged in the county’s 911 system for 30 days so as to alert first responders.</p>
