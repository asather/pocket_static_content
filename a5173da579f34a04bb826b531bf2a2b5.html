<h1>Cleveland-to-Pittsburgh would be a big link in cross-country rail trail</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Connecting Pittsburgh to Cleveland by trail could be very good for both metro areas and people who live in them as well as elsewhere around the region and beyond. And not just for their legs and lungs and moods, but also for the health of local economies and communities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That’s the main point of a new study released this week by people working to complete that connection and others on both a regional and a national network of trails. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some of the 220-mile Cleveland-to-Pittsburgh Corridor, or “C2P” for now, is to be part of the Great American Rail-Trail, one that the national Rails-to-Trails Conservancy announced in May&nbsp;<a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/life/recreation/2019/05/08/Great-American-Rail-Trail-Pittsburgh-bike-cross-country-route-Allegheny-Passage/stories/201905030099" target="_blank">is to eventually come through Pittsburgh</a> on its 3,700-mile run from Washington, D.C., through a dozen states to the Pacific Ocean in Washington state.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This C2P route also is part of&nbsp;a 1,500-miles-plus multiuse trail network that stretches across 51 counties in Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York and West Virginia that’s being pursued by 100-plus groups in the Industrial Heartland Trails Coalition. The regional network is one of RTC’s TrailNation projects designed to demonstrate the positive outcomes that trail networks deliver to every type of community.</p>
<p>“This is a world-class opportunity that will create a destination for people nationwide, and that is exciting,” said Eric&nbsp;Oberg, the RTC’s Midwest Region director, at a Wednesday meeting that had been planned for Historic Fort Steuben in Steubenville, Ohio, but was moved online due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A 28-mile stretch west of Steubenville and a 4-mile stretch east of there to Weirton, W.Va., are two of seven remaining gaps identified by the study, which includes very detailed maps of completed and uncompleted trail. As Mr. Oberg stressed,&nbsp;“Seventy-five percent of this corridor [is] already down on the ground,” including the Panhandle Trail between Weirton and Collier and, from there through Coraopolis, the Montour Trail. Another 6.2-mile gap to be filled would link that stretch to Pittsburgh’s Three Rivers Heritage Trail and the Great Allegheny Passage that connects by trail all the way to Washington, D.C.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh trail town entrepreneur&nbsp;Tom Demagall testified about how connecting from the city’s trails to the GAP trail grew his Downtown Golden Triangle Bike business —&nbsp;“a travel agency that looks like a bike shop” — into one that helps about 1,000 tourists a year ride the GAP. Usually retirees fly in, mostly from the West Coast and West, but from as far away as Australia, to avail themselves of Golden Triangle’s services, which now support 10-plus employees and many more users of the trails. Connecting to Cleveland, he said,&nbsp;“can make it possible for businesses like mine to exist anywhere” along that route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Joe Sciarretti — a Tuscarawas County, Ohio, Commissioner — passionately spoke about how hopeful he is for a hookup with his local Ohio &amp; Erie Canal Towpath Trail, where users already spend $7 million a year. RTC says usage and spending grow with more connectivity. There are two choices for that connection through or near New Philadelphia, Ohio. Finishing two other short gaps at Cleveland would take the corridor to Lake Erie — from the Allegheny and Ohio rivers. When finished, the trail would be given a “more marketable” name.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RTC trail planner Leah Garber, who helped write the planning study with support from Pittsburgh’s Claude Worthington Benedum Foundation and others, said there is no timetable for completing the whole route, but she said many individual projects along the way do have timetables. The study gives specific recommendations on how local groups can complete the missing pieces and estimates the millions of dollars that will cost to do and to maintain. As Mr. Oberg noted,&nbsp;“This is a BIG undertaking.”</p>
<p>But there are big benefits, too. Trails are “important drivers of community and economic development ... People want to live in communities with access to trails,” noted consultant Kent Spellman, one of the West Virginia pistons pushing a Parkersburg-to-Pittsburgh, or P2P, trail. He invited people who want to help to connect with their local trail groups, “because that’s what makes this happen.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting acknowledged all the trail-blazing work many people have put in over the past 30 years and teased other corridors that are moving forward, including one connecting Pittsburgh with Ashtabula, Ohio — a study on which RTC plans to release in a year or so.&nbsp;</p>
