<h1>Joint task force of Pa. and federal authorities will investigate virus-related fraud</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady and state Attorney General Josh Shapiro have created a joint task force to pursue fraud related to the coronavirus.</p>
<p>The top prosecutors announced the task force Thursday, saying it will bring together state and federal agencies to receive information on scams related to the virus, with prosecutors cross-designated to work on investigations together.</p>
<p>The task force will be led by Assistant U.S. Attorney Shaun Sweeney and an executive deputy attorney general.</p>
<p>In addition to the prosecutors' offices, the agencies on the task force are the FBI, the U.S. Secret Service, U.S. postal inspectors, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Social Security Administration's inspector general, the U.S. Department of Education's inspector general and the state police.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady said that he and Mr. Shapiro have been in contact throughout the crisis and decided to create the task force to protect the public from fraudsters exploiting the outbreak.</p>
<p>"Bad guys should know we are open for business," Mr. Brady said in a statement. "We will find you and we will stop you."</p>
<p>Mr. Shapiro said it's "despicable that retailers, distributors and wholesalers are taking advantage of people" during the crisis and said that the new task force will combat them.</p>
<p>The two prosecutors said fraudsters have been setting up websites to sell bogus products and are using fake emails, texts and social media posts to take people's money or steal personal information.</p>
<p>The emails and posts may promote awareness and prevention or include fake information about virus cases in someone's neighborhood. Some ask for donations or offer advice on unproven treatments, or contain malicious email attachments as part of phishing scams.</p>
<p>In some cases, scammers are posing as doctors and hospitals and stating that they have treated someone with the virus and then demand payment. Scammers are also posing as World Health Organization or Centers for Disease Control authorities in sending phishing emails.</p>
<p>Yet another fraud is related to the stock market in which scammers offer online promotions claiming that products of publicly traded companies can prevent or cure the virus and that the stock of those companies will increase.</p>
<p>Mr. Brady and Mr. Shapiro also warned about price gouging in which businesses sell goods such as hand sanitizer at inflated prices, defined as 20 percent or more above the price it was one week before the state declared an emergency.</p>
<p>They also offered numerous tips, including not opening suspicious emails with addresses that differ only slightly from those sent from real organizations. As an example, scammers might use "cdc.com" in the address for the Centers for Disease Control when the real address is cdc.gov.</p>
<p>The prosecutors also encouraged citizens to ignore offers of cures or vaccines.</p>
<p>"Remember," they said, "if there is a medical breakthrough, you won't hear about it for the first time through an email, online ad or unsolicited sales pitch."</p>
<p>The task force has set up a toll free hotline and an email address to collect suspected fraud. The hotline is: 1-888-C19-WDPA, or 1-888-219-9372. The website is: usapaw.covid19@usdoj.gov</p>
<p>The state attorney general has also set up a web address to report price gouging: pricegouging@attorneygeneral.gov</p>
