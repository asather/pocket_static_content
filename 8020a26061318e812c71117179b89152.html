<h1>Joe Starkey’s mailbag: Will losing streak help Mike Sullivan get his points across?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Lee Lacy and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions …</em></p>
<p><strong>jase4668, @jase4668:</strong> Do you think the Penguins (even though supposed to be professionals) are just not listening to Sully, and everyone is just doing their own trying to be hero so to speak out of desperation?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I know this, Mr. jase4668: The Penguins haven’t been playing well since their endless break (All-Star game, off week) in late January, even in many of their wins. Mike Sullivan knows that, too, and I choose to believe that deep down he might be glad the Penguins hit rock bottom in San Jose.</p>
<p>There is nothing like a hideous losing streak to help a coach get his points across. Getting back two of his best defensive players (Brian Dumoulin, John Marino) will surely help, as well.</p>
<p>The 5-1 win over Detroit was a prime example of winning ugly, as the Penguins gifted the Red Wings many a glorious chance. Really good goaltending helped mask the club’s diminishing defensive work in early February. That isn’t happening anymore, now that the goaltending has slipped, as well.</p>
<p>So, what happened coming out of the break — other than perhaps finally feeling the affects of all the injuries?</p>
<p>Could be any number of issues, from the toll of an endless season to (in perhaps a related issue) a lack of “commitment” to the defensive side of the game, as Sullivan noted after a recent loss. Let’s be real: It’s hard to stay fully committed, at playoff-level intensity, for 82 games. The commitment clearly waned. The break might have taken the edge off the Penguins’ game. Trips to Florida and California might have contributed. Who knows?</p>
<p>What I do know is this: It’s impossible to manufacture “desperation” when you’re not desperate. Sullivan spoke Monday of his team’s “mindset” needing to change. Their current circumstances should take care of that.</p>
<p>Marino and Dumoulin will help a lot, too.</p>
<p><strong>christopher manning, @christo53294495:</strong> Tomlin’s coaching tree is shaped like a telephone pole. What’s this say about him?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Interesting question, Mr. Manning, but could you first define for me a “coaching tree”? As in, who, exactly, qualifies? Is it anyone who worked for the coach? Anyone the coach hired or promoted?</p>
<p>Is Charlie Weis part of Bill Belichick’s “coaching tree?” ‘Cause Weis worked a whole bunch of places before he got to New England. Bill Parcells hired him as a New York Giants assistant in 1990, so is he actually part of Parcell’s coaching tree? Parcells hired Romeo Crennel, too, yet both Crennel and Weis and many others are considered branches in Belichick’s “tree.”</p>
<p>Is Mike Munchak part of Tomlin’s tree, even though Munchak was a head coach in the NFL before that? How about Todd Haley? Or is it just guys you bring into the NFL? If it were that, a lot of coaching trees would be bare. Belichick himself worked for the Browns, Lions and Broncos before the Giants hired him, but he is considered the crown jewel of Parcells’ coaching tree.</p>
<p>Is it just the guys to whom you give their first coordinator job?</p>
<p>Seems to me, Tomlin either chose to keep coaches who were already here (prime examples: LeBeau, Bruce Arians, who was promoted, and Keith Butler, who was promoted), hired older assistants (Munchak, Haley) or went with guys he knew and liked. Joey Porter and Randy Fichtner are examples of the latter — and both are lightning rods.</p>
<p>Porter was a bad hire. The jury remains out on Fichtner. Two years ago, when the Steelers had their third-highest offensive rank (points scored) since 1980, people didn’t complain much. Last year they did.</p>
<p>What’s all this say about Tomlin? I suppose it says that for the most part, he has favored age and experience in his primary assistants.</p>
<p><strong>Chris Hawthorne, @Hawthorneee:</strong> Do you believe the Pirates when they say they aren’t rebuilding? If so, why?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Of course not, Dr. Hawthorne. Ben Cherington has basically said the Pirates need players, all kinds of players, everywhere in the system. You don’t need a team of linguists to translate that, do you?</p>
<p><em>THEY ARE REBUILDING.</em></p>
<p>There. I said it. Trading Starling Marte for two children screams they are rebuilding — and only makes sense if the Pirates follow up with more trades of that ilk. I believe they will. I believe if players such as Chris Archer, Gregory Polanco, Keone Kela and others perform early in the season, they will be dealt.</p>
<p>If the idea is to flood the system with talent, then you better open the hoses. And that can only mean more trades. I guess it would be nice if the Pirates told the world they were “rebuilding,” but does it really matter</p>
<p>It’s obvious.</p>
<p><strong>Duce Snedeker, @Duce1966:</strong> Does @KDPomp still have a woodpecker problem?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Near as I can tell Duce, Bob has solved his woodpecker problem. All good. No more woodpecker.</p>
<p><strong>Larry VANALLEN, @LarryVanallen:</strong> Joe what are your D pairings if Dumo and Marino are back?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> The obvious, I suppose:</p>
<p>Dumoulin-Letang</p>
<p>Pettersson-Marino</p>
<p>Johnson-Schultz</p>
<p>Having said that, a few points:</p>
<p>1. Sullivan should not, and will not, hesitate to use Chad Ruhwedel on that third pair, because that pair is one that will be targeted by opposing teams in a playoff series. Hopefully, for the Penguins’ sake, Jack Johnson finds his game in a diminished-minutes role and Justin Schultz regains his confidence.</p>
<p>2. The Penguins should have acquired a left-handed defenseman at the deadline. Ron Hainsey would have been a nice choice. Can’t have enough depth on defense. It’s hard to believe the price would have been exorbitant. Hainsey certainly would have provided good insurance.</p>
<p><strong>Bobby Cole:</strong> Would you rather the Pirates have a $200 million payroll or the best analytics in baseball?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Give me the money, Bobby. Everybody thinks their analytics are a cut above the rest. The Astros were praised as the analytics kings. Then we discovered they won the World Series by banging on trash cans.</p>
<p><strong>David, @djbst75:</strong> What is the meaning of life ?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Can I get back to you on that?</p>
