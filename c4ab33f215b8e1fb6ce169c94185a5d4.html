<h1>Bob Casey, 17 other Democratic senators call for government payments to Americans</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As lawmakers in Washington consider new legislative options that would put money directly into the hands of taxpayers who are feeling the financial impacts of COVID-19, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey joined a group of Democratic colleagues on Wednesday to urge the government to give each American $2,000 in the coming weeks, followed by scaled-down payments as the spread of the virus continues.</p>
<p>In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Mr. Casey and 17 other Democrats wrote that to quell the “economic shock” caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus, the government must pump money directly to the workers and families who need it most.</p>
<p>“We must provide direct cash support to the American workers and families who need it most — to help them purchase essentials; pay the rent, mortgage, and bills; and otherwise weather the coming weeks and months,” the senators wrote.</p>

<p>The first payment under the Democrats’ proposal would cover mid-March through June, and equate to $2,000 per person administered through tax returns and payments through benefit and government assistance programs.</p>
<p>A second payment would be triggered if the public health emergency continues, or if unemployment remains at least 1% higher than it was in the months before the virus hit, and equal $1,500 per person.</p>
<p>Payments of $1,000 per quarter would continue until unemployment drops to less than 0.5% above the pre-virus levels, the senators wrote.</p>
<p>“All of the changes being developed by the Democratic Leadership are necessary,” the senators wrote. “These economic support payments are intended to supplement that plan.”</p>
<p>According to a New York Times review of a White House memo, the Trump administration is asking Congress to allocate $500 billion for two separate waves of payments directly to taxpayers in the coming weeks — a proposal that is being considered, among other proposals, by Congressional legislators. The Senate is expected to vote Wednesday on a different package that would aid workers and the health care system.</p>
