<h1>Observations from Penguins scrimmage: Sidney Crosby still out, third line gets grimy</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>After four months at home watching Netflix, scrimmages are important for all the Penguins, sure. But coach Mike Sullivan made an interesting comment this week when he said the goalies, in particular, would benefit most from the live reps.</p>
<p>So maybe that's the best place to start when breaking down Thursday night's scrimmage. Both goalies allowed three goals during the five-on-five segment. Matt Murray let in one during special teams work to Tristan Jarry’s two.</p>
<p>Sullivan, whom you will almost never hear criticize his own players, said he thought both goalies played well. However, he chose to play both 1 and 1A netminders for the entire scrimmage to give them the full benefit of seeing all those extra reps.</p>
<p>“We thought they needed that workload to continue to sharpen their games,” Sullivan said. “Certainly, in my mind and in the coaching staff’s opinion, both goalies are tracking the right way.”</p>
<p>Murray was <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/07/18/Penguins-scrimmage-Matt-Murray-Tristan-Jarry-Sidney-Crosby-Jake-Guentzel/stories/202007180048" target="_blank">clearly out of sorts</a> during the first scrimmage, allowing seven goals. He’s looked better since, but never sparkling. The same wonky glove hand that's been his kryptonite got him during the special teams segment. Jared McCann used time, space and one of the best wrist shots on the team to burn Murray.</p>
<p>Another miscue came when Murray tried to make an aggressive move to poke check the puck away from Zach Aston-Reese. It landed on Teddy Blueger’s stick instead and then wound up in the back of the net.</p>
<p>Murray’s best save of the night came in the third period. Sam Lafferty, who has been having a great camp, knocked the lanky goalie over as he drove to the net. Murray, from practically inside his own goal, made the save on Anthony Angello. Even Jarry had to offer up a stick tap for that one.</p>
<p>Jarry’s shining moment, meanwhile, highlighted one of his best attributes: his ability to play the puck. As the puck scooted down the rink, Evgeni Malkin raced ahead for what could have been a breakaway. But Jarry came way out to the top of the circles to swat the puck away with an aggressive move. The weakest of the three goals came during a scramble in front of the net during the special teams segment.</p>
<p>“They’re going through the process of trying to capture their best game,” Sullivan said. “That’s what we’re all trying to do under unique circumstances.”</p>
<p><strong>Sidney Crosby absent again</strong></p>
<p>Crosby skated individually prior to Thursday night’s scrimmage, per Sullivan. It was at least the second day in a row he’s been on the ice alone.</p>
<p>The Penguins captain has not joined the team in a full capacity since leaving Saturday’s scrimmage in the second period. Time is ticking before the first game on Aug. 1.</p>
<p>The Penguins practice on Friday, scrimmage Saturday and leave for Toronto on Sunday. Live action in the bubble starts Tuesday with a scrimmage against the Flyers.</p>
<p>Evan Rodrigues filled in again for the captain. It seems if the Penguins were expecting a prolonged absence from the captain, they’d shuffle the lines more significantly. But who knows these days.</p>
<p><strong>The third line gets grimy — and that’s a good thing</strong></p>
<p>A line that has Patric Hornqvist on it will, by its very nature, have a little bit of grease to it. Thursday showed perhaps some of what can be expected from a new-look third line.</p>
<p>The trio featuring Hornqvist at right wing, McCann at center and Patrick Marleau on the left got the puck to the front of the net and McCann shoveled it past Jarry for one goal. They scored another grimy one in the second period when Marleau banked a wraparound off of defenseman Kevin Czuczman’s skate.</p>
<p>In the postseason, they won’t all be beauties. This line seems like the one that could lead the team in clunkers, in a good way.</p>
<p><strong>The speed around Malkin is noticeable</strong></p>
<p>Malkin enjoyed a bounce-back year and Bryan Rust had a career year when they were together this season. Now in camp, they’re working to develop quick chemistry with new linemate Jason Zucker.</p>
<p>An early goal showed why that trio should work with a combination of speed and skill. Malkin had the puck on a string all scrimmage, skating through players with ease in the neutral zone. But on this play, he instead caught the opponent off guard by redirecting a puck in deep.</p>
<p>Zucker and Rust, two of the fastest players on the team, went screaming in behind the net. Rust retrieved it. Zucker finished. Remember that play. It might be something you see again this postseason.</p>
<p><strong>Conor Sheary showing flashes of old</strong></p>
<p>At a time when everyone would love to forget about 2020, Sheary is bringing back memories of 2017. Reunited with Jake Guentzel, the old chemistry looks like it’s coming back.</p>
<p>That duo, even sans Sid, has combined on a number of goals during scrimmages, including one on Thursday night when Guentzel won a battle along the boards and fed the puck to Sheary on a 2-on-1.</p>
<p>“We’ve always felt strongly that Conor’s game suits the style of play that we’re trying to play here in Pittsburgh,” Sullivan said. “He thrives in those areas of the rink where we think a lot of our top players are good at. We think he’s a real good complimentary player with our star players. That’s one of the reasons [general manager Jim Rutherford] went out and reacquired him at the deadline.”</p>
<p><strong>So much for the power play using camp to find continuity</strong></p>
<p>The Penguins power play fluctuated between inconsistent and anemic in the first season without Phil Kessel manning the left circle. If we want to give them an excuse, it’s that every single member of the top unit was injured for a significant stretch, including Crosby, Malkin, Hornqvist, Guentzel, Kris Letang and Justin Schultz.</p>
<p>After a four-month pause, this training camp was supposed to be a time for everyone to come in healthy with a clean slate. Yeah ... about that. It didn’t happen. All five regulars have yet to skate together, with Hornqvist missing the first week and a half and now Crosby out since Saturday.</p>
<p>One big question has been, will McCann stay with the top unit when everyone is healthy? It’s easy to see what Sullivan likes about him there. With arguably the biggest shot on the team and a grip-it-and-rip-it mentality, he’ll create chances and chaos. But when Crosby comes back, who is the odd man out?</p>
<p><strong>Maybe Teddy Blueger’s extra work is paying off</strong></p>
<p>Midway through the second period, Murray tried to poke check the puck away from Aston-Reese. It bounced right to Blueger, who buried it. Good luck? Or maybe something more?</p>
<p>Blueger took the long road to the NHL. Drafted in the second round in 2012, the Latvian played four years of college hockey at Minnesota State University and parts of four seasons in Wilkes-Barre/Scranton.</p>
<p>Through it all, coaches have consistently praised his work ethic. It’s obvious at practice. He’s almost always the last one off the ice, working on some small aspect of his game.</p>
<p>Maybe all that work is paying off.</p>
