<h1>Allegheny County reports 90 new COVID-19 cases, largest daily increase</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The number of reported COVID-19 cases in Allegheny County skyrocketed by 90 in the health department’s report Saturday —&nbsp;the first time since April 23 there has been a single-day increase of more than 60 cases and doubling the 45 cases recorded Monday and Wednesday, which had been the highest single-day increases since May 7 when the county was still in the red phase of shutdown.</p>
<p>Over the last eight days of being in the green phase, Allegheny County has experienced an increase of 334 new cases as reported by the county health department. Of the 90 new cases reported Saturday, 77% are in the 19 to 49 age groups — 38 between the ages of 19-24&nbsp;and 31 between the ages of 25-49. The cases will be assigned to case investigators to gather information from those individuals and then contact tracing will begin, the county said.</p>

<p>Since March 14, there have been been 2,472 reported cases in Allegheny County&nbsp;— 2,329 confirmed and 143 probable. Of all those cases, the largest percentage, 35%, are clustered in the 25-29 age range. There was no change in the county’s death toll which remains at 186, with 174 confirmed and 12 probable.</p>
<p>There were two additional hospitalizations as a result of the virus, bringing the total to 381 past or present hospitalizations.</p>
<p>The Saturday report by the Pennsylvania Department of Health is pending. As of Friday, out of the 20 counties in Western Pennsylvania, Allegheny County had the highest increase in positive cases, 61, and Erie County had the second highest, 13, from the previous day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials on Friday reported 600 new cases of COVID-19 and 22 new deaths, with Western Pennsylvania accounting for 107 total diagnoses.</p>
<p>The total number of cases statewide as of Friday was 84,370 since the pandemic started in March.</p>
<p>Case investigators reported to the county health department that of the new positive cases, some had reported traveling to various parts of the country. Myrtle Beach, Houston, Nashville, Miami, Tampa and Naples, Fla., were all mentioned multiple times. However, the department said they “have not identified any apparent clusters in the travel destinations or activities.”</p>
<p>According to data released by the health department, 15 different bars and restaurants were mentioned to case investigators by people who tested positive and either visited or worked in the establishments. Of those bars and restaurants, five were mentioned frequently.</p>
<p>Smaller numbers of the new cases reported being at church, with families or at protests.</p>
<p>As of Friday, there were only two counties in Western Pennsylvania reporting new deaths due to the virus — Allegheny and Erie — with one death each. Allegheny’s health department, separately from the state, reported that two more people had died from the disease, making the total 186. As of Friday, the state total for Allegheny was 183 deaths.</p>
<p>Statewide, the total number of deaths rose by 22, bringing the new total to 6,579.</p>
<p>State health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Friday that officials are looking closely at areas where COVID-19 infection rates and deaths are ticking back up, threatening to turn back progress against the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We are doing a ‘deep dive’ into all of the counties that have had increases,” Dr. Levine said, warning that “community spread” is occurring in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>The rise may be attributable to the gradual reopening that has been taking place in Pennsylvania, as well as more extensive testing, she said.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration will allow Lebanon County to move from the yellow phase to the less-restrictive green phase by the end of next week, Dr. Levine said. It will be the final county in Pennsylvania to do so.</p>
