<h1>Maryland announces gradual reopening</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan will begin gradually reopening the state this weekend, while District of Columbia Mayor Muriel Bowser extended the city’s stay-home order and closure of nonessential businesses through June 8.</p>
<p>Maryland and Virginia will ease restrictions in the coming days to allow some institutions to reopen with strict social distancing measures. Virginia has exempted hard-hit northern Virginia from the first phase of reopening, and both states are allowing local leaders to opt out.</p>
<p>Hogan’s move from a stay-home order to a “safer-at-home” advisory followed a two-week, statewide plateau in hospitalizations for coronavirus patients, as well as increasing pressure on governors nationwide to reignite economies that have been brought to a standstill.</p>
<p><a style="display: block; width: 100%; font-family: 'proxima-nova'; font-size: 15px; text-align: center; float: left; margin: 30px 30px 30px 0; text-decoration: none; color: #222;" href="https://promo.post-gazette.com/articleoffer" target="_blank;"> <img style="width: 100%;" src="https://liber.post-gazette.com/image/2020/03/17/covid-19-free-coverage-banner-insert-coronavirus-new" alt="Click to subscribe"> </a></p>
<p>“The fight against this deadly disease is far from over,” Hogan, a Republican, said at a news conference Wednesday. “But Maryland and our nation can begin to slowly recover.”</p>
<p>Beginning at 5 p.m. Friday, barber shops and nail salons can reopen to serve clients by appointment only, and manufacturers may resume operations with social distancing measures in place.</p>
<p>Non-essential stores and houses of worship will be allowed to operate at 50% capacity and with distancing restrictions - unless their local governments deem it unsafe.</p>
<p>Leaders of Montgomery and Prince George’s counties say they plan to stay closed for now. They are among the state’s four largest jurisdictions, which are home to 70% of known coronavirus infections. Top officials in the other two, Baltimore City and Baltimore County, said they will decide by Thursday evening whether to reopen.</p>
<p>Bowser, a Democrat, said D.C. has not seen the sustained decline in the spread of the novel coronavirus that would have been needed to lift restrictions that were set to expire Saturday.</p>
<p>“The number of new daily cases of COVID-19 diagnoses has yet to fall and the number of daily deaths has failed to decline,” Bowser’s new order says, referring to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. “It is therefore necessary to maintain our vigilance, to avoid a rapid increase in the occurrence of new cases and a spike in the number of fatalities, and to protect the public health, safety, and welfare of District residents.”</p>
<p>Effective Saturday, the order also requires residents and visitors to wear face coverings when out in public near others, with exceptions for young children and homeless people, people with disabilities and those who are exercising or walking, provided they stay at least six feet away from others.</p>
<p>Essential businesses must provide masks to workers and bar entry to customers who do not wear face coverings.</p>
<p>The mayor said she might lift restrictions before June 8 if the spread of the virus slows quicker than expected - but also could extend them again if needed.</p>
<p>Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, this week extended northern Virginia’s shutdown until at least May 28.</p>
<p>Starting Friday, he is expected to allow the rest of the state to resume indoor worship services of more than 10 people, outdoor dining at restaurants, outdoor exercise classes and shopping at nonessential stops - all with strict cleaning and social distancing requirements.</p>
<p>“We’re in a position to enter Phase 1 because we have the hospital capacity, because we have [personal protective equipment], because we have the testing capabilities,” Northam said Wednesday.</p>
<p>The Virginia Legislative Black Caucus sent him a letter Wednesday urging against reopening, which it said could especially hurt African Americans who have disproportionately died of the virus.</p>
<p>“Under the current plan, and with the already existent racial disparities that this pandemic and economic crisis are perpetuating, we will be creating a situation where Black and Brown Virginians outside of Northern Virginia will become guinea pigs for our economy,” the caucus wrote.</p>
<p>In response, a spokeswoman for Northam said he was committed to protecting low-income people and communities of color while reopening.</p>
<p>The COVID-19 death toll in D.C., Maryland and Virginia passed 3,000 on Wednesday after government health departments reported 103 new fatalities.</p>
<p>The deaths include 14 in D.C. and three dozen in Virginia, including nine in Fairfax County, seven in Prince William County and three in Arlington. Maryland disclosed 53 fatalities, with Montgomery and Prince George’s Counties reporting 15 and 16 new deaths, respectively.</p>
<p>Known infections in Prince George’s passed 10,000, the most of any jurisdiction in the greater Washington area.</p>
<p>Maryland also reported that the number of coronavirus-related deaths among residents and employees at nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and group homes has risen to 995, up from 804 the week before.</p>
<p>According to a Washington Post analysis, half of the 372 fatalities reported by the state since May 6 involved residents or staff members at long-term care facilities. In Montgomery, the state’s most populous jurisdiction, 294 deaths - or nearly 70% of its total - are linked to long-term care facilities. This is significantly higher than neighboring Prince George’s, where about 37% of COVID-19 deaths are linked to nursing homes.</p>
<p>Some activists demanding Maryland’s reopening say they will stage another protest in Annapolis to urge Hogan to lift restrictions more quickly.</p>
<p>“We’re doing what’s right for our communities based on the circumstances that we see on the ground,” said Arlington County Board Chair Christian Dorsey at a Wednesday meeting of the Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments.</p>
<p>He said regional coordination was essential to recovering from the pandemic: “Being blind is going to make our communities worse off.”</p>
<p>Maryland’s announcement gave local leaders 48 hours to decide whether to lift the restrictions.</p>
<p>Anne Arundel County Executive Steuart Pittman, a Democrat, said he plans to review the county’s metrics with health officials and before announcing his plans. He said the county has been “holding steady” on hospitalizations, which is “good news, but not great news” and that the county’s supply of protective equipment is “not at the 14-day supply level that we’d like to see.”</p>
<p>Cecil County Executive Alan McCarthy, a Republican, said he will create his own plan to gradually reopen, to be announced Friday afternoon. “I will not expose our citizens to unnecessary risks,” he said.</p>
<p>Not all Maryland business owners, even in areas with few COVID-19 cases, are clamoring to ease restrictions.</p>
<p>Joan Nubie-Miscall, who owns The Treasure Chest in Oxford, recently ordered new paper shopping bags and moved furniture to ensure that customers can keep their distance.</p>
<p>But the prospect of opening her doors for the first time since March still makes her uneasy. Her shop is 850 square feet, and her customers tend to be older.</p>
<p>“I know I cannot let my guard down and think that we are safe here,” she said. “While there aren’t many cases locally, I just do not know where people are coming from, and that is scary.”</p>
<p>Other Maryland business owners said they were torn between the need to pay to bills and protect their health.</p>
<p>Ula Somwaru, the owner of Tease Hair Salon in Silver Spring, said she has been taking steps to reopen her shop with temperature checks and staggered appointments. But she respects that Montgomery County officials are not ready.</p>
<p>“They have to have all the medical facts and if the numbers are going up and it’s not safe, then I would have to listen to them,” said Somwaru, 72. “I am losing money, but health - to me - and safety come first.”</p>
<p>Even as he announced steps for recovery, Hogan warned residents that the danger from the pandemic has not passed.</p>
<p>“If everybody goes crazy and does things that are unsafe, we’re going to balloon back up and slow down the process,” he said. “If everybody responds responsibly, we’ll be able to move forward quicker.”</p>
