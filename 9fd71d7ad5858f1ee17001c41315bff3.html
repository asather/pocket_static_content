<h1>Pirates sign reliever Robbie Erlin to minor league deal</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pirates on Wednesday signed left-handed reliever Robbie Erlin to a minor league contract with an invite to spring training.</p>
<p>Bob Nightengale of USA Today Sports <a href="https://twitter.com/BNightengale/status/1222672497981607936" target="_blank">first reported the signing</a>. If the 29-year-old former Padres hurler makes the big league roster, he will make $1.5 million, with $100,000 in incentives. Erlin can opt out of the deal if he doesn't make the opening day roster.</p>
<p>The Rangers drafted Erlin in the third round of the 2009 draft. Like many pitchers, he began his career as a starter but later caught on as a reliever.</p>
<p>Erlin, who had Tommy John surgery in 2016, had his best season in 2018 with 44 strikeouts and 2.05 ERA across his 52⅔&nbsp;innings of relief. He also made 12 starts and posted an overall record of 4-7. The next season wasn’t so kind, as Erlin posted a 5.37 ERA in 2019.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ 40-man roster currently sits at 39 players. Sam Howard is the only other left-handed reliever on the 40-man. Steven Brault, another lefty, is expected to compete for a spot in the starting rotation this spring.</p>
