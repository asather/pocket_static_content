<p>Authorities released a video footage they say shows two suspects and a car used in a fatal shooting in Wilkinsburg last week in which a man was gunned down while walking with a 5-year-old girl.</p>
<p>On Feb. 3, Kevin Hall, 23, of Pittsburgh was shot while walking on Winston Street near Laketon Road. He was walking with a 5-year-old relative and pulled her out of the way of gunfire.</p>
<p>Allegheny County police said a white four-door sedan approached them.&nbsp;A black male wearing a brown beanie hat with short dreadlocks exited the car and shot the Mr. Hall multiple times. The gunman then got back into the vehicle, which headed toward Penn Hills, according to police.</p>
<p>The 5-year-old was injured from being pulled down, but was not shot, police said.</p>
<p>In the footage released Monday, two men are identified as suspects. A white sedan is later identified as the suspect vehicle.</p>
