<h1>Bryan Rust's offensive evolution includes doggedness below the dots</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>DENVER — Bryan Rust has been hogging the puck more often this season.</p>
<p>No, that’s actually a good thing, even on a line with a likely Hall-of-Famer.</p>
<p>With three months left in the season, Rust is closing in on career highs in goals and points. With the way Evgeni Malkin and he have been clicking lately, he may get there Friday when the Penguins play the Colorado Avalanche.</p>
<p>It may seem like the 27-year-old became an offensive force overnight, as if Sidney Crosby let Rust borrow his superpowers while he was on injured reserve. In at least one particularly area, though, it has been a gradual progression.</p>
<p>“He’s really evolved offensively,” Mike Sullivan said. “We’re a team that likes to hang onto pucks and force teams to expend energy defending us. And Rusty’s gotten really good at it. I give him a lot of credit. He’s worked at it.”</p>
<p>Let’s flash back to a big goal in last Thursday’s overtime loss to San Jose.</p>
<p>Rust and Alex Galchenyuk crisscrossed behind the Sharks net. Rust picked up the puck and headed toward the corner. In the past, he might have deferred, quickly sending a pass to Kris Letang at the point. Instead, he hung onto it. It was only a split second longer, but it made all the difference.</p>
<p>When Rust crossed the goal line, he swerved toward the action, spotted Patric Hornqvist posted up in front of the net and snapped a firm pass at his stick blade. Hornqvist deflected it past Sharks goalie Aaron Dell to tie up the score.</p>
<p>On a similar play last month, Rust came out of the same corner but that time cut to the middle and snapped a shot past Calgary Flames goalie Cam Talbot.</p>
<p>That was one of 17 goals already this season for Rust despite him playing in only 29 games due to injury and illness. That’s one shy of the career high he set last season. His 35 points are as many as he had in 72 games in 2018-19.</p>
<p>The trio of Rust, Malkin and Jake Guentzel was one of the hottest lines in hockey last month. Sure, they did a lot of damage in the open ice. They were also tough to stop when they got the cycle game going, buzzing around the net.</p>
<p>Losing Guentzel was a significant blow to the Penguins’ Cup chances. But this new and improved Rust, who remains an annoying forechecker and a trustworthy defensive player, has emerged to become a bankable top-six winger.</p>
<p>Entering Thursday, he ranked 12th in the NHL at 1.21 points per game.</p>
<p>“Just a lot of work in the summer,” he said, trying to explain his breakout.</p>
<p>At 5-11 and 192 pounds, Rust is not the bulkiest guy. His game is still built on speed and tenacity. But hoping to make it tougher for big blue-liners to knock him off the puck, he emphasized strength training the past two offseasons to try to make his lower half more powerful and improve his balance.</p>
<p>Rust spends his summers at a lake house in his wife’s hometown of Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. So the strength and conditioning staff put together a workout regimen for him to follow and checked in with him every couple of weeks.</p>
<p>Former Penguins teammate Trevor Daley, who now plays for Detroit, has a place down the road. The close friends trained together in Daley’s home gym.</p>
<p>All that sweating and squatting is paying off. Rust’s legs aren’t on the same level as Crosby’s cartoonish tree trunks. “Maybe one of these days,” he said with a laugh. But this season, they keep churning despite defenders on his back.</p>
<p>“He’s got a lower center of gravity,” Jared McCann said. “He’s a load to handle.”</p>
<p>Throw in the drills that skills development coach Ty Hennes gave Rust to improve his edgework and stickhandling — along with sky-high confidence that has him playing with poise — and Rust is a different player below the dots.</p>
<p>“I am definitely pleased with how that part of my game has been developing,” the winger said. “I’m trying to hold onto the puck a little bit more but also keep my feet moving at the same time. I’ve been able to handle pucks better down low and kind of fight guys off and make more plays as a result.”</p>
