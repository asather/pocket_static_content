<h1>Rep. Mike Kelly 30 pounds lighter after COVID-19 bout</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, a Butler County Republican, always thought of his appetite as a sign of good health.</p>
<p>A member of a big family, he counted that appetite as an asset when he sat down at frequent food-filled gatherings over the years.</p>
<p>Victoria Kelly, his wife since 1973, was quick to notice when her husband was suddenly pushing away his plate.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly thought it might be influenza or some sort of short-lived bug that would quickly disappear.</p>
<p>A consultation with his doctor and a visit to a drive-through testing site at Butler Memorial Hospital indicated that the five-term congressman, who represents Pennsylvania’s 16th District, had COVID-19.</p>
<p>That was March 27.</p>
<p>By Monday afternoon of this week, Mr. Kelly described himself as almost back to normal.</p>
<p>But many of the days in between his diagnosis and now have been difficult.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, 71, falls into what the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says seems to comprise a higher-risk group for more serious complications from the coronavirus: He’s over 70 and has an underlying medical condition, Type 2 diabetes.</p>
<p>Eight out of every 10 deaths among adults with confirmed COVID-19 have been 65 or older, according to the CDC.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly describes himself as lucky. He stayed at home, never developed respiratory problems. He has friends with the coronavirus who have been hospitalized.</p>
<p>But he would be hard-pressed to describe his symptoms as mild.</p>
<p>“It really knocks you off your feet,” he said. “I couldn’t taste anything. I couldn’t get warm. I was under two blankets and I was just shivering.”</p>
<p>Although he didn’t require oxygen, climbing the stairs to his two-story-house in Butler left him feeling drained.</p>
<p>His wife, whom he describes as a great cook, offered chicken soup, mashed potatoes, but nothing sounded good.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I couldn’t stand the smell of it,” he said of food in general.</p>
<p>For the better part of a couple weeks, the gregarious congressman and car dealership owner who loved to sit down to a big meal with family and friends lived on little more than applesauce and water.</p>
<p>“I lost 30 pounds,” he said. “For 10 days, I couldn’t taste anything.”</p>
<p>He watched Mass on his television and tried to keep up with work going on in Washington, D.C., and in his legislative offices. But for a few days, as he wrestled with COVID-19, Mr. Kelly said he hardly had the energy to scroll through his text messages.</p>
<p>Tim Butler, Mr. Kelly’s Erie-based district director, watched as the congressman’s energy level disappeared almost overnight.</p>
<p>“We went from days when we would see him in the office and at eight different events, to days we only communicated through his wife or his chief of staff,” Mr. Butler said.</p>
<p>“There were some days when he was very fatigued and we only gave him as much as he could digest on any given day.”</p>
<p>A few days ago, as Mr. Kelly’s condition improved, his wife said something that caught him off guard.</p>
<p>“She said, ‘I am so glad you are better,‘” Mr. Kelly recalled. “‘I really was afraid of losing you.‘”</p>
<p>Despite his diabetes and the belief he had never felt physically worse in his life,&nbsp;Mr. Kelly said he had never framed his sickness in those terms.</p>
<p>“I have my faith,” he said. “I have been so blessed in my life. I know none of us gets out of here alive. I was concerned but I wasn’t worried.”</p>
<p>But the experience has caused him to rethink some things, he said, perhaps inspired by the hundreds of get-well text messages, cards and calls he’s received.</p>
<p>A well-known Republican and often fierce partisan, it hasn’t been lost on&nbsp;Mr. Kelly that those well wishes have come from friends of all political stripes.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said he’s been touched and humbled by the number of people who have wished him well and said they were praying for his recovery.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s made us look at people as people, not politicians, and I include myself in that,” Mr. Kelly said. “If my governor is doing what he thinks is the right thing, I can respect that.”</p>
<p>Although he’s mostly feeling like his old self, Mr. Kelly and his wife continue to self-isolate. They suspect that she might have had a milder version of the coronavirus before he became sick, but she hasn’t been tested.</p>
<p>Like so many others, his wife, he said, is making plans for when things are different.</p>
<p>She made Easter baskets for the grandchildren. Ten of them. But they will await delivery until it feels safe, probably in May.</p>
<p>At the moment, homebound patience seems to Mr. Kelly like the smart thing.</p>
<p>“How tough is it to stay in the house and read the newspaper?” Mr. Kelly said. “I am just being really cautionary.”</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly, who grew up thinking about and talking about the Great Depression and World War II with his father, thinks COVID-19 is shaping up to be the test of our times.</p>
<p>Mr. Kelly said he remembers asking his father how he navigated those challenging times of war and economic collapse.</p>
<p>He remembers his father’s response, which might easily have been applied to Mr. Kelly as he lay in his bed recovering or to our collective situation as we seek cover from COVID-19 in our homes.</p>
<p>“I asked my father, ‘How did you get through it?‘ Mr. Kelly asked. He looked at me and said, ‘We didn’t have a choice.‘”</p>
