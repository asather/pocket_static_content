<h1>Steelers expect WR Diontae Johnson back for Eagles game</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin said wide receiver Diontae Johnson is out of concussion protocol and will play Sunday against the Philadelphia Eagles at Heinz Field.</p>
<p>Johnson was injured in the first quarter of the most recent game against the Houston Texans and did not return. However, he probably would have played if the Steelers game against the Tennessee Titans wasn’t postponed last week until Oct. 25.</p>
<p>Tomlin also said two players — fullback Derek Watt (hamstring) and hybrid linebacker Marcus Allen (plantar fasciitis) — are working their way back from injuries, and their progress will be monitored through the week.</p>
<p>Watt did some light running at Monday’s practice, Tomlin said. Allen did some running in the pool and might try to run on land this week, he said.</p>
<p><strong>Head start</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin said an unintended benefit of the impromptu bye week is it gave the Steelers a chance to get some preparation done for the Titans, getting a head-start for their rescheduled game on Oct. 25 in Nashville.</p>
<p>“We got a lot of productive work done,” Tomlin said. “We got an opportunity to file it away and use it later.”</p>
<p><strong>Penalty watch</strong></p>
<p>Tomlin said he didn’t have a “strong opinion” about the NFL’s threat to forfeit games if teams don’t adhere to the COVID-19 protocols put in and recently strengthened by the league.</p>
<p>But he agreed there should be some form of punishment for violators.</p>
<p>“Sure there should be a penalty for negligence, but to the extent of what it should be, that’s not my charge,” Tomlin said. “I’m focused on running this outfit and making sure we adhere to the protocol.”</p>
