<h1>Pittsburgh's new chief development officer took winding, rocky road</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The man newly charged with implementing Mayor Bill Peduto’s development vision earned rave reviews and one venomous critique from past bosses, and starts his new job with an affinity for Pittsburgh that began with his first Little League uniform.</p>
<p>“My first Little League team was the Pirates,” Marty LaMar said this week, his second on the job as the city’s chief economic development officer. He was playing first base in Decatur, Ga., but&nbsp;“it was 1978, and it was just perfect timing,” as the Pirates would soon be entering the We Are Family era and winning the 1979 World Series. “And I just never let that go.”</p>
<p>His acquaintance with Pittsburgh didn’t fully blossom until recently, and followed stints in Atlanta, Seattle and Philadelphia, plus a rocky tenure in Toledo, Ohio. Now he’s coordinating planning and permitting, public housing, land banking and redevelopment activities in the city he once admired from afar.</p>
<p>“Everything that I’m doing, that we’ll be doing, is rooted in a love for Pittsburgh — a deep belief that the city has not reached its highest point. I’m open to working with individuals and businesses and other entities that are both public and private,” he said,&nbsp;“in making sure Pittsburgh is the best that it can be.”</p>
<p>The hire is part of a larger effort to&nbsp;“reup [the city’s economic development] organizations with a new generation of leaders,” said Dan Gilman, the mayor’s chief of staff.</p>
<p>In 2014, the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority, which handles public housing in and around Toledo, had high expectations for Mr. LaMar when it hired him as deputy executive director.</p>
<p>After all, he had two master’s degrees and cut his teeth with large public housing agencies in Atlanta and Seattle before moving to the&nbsp;Philadelphia Housing Authority, one of the nation’s largest. His boss in Philadelphia, in written comments provided to the&nbsp;Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority in 2014,&nbsp;described him as “very detailed, very thorough, and he sees projects through to the end. … He’s a stand-up guy. Honest and has integrity.”</p>
<p>In other written comments, Mr. LaMar’s prior supervisor Mike Proctor, then chief policy officer of the Atlanta Housing Authority, noted one area in which Mr. LaMar faced challenges:&nbsp;“He expressed frustration to me when he was working collaboratively with others and the collaboration was not reciprocated.”</p>
<p>He was viewed as the heir apparent to the Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority’s longtime executive director Linnie B. Willis. She didn’t coddle her understudy.</p>
<p>“For the past few months, you have been absent from Central Office on a regular basis, in fact, at least 95% of the work week,” she wrote in a June 2016 memo to him.&nbsp;She ripped his&nbsp;“pattern of absences, lack of engagement in the day-to-day operations” and inadequate communication with her.</p>
<p>She ordered him to “resume regular working hours” the following week, and urged him to start attending “significant LMHA events, especially when HUD [federal Department of Housing and Urban Development] officials and key community/political leaders are present.”</p>
<p>Ms. Willis could not be reached for comment Tuesday.</p>
<p>Mr. LaMar said he had an&nbsp;“uneasy” relationship with Ms. Willis, and he&nbsp;“felt like I was not being given the information that I needed to be able to really thrive and I didn’t want to have any sort of conflict.” So he began to work remotely, typically in other offices of the authority, which also allowed him to get to know the 150-plus employees.&nbsp;His wife had been living in Pittsburgh since 2012, when she got a job in auto parts sales, and he spent time here, too, he said.</p>
<p>Just six weeks after Ms. Willis criticized Mr. LaMar in the memo, she retired and he was elevated to the authority’s top job. He held the post, though, for just 10 months.&nbsp;His May 2017 departure from that role is characterized in official paperwork as a “separation/mutual release,” and the agreement between him and the agency had him continuing to receive his $150,000-a-year salary through August of that year.</p>
<p>He said he and the board&nbsp;“just had a different philosophy in terms of how the organization should go forward. … I think probably to get into the details of it doesn’t do me or the organization any justice.”</p>
<p>Calls to a member of the&nbsp;Lucas Metropolitan Housing Authority board, and to the agency’s current executive director, were answered by the authority’s lawyer, who cited a policy barring comment on former employees.</p>
<p>In 2018 and early 2019, he worked as&nbsp;a regional vice president for McCormack Baron Management, stationed in Pittsburgh but responsible for monitoring low-income housing in Missouri and Illinois. A recruiter suggested that he apply with Mr. Peduto’s administration.&nbsp;The city’s 2020 budget indicates that his newly created position pays $112,084.</p>
<p>“I think looking at the housing opportunities within the city limits is a big deal, and I think that’s a place where the city can reach its next plateau,” Mr. LaMar said.&nbsp;“I think that finding affordable housing opportunities is really huge as well, and I think that bridging the gaps between economic tiers is something that we can definitely do within the city.”</p>
<p>He said he wants to use the city’s&nbsp;“vast educational landscape” and tech businesses to spur economic development.&nbsp;“But also we have a lot of buildings that currently exist, where we don’t necessarily have to go and tear down structures, but we can utilize the bones of those existing buildings and change the insides, if you will, and make those livable spaces,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. LaMar’s hire is part of Mr. Peduto’s revamp of top economic development personnel. Greg Flisram, the <a title="Greg Flisram announcement" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/11/14/Urban-redevelopment-authority-pittsburgh-URA-announces-new-executive-director/stories/201911140122" target="_blank">new executive director of the Urban Redevelopment Authority</a>, will attend his first meeting of that agency’s board Thursday. Monique Pierre is the new chief development officer of the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh. Paul Leger leads the <a title="Land Bank appointment" href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2020/01/10/Pittsburgh-Land-Bank-board-hires-interim-executive-director/stories/202001100128" target="_blank">Pittsburgh Land Bank</a>. And the city is close to announcing a new director of its Department of City Planning.</p>
<p>Following some second-term departures, the administration consciously sought to hire&nbsp;“as a development team, and not one-off positions,” said Mr. Gilman.</p>
<p>Mr. LaMar, he said, knew both affordable housing and development administration, and could coordinate the city’s housing, redevelopment and planning arms.&nbsp;“We believed that Marty’s skill set really fit in with the ability to understand how those three organizations intersect and need to support each other” in pursuit of the mayor’s vision.</p>
