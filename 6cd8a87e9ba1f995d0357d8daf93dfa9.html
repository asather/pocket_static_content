<h1>'Drag Race's' BenDeLaCreme goes Wilde for Pittsburgh Public livestream</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Oscar Wilde’s wit has found a match made in “RuPaul’s Drag Race” haven for hennies. BenDeLaCreme, a contestant on the award-winning VH1 show, will help launch Pittsburgh Public Theater’s free weekly PlayTime series, with a cameo appearance as Lady Bracknell in “The Importance of Being Earnest.”</p>
<p>Artistic director Marya Sea Kaminski inaugurated PlayTime last week, with readings from Shakespeare’s “Henry V” via the online gathering platform Zoom.</p>
<p>The series has moved into a new phase this week, with full-cast performances of classic and new works. “The Importance of Being Earnest” will stream in two parts at 7 p.m. Thursday and Friday, at <a href="http://bit.ly/PPTPlayTime" target="_blank">http://bit.ly/PPTPlayTime</a>.</p>
<p>“This is going to be an exciting, unpredictable, and wild experiment for us and we thought BenDeLaCreme would be the perfect artist to feature in our premiere reading,” Kaminski said of the two-time “Drag Race” contestant from Seattle, Kaminski’s former artistic home. “Besides being wickedly funny, Ben has an incredible ability to mingle a sense of elegance and the unexpected. We are inspired to provide our community something wonderful to look forward to during this challenging time.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh theater-goers will recognize the rest of the cast from productions throughout the region:</p>
<p>This Wilde comedy of manners, set in Victorian London, finds friends Algernon (Andrew W. Smith) and Jack (Jonathan Visser) living double lives, split between the city and country. The cast also includes Emma Elizabeth Mercier, Christine Laitta, Catherine Gowl, James FitzGerald and Monteze Freeland.</p>
<p>The performance is free, but donations are welcome and will go directly to the artists involved. Visit <a href="/ppt.org/PlayTime" target="_blank">ppt.org/PlayTime</a> for more information.</p>
