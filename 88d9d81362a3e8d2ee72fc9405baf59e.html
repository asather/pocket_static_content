<h1>Kenny Robinson, former two-sport standout at Allderdice, presumed dead after fishing accident</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Just a week ago, Kenny Robinson celebrated a huge achievement in his life.</p>
<p>“It’s been a crazy 5 years but I couldn’t be more excited to finally say I am a College Graduate,” Robinson posted on Twitter April 10.</p>
<p>But in a tragic example of how fragile life can be, Robinson’s family and friends are now in mourning.</p>
<p>Robinson, a graduate of Allderdice High School and Mercyhurst University, is presumed dead after a fishing accident late Saturday night along the Ohio River near Neville Island. Robinson, 23, was fishing with friends when he fell into the river and was unable to be pulled out. Ohio Township police were notified and emergency response teams searched for Robinson that night into Sunday but <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=2901389273309048&amp;set=a.232560396858629" target="_blank">were unable to retrieve his body</a>.</p>
<p>Robinson played baseball and basketball at Allderdice before playing baseball at Mercyhurst North East and then Mercyhurst. At Allderdice, he was a three-year starter in baseball and as a senior helped the Dragons win a WPIAL playoff game for the first time in school history. Robinson also helped the basketball team win a City League championship and reach the PIAA Class 4A semifinals his senior season.</p>
<p>Robinson’s twin brother, Keith, played on both teams, as well.&nbsp;Jeremy Askin, Robinson’s baseball coach at Allderdice, spoke highly of Kenny on Monday.</p>
<p>“There’s not a bad thing anyone could say about this young man,” Askin said.&nbsp;“He’s the reason why teachers teach and coaches coach. He was a born leader, self-motivated and determined. The true definition of a winner. And I’m positive that the quality that shaped his success will carry on with his brother.”</p>
<p>Askin said that Kenny and his brother loved to fish, particularly catfish.</p>
<p>The Robinsons helped the Allderdice basketball team make headlines their junior season. They were among <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/high-school-basketball/2013/12/27/Twinsanity-reins-at-Allderdice/stories/201312270171" target="_blank">three sets of twins on a team</a> that was dubbed&nbsp;“Twinsanity.”</p>
<p>Kenny Robinson started 14 games in his final baseball season at Mercyhurst in 2019.&nbsp;His brother offered a thank you to all well-wishers Monday on Twitter.</p>
<p>Former Allderdice basketball coach Buddy Valinsky, now the coach at Norwin, expressed his condolences to the Robinson family via a Twitter post Sunday.</p>
<p>“It is with a heavy heart that we mourn the loss of a family member last night. Kenny Robinson #24 was a part of Twinsanity and was truly one of my favorite players on the BB team,” the post began.</p>
<p>Valinsky concluded it by writing that Robinson’s “infectious smile will always be embedded in my mind.”</p>
<p>That sentiment toward Robinson has been shared by many others on social media since news of the accident began to circulate. Among those to express their love were former Allderdice assistant basketball coach Andy Pakler, former Mercyhurst teammate Tyler Garbee, Wilkinsburg native and recent Carolina Panthers draft pick Kenny Robinson (they shared the same name) and Pitt football star Paris Ford.</p>
<p>By all accounts, Robinson’s future was very bright. Askin said Robinson was particularly proud to get his college degree.</p>
<p>“That’s all he talked about. He was so determined to graduate,” Askin said.&nbsp;“He would call me through the five years. There would obviously be baseball-related questions, but he would just reach out about anything. He was not afraid to share feelings or just ask for help.</p>
<p>“I’m just heartbroken for Kenny and his family.”</p>
