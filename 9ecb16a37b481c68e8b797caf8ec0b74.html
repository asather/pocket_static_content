<h1>Delta Foundation president resigns amid criminal investigation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The board president of the Delta Foundation resigned Monday,&nbsp;less than a month after he was accused of impersonating a police officer and other crimes.</p>
<p>Gary Van Horn, 40, of Shadyside, had initially requested a leave of absence from the foundation after his Dec. 18 arrest, but he decided to leave the board so that he could focus on fighting the charges, according to his attorney, Phil DiLucente.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. DiLucente said Mr. Van Horn would like to return to the Delta Foundation, one of the region’s leading LGBT advocacy groups, if the charges against him are cleared.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“We believe he will have this resolved, and we hope that he can regain his position,” Mr. DiLucente said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a statement, the Delta Foundation said it named board member&nbsp;Jim Sheppard as interim president and&nbsp;Marty Healey as chair of Pittsburgh Pride 2020.</p>
<p>“As a matter of course, the board has engaged the law firm of Leech Tishman to independently review Delta’s prior years’ activities and compliance,” the statement said. “The board will refrain from reporting on such matters until the independent review is completed.”</p>
<p>Mr. Van Horn requested the audit, according to Mr. DiLucente, adding that he will likely do his own after the Leech Tishman review is completed. He said the review was suggested because Mr. Van Horn sometimes signed on behalf of the the Delta Foundation as a guarantor.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“At no time did Gary Van Horn receive a personal benefit from 501(c)(3) expenditures from the Delta Foundation,” Mr. DiLucente said.</p>
<p>State police <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2019/12/18/Board-president-Delta-Foundation-Pittsburgh-Gary-Van-Horn-accused-forgery-impersonating-law-enforcement/stories/201912180105" target="_blank">charged Mr. Van Horn</a> with&nbsp;three felony counts of forgery, four counts of tampering with records and physical evidence, impersonating a public servant, unlawful activities, and using visual and audible signals on emergency vehicles. Police said he forged&nbsp;Allegheny County Sheriff William P. Mullen’s signature and acted as an officer by using police lights and sirens in his personal vehicle.</p>
