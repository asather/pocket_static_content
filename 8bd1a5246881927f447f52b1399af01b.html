<h1>Which Pirate would make the best WWE star? Rinku Singh answers</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rinku Singh thought about it for a second, then asked to hear the question again.</p>
<p>“I want to make sure I answer correctly,” he explained.</p>
<p>The Pirates pitcher turned professional wrestler thought long and hard about which of his former teammates would make the best WWE superstar. But in the end, the rising [wrestling] star wound up giving a predictable answer.</p>
<p>“Baseball players are all athletic, but I would probably say Josh Bell because he’s been following wrestling big-time,” Singh said. “But they’re all pro athletes. They would just need a little bit of training and direction, and I think they would be great at it.”</p>
<p>Fair point.</p>
<p>And politically correct.</p>
<p>But Singh picking Bell as the best Pirates wrestler isn’t just because the latter is a beast.&nbsp;They’re actually good friends dating back to the time Singh spent in the Pirates system after he won the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/ae/movies/2014/05/16/Movie-tells-the-story-of-a-Pirates-prospect/stories/201405160004" target="_blank">“Million Dollar Arm” reality TV show</a> in India back in 2008.</p>
<p>Singh and Dinesh Patel signed with the Pirates later that year. Singh and Bell were both on the Class A West Virginia Power in 2012-13, though Singh was hurt for the second of those two seasons.</p>
<p>Though he’s been plenty busy with WWE’s NXT promotion — essentially the minor leagues of WWE — Singh said he’s kept in&nbsp;touch with Bell, former Pirates pitcher Tyler Glasnow and Gregory Polanco.</p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Last season, Singh drove up from WWE’s Performance Center in Orlando, Fla., to catch a Rays game and reconnect with Glasnow. He and Bell had lunch last year during spring training, with Bell writing on Instagram, “Amazing what a few [pounds] and some hair can do.”</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">Singh even stopped by Pirate City for a visit, joking with Bell, Starling Marte and others.</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“I was so surprised that baseball players and baseball fans, how much they love pro wrestling,” Singh said. “It’s insane. Josh Bell, every time I spoke to him, he’s pretty pumped. Like, ‘Dude, that’s legit.’</span></p>
<p><span data-mce-mark="1">“Hearing from him, we laugh. When we were playing together, we shared some great moments about baseball and wrestling. It’s crazy how everything started and where we are in life.”</span></p>
<p>Singh said he’s even trying to integrate some baseball moves into his wrestling repertoire. Like a clothesline that looks like he’s delivering a fastball. Or a flamingo-type kick that looks like he’s in the middle of delivering a pitch.</p>
<p>“I’ve done that a few times, and fans have loved it,” Singh said. “I enjoy it. I really enjoy doing the baseball clothesline.”</p>
