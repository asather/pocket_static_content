<h1>Joe Starkey’s Mailbag: Does Ben Roethlisberger’s mere presence make the Steelers AFC North favorites?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Welcome to Joe Starkey’s mailbag, where the Post-Gazette columnist and 93.7 The Fan radio host answers your questions about sports, life, Larry Brown (ex-Washington running back, but also be great basketball coach or ex-Steelers tackle/tight end, just to be clear) and everything in between. If you want to ask Joe a question, tweet him @JoeStarkey1 or email him at jstarkey@post-gazette.com. On to the questions <strong>…</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Anthony Scarillo, @AnthScar:</strong> What % chance do you give the Steelers to win the division, conference and Super Bowl?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> I’m not really into percentages, Dr. Scarillo, but let’s start with the division, and let’s not underestimate the return of Ben Roethlisberger in that equation. The Steelers have a quarterback again. Potentially an elite one. And a very good, possibly great, defense. That combination alone makes them a team to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>The sight of Roethlisberger, in pads, zipping the ball around Heinz Field, had to be something more than heartening for Steelers fans everywhere. It doesn’t prove he’s all the way back, obviously, but if his arm is healthy — and it sure looks that way — what else do you need to know?</p>
<p>I’m still not certain, even having witnessed the carnage, that people fully realize — in all its horrific implications — what losing Roethlisberger did to this offense last season. His mere presence influences a game, influences how a defense schemes against the Steelers. He must be respected. Nobody respected the Steelers quarterbacks last season. They attacked the run and did not worry about the pass.</p>
<p>What you got, then, was one of the worst offenses in franchise history. It’s a miracle it ranked as high as 27th in points per game, although you have to go back to 1998 — the year Kordell cried on the sidelines and Courtney Hawkins was the club’s leading receiver — to find a Steelers offense that ranked so low.</p>
<p>The running game might have been the worst in franchise history. It lived in a land far beyond pathetic, and you can understand why: Everybody knew the Steelers couldn’t pass. Go back and watch that Bills game and how the Bills lined up with 53 men in the box. No way you do that consistently, or even think about it, with No. 7 behind center.</p>
<p>All you need to know, in the end, is that the Steelers finished dead last in plays per drive and second-last in points per drive. Do you know what that can do to a defense, physically and emotionally? And yet the Steelers defense finished fifth overall with all kinds of sacks and turnovers. What might it do with an offense that keeps the ball, scores some points and gets a decent lead once in a while?</p>
<p>I happen to believe the Steelers are primed for a big season, Anthony. I would rate them dead even with Ravens in the AFC North, at maybe 12-4 or 13-3. I think they’re going to win the division and have a great shot to reach the Super Bowl, although Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs should be the favorites.</p>
<p>I see a star-laden defense and a potentially balanced offense. I see franchise continuity as a huge positive in such a chaotic season, and I see a quarterback.</p>
<p>A real quarterback.</p>

<p><strong>J.Radical, @jradone:</strong> Should the NHL prohibit the trap, similar to the way the NBA prohibited the zone defense in 2001?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That sounds pretty radical, Mr. Radical, and you do know the NBA allows zone defense, yes? It’s legal, so long as you don’t violate the three-second defensive rule (can’t stand in lane without guarding someone for more than three seconds).</p>
<p>I hate the neutral-zone trap, too, especially in its purest form — the way the Senators choked up their series against the Penguins in 2017. The Canadiens and Islanders used forms of a trap to great effectiveness against the Penguins each of the past two years. Every team plays some form of it. But if you look at the league overall, if you’re watching these playoffs, you’ll see most of the games are quite appealing to the eye.</p>
<p>Have you seen Vegas flying around?</p>
<p>Have you seen even 10 seconds of Dallas-Calgary? It’s wild.</p>
<p>The games are great. The best way to “prohibit” the trap is to beat it and move on, to a place where the opponent plays actual hockey most of the time.</p>
<p><strong>Matt Saylor, @matt_saylor:</strong> Can you think of any player who left the Steelers to play just as good/if not better for their next team?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Not a lot of ’em, Dr. Saylor. Off the top of my head, I would say Rod Woodson first. He had seven of his 13 defensive touchdowns after leaving Pittsburgh (though he was probably at his greatest here, playing cornerback as opposed to safety). Emmanuel Sanders took off big-time when he went to Denver (101 catches, nine TDs his first year there). Kevin Greene had more sacks (14.5) his first year in Carolina than in any year here (although he was very good here). My friend Josh Miller was excellent in New England, where he had a clutch punt in a Super Bowl win.</p>
<p>Can you think of others? Please be in touch.</p>
<p><strong>dundermifflin, @jma343:</strong> Is opening a fresh pack of trading cards a top 10 feeling? I say yes.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Top 5, Dr. dundermifflin (which cannot possibly be your actual name). This question has me headed toward eBay for a fresh pack of some kind of cards.</p>

It’s unreal!</p>

<p><strong>Mike Clarke, @mlc118:</strong> When the Tomlin/Ben era ends with just one Super Bowl, is it more of a disappointment or underachievement? Who deserves more of the blame?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Great question. But I would ask this: Was the Dungy-Manning era an underachievement? Has the Payton-Brees era been an underachievement? How about the Rodgers-McCarthy era in Green Bay? Shula-Marino? Wilson-Carroll?</p>
<p>The answer might be yes on all counts, by the way, but my point here is that it’s awfully difficult to win it all and that the Brady-Belichick dynasty might have skewed the way we judge quarterback-coach combos.</p>
<p><strong>Ryan Knee, @Elbowuindagut:</strong> Your most likely Stanley Cup matchup and your most entertaining? NBA as well.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Most likely Cup — Boston vs. Vegas</p>
<p>Most entertaining — Philly vs. Vegas</p>
<p>Most likely NBA — Bucks vs. Clippers</p>
<p>Most entertaining — Raptors vs. Nuggets</p>
<p><strong>Jake Corcoran, @Jake_Corcoran:</strong> If the Archer trade never happened. .. what would the Pirates record be today?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> 4-14.</p>
<p>OK, maybe 5-13.</p>
<p><strong>Halvy Buckets, m@halvybuckets:</strong> More likely to finish a season with a championship game: MLB, NFL, NCAAF or NCAAM?</p>
<p>In order …</p>
<p>• NFL (new saliva test will help, sheer force of will and enormous clout will see it through)</p>
<p>• NCAAM (I believe they can do this in a bubble, first conference play, then NCAA tourney)</p>
<p>• MLB (good news is that there has been no transference from team to team)</p>
<p>• NCAAF (keep throwing those parties, kiddies)</p>
<p><strong>Nick, @DominionSpy1:</strong> Is Mike Tomlin on the hot seat if the Steelers don’t make the playoffs again this year?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> No.</p>
<p><strong>Franjo Bek, @FBekavac:</strong> Will the jockeys have to ride 6 feet apart at the derby?</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> Pay the man, Shirley! (apologies to the great Norman Chad).</p>
<p><strong>Walt Sliker, @SlikerWalt:</strong> How old is your Twitter profile picture? It looks like it was taken when Crosby was a rookie.</p>
<p><strong>Starkey:</strong> That was pre-Mullsy. He aged me terribly.</p>
