<h1>PPS creates team to review, consider expanding K-2 suspension ban after first full year</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools on Friday said it would form a review team to evaluate and consider an expansion of the district’s&nbsp;K-2 suspension ban for non-violent infractions.</p>
<p>The creation of the team, which&nbsp;will consist of local educators, professionals, advocates and parents, comes at the end of the first full year that the district placed a moratorium on K-2 suspensions for nonviolent offenses.</p>
<p>Although it was the first full year of the moratorium, the district stopped calculating suspensions in March because of the COVID-19 shutdown.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools said it had an overall suspension rate of 10.2% up to March during the 2019-20 school year. The district had an 8.6% suspension rate up to March in the 2018-19 school year, and a 8.1% rate up to March in the 2017-18 school year.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The overall suspension rates by the end of the school year were 10.9% in 2017-18 and 11.2% in 2018-19.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school board in December 2017 approved revisions to district policy that banned out-of-school suspensions of students below third grade for non-violent minor disciplinary infractions in response to concerns from the community and board members.</p>
<p>The district said the moratorium is one of six action steps in its “On Track to Equity” plan aimed at creating equity in school discipline.</p>
<p>The district said it also introduced new student codes of conduct differentiated by age group; has six learning environment specialists who provide training based on school level needs; and implemented an electronic referral system to review discipline data. Additionally, the school board reviews discipline data at designated meetings.</p>
<p>Superintendent Anthony Hamlet in a statement acknowledged that “a disparity&nbsp;remains” for African American students.</p>
<p>“We know that expertise exists in our community that can inform our work to implement discipline practices that are appropriate and fair,” he said. “We must evaluate the impacts of the current moratorium for the possible expansion to higher grade levels.”</p>
<p>In the Pittsburgh Public Schools, African American students were suspended at a rate of 15.4% up to March in 2019-20, compared to white students at 3.8%. African American students were suspended up to March at a 12% rate in 2017-18 and a 12.4% rate in 2018-19, while white students up to March had a 3.4% rate in 2017-18 and 4% rate in 2018-19.</p>
<p><strong>District support for racial and equity consciousness</strong></p>
<p>The Pittsburgh Public Schools also announced Friday that its&nbsp;Office of Equity <a href="https://www.pghschools.org/Page/5435" target="_blank">updated the district website</a> with resources to support racial equity.</p>
<p>The website provides Black Lives Matter and anti-racism resources for school administrators, educators, parents and other stakeholders. It offers&nbsp;offers links to articles, books, videos, webinars, guides, podcasts and other websites.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Public Schools offices will close at 2 p.m. Friday in recognition of the Juneteenth holiday.</p>
<p>The district said it will seek school board approval to officially make Juneteenth a holiday for the Pittsburgh Public Schools in the future.</p>
