<h1>Steelers place Arrion Springs on reserve/COVID-19 list</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Steelers have had their first brush with the NFL’s new injured reserve designated for the coronavirus pandemic, placing defensive back Arrion Springs on the reserve/COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>That doesn’t necessarily mean that the Oregon product signed from the XFL tested positive for COVID-19 himself. He might have, but players also can end up on this new reserve list if they must self-quarantine after coming in close contact with a person who tested positive for the virus. Teams are not permitted to comment on which category a player falls into, other than placing him on the reserve/COVID-19 list.</p>
<p>Rookies and some other players with minimal NFL experience who were signed this offseason reported to Pittsburgh early last week for the pre-entry testing phase of training camp. That meant multiple days of COVID-19 screenings before being allowed to continue to the next step of camp.</p>
<p>On Sunday, six players from five teams were placed on the reserve/COVID-19 list. Veterans report to camp Tuesday, here and elsewhere, but will undergo virus testing and virtual meetings for three of the first four days.&nbsp;</p>
