<h1>Five things to know about the Penguins' opponents this week</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>The Penguins face another busy schedule this week, with four games against New Jersey (Tuesday), Columbus (Thursday), Carolina (Saturday) and the New York Islanders (Sunday). Here are five things to know about those squads:</em></p>
<p><strong>1. Mackenzie Blackwood is no pushover —</strong> The Devils may be in last place, but their second-year goaltender has proven his worth since the Penguins last met this team in November. Blackwood is 22-13-8 in net, impressive considering his team’s struggles overall. And his stats — a .915 save percentage and 2.74 goals against average —&nbsp;aren’t bad considering his team gives up the sixth-most shots in the league. He won’t be an easy one for the inconsistent Penguins offense to solve, even if his teammates aren’t especially threatening.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>2. The Blue Jackets are sputtering, too —</strong> The standings say they’re the Penguins’ closest competition for the Metropolitan Division’s third playoff spot. The results say they’re almost as bad as the Penguins have been lately, if not worse. Their skid is at 12 losses in 15 games since Feb. 8. They’ve scored one or zero goals in six of those losses and given up at least four goals in eight of them. The only teams they’ve beaten in that span are Vancouver twice and horrid Ottawa once. If you’ve wondered how things could be worse for the Penguins, you have the answer. Had Columbus had a collective pulse over the past month and change, the hole could be a lot deeper.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3.&nbsp;Oliver Bjorkstrand is out —</strong> It’s a big reason the Columbus offense has struggled in recent weeks. He led the team with 21 goals when he <a href="https://www.espn.com/nhl/story/_/id/28750726/blue-jackets-oliver-bjorkstrand-8-10-weeks-ankle-injury" target="_blank">went down with a broken ankle</a> Feb. 21. Now he’s expected to miss the rest of the regular season. No forward has surpassed him since. Defenseman Zach Werenski is the closest to him on the score sheet with 20 goals, but he’s not been the answer either with just three goals since Bjorkstrand’s injury. That should put in some perspective how rough it’s been for this team’s offensive attack of late.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>4. Justin Williams is on one for Carolina —</strong> His two goals Sunday against the Penguins extended his scoring streak to four games, in which he has five goals. Before that, he’d scored just twice since his Jan. 19 return to the Hurricanes. The 38-year-old winger sat out the first half of the season as he contemplated whether or not he wanted to continue playing. Now, it’s looking like he’s rounding into form at the right time to help this team make another playoff push.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>5. The Islanders’ big trade has been a dud —</strong> Last week, the Penguins faced the Senators team that Jean-Gabriel Pageau left behind. Now they face the club that gave up a lot to acquire the center before the trade deadline, to poor results. Pageau scored in both of his first two games for New York but hasn’t cracked the score sheet in the four games since, and the Islanders have yet to win any of the games in which he’s appeared for them. They’ve slipped to sixth in the Metropolitan Division after a fast start and look nothing like the group that swept the Penguins out of the first round of the playoffs a year ago.&nbsp;</p>
