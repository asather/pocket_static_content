<h1>Grand jury indicts Shaler man accused in protest outside arena </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A federal grand jury has handed up an indictment against Brian Bartels, the 20-year-old from Shaler accused of damaging a police car and inciting others to do the same during a May 30 protest of the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels was charged Tuesday with obstruction of law enforcement during a civil disorder.</p>
<p>He had previously been charged by complaint, after which federal authorities have 30 days to bring a formal indictment.</p>
<p>The grand jury said Mr. Bartels initiated the destruction of a Pittsburgh police car near PPG Paints Arena, spray-painting it and stomping on its windshield, and then incited at least three others to join him.</p>
<p>After the others joined in, the car was set on fire.</p>
<p>U.S. Attorney Scott Brady said Mr. Bartels had a backpack loaded with rocks and spray paint and came to the protest to "incite violence."</p>
<p>He said Mr. Bartels turned an otherwise peaceful rally into a riot that resulted in destruction throughout Downtown.</p>
<p>A video of the protest shows Mr. Bartels walking among a crowd wearing a black bandana and black hooded sweatshirt. The footage shows him pull a can of spray paint from his backpack and spray the unoccupied police cruiser, then kick the car and throw an object that broke a window.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels then jumped on the hood and further broke the windshield, prosecutors said.</p>
<p>Police on horseback tried to protect the car but the crowd threw rocks and other objects at them, forcing them to pull back.</p>
<p>Prosecutors said Mr. Bartels later admitted to Pittsburgh police that he was the man in the video and that he was upset because of incidents of police abuse, according to the criminal complaint.</p>
<p>Mr. Bartels will be arraigned by video on June 16 before U.S. Magistrate Judge Patricia Dodge.</p>
<p>He also faces state charges of institutional vandalism, rioting and reckless endangerment.</p>
