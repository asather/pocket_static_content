<h1>COVID-19 Update: State reports 600 new cases, 107 more in Western Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania health officials on Friday reported 600 new cases of COVID-19 and 22 new deaths, with Western Pennsylvania accounting for 107 of those diagnoses.</p>
<p>The total number of cases statewide is now 84,370 since the pandemic started in March.</p>
<p>Out of the 20 counties in Western Pennsylvania, Allegheny County had the highest increase in cases at 61 and Erie County had the second highest with 13 new cases from the previous day. Allegheny last saw a single-day increase of more than 60 cases on April 23.</p>
<p>Allegheny’s total is now 2,382 cases. Of those,&nbsp;2,239 are confirmed and 143 are probable, the county said Friday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are only two counties in Western Pennsylvania reporting new deaths due to the virus — Allegheny and Erie — with one death each.&nbsp;Allegheny, however, reported that two more people had died from the disease, making the total 186. The state was reporting 183 deaths for that county, based on data received Friday.</p>
<p>Statewide, the total number of deaths has risen by 22, bringing the new total to 6,579.</p>
<p>State health secretary Dr. Rachel Levine said Friday that officials are&nbsp;looking closely at areas where COVID-19 infection rates and deaths are ticking back up, threatening to turn back progress against the pandemic.</p>
<p>“We are doing quote-unquote a deep dive into all of the counties that have had increases,” Dr. Levine said, warning that “community spread” is occurring in some parts of the state.</p>
<p>The rise may be attributable to the gradual reopening that has been taking place in Pennsylvania, as well as more extensive testing, she said.</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf’s administration will allow Lebanon County, the final county, to move from the yellow phase to the less-restrictive green phase in one week, Dr. Levine said.</p>
<p>According to other data from Allegheny County, there is one additional hospitalization as a result of the virus, bringing the total to 379 past or present hospitalizations. This includes 143 people who have been in intensive care units and 73 that have required mechanical ventilation.</p>
<p>The county health department is examining the data from this week’s new cases and plans to release additional information sometime on Friday, according to county spokeswoman Amie Downs.</p>
