<p><strong>#AwarenessThroughArt:</strong> Artist Kara Bialecki first became aware of the many indigenous women who have gone missing or been murdered in the United States during an event at the Westmoreland Museum of American Art. “I was there for a community event that celebrated Native American cultures. There was dancing, drumming and storytelling,” she said. A musician dedicated a song to the missing women, explaining that one in four indigenous women have disappeared or been killed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I could not believe that this could be true,” Ms. Bialecki said. Afterward, she confirmed it through research and was appalled by how few resources were being utilized to find these women and support their families. Feeling she needed to do something, she chose her artwork to raise awareness. “We all have our strengths, and if we can each come together using our natural abilities to help one another, we can become a force for change.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Spirit of Our Sisters art show was held on Saturday night at Commonplace Coffee on the North Side. Guests enjoyed coffee, tea and snacks and could purchase art as part of a fundraising effort to support the Sovereign Bodies Institute, the only organization creating a comprehensive database of missing and murdered indigenous women in the U.S. An after-party raised more money at the Pittsburgh Winery.</p>
<p>“In a compassionate, artistic way, Kara gives light and voice to those who need to be heard in a world that tends to not listen to those in need,” guest Gary Brown said.</p>
<p>Ms. Bialecki seeks to inspire people to look further into these issues affecting indigenous communities. “I hope that people will explore ways of supporting indigenous peoples, cultures, organizations, businesses, artists, musicians and creators. I hope that people will see that indigenous peoples are not a part of the past, but resilient, diverse cultures of today.”&nbsp;</p>
