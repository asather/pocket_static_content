<h1>Gerry Dulac's Steelers chat transcript: 04.08.20</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: All right kids, we’re going to start our chat in about 15-20 minutes so get those questions ready... <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK kids, here we go...Fire away!</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: Was Hines ever interviewed for the open WR coach position? And if not, how come? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. And he wasn’t a couple years ago either when Darryl Drake was hired. I don’t think he appreciated the slight then.</p>
<p><strong>mrbig</strong>: Do you think having TJ on the other side is why DuPree looked so effective last season? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You know, that can work both ways. Maybe TJ benefits from having Dupree on the other side. I think together they are a pretty good tandem, among the best any OLB duo in the league.</p>
<p><strong>paullochrane@yahoo.com</strong>: i know i will only get a wise crack from you, but its way past time for the steelers to move on from ben,he’s done nothing for the steelers in the last 2 years, yes he was hurt but thats part of those 2 years !! so draft a qb in the draft ? now time for your wise crack !!! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: See, in this time of unity, coming together and understanding, I’m going to answer your question with the thoughtfulness and introspection it deserves, mainly because you took the time to ask. Uh.....no.</p>
<p><strong>FatBuddy</strong>: Gerry, what’s the bigger need? Ol or edge rusher? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Why oh why do you think they need an edge rusher? You do know they franchised Dupree, right? And that Watt is still on the roster??</p>
<p><strong>Where’s My Clark Bar?</strong>: Hi Gerry, with Starkey’s article this morning referencing Duck being chosen to start over Rudolph in last year’s Jets game...is it possible the Steeler organization kept Rudolph from starting due to an injury (not being 100% healthy). I am a Rudolph believer and think he is more than a capable back up QB. Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I did not read Joe’s column, but Rudolph wasn’t hurt before the Jets game, he was hurt in that game.To your later thought, the Steelers do not value Duck or Paxton Lynch over Rudolph. He is their No. 2 QB, period.</p>
<p><strong>Steelersfan#48</strong>: Gerry, i know you keep saying the FO is confident in Mason Rudolph but is there any chance the team uses a pick in the draft on Qb or would they try to bring in Andy Dalton in on a cheap deal to compete with Rudolph <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Look, I’m sure if they could get Andy Dalton on a cheap deal, as you suggest, they might consider it. But why would Dalton want to go to a team where he isn’t the starter and not even the No. 2 QB. I’m sure Dalton believes he is more-than-capable NFL starter (so do I) and is looking to go somewhere where he can compete for the starting position, if not be the anointed starter. That’s not here.</p>
<p><strong>Mike in BP</strong>: Guessing the Masters coverage is in serious doubt now unless the Steelers have a bye week? Hoping that PG management can find a way for you to go. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes it is, but I’ll have to wait to see if there’s a bye week or something unexpected. I know this, it won’t be the same Augusta National you’re accustomed to seeing in April.</p>
<p><strong>Steelersfan#48</strong>: Gerry, if the Steelers do in fact go Rb with #49 who do you like the best and if its Wr at #49 who are you pulling for? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I like Jonathan Taylor as the best RB for them. At WR, they need a playmaker and Jalen Reagor, to me, is the best fit for them. Both have a chance to be there. A chance.</p>
<p><strong>Artie Bridge</strong>: Gerry, What do you make of Starkey’s column suggesting drafting a QB is not out of the question? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It’s never totally out of the question. I will tell you that there was some strong feelings internally in 2017 to take Deshaun Watson because of how highly they had him rated. They didn’t, of course, but my point is, it’s NEVER out of the question. However, what QB on the second or third round is going to be better, in their opinion, than Mason Rudolph? Now you’re right back to where you were last season if Ben can’t play -- using a QB who has never played an NFL game. Save the Ben heir apparent pick for when you have a first-round choice and can move up in that round to get a top-tier QB, not now.</p>
<p><strong>George in OKC</strong>: The inside linebacker depth seems to be thin at the moment. Do you think they will address it in the draft? I think Jacob Phillips from LSU could be a nice option in the 3rd if he is still available. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes they do, they have to. They lost two bodies there with Barron and Matakevich. If nothing else, they need some decent depth there. It might be the first defensive position they address in the draft, if it isn’t nose tackle.</p>

<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: What would your feelings be if they held the Masters late in the year, with no fans or media, and you weren’t allowed to go cover it? You’ve gone every year for quite a long time, yes? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I’ve been there 27 times. My feelings? Wait five more months and stage the “real” Masters.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: Should the Steelers take a look at Gerald Hodges ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No. He’s Jon Bostic at best</p>
<p><strong>TC in NC</strong>: When it comes down to the Steelers drafting players, it seems that they rely heavily on their scouts recommendations and less so on numbers from combine and pro days. Do the current restrictions have that much of an impact for the team drafting players? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don’t rely heavily on their scouts’ recommendations to draft a player. They rely on their recommendations to further examine a player. The Steelers love to attend pro days, as much for taking the player or players they like to dinner and getting to know them. That has been taken away this year. So have the visits to the South Side for the prospects. That’s the important homework they do that is lacking.</p>
<p><strong>Raymund</strong>: Gerry if we are really going WR with our first and Claypool is there I really believe we can’t go wrong by taking him before Hamler or Reagor or anyone like those 2, I mentioned the ones that could reallistically still be there.. Claypool is fast also, more complete, can block, and proven.. can’t go wrong.. Thoughts, thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t have a huge problem with Claypool. But I wouldn’t take him before Reagor. I don’t know that the Steelers are interested enough in Hamler to take him, especially on the second round.</p>
<p><strong>marty v</strong>: Do you think Fitzpatrick’s role will be expanded to “roam the field” similar to the way Polamalu did? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes, a little. But there’s only one 43.</p>
<p><strong>Art</strong>: When the quarterback is in the shotgun formation, why can’t the guards and tackles be in a three point stance? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They can, but that’s not the way the Steelers use their offensive linemen. Their first order of business is to protect Ben.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: Thanks for the chats Gerry. Iwant football more than anything but I am struggling to see the logic in letting the players play in an empty stadium if 60000 others can’t be around each other. Doesn’t seem fair to the players in a sport where there is constant contact. Sports like golf tennis I get, maybe even baseball, but how do you justify football <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nothing seems fair right now. But I would advise to be prepared for the possibility. And I don’t think football is any different than baseball, basketball or hockey. Some players (not all) feed off the fans.</p>
<p><strong>Dave</strong>: <span style="font-weight: bold;" data-mce-mark="1">Gerry, is MLB and the NBA paying their players?</span> <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I don’t follow those sports, but, as long as they have a contract...</p>
<p><strong>NYStillerfan</strong>: Good day. I haven’t seen a lot on Rudolph’s recovery from his surgery, was it minor and there isn’t much concern that the Steelers back-up is also in recovery from surgery? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: As far as I know, Rudolph’s recovery from what was potentially a very dangerous injury is over. It was scheduled to end in February. There aren’t any lingering issues with his shoulder that rehab won’t correct in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
<p><strong>Jacque Strap</strong>: Theoretically speaking, if the contract numbers were workable, what would be the downside to signing Jameis Winston as a backup for two years? Cut Lynch and Hodges. If BB and MR are threatened by it, that’s their problem. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Why would Jameis Winston want to sign with a team to be a backup? And the Steelers don’t have a lot of “workable” room to sign a QB like that. They’re not cutting Mason Rudolph, got it.</p>
<p><strong>Mrs Caroline</strong>: Gerry, Trenches Trenches Trenches (so vital) we really need depth now at OL and soon to be starter, why not get one like Ruiz or anyone else highly rated if available with our first or OT and get WR later to many to chose from (deep class). Am I wrong in your view? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Yes you are. I agree they need to (and will) draft a guard/center, but not on the second round. Third at the earliest, but I’m not sure even then. Do I have to remind everyone that the Steelers offense was the worst in the league the last 10 games last season?</p>
<p><strong>Buccobil</strong>: Hear talk about an old who can cover being draft need. Is Bush able to cover well? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: You’re listening to the wrong people.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany</strong>: great chats! Let’s say everything go wrong on paper before our pick and teams chose all players in offense we were high on and no doubt Safety is BPA by Far (no depth) Edmunds still young and still have faith in him but why not get one if BPA, having 3 we could do so many things and position being so important today, and have a 3 Top defense.. WOW! Thoughts Gerry.. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s not going to happen either, but I will say this...with the amount of time the Steelers play sub-package defense, finding coverage backs is always on their shopping list. But, I will also say this, they are really happy where their defense is right now. The same can’t be said for their offense.</p>
<p><strong>Carl</strong>: Hi Gerry...your thoughts on Colbert’s suggestion to have three additional rounds in the draft? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Don’t agree at all. If your draft process for seven rounds has been hampered by the pandemic restrictions, why prolong the “guesses” with three more rounds. Also, you have the chance to sign any undrafted free agent you want. With three more rounds, some of those undrafted guys you might want to sign will be gone. Everybody is in the same boat.</p>
<p><strong>Ken</strong>: Okay Gerry, if you had to predict today if there will be a football season come August, what would you predict? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Nope.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Do you think that the NFL will start on schedule in September? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not qualified to predict that. But I think the preseason is in jeopardy, and I say that with absolutely no insight from anyone.</p>
<p><strong>Sammy</strong>: Do you see the Steelers drafting a center to eventually replace Pouncey or possibly waiting until next year when they should have more picks? Thanks Gerry. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That is not on their short list.</p>
<p><strong>Matt</strong>: Gerry, I’ve done some research on a cheap, decent DT FA player for the Steelers. Christian Covington. Any thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I haven’t done the type of research you have apparently performed. I had to google the poor bugger to locate him. CFL free agent. Yeah, he would be cheap.</p>
<p><strong>kevin in Punxsy</strong>: Hi Gerry. I read your article about “Lefty” about an hour ago. Great article. I remember a number of the shots, chips, and puts mentioned. I am a big “Lefty” fan. Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Me too. Thanx</p>
<p><strong>BoomBoom</strong>: Any possibility the Steelers can package something to move up far enough to get one of the higher rated inside LBers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: None whatsoever.</p>
<p><strong>Bill in N. VA</strong>: Gerry - I know you think the Steelers aren’t interested in acquiring Winston, but my gut tells me Ben may get hurt again and the team will be in the similar situation with Mason as QB. I recall when Terry Bradshaw suffered his arm injury and he called it quits. At age 37, the reality of a re-injury puts his future and the Steelers’ in jeopardy. If the team drafts a QB this year, they’ <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Your question/observation didn’t finish, but it didn’t have to for my response. Your gut isn’t making the decisions. Mine either. I’m just telling you where they are now. All that sounds nice, but the people espousing that possibility aren’t considering the reality of it. The only way the Steelers are going to sign some type of veteran QB is if they get to July or August and realize Ben is behind schedule and not coming around as expected. And, right now, that is not the case. He is on schedule, according to the people who monitor him, to be ready for the regular season. By then, If Winston or Andy Dalton are still sitting there and their asking price has dropped like gas prices, then maybe -- MAYBE -- they will kick the tires, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Vince</strong>: Belated Happy Birthday to Tony Dorset who turned 66 yesterday. Have you heard if Steelers have any interest in re-signing Mark Barron? I thought he played pretty well last year and was a salary cap cut. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: TD best college player I ever saw on a regular basis. I don’t know that about Barron, but it would make a lot of sense. I’ll try to check for certain.</p>
<p><strong>Bill in N. VA</strong>: Hi Gerry, My first time chat with you has been marked with typos. Sorry. Anyway, I think Winston is a better bet than Mason or another rookie QB in this year’s draft, if Ben gets hurt again. At his age, it could happen and the Steelers would be in a similar situation as last year. I’d never predict it but injuries happen and are part of the game. WInston is still young and despite the INT-TD ration, he’s a proven NFL QB. Cowher’s endorsed the idea of acquiring him. He’s better than any of the Steelers’ backups. Why not, in your opinion? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Hey, typoos heppan, no wrries. You said the magic words -- if Ben gets hurt again. Then, and only then, might it be a different story. But, if the Steelers are tight against the salary cap, which they are, where do you think they will get the money to sign Winston to a contract that he will likely command. And, again, why would Winston, who led the NFL in passing yards and TDs last season, go somewhere where he will be a backup??? Why do people think he might want to do that? In case Ben isn’t ready? And what if he is?</p>
<p><strong>Mean Jean</strong>: Gerry...I saw a feature on Joe Greene and learned a lot. I never knew he played hurt a good part of his career. Is he serving in any capacity with the Steelers? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: A good part of his later career. His arms was so weak he could barely help one of his teammates off the ground. He no longer serves as a scout with the Steelers, tho they still have involvement with him.</p>
<p><strong>DK</strong>: Surprised Bandon Dunes was not your “B” on golf list. Mulligan? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I never played it. List was only courses I’ve played.</p>
<p><strong>Doyle37</strong>: Shouldn’t Polamalu been picked over Weddle for team of decade ? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Absolutely. Weddle overrated</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: Do the Steelers evaluate players by assigning them a round grade or by projecting where a player will be after the first year, second year, third year? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Little of both, but for draft purposes, they go by round grade.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff</strong>: all this talk about sub package but can’t the offense simply call two plays in the huddle and based on the defense decide run or pass? I don’t remember Farrior, Foote, Keisel, Smith, Woodley, Harrison, Smith coming off the field that much which is what made them great. What am I missing. Is it personnel issue? I never recalled all the substitution but again that was awhile ago <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: That’s right, all different now. All about specialization and substitution of personnel groupings. But that’s why teams go no-huddle -- to keep the defenses from being able to do that. And that’s one of the reasons why the Steelers suffer without Ben. They didn’t have the ability to run the no-huddle because the backup QBs had no experience.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Gerry, thanks as always for your time. The consensus is that the Steelers go offense with their first pick. If, instead, they decide to truly go for the best player available for their future, perhaps even post-Ben, what would that selection be? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Still would be offense, though I’m guessing from the tone of your question you think it should be a quarterback.</p>
<p><strong>TPhunter</strong>: Gerry, many have mentioned the 1974 AFC championship game win over Oakland as perhaps the Steelers most important win of that era. What do you think is the most important victory during the most recent Super Bowl era of 2005-2011? Maybe at the Colts during the 2006 AFC semifinal, with Big Ben’s miracle tackle? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I would agree, but not because of Ben’s tackle. That was the game in which the Steelers finally turned the offense over to Ben, gave him the keys to the car, if you will. And you saw what happened the rest of the way. Totally agree.</p>
<p><strong>DK</strong>: I believe Steelers need to start thinking sooner about drafting interior DL/OL versus skill positions, early....our lineman are on their back-9 of their careers. I think RBs can be drafted 5th round+. Thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: They don’t need a RB on the fifth or sixth round. They have plenty of those guys. They need a No. 1 RB. If they don’t take a RB on the second round, don’t even take one at all. You have plenty of running backs. If he’s not special, or you don’t think he’s special, don’t further populate an already crowded backfield.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantiner</strong>: Hey Gerry, I’ve seen a few LB prospects in this draft that seem to be OLB/ILB tweeners. What are you thoughts on these guys outside of Simmons? Do you think the Steelers will look to grab one within their first 4 picks, and if so, what guys do you think they would feasibly draft? Thanks so much. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think one of those guys is William Gay Jr., no relation to the former Steelers cornerback. Not saying he’s the guy, but he’s the type of guy who fits that description -- can play both inside and out. I think an ILB will be one of the first 4 picks, and should be.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor</strong>: Reports are that deshaun Watson is unhappy in Houston. Bill O’Brien seems to rub players the wrong way. <br> Could you see the Steelers going after him when he becomes a free agent in two years? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Absolutely I could. Seems like a lot of people in Houston have a problem with O’Brien. Gee, that never happened at Penn State...????</p>
<p><strong>GSMP</strong>: With “position less” players like Isaiah Simmons becoming more common will defenses in the future look like 11 guys that are all 6-2 to 6-4 weighing 220 to 240 with speed? It just seems like that’s where it’s heading. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: It won’t be all 11, but it will be five, maybe 6 or 7.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong>: Gerry, if Ben, Conner, and Vance stay healthy is the offense good enough to win a playoff game or two? The defense is finally playing at a high enough level to do so. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Playoff game or two? They are good enough to win more than that, if all stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Everyone in this chat</strong>: Hi Gerry, no matter what you say or how you answer, we are going to keep asking you about Jameis-to-the-Steelers and trying to will it to happen! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Good. I will keep answering the same way, until it doesn’t happen. You forget one very important item -- I have a nice red “X” here on my chat screen that I can delete any question at any time.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: I felt James Harrison should’ve been on all decade list, thoughts? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Not going to argue, but there are a lot of very good OLBs.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Sunner in Orlando</strong>: Why are some of your readers interested in Winston. He wants to be a starter and be paid like one and the Steelers have NO interest in signing a QB when they have a starter. Neither side is interested in the other. Please readers leave it alone! Steelers needs are RB, WR and OL. Period! <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Pay the man.</p>
<p><strong>Quarantiner</strong>: Hey Gerry, how early in the draft would you anticipate the Steelers taking a serious look at drafting a legit backup FS? Thanks <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: No sooner than the fourth round.</p>
<p><strong>darryl</strong>: Gerry, would you consider Randy Boss’s kid, Steelers like family tree players and he would give us another t.e maybe save $ cutting Mcdonald? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: I think once they signed Eric Ebron, that eliminated any chance of drafting a tight end. They are not interested in cutting Vance McDonald.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: Hi Gerry. Hope you are well today. Thanks for the chat. Any predictions about a top 32 player who could realistically fall in the draft and still be on the board when the Steelers pick at 49 whom the Steelers would want to select? <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: Too early to tell Robert. Not a big predictor about things I don’t know. <br> <strong>Gerry Dulac</strong>: OK, kids, that’s all the time we have today. See you next week.</p>
