<h1>Tuned In: NBC launches emotional ‘Council of Dads’ off ‘This is Us’ season finale</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>PASADENA, Calif.&nbsp;— A global pandemic may not seem like the best time to launch a feel-good show about a feel-bad subject, but NBC gives it a shot with the premiere of “Council of Dads” (10 p.m. Tuesday, WPXI-TV) following the fourth-season finale of partially Pittsburgh-set “This is Us.”</p>
<p>The “Council of Dads” premiere is set over the course of a year in the life of a family after patriarch Scott (Tom Everett Scott, “That Thing You Do”) receives a cancer diagnosis leading him to call on his friends to serve as back-up dads (AKA the council) in the event of his death.</p>
<p>Scott’s doctor wife, Robin (Sarah Wayne Callies), winds up with a lot on her plate through the premiere episode. It is inspired by the 2010 book of the same name by Bruce Feiler, who did not die from his cancer.</p>
<p>“Council of Dads” is a better show and less blatantly manipulative than last year’s post-“This is Us” NBC series, “The Village,” but “Council” still piles on the dramatic plot turns in ways that are easy to spot a mile away, though occasionally unpredictable (and maybe even confusing for some viewers). It’s a LOT of drama to absorb all the same.</p>
<p>Give the show a pass on the pilot’s awkward handshake scene. Who knew when they filmed it a year ago that we’d all be self-isolating now.</p>

<p>The show was slotted before the COVID-19 outbreak really got going in America. What’s more surprising about the timing of “Dads” is NBC’s decision to follow the same release schedule it used on “Zoey’s Extraordinary Playlist,” which debuted its premiere episode in January and didn’t air subsequent episodes until a month later. The thinking behind this slow rollout is that NBC makes the pilot available on multiple streaming platforms after the linear premiere and the show might draw more viewers once the show’s episodes start airing weekly. Linear ratings for “Zoey” have remained low but it’s doing well when delayed and digital viewing are factored into the overall ratings equation.</p>
<p>After next week’s series premiere, “Dads” won’t air additional episodes until 8 p.m. on April 30. Considering the current state of the nation — with more people staying home, linear TV ratings have actually been on the rise — it’s surprising NBC hasn’t had a change of heart and opt to continue the series sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>Making this strategy stranger, the “Dads” pilot tells a complete story that might not encourage viewers to come back,&nbsp;especially a month later. Viewers could be excused for watching the premiere and thinking it was an unusual one-shot.</p>
<p>Compounding matters, NBC opted not to make subsequent episodes from the show’s 10-episode first season available for review, making it impossible to describe what the show will be going forward.</p>
<p>At a January press conference during the Television Critics Association winter 2020 press tour, series creators Tony Phelan and Joan Rater (“Grey’s Anatomy”) offered only hints about what the show will be in series:</p>
<p><strong>•&nbsp;</strong>No flashbacks.&nbsp;“The show is very much in the present, this family moving forward from this very devastating event,” Ms. Rater said. But future episodes will play with time without spanning a year as the pilot did.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;One episode explores the first run of holidays&nbsp;— Halloween to New Year’s — following changes in the family makeup.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Viewers will get to know Scott through the dads, through Robin and through the kids. Actor Tom Everett Scott will appear again in the first season but it won’t be in a flashback.</p>
<p>As for those “This is Us” comparisons, Ms. Rater said she’s happy to launch off the back of the NBC hit’s season finale.</p>
<p>“I just think that well-told, recognizable family stories are always going to resonate with people,” she said.</p>
<p>For Callies, a veteran of “Prison Break” and “The Walking Dead,” she’s found herself more drawn to comedy and lighter or more emotional drama in the recent past.</p>
<p>“I never watched ‘The Walking Dead’&nbsp;—&nbsp;it scared me&nbsp;— but 10 years ago, the world was different and that kind of exploration of depravity and desperation and fear was subversive and it was interesting and it was new,” she said in January during an interview after the “Dads” panel. “Now we have such a glut of shows about what a dystopian, [messed] up world we’re in … that I think now it’s actually subversive to say, maybe we’re gonna be OK. Maybe we can get through this by reaching out to one another.”</p>
<p>That theme might be ready-made for this particular moment.</p>
