<h1>National Aviary reopens July 1</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The birds at the National Aviary will be receiving visitors again, starting July 1 after a three-month shutdown because of concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic. Special safety precautions will be in effect.</p>
<p>A new online timed ticketing system will allow staff at the North Side facility to control the entry and movement of visitors. Masks and social distancing will be required. The tickets will be available later this month at the <a href="https://www.aviary.org/" target="_blank">aviary.org</a> website. The number of people admitted will be less than usual.</p>
<p>Visitors can also prebook closeup animal encounters with a number of animals, including penguins sloths, hawks and owls.&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some new things to see. The popular Victoria crowned pigeons have a new chick and the Grasslands habitat has been renovated.</p>
<p>Safety precautions have been adapted after consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local authorities and collaborations with other members of the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.</p>
<p>National Aviary members will be admitted June 28, 29 and 30.</p>
