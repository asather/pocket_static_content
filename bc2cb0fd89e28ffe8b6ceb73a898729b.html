<h1>Shortage of drivers during pandemic causes Port Authority to miss thousands of trips</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Port Authority has missed more than 10,000 hours of service and canceled hundreds of trips due to a lack of bus drivers since May, when the agency started trying to return service to levels that existed before the COVID-19 pandemic began in March.</p>
<p>Figures released by the agency show the missed trips spiked in July, when drivers weren’t available for 5,259 hours of service. That means thousands of riders waiting at bus stops were left stranded when their bus didn’t arrive at the scheduled time.</p>
<p>The authority almost never has a driver for every one of its trips, but the numbers in recent months were way above normal. In July 2019, the hours of service missed was 191.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While those out-of-service numbers aren’t acceptable, authority spokesman Adam Brandolph said they weren’t unexpected. After the pandemic began, dozens of operators and other employees were off either because they or a family member were sick, they had child-care issues or they were in a high-risk category for the virus.</p>
<p>The agency ordered everyone who wasn’t ill back to work the first week of August and the numbers have been climbing since then.</p>
<p>“If you look at the numbers, they are still too high, but they are improving,” Mr. Brandolph said. “We think they will continue to get better as more people come back to work. Now, we’re starting to get back on track.”</p>
<p>Last month, the authority said since the pandemic began it had paid&nbsp;$3.3 million to 651 employees who had been off with various COVID-19 absences: 285 for virus testing; 111 to monitor symptoms; and 255 in medical quarantine. Under the federal CARES Act, dozens more were off, first at full pay then at two-thirds pay, for&nbsp;child care or for caring for family members.</p>
<p>Initially, with sharply reduced service in March and April, that didn’t cause many service problems. As the agency tried to ramp up service, though, it resulted in drivers being unavailable for thousands of trips.</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said part of the problem is that under union rules the agency only can make service changes every three months. Just after the virus emergency began, it cut service by 75% across the board in March as ridership dropped sharply; restored full service to 39 bus routes in May in anticipation of the virus being contained; and in June announced it would attempt to return to full service Aug. 23.</p>
<p>But the number of virus cases spiked again and ridership remained at least 50% below 2019 levels. As a result, with the agency trying to operate all scheduled service without the necessary drivers, it continues to struggle in two areas: not having enough drivers to meet the schedule and having buses that are passing riders because they are too full under social distancing guidelines to pick up more passengers.</p>
<p>“I would say our response to service issues, because we can only modify service every quarter, was behind,” Mr. Brandolph said.&nbsp;“By the time we were able to make changes, the situation changed again. We have to analyze and make changes a month in advance, so that makes us a little slow to respond.”</p>
<p>Riders have let the authority know they aren’t happy about either situation, Mr. Brandolph said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;“I think that’s natural if you say you’re going to be there at a certain time and you don’t show up that people aren’t happy,” he said.&nbsp;“That’s sort of our contract with our customers that we show up when we say we will.</p>
<p>“I hope people understand during this pandemic we have been doing our absolute best to keep up as much of the transit bargain as we can.”&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Brandolph said the agency is working on&nbsp;“a few tweaks” it intends to make with the quarterly changes in November.</p>
<p>“They should be finalized by the end of September. We think it will mean less out-of-service hours for the system.”</p>
