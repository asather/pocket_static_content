<h1>Hoburg's start in Pittsburgh could finish on the moon -- or beyond</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Most graduates step away from their commencement ceremonies feeling as if the world is at their fingertips.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh native Warren Woodrow “Woody” Hoburg and his classmates have their sights set a little bit higher.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Hoburg was one of 13 members of NASA’s 2020 class of astronauts who graduated Friday morning in a ceremony at the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Their futures promise to take them to the International Space Station and on missions to the moon as part of the upcoming Artemis program. One or more of them might even walk on the surface of Mars.</p>
<p>That’s a long way from running in the streets of Pittsburgh during the Great Race, as Mr. Hoburg did in 1995 when he was 10 years old. (His time was 53:17.)</p>
<p>Since then, Mr. Hoburg, 34, has graduated from North Allegheny High School, and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2008. He earned a Master of Science in 2011, followed by a doctorate in 2013, in electrical engineering and computer science from the University of California, Berkeley. He then worked in product development at Boeing, became an assistant professor at MIT, and spent some time working on a search-and-rescue team in Yosemite National Park in California.</p>
<p>All the while, his eyes were on the nighttime sky, a dream that took hold of him when he was a boy of 15 tinkering with model rockets in Western Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>His graduation at NASA marks the end of two years of intensive training in America’s space program. These 13 adventurers have been trained in robotics, undertaking exercises that simulate spacewalking, flying T-38 jets, and learning the Russian language due to NASA’s partnership with that nation.</p>
<p>“I can’t believe that it’s only been two years since I started with my fellow classmates,” Mr. Hoburg said in a satellite interview from Houston after the ceremony. “I feel like I’ve known them all forever. We’ve been through shared struggles as well as triumphs together, and we are just a wonderful tight-knit group of people, and I’m so lucky to be surrounded by this bunch of friends as well as future crewmates.”</p>
<p>The Class of 2020 —&nbsp;comprising seven men and six women —&nbsp;brings NASA’s astronaut corps to 48 members. Two members of this year’s graduating class are Canadian, and two others, in addition to Mr. Hoburg, have Pennsylvania connections.</p>
<p>Zena Cardman, 32, is a marine biologist and geoscientist who did her doctoral work at Penn State University’s College of Earth and Mineral Sciences.</p>
<p>Bob Hines, 44, a U.S. Air Force lieutenant colonel, attended high school in Mountain Top, Luzerne County, but considers Harrisburg his hometown. Before joining the astronaut training program, he has deployed in Iraq and was a NASA research pilot at Johnson.</p>
<p>“I think we have, today more than ever, a diverse population of astronauts in the corps, and you see that mostly in our diversity of experience and our backgrounds,” said Mr. Hoburg, whose parents now live in New Hampshire. “As a civilian, I come here as an engineer. Some of my classmates are everything from geologists to microbiologists to fighter pilots, a Navy SEAL, a submariner. We have so many different paths to get here.</p>
<p>“The theme you see is some sort of technical area of expertise that we excelled at, combined with a passion for operational skills. In my case, that was engineering and search and rescue, but for my classmates that might have been serving on Antarctic research vessels. [There was] a huge wide range of possibilities for getting here.”</p>
<p>And for going further.</p>
<p>“These individuals represent the best of America, and what an incredible time for them to join our astronaut corps,” NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine said at the graduation, at which Texas Senators John Cornyn and Ted Cruz also spoke.&nbsp; “2020 will mark the return of launching American astronauts on American rockets from American soil, and will be an important year of progress for our Artemis program and missions to the moon and beyond.”</p>
<p>During Friday’s ceremony, each new astronaut received a silver pin, a tradition dating back to the Mercury 7 astronauts, who were selected in 1959. They will receive a gold pin once they complete their first spaceflights.</p>
<p>What that might be like, Mr. Hoburg said, he can only imagine.</p>
<p>“I have no idea what it’s going to be like, those first few moments in space, but I’m really looking forward to it, and I’m looking forward to communicating it back so other people can share in the experience as well,” he said.</p>
<p>“One of the comments I hear from veteran astronauts a lot is just the importance of staying the course and continuing with the mission that we have. I think people sometimes forget the amazing things we’re doing in space every day. We’ve been living and working on the International Space Station now for almost 20 years. That’s absolutely amazing, that’s more than half my life that there’s not a day that’s gone by that we haven’t had men and women on board the International Space Station living and working in space. ... [Now] we want to land the next man and the first woman on the moon, and I can’t wait to see that happen.”</p>
