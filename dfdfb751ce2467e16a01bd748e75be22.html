<h1>Giant Eagle cuts hours; Heinz History Center, Fort Pitt Museum close due to COVID-19 concerns</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Giant Eagle is temporarily reducing its hours starting Sunday in response to COVID-19.</p>
<p>The supermarket chain announced Saturday afternoon that its Giant Eagle and Market District locations — including ones that are now 24-7 —&nbsp;will open at 7 a.m. and close at 10 p.m. seven days a week.</p>
<p>Most stores are open from 5 a.m. to 1 a.m.</p>
<p>Adjacent GetGo stores will have the same hours, and the chain’s curbside delivery service will, too.</p>
<p>Standalone GetGo gas stations will function as normal, including locations that operate around the clock.</p>
<p>Supermarkets have been unusually busy in the past several days as local, state and federal governments have enacted extraordinary measures to combat the coronavirus pandemic.</p>
<p>Changing hours, according to Dick Roberts, a Giant Eagle spokesman, will give workers a chance to restock shelves, clean the stores and destress.&nbsp;</p>
<p>While Giant Eagle is staying open, albeit under a different schedule, COVID-19 fears are prompting a new round of closings of locations and events in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
<p>The Heinz History Center and Fort Pitt Museum announced that they will close effective Saturday through March 29.</p>
<p>U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania will remain open for business in Pittsburgh, Erie and Johnstown, but all jury selection and jury trials scheduled to begin before April 27 are postponed pending further notice and will be rescheduled.</p>
<p>Judicial officers can continue at their own discretion to hold bench trials, hearings, conferences and sentencings. Sitting grand juries can continue to meet.</p>
<p>In issuing its order, district court recognized that jury pools frequently involve the need to travel and include those in the age categories most at risk from the COVID-19 virus.</p>
<p>On Friday evening, the state's Public Utility Commission forbid utilities from shutting off services. The moratorium remains in effect as long as the state's disaster declaration.</p>
<p>Also, Just Harvest, an anti-hunger organization, has suspended its free tax preparation services at its South Side, Community College of Allegheny County Boyce and Bedford Hope Center locations beginning Monday. It said it will coincide its reopening of the sites with the Pittsburgh Public Schools schedule.</p>
<p>Just Harvest will contact those with tax appointments scheduled during the closure to reschedule.</p>
<p>Additionally, Just Harvest announced the postponement of D-Jam 2020, an annual fundraising event, which was scheduled to take place March 21 at the Rex Theater.</p>
<p>Bishop David Zubik canceled the Rite of Election and Call to Continuing Conversion that had been scheduled for Sunday at 2:30 p.m. at St.Paul Cathedral in Oakland.</p>
<p>The rite is a ceremony for adults and children seeking baptism and full initiation into the Catholic church.</p>
<p>Two shows scheduled at the Palace Theatre in Greensburg have been rescheduled, according to Latshaw Productions.</p>
<p>Little Anthony and The Imperials, The Crystals and The Marcels, all originally scheduled to play Sunday afternoon, are rescheduled for a July 12 show at 3 p.m.</p>
<p>Neal McCoy, who was supposed to go on March 21, will now appear June 28 at 7 p.m.</p>
<p>Latshaw said all tickets for the original dates will be honored and automatically transferred.</p>
