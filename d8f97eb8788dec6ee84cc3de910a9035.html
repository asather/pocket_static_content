<p>ST. LOUIS —&nbsp;Hockey’s youth was on grand display in the NHL All-Star 3-on-3 tournament on Saturday night, which was won by the Pacific Division.</p>
<p>Whether it was Boston’s 23-year-old David Pastrnak earning MVP honors with six points or Vancouver’s 21-year-old Elias Pettersson scoring twice and trying a lacrosse goal, the fifth incarnation of 3 on 3 making up the All-Star Game was a showcase of the game’s present and future.</p>
<p>“It’s a young man’s game now in the NHL, and these guys, they’re superstars,” Dallas Stars forward Tyler Seguin said.</p>
<p>The night featured as many swear words during Green Day’s performance as saves by some of the goaltenders, who aren’t exactly in a good spot with more open ice than defense going on. Things tightened up and the final before the Pacific beat the Atlantic 5-4 and claim the $1 million prize.</p>
<p>“The second half, they turn it on and started to really play, which is good for the All-Star Game,” said Pastrnak, who gets a car for his four goals and two assists. “We’re all having fun, but it comes to the end that we are all hockey players and it’s in our nature that everybody wants to win. Even if you’re playing and having fun, you still want to win.”</p>
<p>Along the way, there were plenty of opportunities for players to try things they ordinarily wouldn’t in a game that counts. Along with Pettersson, Chicago veteran Patrick Kane thought about celebrating his eighth NHL All-Star appearance by lifting the puck in lacrosse style before his hockey sense kicked in.</p>
<p>“I was thinking about it at that moment, and then I was kind of thinking that our team kind of needed a goal,” said Kane, who was cheered and booed in enemy territory. “Then I gave away the puck anyway, so I should’ve just tried it.”</p>
<p>One of the most memorable parts of the night came when lead singer Billie Joe Armstrong swore multiple times during Green Day’s performance, words that could be heard in-arena but were bleeped on the TV broadcast.</p>
<p>“I heard a lot of F-bombs,” Bruins coach Bruce Cassidy said. “I was like, is this OK?”</p>
<p>Before that, there were family friendly moments and reminders of the Blues’ Stanley Cup run last season. Laila Anderson, the 11-year-old whose courageous battle with a rare immune disorder served as the team’s inspiration when winning its first Cup title, announced Blues All-Stars Ryan O’Reilly, Jordan Binnington, David Perron and Alex Pietrangelo.</p>
<p>“She was really good, too,” said Blues forward David Perron, who along with O’Reilly gave Anderson a hug when they were introduced. “She had a good voice and was pretty loud and she had fun doing it, so it certainly was special for all four of us.”</p>
<p>St. Louis natives Jon Hamm and Jenna Fischer and Hockey Hall of Fame Blues alumni Wayne Gretzky and Brett Hull spent time behind the benches as honorary captains. With less pressure and more pomp and circumstance, even usually intense Blues coach Craig Berube could relax.</p>
<p>“I didn’t do much coaching,” Berube said. “I just stood there. It’s kind of nice, you just watch and watch the skill level and the talent out there and really just not have to engage too much. It’s stress-free.”</p>
<p>Blues fans who cheered Binnington’s success in the skills competition Friday didn’t get to see their players reach the 3-on-3 final because the Central Division lost the Western Conference semifinal 10-5 to the Pacific. Calgary’s Matthew Tkachuk, who grew up in St. Louis, had two goals and two assists including the game-winner.</p>
<p>Pastrnak and Ottawa Senators forward Anthony Duclair each had a hat trick to help the Atlantic beat the Metropolitan in the Eastern Conference semifinal.</p>
<p>“I just wanted to show what I can do,” said Duclair, whose comeback season has been one of the best stories in the NHL thus far. “When you’re playing with the best players in the world, you’re going to make some plays.”</p>
<p>Those plays came fast and furious and not without some drama. After some incidents during Oilers-Flames games this season left no love lost between the heated Alberta rivals, Draisaitl could be seen — perhaps jokingly — cursing at Tkachuk after setting him up for a goal.</p>
<p>“It was a nice play by him,” Draisaitl said with a laugh. “We’re all here to have fun. We’re all here to have a good time and things like that, they happen in the game but this is not the time to be grumpy about anything.”</p>
<p>There’s plenty of time for that the rest of the NHL season.</p>
