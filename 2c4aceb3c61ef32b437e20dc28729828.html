<h1>Seven Pitt players miss season opener due to 'COVID-related protocols'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As Pitt prepared to begin its 2020 football season Saturday, it had do so with reminders of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic all around it, none of which are more obvious than playing in an empty stadium.</p>
<p>Such signs of the times extend even to the Panthers’ roster.</p>
<p>Pitt had seven players missing for the team’s game against Austin Peay due to what the university described as “COVID-related protocols.”</p>
<p>Earlier in the day, standout defensive lineman Rashad Weaver sent a pair of tweets expressing frustration with the testing process, noting that two companies in two separate tests had found he was negative, but that a third company, which tested him twice, found he was positive in both instances, with the first coming Sunday and the second Thursday.</p>
<p>“It’s not adding up,” he wrote. “Let’s call it spade for spade. Company 1 the common denominator. They playing with my money.”</p>
<p>In a later tweet, Weaver, who missed all of last season after tearing his ACL, said it was “no big deal” to miss another game before adding “see y’all next week!”</p>
<p>The Panthers completed their third and final round of COVID-19 testing Friday, with coach Pat Narduzzi saying Thursday that he and his program “feel good” about where they were at following the most recent round of testing.</p>
<p>In accordance with an ACC mandate, Pitt is undergoing nasal swab tests three times a week. On Friday, Pitt players and coaches were tested twice, with staff members from MAKO Medical, a lab in North Carolina, going up the left and right nostril with a nasal swab, putting it in a vial and closing it before repeating the procedure.</p>
<p>Pitt’s athletic department has not disclosed data related to COVID-19 cases since athletes returned to campus, though the university has a dashboard that provides an overview of cases on campus. That dashboard is updated twice weekly.</p>
