<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wilkinsburg’s borough manager has been fired for allegedly misappropriating funds, according to Mayor Marita Garrett.</p>
<p>Ex-manager Donn R. Henderson —&nbsp;who served in the position since June 2016 — was officially terminated by borough council on June 9 for illegally transferring funds from the Wilkinsburg&nbsp;Police Department and into the “general funds,” Ms. Garrett said. The amount of funds he allegedly mishandled was not immediately made clear.</p>
<p>The termination was publicly announced during a council meeting last week.</p>
<p>"Yes, he was terminated, but I feel there needs to be some repercussions for this," Ms. Garrett said. "I don't want this happening to another community. The thing about borough managers is there are so few out there that people get desperate to have them. I hope council takes this seriously."</p>
<p>A search of court records showed that no charges have been filed against Mr. Henderson.</p>
