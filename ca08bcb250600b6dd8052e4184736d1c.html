<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>An American pilot died when her plane malfunctioned while she was on her way to deliver COVID-19 rapid test kits to a remote Indonesian village, officials said.</p>
<p>Joyce Lin, 40, had just taken off Tuesday morning, leaving the airport in Sentani, in Papua province, in a Kodiak aircraft. She was a missionary with the Mission Aviation Fellowship, serving as a pilot and an information technolgoy specialist.</p>
<p>She'd been with the MAF for about three years, <a href="https://www.maf.org/lin" target="_blank">according to the organization</a>.</p>
<p>Tuesday, Ms. Lin was attempting to fly to Mamit, in the Papua highlands, in an effort to bring test kits to the local clinic. Within minutes of takeoff, she reported an emergency.</p>
<p>The aircraft fell into Lake Sentani, and divers confirmed she did not survive, <a href="https://hub.maf.org/news/maf-family-grieving-for-pilot-lost-in-accident" target="_blank">according to the MAF</a>. She was the only one aboard the plane. The MAF said it is working with local authorities to investigate the incident.</p>
<p>Ms. Lin had worked in Indonesia for two years, and joined the MAF after more than a decade of work as a computer specialist. She was a graduate of the Massachusetts Insitute of Technology, where she received both her bachelor and master degrees, before enrolling at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary and graduating in 2017.</p>
<p>It was at seminary that Ms. Lin discovered mission aviation, and she never looked back.</p>
<p>"Joyce was a light reflecting Jesus, and she will be deeply missed," the MAF wrote in a statement.</p>
<p>Ms. Lin is survived by her parents and two sisters, who have requested privacy were not available for comment.</p>
<p>Indonesia has seen more than 15,000 cases of the virus, and over 1,000 deaths, according to <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/asia/indonesia-ghost-volunteers-pocong-intl/index.html" target="_blank">figures from Johns Hopkins University.</a> That's the highest death toll for any East Asian country, other than China, and only Singapore and China have had more cases.</p>
<p>The country has seen its coronavirus numbers <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/asia/indonesia-ghost-volunteers-pocong-intl/index.html" target="_blank">rapidly multiply</a>, despite not reporting any COVID-19 cases until March.</p>
<p>President Joko Widodo didn't declare a national public health emergency until March 31, the same day it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/world/live-news/coronavirus-outbreak-03-31-20-intl/h_9d84bdd8b2671de839f5d60a415d275b" target="_blank">forbade most foreign visitors</a> from entering or transiting through the country.</p>
