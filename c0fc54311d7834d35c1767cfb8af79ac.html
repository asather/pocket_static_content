<h1>Pirates reliever Cody Ponce honored late mother with cleats in MLB debut</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Cody Ponce’s major league debut likely wasn’t exactly what he had planned.</p>
<p>Ponce entered the Pirates’ game against the Chicago Cubs on Sunday in the 11th inning. That meant, with the new MLB rule, there was already a runner on second. Ponce got the first batter, Anthony Rizzo, to fly out to right field, but the second, Javier Baez, singled into center field, driving in the game-winning run and saddling Ponce with the loss.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ponce remembered his debut fondly a day afterward. The last few years have been hard for Ponce and his family. In 2017, his mother, Jennifer, was diagnosed with stage-four brain cancer. She passed away on Dec. 1 of that year.</p>
<p>Ponce’s cleats Sunday had the Los Angeles skyline, his hometown, on one side and the Pittsburgh skyline on the other. Grey brain cancer ribbons were depicted on the heels of the shoes. And on the left side of the shoes, it read “Jennifer,” with the other side reading “Ponce.”</p>
<p>“That was the one person who I wish was there with me and I had a call that I was able to make to her,” Ponce said. “... So those cleats meant a lot to me. I knew that those were the only day that they were going to be worn, no matter what, so those things will be put up for the rest of my life. But yeah, they had a lot of special meanings, coming from my hometown, the area code of where I’m from. And I’m just proud to be able to say that I could be able to share the field with all these great guys.”</p>
<p>Ponce did call his father, Joe, after the game, who told him how proud he was. Ponce says the message that stuck with him the most, however, came in a text from his sister, Devan.</p>
<p>“It was just, she’s like, ‘You know what? No matter what happened, you’re still a winner in my heart because you won and you were able to make your dream a reality. So for you and our family, you’ll always be a winner, because you did what you set out to do,’” Ponce said.</p>
<p>One benefit of milestone events like Sunday’s is the ability to look back at the journey to make it to that point. That includes the personal, off-the-field events, but also the ones directly affecting his career.</p>
<p>Last year, he was traded from the Milwaukee Brewers to the Pirates. So Ponce got in a car and drove from Biloxi, Miss., home of the Brewers’ Class AA affiliate, to New Jersey to join the Pirates’ Class AA Altoona on the road. He split time the rest of the season between Altoona and Class AAA Indianapolis.</p>
<p>At the beginning of this season, Ponce spent his time with the Pirates’ alternate training squad in Altoona. He admitted Monday that it’s tough there. The numbers in the camp don’t allow for full scrimmages daily, and he said morale can get low.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m not going to say it’s all fun and games, because it’s not,” Ponce said. “I just try to have as much fun as I can. I try to keep a competitive spirit with everybody. I like to talk a little smack, whether I get mine or they get theirs, it keeps everybody kind of enjoying it and having fun and the competition level up. I mean, yeah, it’s very tough to know that sometimes people aren’t just going to play all out. Some people are going through the motions because they don’t want to be there or they just don’t see the light at the end of the tunnel when this is a sprint of a season and anything can happen.”</p>
<p>If anyone is evidence of that, it’s Ponce.</p>
<p>Certainly he would have liked to have pitched a shutout inning, but when all is said and done, he earned more than just the statistical loss from his debut.</p>
<p>“Who would have thought [a year ago] I’d be sitting in this chair in front of [media] on a Zoom phone call for an interview?” Ponce said.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“...&nbsp;It was a dream come true. Obviously everybody knows that. It was a little difficult at the same time. I wasn’t able to share it with one person in particular, but it was a whirlwind of emotions.”</p>
