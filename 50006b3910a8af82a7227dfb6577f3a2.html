<h1>Pittsburgh musicians pull off virtual jam session on classic 'Man of Constant Sorrow'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>“Man of Constant Sorrow” has a long, proud history, dating back to 1913 when it was first published by fiddler Dick Burnett as the “Farewell Song.”</p>
<p>The haunting folk tune was later covered by everyone from the Stanley Brothers to a young Bob Dylan to Ginger Baker’s Air Force. The best-known take of the song is the Grammy-winning rendition by the fictional Soggy Bottom Boys in the Coen brothers’ 2000 film “O Brother, Where Art Thou?”</p>
<p>On Wednesday, a “supergroup” of Pittsburgh musicians presented “Man of Constant Sorrow”&nbsp; the quarantine version.</p>

<p>Peter Guellard, from the veteran industrial rock band Venus in Furs, instigated the virtual jam session and takes the lead, joined by guitarist Dirk Miller (Rusted Root), drummer Tracey Whorton (Jenn Wertz Band, Venus In Furs), bassist Andrew Belsick (LoFi Delphi), violinist Megan Williams (The Turpentiners, Emily Rogers) and keyboardist/backing vocalist Charmaine Evonne.</p>
<p>“It is impossible to do it live,” Guellard says, “because the internet is not fast enough for musical interaction and everybody playing together in sync. What you do is you have to have a demo recording with a click track. Each musician gets to play with the recording in his or her headphones while simultaneously recording a video selfie. All these selfies are later combined into one screen in a video editing software and each audio track from these selfies mixed in audio software.”</p>
<p>Pittsburgh pop-punk band Punchline took a similar approach to the video for its new single “Just Stay Home.”</p>

<p>Besides just keeping us entertained, Guellard says, “It’s important to show that staying home during the quarantine doesn't have to be boring.”</p>
