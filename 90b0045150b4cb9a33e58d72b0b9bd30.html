<h1>Top football teams will be part of Woodland Hills annual kickoff showcase</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Even if no one is permitted to watch, Woodland Hills is going through with the “Everyone” event.</p>
<p>The high school football season in Pennsylvania will start Aug. 28 and Woodland Hills will play host to a multi-game event that weekend for the third consecutive year at the Wolvarena in Turtle Creek. The “Western Pennsylvania vs. Everyone Football Showcase” will feature some excellent matchups this season between WPIAL teams and strong teams from the Harrisburg area, Ohio and New Jersey.</p>
<p>Woodland Hills athletic director Ron Coursey is the man responsible for starting the event and this year’s may be the best of three years, simply because of the matchups. Coursey is just hopeful the COVID-19 pandemic doesn’t cancel the event — and high school football this season.</p>
<p>“This event is a celebration that maybe the worst is behind us,” Coursey said. “But the reality is that I don’t want to get too excited yet, because if the (COVID-19) numbers would start to spike, maybe the governor (Tom Wolf) or the PIAA would pull the plug because it’s not in the best interest of high school athletics.”</p>
<p>It has not been determined by the PIAA or the governor’s office if there will be any restrictions on Pa. football games this season, such as crowd size.</p>
<p>“If the situation is where we are not allowed to have fans, or limited fans, we would still have the event,” Coursey said.</p>
<p>The Woodland Hills School District uses Roxamore Sports Network to live stream some Woodland Hills sporting events. Coursey said if fans are not allowed to attend at the football kickoff showcase, Roxamore would live stream all of the games on a pay-per-view basis.</p>
<p>“The bottom line is, obviously, sports are not more important than people’s health, wellness or safety,” Coursey said. “But sports are a big part of our society and high school sports in the fall would be one of the biggest signs that we are getting back to some kind of normalcy.”</p>
<p>Two games will be played Aug. 28 and three on Aug. 29. Ticket information will be released in the future, but here is a look at the five games at the Wolvarena.</p>
<p><strong>FRIDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our Lady of the Sacred Heart vs. Perry, 5 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;— This is the second consecutive year that OLSH has played in the event. OLSH won the WPIAL Class 1A championship in 2018 and was 7-4 last year. Perry is a City League team hoping to improve in Rod Rutherford’s third season as coach.</p>
<p><strong>Harrisburg vs. Central Catholic, 8 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;— This could be the best game of the weekend. Central Catholic is the defending WPIAL Class 6A champion and figures to be one of the top teams in the state this season. Harrisburg usually has a strong team and lost in the 2018 PIAA Class 6A title game to St. Joseph’s Prep. Harrisburg’s 2016 team featured Micah Parsons, now a star at Penn State, and lost in the PIAA Class 5A final to Archbishop Wood. This year, Harrisburg has Nate Bruce, a 6-foot-3, 235-pound offensive guard who has committed to Penn State. Maybe he will go against Central Catholic defensive tackle Elliot Donald, a heavily-recruited senior and one of the WPIAL’s top players.</p>
<p><strong>SATURDAY</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sto-Rox vs. Steelton-Highspire, noon</strong>&nbsp;— Sto-Rox made it to the WPIAL Class 1A championship last season, but moves up to Class 2A this year. Steelton-Highspire, located near Harrisburg, usually has a highly competitive team and won PIAA Class 1A championships in 2007-08.</p>
<p><strong>Clairton vs. Penns Grove (N.J.), 3:30 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;— Clairton won the WPIAL Class 1A championship last year and has 10 titles since 2006. With a number of returning starters, Clairton is expected to have one of the top 1A teams in the state. Penns Grove lost in the Group 1 (smallest division) New Jersey Central Region championship last year. The loss snapped a 25-game winning streak. Penns Grove finished 13-0 in 2018 and won the Central Region championship.</p>
<p><strong>Woodland Hills vs. Dublin Coffman (Ohio), 7 p.m.</strong>&nbsp;— Woodland Hills expects to rebound from a 3-7 season, the worst in school history. But the Wolverines start this year off against a perennial power from Ohio. Dublin Coffman has made it to the Ohio regional final in the largest classification for the past two years. This season’s team has three players rated among the top 30 in Ohio (according to Rivals.com) and all three are headed to Power Five conference colleges. They are outside linebacker Devon Williams (University of Minnesota), running back-defensive back Bryon Threats (Purdue) and defensive end Hammond Russell IV (West Virginia).</p>
<p>Dublin Coffman is the alma mater of former NFL quarterback Brady Quinn.</p>
