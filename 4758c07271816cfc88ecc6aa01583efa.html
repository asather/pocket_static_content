<h1>World struggles to comprehend X Æ A-12 —&nbsp;the name of Elon Musk’s new baby</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Welcome to planet Earth, little&nbsp;X Æ A-12 Musk.</p>
<p>The first child of SpaceX and Tesla boss Elon Musk and his musician girlfriend Grimes apparently has a name so out of this world, fans were left puzzling over how to pronounce it Tuesday.</p>
<p>Musk announced the birth late Monday and posted a photo of the sweet infant with a filter that gave him tiny face tattoos.</p>
<p>“Mom &amp; baby all good,” he said in another tweet.</p>
<p>Asked to reveal the baby’s name, Musk tweeted, “X Æ A-12 Musk.”</p>
<p>The futuristic name, real or not, sent fans racing to decipher a possible pronunciation.</p>
<p>One follower guessed “X Ash Archangel?” while giving screenshots of evidence gathered to support the proposal.</p>
<p>Musk liked the tweet, apparently hinting it was at least on the right track.</p>
<p>The billionaire Tesla CEO has been making nonstop headlines recently with his call for an end to pandemic stay-at-home orders and a vow to sell off most of his possessions, including his homes.</p>
<p>He sent Tesla stock tanking when he said Friday he considered the shares overvalued.</p>
<p>Two of Musk’s pricey properties showed listings on the real estate industry website Zillow Tuesday that apparently were posted Monday.</p>
<p>His seven-bedroom, 11-bathroom house bordering the Bel-Air Country Club was listed for a whopping $30 million, though it wasn’t immediately clear if Musk was actually entertaining offers.</p>
<p>His five-bedroom house directly across the street, which previously belonged to actor Gene Wilder, was listed on Zillow for $9.5 million.</p>
