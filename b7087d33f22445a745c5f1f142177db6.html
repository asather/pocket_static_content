<h1>Man arrested for shooting at car that hit boy in East Pittsburgh</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A man was arrested Saturday after police said he fired shots into a vehicle that hit a 5-year-old boy in East Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>State police charged Dion Marquis Peterson of East Pittsburgh with two counts of aggravated assault and three counts of reckless endangerment after the incident in the 500 block of Bessemer Avenue.</p>
<p>Police said in a criminal complaint they were dispatched to the scene around 5:13 p.m. after a car struck the boy, who had run out into the street.</p>
<p>The driver of the car, Morgan Thompson, told police she stopped the car after hitting the boy and a man started shooting at her and her 16-year-old passenger while both of them remained in the front seat of the vehicle.</p>
<p>A witness identified Mr. Peterson as the shooter.</p>
<p>Mr. Peterson told police the boy is his nephew and he was outside his residence on Bessemer Avenue when the crash occurred.</p>
<p>After the boy was hit, Mr. Peterson told police he believed the driver was trying to leave the scene and he used his 9-mm pistol to shoot several rounds at the carâ€™s back tire.</p>
<p>Police said video surveillance showed the driver did not appear to be leaving the scene and that Peterson fired directly over the boy and into the rear of the car.</p>
<p>The boy was taken to a hospital in serious, but stable condition.</p>
<p>A preliminary hearing for Mr. Peterson is scheduled for July 27.</p>
