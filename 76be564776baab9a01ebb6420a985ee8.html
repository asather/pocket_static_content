<h1>Gary Bettman details one possible plan for the resumption of the NHL season</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The NHL still has so much to figure out when it comes to contingency plans for the resumption of the 2019-20 season, should government officials and public health experts give the league the green light in the coming months.</p>
<p>But it does appear the league is at least whittling down its options.</p>
<p>In a Wednesday interview with Sportsnet, commissioner Gary Bettman said the NHL has decided against playing games in non-NHL arenas at neutral sites. He acknowledged the league is considering a plan to finish the season at as many as four NHL arenas, knocking out multiple games per day with no fans.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’ll be two cities,” <a href="https://www.nhl.com/news/commissioner-gary-bettman-on-scenario-to-resume-nhl-season/c-316699898" target="_blank">he said, per NHL.com</a>. “It’s not something that we can predict right at this moment. But this is part of the contingencies. It doesn’t necessarily have to be by division, although the centralization may be by division. But the particular location could be anywhere that isn’t a hot spot.”</p>
<p>Bettman said the league won’t be able to play games in, for example, an arena on a college campus because the facility would need to have at least four locker rooms, a playing surface that meets NHL specifications and the technology needed to put on the games and broadcast them on various media.</p>
<p>So, no, the Penguins won’t be playing playoff games in North Dakota.</p>
<p>The league, Bettman said, could look to play games in two to four NHL venues, with several teams in each city for practices and games. He added that locker rooms, benches and other areas would need to be sanitized often.</p>
<p>Bettman said it has not been determined which cities could play host. It’s been rumored the NHL is eyeing Raleigh, N.C., for Metropolitan Division games.</p>
<p>Again, this is just one of the many, many ideas the NHL, the 31 teams and the NHLPA have been kicking around. But it is certainly noteworthy that in a TV interview Bettman was willing to discuss in detail this particular plan.</p>
<p>Another significant admission Bettman made in the Sportsnet interview was that the NHL is open to pushing back the start of the 2020-21 season to make sure the Stanley Cup gets awarded for the 2019-20 season. Previously, the NHL’s public stance was that having next season go as scheduled was a priority.</p>
<p>“Clearly, we can play into the summer,” Bettman said, per NHL.com. “Clearly, we can play next season, which we intend to do in its entirety, starting later. And so, with a lot of timing options, we have a great deal of flexibility, and we’re not going to rush anything. We're not going to do anything that’s crazy.”</p>
<p>The NHL has told players and team staff that they should self-quarantine through April 30. The next step, eventually, will be allowing players to skate and work out at team facilities. After that would be training camps. Bettman, after talking with the NHLPA, said the camps would need to be at least three weeks.</p>
<p>All this sounds encouraging. And who doesn’t want hockey back? But looking at the landscape outside the NHL bubble, it’s clear we probably still have a long way to go before we are able to watch people chase around a puck again.</p>
<p>Bettman again acknowledged that the NHL isn’t calling the shots right now.</p>
<p>“The decision ultimately will be made by medical people and people who are in governments at all different levels,” he said. “So we’re not going to try and do anything that flies in the face of what we’re being told is appropriate.”</p>
