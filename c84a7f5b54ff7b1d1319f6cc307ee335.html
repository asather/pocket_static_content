<h1>GM Ben Cherington says Pirates will likely cut some minor leaguers soon</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>On Saturday, the Pirates committed to paying their minor league players, all 300-plus of them, through the end of June.</p>
<p>The topic was hot in the last week, after the Oakland Athletics decided they would not pay their minor leaguers through June, after a previous agreement guaranteed those players $400 a week through May. That resulted in many MLB organizations coming out on the other end to say they would pay their players.</p>
<p>The Pirates’ pledge to pay through June, however, didn’t guarantee that the Pirates wouldn’t still have to make cuts to their farm system. On Wednesday, in a conference call with media, general manager Ben Cherington confirmed that cuts would be coming.</p>
<p>Those who are released will still get their $400 a week through June, but Cherington feels that part of his job is to look forward to the 2021 season and beyond. In his words, he and the Pirates wouldn’t be doing their minor league players any favors by keeping them around if they don’t see a future for them in Pittsburgh.</p>
<p>“I do expect we’ll make some releases,” Cherington said. “We’ve wanted to be as thoughtful as we can, especially with a new GM and trying to learn as much as I can about the player group that we have. We’ve had a good amount of dialogue over the last several days about that, It all comes back to the best information we have about looking forward to next year. Our feeling and I think the feeling of other teams has been that if we truly cannot see opportunity next year for a minor league player, we are not necessarily helping them by extending the relationship, if it’s that clear. That’s where we are and I’d expect we’ll have some released probably this week after we have a couple more conversations.”</p>
<p>The discussion around these minor league players spurs a larger one about just how effectively the future of an organization can be developed during this time.</p>
<p>Most believe there will be no minor league season. The best concession that seems possible is that MLB teams will have a taxi squad of near-MLB-level talent at the ready during the season to join the big-league club in the case of an injury or some other unforeseen problem.</p>
<p>Everyone who doesn’t make that taxi squad would seem to be in a sort of baseball purgatory. It’s in every team’s best interest to keep them as prepared as possible, though, and Cherington said he and the rest of the league’s powers that be understand this. They can’t simply let their minor league players sit without baseball for a year and hope they’ll pick up where they left off in 2021. Still, figuring out the details of MLB’s season is paramount right now, and what a development system would look like in 2020 is unknown.</p>
<p>“We definitely remain hopeful that there will be some kind of player development activity in 2020,” Cherington said. “Exactly what that looks like, where it is, remains to be seen. The league wants to prioritize figuring out a solution for the major league season first. I would characterize it as an important topic for the league to figure out, but we need to figure out the major league portion first. There’s been a lot of work done behind the scenes by the teams and the league. We hope we can get to that and include as many of our players as we can. It may not be 100 percent of them. We’ll see.”</p>
<p>At the very least, some system for the minor league players would help inform any cuts that Cherington and the Pirates have to make. For now, though, it seems they will be making some releases in the very near future for the players they don’t anticipate making it to the Pirates down the road.</p>
