<h1>Miner’s Park set for im­prove­ments </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Bethel Park’s council voted unanimously Monday to invest $78,000 in improvements at Miner’s Park.</p>
<p>The upgrades will impact the restroom and concession stand facilities at the park, located in Bethel Park’s Coverdale neighborhood off Main Street. Swede Construction, of Elizabeth, was awarded the contract for the work.</p>
<p>Funds for the improvements are coming from a grant the municipality received from the state Department of Community and Economic Development with the help of state Rep. Natalie Mihalek, R-Upper St. Clair.</p>
<p>In other business, Council President Tim Moury updated members on the Allegheny Land Trust’s “Bethel Green” project.</p>
<p>The Allegheny Land Trust earlier this year purchased a 40.5-acre piece of property at the intersection of Connor Road and Library Road in Bethel Park near the Castle Shannon border. The nonprofit organization has vowed to protect the property, which had been used decades ago as a coal mining dumping site, as a nature preserve.</p>
<p>Mr. Moury said a small parking lot is being constructed off Valley Drive so that people can park and enjoy the nature preserve.</p>
<p>He said there will be about five parking spaces in the gravel parking lot, and if the spaces are full, people should come back another time so as to not have too many people in the preserve at once.</p>
<p>“The gist of the whole thing is to keep it green,” he said.</p>
<p>Additionally, signs are being installed as well as an entrance to the preserve from Valley Drive.</p>
