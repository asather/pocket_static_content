<h1>PA Turnpike buys land in Westmoreland County ahead of planned maintenance-facility move</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The Pennsylvania Turnpike has bought 42 acres of land in Penn Township, Westmoreland County, in anticipation of moving its maintenance facility from one side of the road to the other.</p>
<p>The turnpike commission agreed last week to pay $1.7 million to seven people who own the parcel near Route 130 in the township’s Harrison City neighborhood. The turnpike has a maintenance facility along the westbound side of the toll road but plans to move it to the eastbound side in a few years when it moves ahead with a project to widen the highway, spokeswoman Renee Colborn said.</p>
<p>“We purchased this property with the intent to relocate and expand the Harrison City maintenance building,” Ms. Colborn said in an email. “The current maintenance building site is currently too small and will ultimately be impacted by our six-lane widening in that area, so we have to move the facility.”</p>
<p>The agency expects to advertise for architects to design the new facility later this summer. Construction could begin in two years if funds are available and is expected to about 18 months.</p>
<p>An estimated cost won’t be available until the facility is designed.</p>
<p>The land, which is currently vacant, is along Nike Site Road at about mile marker 63 on the turnpike. It had been advertised for $2.2 million.</p>
<p>The project is part of the turnpike work to widen the highway from four to six lanes across the state. New construction in that program is on hold due to the financial constraints created by low ridership during the COVID-19 pandemic reducing revenue for capital projects.</p>
