<h1>A little advice from those who had been working remotely even before the pandemic hit</h1>

<p>The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic meant many companies had to shift to remote work quickly as it became clear that keeping employees at home wherever possible would be critical to slow the spread of the virus.</p>
<p>For businesses that already had regular remote employees prior to the pandemic, the shift to more locked-down operations was less complicated. Here’s what some of them had to say about the best practices for running your business remotely.</p>
<p>You definitely have to remain in communication,” said Brian McGuire, vice president of human resources at the Strip District-based trucking company Pitt Ohio. The company’s sales team had been working remotely prior to the pandemic, and now more workers there have shifted to working from home.</p>
<p>Pitt Ohio keeps up what Mr. McGuire called an “ongoing communication channel” via regular department phone and video meetings, as well as a weekly companywide letter (via either email or snail mail) detailing updates to the pandemic response.</p>
<p>Mr. McGuire said the remote status of many of Pitt Ohio’s employees has made it especially critical for the company to be transparent about what is known about coming pandemic-related changes.</p>
<p>“Just keep the communication flowing,” he said.</p>
<p>Mainstay Health Services, an organization in Scott that provides support to people with developmental disabilities, has many employees who are classified as essential workers — meaning the company did not institute as widespread a remote work policy. But the company’s administrative staff have had the option to work from home.</p>
<p>It helped that that Mainstay had been increasing its remote work infrastructure prior to the pandemic for services the company offered in partnership with other organizations.</p>
<p>“Fortunately for us, we’ve invested in technology over the last couple of years for our administrative office, but also to try to support the people that Mainstay helps … We already had a lot,” said CEO Kim Sonafelt.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean the pandemic hasn’t had a significant impact on employees’ workdays.</p>
<p>“I can say, though, that the office that was once bustling, a lot of communication and talking each day. There’s now about five to seven, eight people at the main office that support the employees that do go to work each and every day,” Ms. Sonafelt said.</p>
<p>But what do the experts have to say about turning your in-person workplace into a successful remote enterprise?</p>
<p>Tacy Byham, CEO of Bridgeville-based leadership-development company DDI, says administrators should look for two key things in a remote setup: first, that employees are able to manage and execute their key job responsibilities; and second, that managers are encouraged to remain engaged and connected with their employees.</p>
<p>Ms. Byham advises setting goals with flexible paths to achievement in order to accommodate the variety of challenges brought on by working at home.</p>
<p>“What that allows is autonomy for the individual … as long as the focus is on them achieving the key results,” she said.</p>
<p>Ms. Byham also suggests that companies should be aware of the effect that working from home and not regularly getting to socialize with coworkers can have on employees.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“It can feel lonely. It can feel isolated,” she said. “To me personally … it feels very monotonous.”</p>
<p>To combat these feelings, she&nbsp;says managers should be paying attention to how employees are doing and willing to reach out to people who seem to need additional support.</p>
<p>Keeping video on during meetings, if that’s an option, is one way to better simulate an in-person work experience, Ms. Byham said.</p>
<p>“The real way to make a human connection is when you’re able to look eye-to-eye with someone,” she said. “It helps me feel like I’m normal again.”</p>
<p>She also suggests using a virtual whiteboard, like the ones offered by Miro and Microsoft, to create a real-time collaborative experience where everyone can see each others’ contributions. (For further information on remote-work setup and technology, DDI publishes studies and articles at ddiworld.com).</p>
<p>The consistent message from managers was that communication, particularly synchronous remote communication, is key to having a well-functioning remote operation during the pandemic.</p>
<p>“You can’t pass up a voice-to-voice communication by phone or by teleconference,” Mr. McGuire said. “Reach out and keep well-connected with employees.”</p>
