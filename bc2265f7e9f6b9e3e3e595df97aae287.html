<h1>Despite ban by Gov. Tom Wolf, UPMC ramping up elective surgeries</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite a directive from the governor of Pennsylvania, the state's biggest hospital system is preparing to ramp up elective surgical procedures — the goal being to reach pre-shutdown surgical capacity within six weeks.</p>
<p>The Post-Gazette has obtained documentation showing that UPMC is gearing up for the move that makes it the only health care system in the region to do so.</p>
<p>A letter to UPMC surgeons dated April 15 from hospital leadership offers guidance to surgeons on how to justify doing such procedures, recommending the use of terms such as “urgent,” “cancer,” “unstable” and “relief from suffering” in reports.</p>

<p>“We have NOT said no to a surgery that the surgeon and patient feels should proceed,” according to the April 15 letter, which was obtained by the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>UPMC employees told the Post-Gazette in March that they were upset over risks to staff and patient health, and the use of resources that might be needed as the virus spread.</p>
<p>The Pittsburgh-based health system’s push to return to pre-COVID-19 levels of elective surgery comes despite a ban on elective medical procedures issued by the Pennsylvania governor in March, a ban that the state health department said is still in effect.</p>
<p>But a spokesman for the health system, which operates 40 hospitals, said Monday that UPMC believes it can do elective procedures safely and noted that new guidance from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services emphasized flexibility to “allow facilities to provide care for patients needing non-emergent health care.”</p>
<p>Elective surgery bans are in effect in 35 states, according to the Ambulatory Surgery Center Association, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va. They’ve been lifted in three states: Alaska, Oklahoma and Texas.</p>
<p>The shutdown of outpatient and non-emergency surgeries is costing hospitals dearly. Administrators are trying to shore up their institutions’ finances while backing public health measures designed to stop the spread of the highly contagious new coronavirus. Those measures also have the effect of cutting deeply into hospital revenue.</p>
<p>Big hospitals typically derive 46% of revenue from outpatient procedures, according to the Healthsystem Council of Western Pennsylvania, a Warrendale-based trade group. A report Monday by another trade group, the Hospital and Healthsystem Association of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg, concluded that COVID-19’s toll on Pennsylvania hospitals could exceed $10 billion.</p>
<p>If successful, UPMC, which reported $20.6 billion in revenue for 2019, would be among the first health systems in Pennsylvania to restore elective operations.</p>
<p>UPMC was behind other Pittsburgh-area health systems in winding down non-emergency procedures after Gov. Wolf’s March 19 directive, continuing to do them after Allegheny Health Network, Excela Health, Heritage Valley Health System, St. Clair and Washington Health System said they had stopped.</p>
<p>At Allegheny Health Network, the surgical shutdown continues for elective procedures.</p>
<p>“At AHN, we continue to closely monitor the progression of the COVID-19 pandemic in western PA while also communicating regularly with local and state health officials about the safest and most responsible approaches to patient care at this time,” spokesman Dan Laurent said in a statement. “We are preparing appropriately for an organized, phased-in return to normal surgical operations in the coming weeks and will strictly follow CDC and CMS guidelines in order to ensure the safety and well-being of our patients and caregivers when we do.”</p>
<p>To return to pre-shutdown surgical capacity, UPMC is counting on technology that received emergency clearance from the Food and Drug Administration on March 29, which allows COVID-19-contaminated face masks to be sterilized for reuse by doctors and nurses up to 20 times.</p>
<p>Typically, the malleable polyester masks are discarded after wearing once or twice, but nationwide shortages of the protective gear have been reported.</p>
<p>Columbus, Ohio-based Battelle Memorial Institute, a private nonprofit applied science and research center, will be cleaning N95 protective masks for UPMC and other health systems at 60 sites around the country free of charge, thanks to federal funding.</p>
<p>More than 1,300 UPMC employees were briefed on the plans Thursday, where the partnership with Battelle was described as key to the restoration of the non-emergency surgery caseload at UPMC.</p>
<p>The health care giant had been piloting Battelle’s decontamination system, with plans to roll it out to all surgical sites, according to information distributed at the employee meeting Thursday. The Post-Gazette obtained a copy of the handout.</p>
<p>UPMC’s plans come after Gov. Tom Wolf banned elective medical procedures in the state March 19.</p>
<p>On Friday, Gov. Wolf provided a broad outline for reopening the state, but without a timeline or benchmarks that would guide his decision. On Monday, the governor went further, easing restrictions on online car sales and allowing the restart of construction projects statewide May 8. But he stopped well short of ending mitigation efforts.</p>
<p>The Wolf administration does “not feel that today is the day that hospitals should resume these services,” state Department of Health spokesman Nate Wardle said Thursday. “We must take a slow, iterative process as we ease back on our mitigation efforts and not move too quickly.”</p>
<p>He declined to elaborate when contacted Monday. Health officials have warned that ending mitigation efforts too soon could bring a rebound of the disease.</p>
<p>Citing CMS guidance that was issued Sunday, UPMC spokesman Paul Wood said on Monday that the time was right to begin doing elective procedures.</p>
<p>“In the current environment, with proper protection and precautions, we believe that we can soon begin to treat patients who postponed needed treatments and procedures,” he said in a statement.</p>
<p>His comments echoed the new CMS guidance.</p>
<p>“At this time, many areas have a low, or relatively low and stable, incidence of COVID-19 and that it is important to be flexible and allow facilities to provide care for patients needing non-emergent, non-COVID-19 health care,” CMS said. “In addition, as states and localities begin to stabilize, it is important to restart care that is currently being postponed.”</p>
<p>In a conference call with more than 1,300 employees Thursday, UPMC officials said non-emergency operations would be ramped by 10% this week after a case-by-case review, which will include COVID-19 testing of the patient two days before the procedure, according to the person who participated in the briefing but was not at liberty to speak publicly about it. Back surgery for chronic pain and hernia repair are examples of the operations that could start to be scheduled.</p>
<p>In the April 15 letter — issued the day before UPMC employees were briefed on plans to ramp up elective surgery cases — surgeons were offered guidance on how to justify doing non-emergent operations. The letter recommended that doctors use such words as “urgent,” “cancer,” “unstable” and “relief from suffering” to justify doing operations.</p>
<p>The letter was signed by Athan Georgiades, chairman, department of surgery; Michael Kentor, department of anesthesiology; Marc Cordero, vice chairman, department of surgery; and Wendi Ridgway-Price, clinical director of surgical services, all of whom are affiliated with UPMC East and UPMC McKeesport hospitals.</p>
<p>Battelle received authorization from the FDA to use its mask sterilization system under an emergency use authorization, which allows the FDA to quickly greenlight medications and devices that are needed to address an urgent public health need without standard review.</p>
<p>The decontamination system uses vapor phase hydrogen peroxide, an industry standard disinfectant, to fumigate dirty masks for 2.5 hours.</p>
<p>Each employee will identify a mask that they have used. It will be returned to them after cleaning, under the system. Battelle said it’s capable of disinfecting tens of thousands of masks per day at its West Jefferson, Ohio, facility.</p>
<p>It was unclear what, if any, affect reprocessing will have on the pliable mask shape, which is critical to proper fit and filtering out the virus. Battelle spokesman T.R. Massey said that wouldn’t be a problem.</p>
<p>“We have found that they retain their shape,” he said.&nbsp;</p>
