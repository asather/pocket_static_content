<h1>'I want him to be happy': Did you know about Zach Banner's NFL bloodlines?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>At the home of Lincoln Kennedy hangs a framed Steelers jersey, an oddity among plenty of Raiders memorabilia.</p>
<p>But it’s Kennedy’s way of supporting his favorite player, No. 72, Zach Banner. And as of last week, after a lengthy camp battle with Chukwuma Okorafor, that’s <em>No. 1&nbsp;right tackle Zach Banner</em>.</p>
<p>“I said look, that’s the only Steeler thing that’s going to be in my house, so let’s not get carried away,” Kennedy said with a chuckle. “But I am so very much proud of him because the journey has been a little bit tough for him.”</p>
<p>Part of Banner’s journey is his relationship with Kennedy, an 11-year NFL veteran picked ninth overall in 1993 who made two All-Pro teams with Oakland in 2001 and 2002. He’s also Banner’s biological father.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, Banner was raised by his mother, Vanessa Banner, and her husband, Ron Banner, is his dad. They’re <a href="https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2683994-big-man-big-personality-and-big-plans-uscs-zach-banner-is-ready-for-stardom" target="_blank">his biggest fans</a>, along with his brother and sister, but he inherited his size from the man who’s <em>literally</em> his biggest fan. Kennedy was 6-feet-6, 335 pounds when he played. Banner actually has two inches on him, but the tale of the tape is eerily similar: Kennedy wore No. 72 with the Raiders, played right tackle and didn't have the smoothest start to his NFL career.</p>
<p>He and Banner didn't have the smoothest start, either. Banner was in seventh grade <a href="https://247sports.com/college/football/recruiting/Article/Zach-Banner-A-Profile-in-Character-104704730/" target="_blank">when he inadvertently learned the identity</a> of his biological father. That would be difficult for any middle schooler to deal with, and it was no different for Banner as he tried to explore a relationship with Kennedy.</p>
<p>“We’ve been working on it since his high school years, when I first reintroduced myself back in his life,” Kennedy said. “He told me the story how he found out about me, and I told him at the time, ‘I just want to be your friend.’ That’s what I’ve been pursuing. I’m not trying to take credit for who he is or what he’s done or anything like that.”</p>
<p>Kennedy declined to go into detail about why he wasn't part of his son’s life sooner but noted that Banner has had “tremendous support” from his family — the family Banner called immediately when he found out from Mike Tomlin he’d be making his first NFL start Monday night against the New York Giants. They were excited, but also well aware that there’s more work ahead, same as it’s been for their oldest of three since he started football in second grade.</p>
<p>Banner talked to Kennedy, too, who reminded him that it’s one thing to win a starting job in the NFL, but it isn’t easy to stay there. As a rookie, Kennedy started every game at left guard for Atlanta but lost his job the next year. After five starts over the next two seasons, the Falcons traded him to Oakland, where he became a star.</p>
<p>“It’s on to the next step. He always gives his two pieces, but he also understands the awesome opportunity I have being out here,” Banner said. “A lot of the stuff when he was with the Raiders was a little bit different, but as an offensive tackle, it’s the same. So, a little bit of technique here and there, and just conversation.”</p>
<p>The two went to the ESPY awards together two years ago, talk a couple times a week and try to catch up each offseason. This year, though, Banner spent most of the early days of COVID-19 training in Pittsburgh, often with his younger brother Xavier, who served as the angel on his shoulder at times. When Banner wanted to go out for a bite to eat, something that might not be in line with his nutrition plan, Xavier would insist they keep eating healthier home-cooked meals like they’d been doing.</p>
<p>“I have had a lot of regrets since senior year, junior year of college,” Banner said, “in allowing myself to become a bigger gentleman.”</p>
<p>Which is part of the reason he considers this his NFL debut, in a sense, despite his extensive playing time last year. Jumbo tight end, extra blocker, sixth lineman, Mr. Eligible Receiver — whatever you want to call it, he had a very specific role, albeit one that made him a fan favorite. The Steelers ran the ball 85% of the time when he was in and averaged just 2.96 yards per carry, according to the NFL’s internal statistics system.</p>
<p>Everything should be better for the offense now that Ben Roethlisberger’s back, but it does mean pressure on Banner to keep the franchise quarterback upright. As he put it, “if I go out on Monday night and I suck, I’m done.”</p>
<p>Banner has been done before, such as when the Colts cut him four months after using a fourth-round draft pick on him. He showed up to camp overweight and got fined $6,000, but after making the initial 53-man roster, Indianapolis general manager Chris Ballard put him on waivers. The Browns claimed him, used him sparingly in his rookie season, then released him. Banner could’ve been done then, or again when Carolina picked him up and let him go within a three-month span as he fought to get his weight and conditioning right.</p>
<p>In came the Steelers, who signed him during training camp in 2018 and have kept him in Pittsburgh ever since. Banner wishes he could shake Ballard’s hand right now and thank him for giving him the wake-up call he needed early in his career, motivating him to keep pushing.</p>
<p>“It feels good to be a 26-year-old guy looking down upon my 23-year-old self, because that means we’re making progress and we’re getting better,” Banner said.</p>
<p>Over on the West Coast, Kennedy will be on his couch watching Monday night. He’s now a color analyst for the Raiders, but they played Sunday, so he can focus fully on the right side of the Steelers offensive line. Last year, he recorded as many Steelers games as he could to go back and watch the biggest tight end in football.</p>
<p>And how’s this for a footnote? With David DeCastro out due to a knee injury, playing right guard next to Banner will be Stefen Wisniewski, whose uncle Steve played left guard on the same Oakland line as Kennedy for most of the 1990s.</p>
<p>“Dude, what are we going to do? We’ve got family ties, but blood is thicker,” Kennedy told his former teammate. “This is hard.”</p>
<p>Kennedy couldn't bring himself to say “Go Steelers,” but he’ll excitedly say “Go Banner” — and who knows, perhaps their story will get mentioned on a national broadcast. He told his mini-me a long time ago: <em>You look like me, you walk like me, you even talk like me at times, and you play the same position, so people are going to make that connection.</em></p>
<p>“But I really want him to be his own person,” Kennedy said, “and make his own path to glory. ... It always takes effort from both sides when you talk about creating a relationship. The thing is, we’re here now and we’re moving forward. I love him, I think he’s fond of me, and I want to strengthen the relationship we have.”</p>
<p>Which goes back to that framed jersey Kennedy has on his wall, with an inscription that reads “Love you! HulkSmash!” followed by Banner’s signature. He remembers hanging it and texting a photo of it to Banner. The gentle giant who’s always smiling, laughing and joking in the Steelers locker room responded that he was about to cry.</p>
<p>“I truly appreciate what I have with him,” Kennedy said. “He’s my son, and I want him to be happy.”</p>
