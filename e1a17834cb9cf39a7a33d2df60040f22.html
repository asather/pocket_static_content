<h1>Pirates prospects Ke’Bryan Hayes, Will Craig look to use 2019 snubs as motivation</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>One hopes to solidify his position for years to come. The other doesn’t really have a position, at least not yet. But you can lump Pirates prospects Ke’Bryan Hayes and Will Craig together in at least one way: Both were pretty steamed at the end of the 2019 season.</p>
<p>Two of Class AAA Indianapolis’ best players last summer, neither earned a September promotion to Pittsburgh. Hayes was banged up, and his offensive production lacked. Craig endured a late-season slump, where he hit .219 with a .644 OPS and two home runs over his final 28 games.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Pirates management was right or wrong, Hayes and Craig said spending September at home was not something they were able to easily forget. It has also served as a motivating factor in 2020, as both look to compete for MLB time.</p>
<p>“It hurt, just because I thought I had a good year,” Craig said. “I felt like I did well enough, and I played really well defensively. I showed that I had what it takes.”</p>
<p>“Neal [Huntington] was the GM at the time. I called him and asked him what I needed to do to make sure that doesn’t happen again. That was part of it. He told me to make sure I’m in shape and doing all the right things every day. I took that to heart. I’m definitely taking it into the season now, too.”</p>
<p>Said Hayes, “It kind of stunk. I wanted to go up. It didn’t happen. I just had to go home and get my body ready for next year and give it all I have for next year. I went home, got healthy, and I’m ready to go for 2020.”</p>
<p>At this point, it’s tough to see either Hayes or Craig in Pittsburgh to start the season, though crazier things have happened. Craig obviously isn’t going to unseat Josh Bell at first. Although the Pirates tried Craig in right field last season, if Gregory Polanco remains healthy, he’s going to get as many reps as he can handle there.</p>
<p>In Hayes’ case, it’s likely he needs more seasoning at the plate. The 23-year-old has struggled to quickly dig himself out of funks, a common occurrence for players his age. The issues will persist, taking Hayes games to get right instead of pitches or innings. Hayes also probably has some additional work to do when it comes to adjusting to major league pitching.</p>
<p>“I really worked on my hitting this offseason, and I’m just continuing to work on that approach,” Hayes said. “Being able to hit 95-96 mph and adjust to the off-speed, I feel like that’s the only thing holding me back from really flourishing with my hitting. Other than that, I’ve just been getting faster and stronger, those types of things.”</p>
<p>Hayes slashed .265/.336/.415 at Class AAA a season ago, walking at a 9.0% clip while hitting 10 home runs, scoring 64 runs, driving in 53 and stealing 12 bases in 110 games.</p>
<p>There’s zero question about Hayes’ defense, as he took home a third consecutive Rawlings Minor League Baseball Gold Glove last season by virtue of his .989 fielding percentage — which was the top mark for a third baseman at any level. Over the past three years, Hayes has made just 17 errors in 331 games (872 chances), which means that, once Hayes figures out the consistency part of his game and can more quickly snap himself out of bad stretches, it’ll force Colin Moran to play somewhere else.</p>
<p>Moran slashed .277/.331/.419 in 2019 and actually produced a worse isolated power number than Hayes (.142 to .150) while playing some pretty ugly defense. Moran has been worth minus-21 defensive runs saved, per Fangraphs, since the Pirates acquired him. Only 10 players in all of baseball have fared worse, meaning Moran’s slash line or his 13 home runs and 80 RBIs — while encouraging — probably aren’t enough to block Hayes, at least not on a team that’s badly in need of defensive improvements.</p>
<p>As for Craig, this spring will be interesting. Indianapolis manager Brian Esposito tried Craig in the outfield last season, though the experiment never really got off the ground.</p>
<p>Craig actually blamed himself for the fact that it didn’t stick, saying he wasn’t in good enough shape.</p>
<p>“Mentally I was ready, but physically I wasn’t prepared,” Craig said. “After a couple games in a row in the outfield, I started to get a little worn out. This offseason I worked to try and show that I care and want to make a difference, whether it be at first base or in the outfield.”</p>
<p>First base was a positive for Craig in 2019; he posted a .999 fielding percentage that, like Hayes, led all players at his position in the majors and minors.</p>
<p>Craig called his offseason workouts “awful” and said he wanted to go to sleep soon after finishing. They also stripped his body of 20 extra pounds, a loss that’s noticeable when talking to the 2016 first-round pick out of Wake Forest.</p>
<p>“It was kind of a wake-up call for me,” Craig said.</p>
<p>Whether he makes the big club out of spring training or during the season could depend on need, but Craig could certainly help himself by swinging the bat well. He’s shown flashes of power and produced decent offensive numbers last season — 23 home runs, 78 RBIs — though like Hayes, it’s the consistency that has lacked.</p>
<p>There have been some distributing trends involving Craig’s ability to get on base, stuff he’ll want to correct in relatively short order.</p>
<p>Craig’s walk rate has gone from 15.0% in 2016 to 7.9 this past season. Meanwhile, his strikeout percentage has climbed from 13.5% to 26.3%. Both of those numbers are a little too far from center.</p>
<p>Craig will likely need to tug his slugging percentage north of the .435 he produced last season while also offering defensive flexibility. It won’t be easy, but Craig said he’s definitely ready to start changing some peoples’ perception of him, something he wasn’t given the opportunity to do last September.</p>
<p>“I’m really looking forward to spring training and trying to establish myself,” Craig said. “I’m actually looking forward to possibly doing something that people don’t expect.”</p>
