<h1>NEXTransit looking at the future of transit in Allegheny County</h1>

<p>The plan for the Pittsburgh region’s public transportation future will be called NEXTransit, but where that system should serve and how it should get there will be determined over the next year.</p>
<p>Port Authority planners and consultant Michael Baker International met with more than 130 business and community leaders earlier this month to outline their efforts so far in looking at what transit service will be like 25 years from now. The agency will launch a website, NEXTransit.network, this week to generate more public input for the project.</p>
<p>David Huffaker, the authority’s chief development officer, told a board committee recently the planning process is continuing despite the need to change its approach as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Planners had completed five of nine scheduled meetings throughout Allegheny County to talk about the future of transit in early March when it was forced to cancel the rest because of the ban against large gatherings.</p>
<p>While the virus emergency may have changed the procedure, Mr. Huffaker said, it also&nbsp;“highlights the importance of our service” for essential workers and residents who use it to get food or medical care. As a result, the reduced service and lower ridership during the virus emergency may have given the agency&nbsp;“a perfect opportunity” to re-evaluate its service, he said.</p>
<p>Among the long-term planning adjustments the agency is making, Planning Director Amy Silbermann said, is the development of a&nbsp;“meeting in a box” that can be mailed to groups and individuals to outline planning efforts and solicit feedback. The goal is to reach riders with a variety of jobs, incomes and transit needs so the agency has a complete picture of the type of system that would best serve the public.</p>
<p>“We’ll continue to modify and evolve here” as the planning process continues, she said.</p>
<p>Over the next year, Ms. Silbermann said, the plan will concentrate on five areas: public involvement, benefits and barriers to expansion, where riders want to go, how transit can get riders there, and how to pay for the improvements. Once a proposal is developed, planners will take it back to the public to find out,&nbsp;“Did we get it right?” she said.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Mr. Huffaker has said the goal of the project is to develop a broad concept of where service should be provided in the future. The details, such as whether that service it should be bus, light rail or some system not yet developed, won’t be decided until later.</p>
<p>The plan also is expected to make a recommendation on where the agency should locate an additional maintenance garage. Right now, any service expansion is limited because the agency doesn’t have the space to handle more than the 720 buses it has now.</p>
<p>A new garage could cost $140 million or more.</p>
