<h1>Verona cop charged with child porn, giving teen drugs is fired </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>A part-time Verona police officer who was suspended last week due to charges that he inappropriately engaged with a 16-year-old boy after the two met on online, was officially fired during a borough council meeting Tuesday evening.</p>
<p>The Verona Borough Council voted unanimously around 6 p.m. to terminate 34-year-old Anthony Ogline, according to Verona Borough Manager Jerome Kenna. He had been a part of the police force since January 2015.</p>
<p>Police said Mr. Ogline provided the boy alcohol and marijuana and exchanged naked pictures with him after the two met about three weeks ago on a gay dating app called Grindr, according to a criminal complaint.</p>
<p>The teen told Mr. Ogline that he was 17 and “asked if Ogline was OK with that,” the complaint said.&nbsp;“Ogline replied, ‘that's OK consent is 16 years old.’”</p>
<p>Mr. Kenna stressed in a statement Wednesday that Mr. Ogline’s actions do not reflect the department or community. He said officers work “very hard and do an amazing job,” and this behavior should not overshadow their everyday work.</p>
<p>“Verona Borough is an amazing town, growing at an extremely impressive rate from new businesses and new families&nbsp;choosing to call it home,” Mr. Kenna said.&nbsp;“It’s extremely important that we don’t allow the actions of one man [to] define our community or our police department.”</p>
<p>Mr. Ogline was arrested last Wednesday after police found him with the teen on Jan. 17 — a day after the officer picked up the alleged victim at school in the middle of the day. This alarmed school officials and lead them to call police.&nbsp;Mr. Ogline had been suspended without pay since that day, when his department learned of the charges.</p>
<p>He is charged with unlawful contact with a minor, possession of child pornography, criminal use of a communications facility, corruption of minors, tampering with evidence and furnishing alcohol to a minor.</p>
