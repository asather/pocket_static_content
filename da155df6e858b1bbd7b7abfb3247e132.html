<h1>Celebrating the suffrage movement 100 years later</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>As part of an organization now 100 years old that grew from the women’s suffrage movement, Eileen Olmsted readily admits it can be frustrating, even sad, to know part of the electorate — male and female —&nbsp;doesn’t vote.</p>
<p>“The right to vote and the right to have a say in your government is so important. It is so valued in many countries in the world by people in the world who don’t have that right,” said Ms. Olmsted, 81, of Oakland, who’s lived in places abroad including the Middle East.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But make no mistake, she is optimistic — an outlook prevalent Saturday among members of and supporters of the League of Women Voters of Greater Pittsburgh. Upward of 260 of them filled a large fifth-floor room inside the Senator John Heinz History Center to celebrate the League’s centennial Friday and Saturday’s birthday of famous suffragette Susan B. Anthony, born 200 years ago on Feb. 15, 1820.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t still be a League member after 40&nbsp; years if I really didn’t believe in democracy and believe in civil discourse,” said Ms. Olmsted, who noted that she’s held about every position with the League and in previous years served four times as president in California and in Pittsburgh. “I believe the League is more needed than ever.”</p>
<p>A non-partisan organization with chapters around the nation, The League is devoted to political engagement. Its web site says the group “encourages the informed and active participation of citizens in government, works to increase understanding of major public policy issues, and influences public policy through education and advocacy.”</p>
<p>At a time when many say the nation arguably is as polarized as it’s been in modern history,&nbsp; the Greater Pittsburgh chapter has seen growth, to 330-plus members, largest in the state, said&nbsp; Cris Beuger, its program director. In the last year&nbsp;it has registered more than 1,000 new voters in the Pittsburgh area.</p>
<p>“Being non-partisan, we are able to talk with people about the issues,” she said. “We can educate people on candidates. We don’t support them or tell people who to vote for.”</p>
<p>League members in Greater Pittsburgh meet with high school students, talking up the importance of government participation to a generation that gets much of its information from social media. Members are present as new citizens are naturalized, and they are involved in getting out the word to others to be sure before elections that they are registered.</p>
<p>Legislative and protest efforts to secure women’s right to vote in the 1800s culminated with ratification in August 1920 of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Some attendees Saturday came in suffragist apparel, including Ms. Beuger, who wore a straw hat and prairie dress.</p>
<p>Mary Larsen, 97, a League member who lives in&nbsp; Mt. Lebanon, was born less than three years after the amendment’s passage but lived in Canada as a child. A six-decade-plus League member, she voted for the first time in the late 1940s. She was in Los Angeles, and by then, she said, “It was just something you did.”</p>
<p>Saturday’s event&nbsp;featured a performance by actor Christina Rausa of “Susan B. Anthony, is it a Crime to Vote?”</p>
<p>Ms. Anthony, who died in 1906 before the amendment’s passage, gave more than half a century to the suffrage movement and was arrested in her hometown of Rochester, N.Y, after voting illegally in the 1872 presidential election, according to the National Archives web site.</p>
<p>Saturday’s celebration also coincided with the launch of a new App highlighting women’s history within the Center’s galleries, providing a digital interactive experience connecting visitors with significant women’s stories in Pittsburgh history.</p>
<p>According to the League’s web site, around the time of the organization’s inception, National American Woman Suffrage Association president Carrie Chapman Catt asked: “Are the women of the United States big enough to see their opportunity?”</p>
<p>Today, they account for nearly 51% of registered voters in the U.S., according to the League, but they are represented far less among elected offices including in Congress and in state houses, a placard set up for the event noted.</p>
<p>It read: “We still have a long way to go.”</p>
