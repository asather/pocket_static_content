<h1>'The boxing gloves are off' for Keith Dambrot as Duquesne hits the stretch run</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>There was a little extra intensity at Duquesne’s practice on Monday.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dukes coach Keith Dambrot, who has a fiery, in-practice style anyway, had a little more pep in his step, getting after his guys to defend better, get the details down and play harder all-around.</p>
<p>It stems from a sense of urgency with the end of the season looming. Duquesne (20-8 overall, 10-6 A10) has two more regular season games remaining, starting with a road trip to VCU (18-11, 8-8)&nbsp;on Tuesday, and Dambrot feels his team needs to reach an extra gear to have the type of success they are striving for.</p>
<p>“So my deal right now is we should have a lot of fun, but I took the boxing gloves off. It’s time now. We’ve got to&nbsp;<em>go,</em>”&nbsp;Dambrot said Monday.&nbsp;“Because we’re capable of winning and playing better, so I don’t really care what they think right now. I’ve been in postseasons. They haven’t. I’ve been to VCU. They haven’t. So if they’re mad at me, they’re mad at me, but we’re better than we’ve played. So it’s time now. We’ve got two, three, four weeks left in the season, it’s time we achieve what we should achieve, and that’s how I feel about it.</p>
<p>“I got them to this point being nice and friendly, and now I’m going to be unfriendly. Now, I love them, but I want to get what I want to get now, and I want them to get what they want to get. So I know how to do it. I don’t care. I don’t care if it’s dysfunctional. I don’t care if it’s confrontational. I’m going to do what I’ve got to do to make sure they’re ready to play.”</p>
<p>Of course, the response from Dambrot’s players is what will really matter.</p>
<p>Junior forward Michael Hughes has known Dambrot as long as any of his current players. He transferred to Duquesne when Dambrot arrived after originally playing for him at Akron.</p>
<p>So this is nothing new for Hughes, and he personally enjoys the intensity.</p>
<p>“When he’s talking about ratcheting up, I ratchet up,” Hughes said Monday.&nbsp;“When he ratchets up, he brings that energy, he brings that passion out of people. It makes you want to fight harder. So whenever me and him go at it, it’s just our passion colliding, and I think that’s just the greatest thing about it with my relationship with Coach Dambrot. It’s just that whenever he ratchets up, I know I’m going to be right behind him. And even whenever he’s getting on my ass and we have our feuds, it’s because of our [expletive] passion for the game.”</p>
<p>Dambrot’s coaching style isn’t completely rigid, though. Hughes thinks Dambrot does it to try to inspire his players’ own competitive drive and that Dambrot doesn’t mind it when players come back at him.</p>
<p>In Hughes’ mind, it’s a constructive two-way street that leads to players reaching higher levels of success.</p>
<p>“It’s more, as your relationship builds, he wants that,” Hughes said.&nbsp;“Coach Dambrot’s weird. He likes you to say,&nbsp;‘F you,’ once in a while. It’s just different. He’d rather a guy come at him and debate with him about something, rather than not showing emotion at all and just give in to him getting on your butt. So him getting on your butt, he wants a response. He wants to see it on the court, and he also wants to hear it from you.”</p>
<p>Hughes says his relationship with Dambrot off the court is good. They’re close, and outside of practice, they’ll have conversations and joke with each other.</p>
<p>But on the court, like on Monday, their competitiveness results in intensity. The end goal is the same, though. The Dukes are on a two-game winning streak after beating Saint Bonaventure and George Mason last week.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Both Dambrot and Hughes, and likely the rest of the players, know there is another level to reach, though.&nbsp;</p>
<p>At the very least, Dambrot feels the best way to reach that is through sheer will, and that means eliminating the niceties and getting down to business.</p>
