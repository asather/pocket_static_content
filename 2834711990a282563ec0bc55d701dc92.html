<h1>Malls, some retailers won't reopen just yet, even as restrictions ease on businesses</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Much of southwestern Pennsylvania will be able to ease coronavirus-related restrictions on <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/05/08/pennsylvania-governor-Wolf-move-southwest-region-yellow-phase-reopening-pandemic-covid-19/stories/202005080095" target="_blank">business and residents on May 15</a>, but that doesn’t mean that retailers will suddenly swing their doors open wide.</p>
<p>Enclosed malls and many small businesses say Gov. Tom Wolf’s decision to move the region into the “yellow phase” of his tiered reopening plan won’t immediately change their operations.</p>
<p>The Mall at Robinson will not be reopening, though some stores and restaurants with exterior entrances will offer curbside pick-up, according to Shelley Matheys-Yugar, marketing director.</p>
<p>“Malls themselves are not permitted to reopen,” Ms. Matheys-Yugar said.</p>
<p>Wigle Whiskey, which has locations in the Strip District, North Side, Downtown and Ross Park Mall, began offering drive-up service last week at its North Side location and plans to expand its food offerings. But not much will change this Friday.</p>
<p>“The governor’s latest order doesn’t change anything for us,” said Meredith Meyer Grelli, co-owner of the distillery. “We’re not able to open bars and restaurants and we expect mall sites to be the last to allowed to open.”</p>
<p>On May 15, Allegheny, Armstrong, Bedford, Blair, Butler, Cambria, Fayette, Fulton, Greene, Indiana, Somerset, Washington, and Westmoreland counties will be able to move into the “yellow phase” of Mr. Wolf’s reopening plan, a step that took effect last week in much of northwest and northcentral Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Last week, some shopping centers in those areas did reopen. <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/business/money/2020/05/08/grove-city-outlets-mercer-county-simon-pennsylvania-reopen-yellow-covid-19-mall/stories/202005080102" target="_blank">Grove City Premium Outlets</a>, an open-air shopping destination, resurfaced.</p>
<p>Grove City outlets is owned by Simon Property Group, which also owns Ross Park Mall and South Hills Village.</p>
<p>Adriene Rister, who owns Spark Books, a children’s bookstore in Aspinwall, is considering her options. With a 500-square-foot space, it’s difficult for customers to maintain social distancing.</p>
<p>“I might do appointment-only,” she said. Getting masks, sanitation supplies and Plexiglas shields has been a challenge, since those items have been in high-demand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Spark Books has been relying on online orders and plans to offer subscription boxes starting in June.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“I’m very fortunate that our customers have been very supportive. There’s so much love around the community, but we have taken a big hit.”</p>
