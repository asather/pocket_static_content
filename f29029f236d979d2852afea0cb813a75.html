<h1>Fetterman talks sand, legal pot at Erie rally</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Lt. Gov. John Fetterman at a Saturday political rally in Erie said he will advocate for additional state funding to assist Presque Isle State Park sand nourishment projects this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Fetterman also reiterated his push to legalize recreational adult-use marijuana in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Fetterman, the former mayor of Braddock, visited the Erie County Democratic headquarters in downtown Erie early Saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>Party supporters, Democratic office-holders and candidates attended the Pennsylvania Democratic Party’s “Back To Blue” rally tour. Mr. Fetterman spent about an hour at the Erie rally following earlier Saturday appearances at party rallies in Mercer and Crawford counties.</p>
<p>Fetterman said finding additional state monies to help alleviate erosion damage at Presque Isle State Park “is something I certainly would advocate and champion.”</p>
<p>Presque Isle State Park is experiencing substantial erosion due to high water levels, a lack of winter ice cover and numerous storms.</p>
<p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers announced it will use a $670,000 surplus from 2019 to increase the total 2020 sand replenishment funding to $3,170,000 for the park this year. That is $170,000 more than 2019 funding.</p>
<p>The Army Corps of Engineers allocated $1.25 million for peninsula sand replenishment in its recently released 2020 project work plan. The state is expected to match the $1.25 million in federal funding.</p>
<p>Presque Isle State Park received $3 million in funding —&nbsp;$1.5 million from the Army Corps of Engineers and a $1.5 million state match —&nbsp;in 2019.</p>
<p>“I speak to the governor often, and my family and I vacation at Presque Isle all the time,” Mr. Fetterman said. “Presque Isle is a jewel and it deserves the resources it needs to to maintain its status.”</p>
<p>The park, which attracts about 4.2 million visitors annually, has experienced some of its worst erosion in years this winter.</p>
<p>“You can have my word that I will absolutely bring it up personally with the governor,” Mr. Fetterman said. “I can’t make any promises, but I would hope I would be optimistic because everyone knows how critical Presque Isle is to tourism and the economy here, and also how critical Erie is to the trajectory of Pennsylvania as a whole.”</p>
<p>Mr. Fetterman said efforts to pass legislation to legalize recreational adult-use marijuana remain at a standstill with lawmakers in the state General Assembly.</p>
<p>“The Republicans control both halves of the legislature, but privately, a lot more Republicans support it as a whole,” he said. “You need revenue to help Presque Isle State Park or schools or whatever. You’re saying no to billions of dollars over the next 15 or 20 years by not legalizing marijuana.”</p>
<p>Gov. Tom Wolf and Mr. Fetterman in late September at a Harrisburg news conference called for the legalization of recreational adult-use marijuana in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>“Erie, geographically, is very close to New York. When that happens in New York, we’re going to be awash in legal marijuana here in northwest Pennsylvania,” Mr. Fetterman said. “Not ours, but why not be a first mover in the region and why not reap all of the advantages. That’s my pitch.”</p>
<p>In the past year, Mr. Fetterman attended at least one town-hall meeting in all 67 Pennsylvania counties to gauge public interest in legalizing marijuana.</p>
<p>He said the majority of the town-hall attendees, and those who weighed in with comments through an online form on the governor’s website, support marijuana legalization.</p>
<p>“I went to all 67 counties and that’s what voters have told me,” Mr. Fetterman said. “Polling has told us this, as well as the people that I meet on the ground. There’s no reefer madness. All that is going away. I don’t smoke it, and a lot of people don’t smoke it, but it belongs in a different basket of goods like tobacco and alcohol, and a majority of Pennsylvanians, including Republicans, feel that way as well.”</p>
<p>Republican leaders in both the state Senate and the state House of Representatives have expressed opposition to legalizing recreational marijuana.</p>
<p>“I think once it goes legal in New York or New Jersey, and we’re awash in legal marijuana, then they’re going to be like ‘It should be ours, it should be on our farms, it should be our tax revenue,’ ” Mr. Fetterman said.</p>
