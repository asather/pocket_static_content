<h1>Churches form virtual choir for Easter anthem</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Worship leaders from more than two dozen Pittsburgh-area churches combined to form <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/btrqhadnp3bb4ai/The%20Blessing%20Final%20v1.mp4?dl=0" target="_blank">a virtual choir to sing a videorecorded anthem</a> that theirs and other churches can play for their online Easter services, an effort organized to spread a message of hope in the time of the coronavirus.</p>
<p>“It’s important for our churches to come together and say there’s hope, God is for you and there’s a way to have a hope and optimism even when the world seems very shaken,” said Jason Howard, lead pastor at Amplify Church and one of the organizers of the project, called the Pittsburgh Blessing.</p>

<p>The song, called the&nbsp;“The Blessing,” was newly composed and released earlier this year by the worship ministry of Elevation Church in Charlotte, N.C. It draws from biblical lyrics pronouncing blessings on the recipients and their descendants, beginning with words that are common in church benedictions: “The Lord bless you and keep you and make his face shine upon you and be gracious to you.”</p>
<p>The lyrics and a soundtrack were distributed to the Pittsburgh-area singers, many of whom recorded on their cell phones in their homes, with a few recording on more sophisticated studio equipment. or their churches. They each sent their tracks back for editing into the final take.</p>
<p>The video begins with single images of different singers, and as the quiet opening swells in a crescendo, they appear on ever-multiplying squares on the screen, videoconference-style.</p>
<p>Alan Hannah, assistant lead pastor at Allegheny Center Alliance Church, said the project went from idea to completion in two weeks. “I had seen some videos that had gone viral online of these virtual choirs,” he said. “The idea came to me, man, what if we could get churches together and create a virtual choir?”</p>
<p>He contacted Mr. Howard with the idea, and they invited churches to participate. “I’m not embarrassed to tell you I cried when I first saw it,” Mr. Hannah said.</p>
<p>Participating congregations included an array of mainly evangelical churches from various denominations, independent movements and racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>“There’s many traditions and many worship styles,” Mr. Howard said. “This allows us to have an opportunity to have a unified moment on Easter Sunday.</p>
