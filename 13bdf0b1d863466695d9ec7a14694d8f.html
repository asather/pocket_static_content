<h1>Casey says he will vote to convict Trump in impeachment trial</h1>

<p>WASHINGTON — Sen. Bob Casey, D-Pa., took the Senate floor on Tuesday to announce he will vote to convict President Donald Trump on two articles of impeachment, saying House Democrats presented “substantial, persuasive evidence that President Trump abused his power and obstructed Congress.”</p>
<p>The Republican-controlled Senate is all but certain to acquit Mr. Trump of the charges in a vote scheduled for Wednesday at 4 p.m. This week, however, senators have been — finally — allowed to speak about their final verdict after 11 days of listening silently to House Democrats argue with White House defense lawyers.</p>
<p>“We’re here because the president abused his power, the awesome power of his office to demand that an ally investigate a political opponent, proving his contempt for the Constitution and his duties as a public official,” Mr. Casey said, speaking for about 13 minutes in the late afternoon.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The House managers provided substantial evidence of wrongdoing,” he said.</p>
<p>Mr. Casey added that Republicans, by voting last week to block efforts to call witnesses and subpoena documents, overruled&nbsp;“the will of the American people.”</p>
<p>“America deserved a fair trial and it got a cover-up,” Mr. Casey said.</p>
<p>All 53 Republicans are expected to vote to acquit the president in Wednesday’s vote, and many have declared their decision in the Senate on Tuesday. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., will vote to acquit, he wrote in an op-ed published by the Philadelphia Inquirer on Tuesday.</p>
<p>The 45 Democrats and two Independents are expected to vote to convict, although some may break with their party.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On Monday, Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., suggested senators should vote to censure Mr. Trump, a symbolic repudiation of the president’s actions.&nbsp;</p>
