<h1>Allegheny County reports 3 new deaths from COVID-19; 48 deaths reported in Pa.</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Pennsylvania is reporting 48 new deaths attributed to COVID-19, and three of them — all in Allegheny County — occurred in Western Pennsylvania, the state Department of Health said.</p>
<p>With the new deaths, Allegheny’s total is 172, the highest in the region. Of that total, 160 are confirmed and 12 are probable.</p>
<p>The county also reported seven new cases of the respiratory disease. Since the county reported its first case on March 14, it has had 2,034 cases — 1,904 confirmed and 130 probable.</p>
<p>The state’s death toll has reached&nbsp; 6,062.&nbsp;With 410 new positive cases, the state has gone 30 consecutive days of reporting less than 1,000 cases. As of Wednesday, its total number of cases is 76,846.</p>
<p>As summer approaches and the threat for severe weather grows, the Wolf Administration is advising residents to begin reviewing their emergency plans and figure out how COVID-19 and social distancing guidelines will affect those plans.</p>
<p>Jeff Thomas, PEMA’s executive director, said Tuesday the state doesn’t usually receive direct hits from hurricanes but added that the storm systems often bring heavy rains, flooding and power outages into the state.</p>
<p>"The reality of COVID-19 will change the way people plan for emergencies, and the time to think about those changes is now, not in the middle of an emergency," he said.</p>
<p>Emergency kits should include items now considered necessities in the age of COVID-19: cloth masks, hand sanitizer and other medication.</p>
