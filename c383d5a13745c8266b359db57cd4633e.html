<h1>Fauci, 2 other members of coronavirus task force in quarantine</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>WASHINGTON&nbsp; — Three members of the White House coronavirus task force, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, placed themselves in quarantine after contact with someone who tested positive for COVID-19, another stark reminder that not even one of the nation’s most secure buildings is immune from the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, will be “teleworking for the next two weeks” after it was determined he had a “low-risk exposure” to a person at the White House, the CDC said in a statement Saturday evening. The statement said he felt fine and has no symptoms.</p>
<p>Just a few hours earlier, the Food and Drug Administration confirmed that FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn had come in contact with someone who tested positive and was in self-quarantine for the next two weeks. He tested negative for the virus.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said he will begin a "modified quarantine" after making "low-risk" contact with the White House staffer who tested positive for the novel coronavirus.</p>
<p>The "low-risk" assessment means he was not in close proximity to the person who tested positive during the time when that person was known to be positive for the virus.</p>
<p>To err on the side of caution, Dr. Fauci said he is doing what he calls a "modified quarantine," meaning he will stay at home and telework, wearing a mask continually, for 14 days. He said he might also go to his office at the National Institutes of Health when he is the only one there. He also will be tested every day, he said, noting he was tested yesterday and was negative.</p>
<p>All three men were scheduled to testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday. Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., the chairman of the panel, said the White House will allow the three men to testify by videoconference, a one-time exception to the administration’s policies on hearing testimony.</p>
<p>Dr. Fauci said if he is called to the White House or Capitol Hill, he will go while taking every precaution, he said.</p>
<p>Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary tested positive for the coronavirus on Friday, making her the second person who works at the White House complex known to test positive for the virus this week. White House officials had confirmed Thursday that a member of the military serving as one of President Donald Trump’s valets had tested positive for COVID-19 on Wednesday.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump, who publicly identified the affected Pence aide as spokeswoman Katie Miller, said he was “not worried” about the virus spreading in the White House. Nonetheless, officials said they were stepping up safety protocols for the complex.</p>
<p>Ms. Miller had been in recent contact with Mr. Pence but not with the president and had tested negative a day earlier. She is married to Stephen Miller, a top Trump adviser. The White House had no immediate comment on whether Stephen Miller had been tested or if he was still working in the White House.</p>
<p>The CDC and FDA would not disclose the identity of the person who had tested positive and with whom the agency leaders had come in contact.</p>
