<p>The bill for the removal of a Port Authority bus from a large Downtown sinkhole in October is in, and it’s going to cost $88,150.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh City Council introduced legislation Tuesday to pay Allegheny Crane Rental for its emergency services that involved two cranes and a 12-member crew after the&nbsp;rear end of the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/local/city/2019/10/29/Authorities-working-to-assess-damage-caused-by-sinkhole/stories/201910290101" target="_blank">bus fell into a 20-foot-deep sinkhole</a> the morning of Oct. 28 as it stopped for a red light on 10th Street at Penn Avenue.</p>
<p>The additional costs for street repairs remain unknown at this point, said Councilman Daniel Lavelle, who chairs the Finance and Law Committee.</p>
<p>“This [cost] is just to remove the bus. So we’re probably talking hundreds of thousands,” Mr. Lavelle said, adding that he is unsure of how the total cost will be split.</p>
<p>Utility companies have been fixing damaged underground infrastructure since the sinkhole incident occurred.</p>
<p>Pittsburgh Allegheny County Thermal is finishing repairs to tunnels&nbsp;“deep below the hole,” said Timothy McNulty, mayoral spokesman.&nbsp;“When that's done we will determine whether we can repave and reopen the street.”</p>
<p>The company is expected to finish repairs to the Downtown steam heat system by early February.</p>
<p>The cause of the sinkhole has not yet been determined, as the focus has been&nbsp;“completely on fixing the utility issues and getting the street reopened,” Mr. McNulty said.</p>
