<p><strong><em>This story will be updated.</em></strong></p>
<p>The new owner of SouthSide Works will shut down its movie theater as&nbsp;part of a $37 million makeover of the riverfront complex.</p>
<p>New York-based Somera Road plans to convert the cinema into the Box&nbsp;Office, a 77,000-square-foot innovative and creative office space&nbsp;designed to attract tech tenants.</p>
<p>The conversion is part of $37 million in improvements that will&nbsp;include changes to the SouthSide Works town square and streets,&nbsp;expanded green space, more public art, and children’s and dog play&nbsp;areas.</p>
<p>Somera also plans to add about 230 residential units along the&nbsp;Monongahela riverfront and about 200,000 square feet of waterfront&nbsp;office space.</p>
<p>It is not known when the theater will close. More details are expected&nbsp;to be available at a press conference Monday.</p>
<p>The real estate, investment and development company began the majority&nbsp;owner of SouthSide Works, the former LTV Steel mill on the South Side,&nbsp;this month, taking over from the Soffer Organization.</p>
