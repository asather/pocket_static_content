<h1>Remembering Neil Peart's first show with Rush — Pittsburgh 1974</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>The sound quality is awful and dominated by Geddy Lee’s high-pitched wail, but Neil Peart’s debut with Rush exists on the internet.</p>
<p>It was at the Civic Arena in Pittsburgh on Aug. 14, 1974, the first show of the Toronto trio’s first U.S. tour.</p>
<p>Rush, which had done two weeks of rehearsal with their new drummer, was a late and unadvertised addition to a bill with two bands from Britain, Uriah Heep and Manfred Mann’s Earth Band, on a bill presented by DiCesare-Engler.</p>

<p>Although the Canadians were new to the road, they had some experience under their belts. Taking their cues from hard rock icons Led Zeppelin and Cream, frontman and bassis Lee and guitarist Alex Lifeson had been playing together since 1968 and became “Rush” in 1971 with drummer John Rutsey.</p>
<p>They released their self-titled debut album, most notable for the Black Sabbath-sounding banger “Working Man,” in March 1974, but during that summer, it was determined that Rutsey, unable to tour extensively due to diabetes, would be replaced.</p>
<p>The auditions turned up Hamilton, Ontario, native Peart, who would go on to become their backbone, chief lyricist and, indisputably, one of the greatest rock drummers of all time. Peart, who died Friday at 67 of brain cancer, joined Rush for the tour that began at the Civic Arena and then circled back to the Stanley Theater just a week later.</p>
<p>In a 1996 interview with Rolling Stone, Lee was asked about the first Rush gig.</p>
<p>“With Neil Peart?” he responded. “1974. Aug. 16. Pittsburgh Civic Arena. We were the opening act for Uriah Heep. And Manfred Mann’s Earth Band was the special guest. We were given 24 minutes, exactly, to play. It was over very quickly.”</p>
<p>He was off by just a few days, and during a November 1996 show at the Arena, he told the crowd, “It was right here, on Aug. 16, 1974, that we played our first American date. The only difference between then and now is that tonight we're going to play a lot longer.”</p>
<p>As for the length of the gig, the recording on YouTube is four songs and just over 17 minutes long. Writing in the Pittsburgh Press the following day, Pete Bishop declared that Uriah Heep “eschewed anything even slightly namby-pamby in favor of the kind of music Pittsburgh likes&nbsp;— heavy, slam-bang rock,” adding that “somebody must have wised up the opening acts because that’s all Rush, a promising Canadian trio, offered …”</p>
<p>In his book “Roadshow,” Peart wrote, “Among the sleek buildings that indicated Pittsburgh's successful transition from Iron City to a technological center, I caught a glimpse of the low dome of the Civic Arena. That was where Alex, Geddy and I had played our first show together, on August 14th, 1974, opening for Manfred Mann's Earth Band and Uriah Heep in front of about 11,000 people. Among the many memories of that life-changing experience, I would never forget standing on the floor beside stage left while Uriah Heep played 'Stealin'.' The big dark building, colored lights on the heroic figures up on the stage, the roaring audience, the sheet electricity in that place. Halfway through their show, the retractable dome of the Civic Arena had peeled back, open to the summer night.”</p>
<p>Lee told the Toronto Star that they showed up with their equipment in Coca-Cola boxes because they didn’t have cases: “We looked green when we arrived at our first American gig. We just looked like hicks right out of the bar, which is what we were.”</p>
<p>Thinking it would calm his nerves, Lee took his first ever shot of Southern Comfort, saying, “By the time I had regained my senses, our 26 minutes were up. We were basically playing while people were still coming in and finding their seats. But it didn't matter. We were playing the big room, as they used to say. We felt like a door was opening for us. It really was exciting.”</p>
<p>After that, Rush would become entangled here with Kiss. After releasing their first album with Peart, “Fly By Night,” in February 1975, Rush opened for Kiss at the Stanley that April and the Arena in December.</p>
<p>With the subsequent successes of “2112,” “A Farewell to Kings” and “Hemispheres,” Rush slowly but surely worked their way up to top billing, headlining the Arena for the first time in January 1979. After that, they would never go back to being an opener.</p>
<p>Lee once said that Rush may have played Pittsburgh more than any other city, outside of their hometown. Sadly, there was no date here for the band’s 40th Anniversary farewell tour in 2015, so the last time we saw Rush and its powerhouse drummer was 2012 on the “Clockwork Angels” tour.</p>
<p>We can say with absolute certainty that Rush inspired more air-drumming among fans than any other band.</p>
