<h1>Point State Park turns on famous fountain for first time in 2020</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Many folks taking a walk, run or drive Downtown on Wednesday may have noticed that one of Pittsburgh’s most iconic tourist attractions was back up and running for the first time in 2020.</p>
<p>Point State Park’s 150-foot fountain had yet to be turned on this year for reasons that remain unclear. But as of Wednesday, the fountain came roaring back to life and will remain on throughout the summer, according to Point State Park manager Jacob Weiland.</p>
<p>It’s also unclear why the fountain was turned on today specifically, though its return has coincided with most of the city and Allegheny County reopening after being shut down due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>"The fountain is a symbol of returning to normalcy," Mr. Weiland told the Post-Gazette.</p>
<p>Mr. Weiland said that Point State Park management is still going through “testing and preventative maintenance” to make sure there aren’t any lingering concerns about the fountain remaining on throughout summer 2020. He also encouraged fountain visitors to continue respecting Pennsylvania Department of Health guidelines and continue to practice social distancing.</p>
<p>Oh, and Mr. Weiland also wanted to remind everyone that the fountain is not a pool and entering its water is off limits.</p>
<p>That fountain has been a fixture of Point State Park since 1974. It received an <a href="https://riverlifepgh.org/riverfront-guide/point-state-park-fountain/" target="_blank">$11.6 million renovation</a> in 2013 courtesy of Riverlife to repair its water pumps, revamp the surrounding plaza area and provide other upgrades.</p>
<p>Other recreational spaces and activities have been slowly coming back to Pittsburgh and Allegheny County as the region acclimates to life under the “green” phase of reopening.
