<h1>Dormont’s council votes to keep pool closed</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Despite an offer of $25,000 from the Friends of Dormont Pool organization to help to open the swimming facility this summer, the Dormont Borough Council on Monday night stood by its decision to keep the pool closed for the 2020 season.</p>
<p>The council voted unanimously last month to keep the pool closed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>Last week, the Friends of Dormont Pool announced it would be willing to donate $25,000 to help cover the costs of opening of the pool for the summer.</p>

<p>“As Allegheny County has moved to the green stage, Friends of Dormont Pool has voted to donate $25,000 to the borough of Dormont for the opening of Dormont Pool in the summer of 2020,” John Maggio, president of the Friends group, said at the meeting.</p>
<p>“We request that borough council commits to and develops a rapid recovery plan to open this summer in 2020. If you could open safely, would you? We all want to give our community some type of summer and let them at least have some fun and memories at the pool.”</p>
<p>Council President Jeff Fabus said that if the donation was contingent upon opening the pool this summer, “we cannot accept the money on those conditions.”</p>
<p>Council member Joanna Bouldin thanked the group for its offer but said rather than accepting the donation, it would be better to start regularly meeting with the Friends.</p>
<p>Jen Mazzocco, vice president of council, praised the group for its work with the pool and for “working so hard this year to advocate” for the pool.</p>
<p>“Their generous offer is something that is really kind, and I think if this were a normal year that we would obviously work with them to use that money for a purpose that would benefit the community,” Ms. Mazzocco said.</p>
<p>She added that “even if the borough wanted to open the pool,” all CDC guidelines would have to be followed.</p>
<p>“We may have a difficulty implementing those guidelines because there are so many, and many, in some cases, are so vague,” Ms. Mazzocco said.</p>
<p>She added Allegheny County has just recently gone to yellow, and “I don’t think we’ve had a chance to see whether the [number of] cases will kind of remain stagnant for now, or if there will be a resurgence. Looking at it this year, it’s just too much of a risk.”</p>
<p>One of the largest public pools in the county, the Dormont Pool, which officially opened July 4, 1929, is located on Dormont Avenue, but can easily be seen from Route 19, enabling passing drivers to view residents enjoying its facilities during the summer months.</p>
<p>Council member Daniele Ventresca said that the borough was taking into consideration the community and its employees.</p>
<p>“I can’t imagine asking a lifeguard to sit in the heat for a six- or eight-hour shift with a mask on,” Ms. Ventresca said, adding she is an avid pool-goer in the summer.</p>
<p>“It’s killing me not to reopen,” she said.</p>
<p>Resident Renee Horner supported council’s decision to keep the pool closed.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe Dormont owes us a pool,” she said, adding she grew up in a community without a pool. “Summer was not ruined because we didn’t have a community pool.” She said there are “too many risks” associated with opening the pool.</p>
<p>“Get your own pools,” Ms. Horner said. “The rules have been set. It’s not going to open. What’s the problem?”</p>
<p>Resident Jessie Schluter said it was “just disappointing” that the pool wouldn’t be open and said council made its decision on the matter too early.</p>
<p>Council member John Moore added that if the pool were to have opened there would be a limit in attendance and those allowed to attend would have been limited to pass holders.</p>
<p>He said the borough would stand to lose about 80% of its pool revenue if it were to open and had to limit the sale of seasonal pool passes and daily sales. During a normal year, the borough sells $31,000 in passes and has $129,000 in cash sales. The pool has a yearly deficit of around $77,000. He said the borough would stand to lose nearly $200,000 if the pool were to open.</p>
