<h1>Pitt mailbag: How many more wins do Panthers need to get in the NCAA tournament?</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><em>Each week through the end of the 2019-20 season, Craig Meyer, the Post-Gazette’s Pitt basketball writer, will answer reader questions about the Panthers. And some other stuff, too.</em></p>
<p><em>If you want to submit a question, you can email Craig at cmeyer@post-gazette.com or hit him up on Twitter @CraigMeyerPG.</em></p>
<p><strong>Evan</strong>: Do you you think 10 ACC wins and 2 wins in the ACC tournament gets Pitt into the tournament? Usually I think it’d be a yes but considering their rankings right now, not sure if it’d boost them up enough</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I don’t think it does. Ten ACC wins would have Pitt at 19-12 overall and 10-10 in what is possibly the worst of the six major conferences in the sport this season. In these final seven regular-season games, I would guess they would need to go at least 5-2 and then win a couple of games in the ACC tournament to feel decent about their chances. But the bubble is fluid and things can change quickly. It also depends some on who Pitt beats and who it loses to in that stretch.</p>
<p>Right now, the Panthers are 78th in the NET, which puts them pretty far out of reach of an at-large berth. One problem for them: a lack of high-quality wins. The Florida State win to open the season was huge, and the victory against Rutgers in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge has been much more impressive than many would have figured at the time, but aside from that, what’s their best win? Kansas State, which is 9-14 as I type this? The worst North Carolina team many of us have seen? The problem, too, is that outside of a Feb. 18 game at Florida State and a Feb. 29 game at N.C. State, there aren’t any Quad One win opportunities left for Pitt.</p>
<p><strong>Victor</strong>: Is Champagnie Pitt’s best player at this point? I can’t imagine what the offense or rebounding would look like without him.</p>
<p><strong>NJ</strong>: Is champagne Pitts best pro prospect at this point?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I’ll take these together. I think it can be a little tough to make distinctions about who the best player is on a team with three guys averaging between 12 and 12.9 points per game, but if I had to pick, I would say Champagnie. What he has been able to contribute from a rebounding and offensive standpoint has been invaluable, though I do think he benefits some from the attention opposing teams have to pay to Xavier Johnson and Trey McGowens.</p>
<p>As for his pro prospects, I’ve talked to scouts this year who are impressed with Champagnie. He is an exceptional athlete, and his basketball instincts are remarkable, especially for a player his age. But Johnson began this season as a projected second-round NBA draft pick, and I even had people tell me last season that they could see McGowens as a future first-rounder if he improves some areas of his game. There really isn’t an obvious pro prospect on this team that’s head and shoulders above the rest, but Champagnie would definitely have to be in consideration for that distinction.</p>
<p><strong>Robert</strong>: How will the addition of Hugley help the backcourt?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I think it’ll help the frontcourt quite a bit. John Hugley’s a really talented player — he’s a four-star, top-100 recruit — who is putting up some absurd numbers his senior year of high school. Pitt can obviously use whatever help it can get down low, and the combination of size and skill he has will provide a nice boost. I will provide a word of caution, though: it often takes freshman bigs a little while to come along. It’s hard for them to acclimate to playing against guys their size (or bigger) on a nightly basis, so while expectations for Hugley should be high, I wouldn’t make them too unrealistic.</p>
<p><strong>Dan</strong>: I imagine at this point there is no chance of Chukwuka playing this season?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: At this point, I’d have to think not. There are only seven regular season games left and it would seem pretty illogical to burn a year of eligibility just for that. Pitt could use help down low, but with Terrell Brown, Eric Hamilton and Abdoul Karim Coulibaly already in the fold, I don’t know how drastically different or better Kene Chukwuka would make the frontcourt.</p>
<p><strong>Drew</strong>: Is Capel making a run for ACC COY?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: It looks possible at this point, though it’ll obviously depend on how these final seven games go. It’s important to remember they were picked to finish 10th in the preseason, so as far as measuring exceeded expectations, that will be the basis for it, though I could certainly see some voters basing it off what he has done over two years. Right now, I’d say it will be Leonard Hamilton or Chris Mack (I’d probably vote for the former).</p>
<p><strong>Sam</strong>: Given her appearances on the scoreboard almost every home game, when are you going to give Xavier Johnson’s sister the media coverage she deserves? If Narduzzi’s calves can get an article, I feel like she needs one, too.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: Johnson’s little sister, Mya, deserves endless praise for doing on the dance cam what the intent of the dance cam is: dancing! So many people appear on there and just jump up and down. So shouts to her.</p>
<p><strong>J.</strong>: If you could keep one Stallings player/potential recruit and add to this roster (who would still be eligible), who’s your pick?</p>
<p><strong>Craig:</strong> I think Marcus Carr is probably the best player to have left Pitt from the Stallings era, at least among those still with eligibility, but for this team’s specific needs, I’d say Parker Stewart. He’s shooting 36% from 3 on a UT Martin team on which he is a major focus for opposing defenses, which tells me he’d probably be at least a few percentage points higher on a Pitt team on which he’d be more of a complementary piece. This team sorely needs more outside shooting.</p>
<p><strong>Todd</strong>: I know you don't speculate (rightfully so) on specific players, but with almost everyone eligible to return next season plus several talented incoming recruits (and the possibility of one more who's top 50 guy) ... Should we expect to see a few transfers from this year's roster?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I would say so, yes. There has to be one defection from the current roster since Pitt is only slated to lose Hamilton (assuming Chukwuka doesn’t play this year and retains a season of eligibility). With a scholarship that went unused this year, the Panthers have two openings, but have three players signed. To get anyone else in this class, which seems likely at this point, they would need two players to leave or have some creative scholarship maneuvers.</p>
<p><strong>Josh</strong>: How do you feel about Karim Coulibaly and his future projection on the roster? He seems talented from some of the flashes in the Duke game but it’s very obvious he needs more minutes to refine his craft.</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: I really like him. What we’ve seen from him have been spurts, but he has shown some uncommonly good footwork for a freshman big and seems like a really skilled player. He has to finish better around the rim and generally be more active, especially defensively, but you see some promising glimmers in his game that make you rightly believe he should get better with time.</p>
<p><strong>John</strong>: How big should the Pete really be?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: For those of you that have the good fortune of not following me on Twitter, I said last week while at Notre Dame that I think the Petersen Events Center is too big for what Pitt is as a program and that it would be better to have something about the size Notre Dame has (about 9,100). It, very understandably, got some pushback, but as a great philosopher once said, I think it’s a good idea and I stand by it.</p>
<p>The Pete seats about 12,500. In the 17 full seasons it has been open, do you know how many times it has averaged more than 11,000 fans a game? Four. I understand that it used to be one of the hardest tickets in town and it used to rock in a way few other college basketball venues do. But that was partially the product of Pitt being a perennial top-15 team playing in a brand-new arena. Now, that building is almost 20 years old and the success the Panthers achieved in that time — literally the best and most sustained run in program history — is highly improbable to be replicated. This isn’t a knock on Pitt. A college basketball program at a school of 20,000 undergraduates having to fill more than 12,000 seats in a pro-centric market that’s not a great basketball town is a big, big ask.</p>
<p>There are any number of reasons why the Pete is as big as it is — primarily, to host graduation and be a secondary concert venue for shows that can’t sell out PPG Paints Arena — and its capacity obviously isn’t going to change, but, hey, sports are about dumb hypotheticals, right?</p>
<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Given the success that Capel has had in his first two years raising this program from the dead, is now the appropriate time to offer him a lifetime contract? I mean other than Capel, and his mother, who could have predicted this great success already?</p>
<p><strong>Craig</strong>: He’s got seven more years on his current deal (two years into his original seven-year deal, with a two-year contract extension that was added in January). He has done extremely well so far, but he’s got a pretty fair contract as is.</p>
