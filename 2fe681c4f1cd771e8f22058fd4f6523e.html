<h1>After the go-go days of expansion, visits to the hospital emergency room plummet</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>In announcing an $8 million construction project in 2007 to nearly double the size of its emergency department, St. Clair Hospital cited “meteoric growth” in the number of patients seeking emergency care.</p>
<p>And St. Clair was hardly alone: Washington Hospital expanded its emergency room by 54% to 34 beds in 2009; Allegheny Valley Hospital nearly doubled the size of its emergency room to 21 beds from 12 in 2006; and Canonsburg Hospital’s emergency department ballooned to 18 beds from eight beds in 2005.</p>
<p>The building binge, fueled by a nationwide growth spurt in emergency room visits, is getting a second look now after the COVID-19 outbreak dramatically cut the number of people seeking care at the emergency department.&nbsp;Every hospital in Western Pennsylvania has been affected by the pandemic-induced downturn in patient volume, with one UPMC official suggesting it may be time for a new view of the emergency department’s role.</p>
<p>“The role of the emergency room will continue to evolve,” said Don Yealy, chair of emergency medicine at UPMC, which operates 40 hospitals with 7,000 beds. “What is the most efficient way for the patient to get things taken care of?”</p>
<p>The annual number of emergency room visits grew 44% to 129.8 million in 2010 from 90.3 million in 1996, according to a 2014 study by the Emergency Nurses Association. But the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said the median number of emergency room visits nationwide fell by 42% between March 29 and April 25 when compared to the same period a year earlier.</p>
<p>That trend was reflected locally, with Pittsburgh-based hospital giant UPMC reporting a 20% drop in emergency room visits to 446,684 for the six months ending June 30 and Washington Hospital reporting an 11.3% drop to 42,025 total emergency department visits during the same period.</p>
<p>Among the 60 Western Pennsylvania hospitals represented by the Healthcare Council of Western Pennsylvania, emergency room visits were off nearly 35% for the three months ending June 30, CFO Denis Lukes said.</p>
<p>“It’s really significant,” he said. “Things have improved somewhat, but not nearly what we would call normal.”</p>
<p>Community ambulance services, already smarting from depressed insurer reimbursement for emergency care and higher operating costs, are also feeling the fallout.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Very early on in the COVID-19 pandemic, we saw a drastic reduction of 70% in the number of calls, even in the number of people calling 911,” said Steve McKinnis, administrator of McCandless-Franklin Park Ambulance Authority, which answers about 4,800 calls annually in five North Hills communities. “There were days when we’d only have two calls, but it has returned quite a bit since then.”</p>
<p>Emergency call volume is off 10% to 15% when compared to a year ago, Mr. McKinnis said.</p>
<p>Bill Negrich, director of Cheswick-based Lower Valley Ambulance Service, which answers about 4,000 emergency calls annually in seven communities, estimated that emergency transport calls fell 20% to 25% as the number of COVID-19 cases surged in Western Pennsylvania in the spring. Call volume has not completely recovered since, he said.</p>
<p>“A lot of people are still very hesitant about going to the hospital,” Mr. Negrich said. “We’re seeing a lot of refusals, people who are evaluated but decline to go to the hospital.”</p>
<p>For 911 calls, the bulk of the alarms that ambulance services handle, EMS is only paid when the patient is taken to the hospital.</p>
<p>The big reason for avoiding the emergency department: People want to avoid catching the highly contagious COVID-19, said Domenic Pascucci, a veteran health insurance consultant at insurance brokerage JRG Advisors LLC in Wexford.</p>
<p>“Most of the avoidance is due to COVID-19,” he said. “People are just afraid of going to the hospital, period.”</p>
<p>Moreover, most health insurance policies have co-pays ranging between $200 and $500 for emergency room visits, which is an out-of-pocket expense for patients who are not admitted to the hospital, he said.</p>
<p>Health insurers encourage members to visit an urgent care center, see a doctor virtually with telehealth — a service that has exploded&nbsp;in popularity since the start of the pandemic —&nbsp;or simply see their family doctor instead, when possible.</p>
<p>But even people with serious ailments such as heart attacks and strokes avoided the hospital emergency room during the height of the pandemic, said Arvind Venkat, immediate past president of the Pennsylvania College of Emergency Physicians and a staff physician at Allegheny Health Network hospitals.</p>
<p>“Some people with serious conditions are not coming in when they should,” Dr. Venkat said. “As restrictions eased, emergency room visits have slowly come back to normal, but they haven’t come back to the same level as before.”</p>
<p>Dr. Venkat said he worries that people with true medical emergencies are putting off care for any number of reasons, including fear of becoming infected with COVID-19. Such fears are overblown, he said.</p>
<p>“If you have symptoms of an emergency —&nbsp;slurred speech, chest pain —&nbsp;that’s when we can intervene and make a difference for you,” he said.</p>
<p>Emergency care is expensive care, experts say, partly because of the quick, around-the-clock access needed for staff, supplies and medical equipment to handle a wide array of problems. Still, Dr. Yealy said between 10% and 30% of emergency department patients could effectively be treated in lower-cost ways, including telehealth and at urgent care centers.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean emergency departments are going away, he said.</p>
<p>“COVID-19 has accelerated changes in the emergency department that were happening or likely to happen,” Dr. Yealy said.</p>
<p>Hospital emergency rooms of the future may provide longer intervals of care than are typical today when fast stabilization and transfer of the patient are priorities.</p>
<p>In some instances, an extended emergency room visit —&nbsp;seven or eight hours, for example — may help the patient as much as being admitted to the hospital for two or three days, he said.</p>
<p>“Health care systems have to meet people where they need to get care</p>
