<h1>Mike Sullivan on the NHL suspending play and how the Penguins are staying 'ready'</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Wednesday, for the first time since the <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/12/pittsburgh-penguins-coronavirus-season-postponed-nhl/stories/202003120129" target="_blank">NHL went on a hiatus</a> due to the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the Penguins’ top decision-makers spoke publicly.</p>
<p>Mike Sullivan appeared on Sportsnet 590’s “Hockey Central” and gave an update on what he has been up to since the NHL suspended play last Thursday, sharing a little insight into what the Penguins are doing to try to keep their players in shape should the league get the green light to start skating again.</p>
<p>First things first, Sullivan reported that his family and he are “doing great.”</p>
<p>“Quite honestly, we haven’t been doing a whole lot,” he said. “We’ve just been trying to do what everyone else is doing, trying to self-isolate, so to speak, in hopes that everybody can do their part and try to limit the spread of this coronavirus. Obviously, the health and well-being of everyone is the priority at this point.”</p>
<p>The “Hockey Central” crew asked Sullivan what the Penguins and their coaching and strength and conditioning staff were doing to guide the players, who are also doing self-quarantine for the foreseeable future at the urging of the league.</p>
<p>As laid out in <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/sports/penguins/2020/03/13/pittsburgh-penguins-nhl-seaosn-suspended-coronaviurus-covid19/stories/202003130141" target="_blank">an NHL memo</a> a few days ago, players are not allowed to skate at team facilities or public rinks. They were also told to avoid gyms. That leaves working out at home or exercising outside, as long as they practice social distancing.</p>
<p>“We’ve trying to do everything we can under difficult circumstances to try to stay prepared,” Sullivan said. “I know our strength coaches have had personal conversations with every guy and taken an inventory of what they have at their disposal in their respective homes, and then [they are] building individual programs for these guys that they can continue to do on a daily basis to try to stay fit and keep themselves ready in the event that we get on the other side of this.”</p>
<p>Sullivan, while obviously appreciating the unsettling circumstances that led to the league going on hiatus, expressed disappointment that his players saw the season put on hold with 13 games left in the regular season. Despite going 3-8-0 in their last 11 games, the Penguins were still on the short list of East contenders.</p>
<p>“Our team was going through a bit of a struggle here. I felt like that as a group we were starting to turn the corner as a team,” he said. “So in some ways, I’m a little bit disappointed for the group because I felt like we were making big strides in trying to capture the game that we played so consistently all year long.”</p>
<p>The coach touched on a few more topics if you want to <a href="https://podcasts.google.com/?feed=aHR0cDovL2ZlZWRzLmZlZWRidXJuZXIuY29tL2ZhbjU5MF9ob2NrZXljZW50cmFs&amp;episode=aHR0cHM6Ly9wb2RjYXN0LnNwb3J0c25ldC5jYS8_cD0xNDA5Nw&amp;hl=en&amp;ved=2ahUKEwihjO_LnKXoAhXhlHIEHUZ6BjQQieUEegQIBBAE&amp;ep=6" target="_blank">check out the “Hockey Central” interview</a>. They include Sidney Crosby’s potential as a coach, Sullivan’s involvement with USA Hockey, why Sullivan thought Justin Schultz was getting back on track and Tom Brady leaving the New England Patriots.</p>
