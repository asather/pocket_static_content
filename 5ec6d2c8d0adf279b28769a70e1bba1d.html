<h1>After a drastic turnaround, Penguins have started to slip with odd-man rushes</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>SUNRISE, Fla. — Last season, the Penguins ranked near the bottom of the NHL in odd-man rushes against, too often asking Matt Murray to be more of a gymnast than a goalie. None of his padded NHL peers faced them more frequently.</p>
<p>It caught up to them in the playoffs, when they allowed 27 rush chances in four games, per Sportlogiq. The New York Islanders scored on four of them.</p>
<p>Coach Mike Sullivan, who stewed about that all summer, made transition defense a point of emphasis this fall. His players were listening. Entering the All-Star break, they had allowed the fewest odd-man rushes in the league, per Sportlogiq.</p>
<p>“He addressed this and we know, too,” defenseman Marcus Pettersson said. “We saw that last year. You can’t win over a [long] period of time if you give up too many odd-man rushes. Teams are just too good nowadays, especially a team like Tampa.”</p>
<p>The Penguins gave up a few in Thursday’s 4-2 loss to the Tampa Bay Lightning. Murray stopped a pair of breakaways. But Anthony Cirelli cashed in on a 3-on-1 in the second period, moments after the Penguins had pulled within a goal.</p>
<p>Pettersson said there was more of the same in the two games before that.</p>
<p>“Teams are pretty good at transitioning. If they see an opportunity, they’ll shove it down your throat,” Justin Schultz said. “We haven’t been giving up as many odd-man rushes, other than the last few games. It’s something we’ll try to [fix].”</p>
<p>So what had the Penguins been doing most of this season to cut them down?</p>
<p>“It’s not any one thing,” Sullivan said, adding, “It’s managing the puck the right way at different areas of the rink. It’s [forwards] working to reload in the offensive zone and stay above people so if our defenseman pinches, he’s got support. It’s changing smart. There’s so many different aspects that go into it.”</p>
<p><strong>Marino, Rust miss practice</strong></p>
<p>Defenseman John Marino and winger Bryan Rust did not practice Friday at BB&amp;T Center, where the Penguins will play the Florida Panthers on Saturday.</p>
<p>Marino was drilled by a slap shot in the left cheek during the third period of Thursday’s loss and did not return. He had to get his cheek stitched up after the game, but it was believed then that he escaped without major injury.</p>
<p>Once the swelling goes down, the Penguins will know for certain. Sullivan said Friday afternoon that the rookie’s injury was still being evaluated. It’s not yet known if he will be in the lineup Saturday against the Panthers.</p>
<p>With Marino sitting out Friday’s practice, Pettersson and Schultz were reunited on the second pair. The third pair was Juuso Riikola with Chad Ruhwedel.</p>
<p>Sullivan said Rust was given a “maintenance day,” his second this week. Rust did not practice Monday in Tampa after taking a brief skate without his full equipment on, as head athletic trainer Chris Stewart closely watched. He did practice Wednesday and played more than 21 minutes against the Lightning.</p>
<p>Andrew Agozzino was in Bryan Rust’s spot on Evgeni Malkin’s line Friday.</p>
<p><strong>Another power outage</strong></p>
<p>The power play has been feast or famine for the Penguins all season, in part due to injury-related absences for their star players, sometimes simultaneously.</p>
<p>They started clicking again when Sidney Crosby returned to the lineup last month, putting up multiple power play goals four times in a seven-game stretch. The past two games, though, they went 0-for-12 combined. That included a long 5-on-3 power play while down a goal in the third period of Thursday’s loss.</p>
<p>Sullivan said the unit often struggles when players become too stagnant.</p>
<p>“The strength of our group is their instinctive play,” the coach said, adding, “Some power plays might have less movement and play within more structure than ours does. Ours has a framework and there is some structure. But it’s movement within that I think helps us be at our best and creates deception.”</p>
<p>With Rust not practicing, Jared McCann took his place on the top power-play unit. Sullivan also gave Kris Letang and Schultz each a turn running the point.</p>
<p><strong>Teddy saves the day</strong></p>
<p>Thursday’s game against the Lightning might have gotten out of hand if not for a key play by Teddy Blueger with the Penguins down 2-0 in the first period.</p>
<p>Murray was down and out when the puck came to Lightning forward Yanni Gourde in the slot. Blueger dropped one knee into a half-butterfly position to block the shot, though the center wasn’t credited for it on the stat sheet.</p>
<p>“I can’t remember [how I got there]. But there was a scramble in the crease and I just kind of found myself on the goal line,” he said Friday. “So I just tried to get in there and hope it hit me. And fortunately it did — and not in the face.”</p>
<p>Blueger, a native of Latvia, has only strapped on the pads for street hockey.</p>
<p>“Street hockey was fun,” said Blueger, who has blocked 27 shots this season. “But I wouldn’t like to be [an NHL] goalie and have a million pucks flying at me.”</p>
