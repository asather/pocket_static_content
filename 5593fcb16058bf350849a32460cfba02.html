<h1>City Theatre names Clare Drobot associate artistic director </h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>City Theatre has restructured some of its top jobs following the recent exit of Reginald Douglas as artistic producer.</p>
<p>That title, created when he came to work for then artistic director Tracy Brigden, is no more. Current artistic director Marc Masterson on Wednesday announced a new staff structure for the 45-year-old South Side theater.</p>
<p>Clare Drobot, previously the director of new play development, has been promoted to the role of associate artistic director, and Katie Trupiano is now education director, a role previously held by Dennis Robinson.&nbsp;Filling new new positions are Monteze Freeland, a former Post-Gazette Performer of the Year, as associate producer, and Rebekah Diazjoining as community engagement officer.</p>
