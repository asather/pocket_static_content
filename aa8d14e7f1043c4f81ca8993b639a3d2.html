<h1>Dapper Dan honors: Broadcaster Bill Hillgrove 'humbled' by recognition</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>For the first time in a month, Bill Hillgrove sat courtside at Petersen Events Center and watched warm-ups. The longtime radio play-by-play voice of the Steelers, Pitt football and Panther men’s basketball, who underwent back surgery in late December, was sidelined for four home games at the Pete and returned to his post last Saturday.</p>
<p>For someone who missed only one basketball game for health reasons — back spasms four years ago cost him a game against Syracuse — it was an odd feeling being away. But when Hillgrove called Pitt’s 66-52 win over North Carolina, he brought with him a fresh perspective.</p>
<p>“You just take a step back and appreciate the whole thing,” Hillgrove said. “The whole thing” being, of course, a career cherished by Pittsburgh sports fans for a half-century. A career that will be honored at the 84th Dapper Dan Dinner &amp; Sports Auction, where Hillgrove will receive this year’s Lifetime Achievement Award.</p>
<p>Hillgrove — who started calling play-by-play for Pitt basketball games in 1969, Panther football in 1974 and the Steelers in 1994 — will be recognized at the annual event starting at 6 p.m. Feb. 10&nbsp;at the Wyndham Grand Pittsburgh Downtown. Tickets and more information are available at <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/dapperdan20" target="_blank">post-gazette.com/dapperdan20</a>.</p>
<p>Hillgrove said he was “floored” when he found out of the Dapper Dan award.</p>
<p>“To get it is an honor. But in my hometown, it’s almost triple. You know what I’m saying? To be blessed to do teams that I grew up rooting for ... that’s all good,” Hillgrove bellowed over the eager and chatty Oakland Zoo. “I’m humbled and honored. ... I don’t have too many words for it. I don’t. How do you quantify it? It’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Hillgrove, 79, remembers being in attendance when former Pitt tight end and Chicago Bears coach Mike Ditka won the honor in 2000 and when former Pirates MVP and fellow broadcasting legend Dick Groat was recognized with the 2015 honor. He called those moments “pretty special,” and those closest to Hillgrove expect the same sentiment when he takes center stage.</p>
<p>Pat Bostick, Hillgrove’s partner on 93.7 The Fan’s Pitt football broadcasts and the Panthers’ associate athletic director for major gifts, was in a department meeting discussing how many tables Pitt would need on awards night when he first heard of Hillgrove’s honor.</p>
<p>“I was happy and then somewhat panic-stricken because there are so many people that would want to be there for him,” Bostick said. “How many tables can we accommodate? Because his reach is so far.”</p>
<p>Hillgrove is, as Bostick dubbed him, “a treasure to Pittsburgh.”</p>
<p>Hillgrove grew up in Garfield. If he attended public school, it would have been the since closed Peabody High School. But his parents insisted he go to Central Catholic, only a 30-minute walk from his childhood home.</p>
<p>The 1958 Central Catholic graduate, who will be inducted into high school’s Hall of Fame this spring, recalls getting cut by the Vikings’ baseball team. The kid who lived next to Fort Pitt Field at the top of Garfield Hill, where he could see the Forbes Field lights and dream of one day playing in those storied confines, had what he called a “sudden and very real end” to his playing career. That later spawned an interest in sports broadcasting.</p>
<p>Hillgrove, who graduated from Duquesne in 1962 with a bachelor’s degree in journalism, moved on from his gig as a disc jockey at WTAE-Radio when the station acquired the rights to Pitt football and basketball in 1969. Hillgrove served as the color commentator alongside the legendary Ed Conway on Pitt football and boomed as the play-by-play voice for Panther basketball. He took over the Pitt football play-by-play duties when Conway died in 1974 and added Steelers play-by-play responsibilities 20 years later.</p>
<p>Calling games in the city for 50 years, Hillgrove had a lot to choose from. But when asked what his favorite games were to voice, he mentioned the Big East basketball championships in 2003 and 2008, the 2009 Super Bowl (“You know, Santonio’s touchdown,” Hillgrove quipped) and Tony Dorsett’s record-setting day against Navy in 1976.</p>
<p>There were games Hillgrove didn’t voice, too. Due to radio rights restrictions, he wasn’t allowed to be in the booth for Pitt football’s 1976 national title-clinching Sugar Bowl victory, and he couldn’t call Dan Marino’s 33-yard, game-winning touchdown to John Brown in the 1982 Sugar Bowl, either. Hillgrove was, instead, on the sidelines, still a part of the moment and of Pitt history.</p>
<p>With the Dapper Dan Lifetime Achievement Award, Hillgrove’s place in <em>Pittsburgh</em> history is further cemented, just in case the foundation wasn’t strong enough already.</p>
<p>Bostick believes Hillgrove is a little hesitant to accept these kinds of honors “because I don’t think he’s close to being done yet.” Hillgrove himself nodded at the notion that his career is far from finished, reiterating what he told the Post-Gazette in September: He’ll keep calling games “as long as it’s fun.”&nbsp;Doing it in the city he grew up in has a lot to do with that, too.</p>
<p>“I love this town. And I travel enough to know it’s probably the biggest little town in North America,” Hillgrove said. “I’ve never, ever wanted to get away from that. ... I was lucky enough to stay home.”</p>
<p>And Pittsburgh sports scene was lucky enough to have him.</p>
