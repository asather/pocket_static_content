<h1>Fishing Report: Regional stocked trout waters loaded with fish</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p><strong>Lake Erie and tributaries</strong> (Erie County) Smallmouth bass and yellow perch were taken off the mouth of Walnut Creek. Perch were caught from shoreline locations on Presque Isle Bay.</p>
<p><strong>Connoquenessing Creek</strong> (Butler County) A 25-inch rainbow trout took a wax worm and was landed by a Butler County man April 15.</p>
<p><strong>Pine Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Will Drexler, 17, of McKees Rocks landed a brightly colored 17-inch golden rainbow. This year, the state Fish and Boat Commission stocked some 13,000, 40% more than in 2019. The goldens are rainbow trout, hatchery-bred for their angler appeal. They are often incorrectly called “palominos,” which were a dull-colored hatchery creation discontinued years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Big Sewickley Creek</strong> (Allegheny County) Emily Reiner, 12, of Glenfield landed a rainbow trout in the 20-inch range on an ultralight spinning rod. The big fish was released.</p>
<p><strong>Loyalhanna Creek</strong> (Westmoreland County) A 22-inch brown and 23-inch rainbow went for a spinner fished in Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only waters stocked for the Keystone Select Stocked Trout Waters program. Those waters were stocked with trophy-size trout at a rate of 175 to 225 fish per mile, in addition to the creek’s regular stocking.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Stone Creek</strong> (Huntington County) An Allegheny County angler caught and released two hefty trout taken on a spinning gear using small trout eggs.</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Hill Lake</strong> (Somerset County) Trout took minnows and other live baits under bobbers.</p>
<p><strong>Laurel Hill Creek</strong> (Somerset County) Todd Davis of Greensburg caught and released a 25-inch brown trout taken on a nymph in the upper Delayed Harvest Artificial Lures Only stretch, part of the Keystone Select Stocked Trout Waters program.</p>
