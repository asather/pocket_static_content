<h1>Police in Indiana conducting traffic stop apprehend West Mifflin homicide suspect</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Police in Indiana on Monday apprehended a man <a href="https://www.post-gazette.com/news/crime-courts/2020/05/22/Allegheny-County-Police-West-Mifflin-shooting-daymond-wiggins-thomas-johnson/stories/202005220106?cid=search" target="_blank">charged with homicide</a> in a West Mifflin shooting last month.</p>
<p>The LaPorte County Sheriff's Office took Daymond “Day Day” Wiggins into custody after conducting a traffic stop in LaPorte, Ind.</p>
<p>Wiggins, 37, is charged with killing Thomas Johnson, 45, on Midway Drive in the Mon View Heights apartment complex on May 18. Wiggins is listed on court paperwork as living in the complex.</p>
<p>Two days later, Allegheny County police obtained an arrest warrant for Wiggins.</p>
<p>Wiggins will now await extradition to Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Wiggins, a convicted felon, is not allowed to possess a gun. He is charged with homicide and firearms violations.</p>
<p>A criminal complaint said Wiggins approached Mr. Johnson in an area called “the tunnel,” located between two buildings in the apartment complex.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Two witnesses to the killing, one of whom identified Wiggins as the shooter, spoke with police. Neither was identified by name in court paperwork.</p>
<p>The first witness, who was friends with Mr. Johnson, was hanging out with him when Wiggins pointed a gun at the victim and shot multiple times, a criminal complaint said.</p>
<p>That witness, who police said broke down in tears upon seeing a picture of Wiggins during a photo array presented by detectives, identified Wiggins as the killer, according to the complaint.</p>
<p>The witness admitted to returning fire.</p>
<p>Another witness described hanging out with Mr. Johnson, who was giving money to little kids near the tunnel, when two men and two women appeared in the tunnel.</p>
<p>The second witness told police that one of the men pulled a revolver from his pocket and started firing. The witness took cover but said four or five shots could be heard.</p>
<p>Detectives found four spent .25-caliber cartridge casings at the scene and said they were consistent with the first witness's gun.</p>
<p>An autopsy revealed that Mr. Johnson was shot in the head but concluded that the bullets that killed him could not have been .25 caliber, the complaint said.</p>
<p>The complaint does not describe a motive for the shooting.</p>
<p>Anyone with information about the homicide can call the county police tip line at 1-833-ALL-TIPS (1-833-255-8477).</p>
