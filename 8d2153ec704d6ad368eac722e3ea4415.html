<h1>Five former Pitt, Penn State players on College Football Hall of Fame ballot</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>D.J. Dozier is back on the College Football Hall of Fame ballot.</p>
<p>The former Penn State All-American running back, who helped guide the Nittany Lions to their 1986 national championship, was included in the field of candidates for immortality for the first time since 2017 when the National Football Foundation announced the 2021 ballot Tuesday.</p>
<p>He’s joined by four former Pitt and Penn State standouts on the list.</p>
<p>Pitt’s Matt Cavanaugh, quarterback of the 1976 national championship squad, and Craig “Ironhead” Heyward, former All-American running back and father of Steelers Pro Bowler Cam Heyward, are both appearing for a fifth consecutive year.</p>
<p>Joining Dozier among former Nittany Lions are Bobby Engram, an All-American wide receiver who last appeared on the ballot in 2019, and Steve Wisniewski, a former All-American offensive lineman who’s been on the ballot every year since 2014.</p>
<p>Taylor Stubblefield, Penn State’s first-year wide receivers coach, is also a candidate. He was previously an All-American receiver at Purdue.</p>
<p>A total of 78 former Football Bowl Subdivision players are candidates this year, along with seven coaches. The class will be announced in early 2021 and inducted the following December.</p>
