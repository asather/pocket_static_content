<p>Asked by a federal judge in Pittsburgh to lay out its evidence of how mail-in balloting can "sow chaos" in an election and foster an environment of voter fraud, Donald Trump's presidential campaign filed more than 500 pages of documents last week that it claims show votes are at risk of being diluted by Democratic policies.</p>
<p>But the filing —&nbsp;obtained this weekend by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette — does not include specific evidence that suggests rampant and widespread fraud encouraged by a flawed and insecure mail-in system.</p>
<p>Instead, evidence is presented as a series of specific examples of election malfeasance that the Trump campaign says is enough to prove their point — while critics say it proves Mr. Trump is vastly exaggerating.</p>
<p>While much of the filing is basic information about poll watchers, ballot drop boxes and right-to-know requests, it also includes several news articles that detail instances of fraud, cluttered voter rolls and bribery — a majority of which have nothing to do with vote-by-mail directly but attempt to make the campaign's case that any fraud in the electoral process is too much fraud and ripe for abuse.</p>
<p>It hones in — more than once — on a scandal earlier this year in Philadelphia, where an election judge pleaded guilty to taking bribes to run up Democratic vote totals, according to a <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/news/election-fraud-philadelphia-dmocrats-federal-charges-president-donald-trump-republicans-domenick-demuro-20200522.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia Inquirer article</a> referenced in the filing.</p>
<p>In that case, a former congressman was also charged, alleged to have bribed the election judge and conspired with him to "add fraudulent votes on the voting machines -- also known as 'ringing up' votes -- for [the congressman's] clients and preferred candidates, thereby diluting the value of ballots cast by actual voters," a <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-congressman-charged-ballot-stuffing-bribery-and-obstruction" target="_blank">release from the U.S. Department of Justice</a> read at the time.</p>
<p>Though the Trump campaign pounced on it at the time and called it proof of the need for Republicans to "fight back against the Democrats' nationwide vote-by-mail push to destroy the integrity of elections," none of the allegations in the case involved mail-in voting —&nbsp;which is at the center of the camp's recent legal effort in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>Mr. Trump's campaign, along with several local GOP congressmen, is suing Pennsylvania and the election boards of its 67 counties to put an end, among other things, to "unmonitored ad hoc drop boxes" for mail-in and absentee ballots, which they claim would allow "illegal [absentee] and mail-in voting, ballot harvesting, and other fraud to occur and/or go undetected, and will result in dilution of validly cast ballots," according to the original suit.</p>
<p>In their suit, the Republicans allege that the "single greatest threat to free and fair elections" is "unmonitored" mail-in voting, and say that counties have implemented it in a "hazardous, hurried and illegal" manner.</p>
<p>Seeking evidence for Republican claims of fraud, the Sierra Club and Citizens for Pennsylvania's Future — two intervening parties in the suit — requested the Trump campaign provide documentation, which U.S. District Judge J. Nicholas Ranjan granted.</p>
<p>Suzanne Almeida, redistricting and representation counsel for Common Cause, another intervenor in the case, said the Trump campaign did not prove in their filing that voter fraud is rampant or that there are breakdowns in the mail-in voting system.</p>
<p>“There isn’t any evidence of voter fraud in what they have filed with the court, which leads me to believe — as we all know — that voter fraud is not the kind of problem that some people think it is,” Ms. Almeida said.</p>
<p>In a statement to the Post-Gazette, a senior Trump campaign official said "any amount of fraud is too much fraud," and that to win the case, they "must show that the Democrats' ridiculous policies dilute votes."</p>
<p>"The evidence of fraud we produced in our response, along with the legal flaws inherent in the Democrats’ policies that allow for double voting and standardless drop boxes, clearly demonstrate that vote dilution," the official said.</p>
<p>Among the articles and releases cited in the Trump campaign filing was one from the Pennsylvania Attorney General's office <a href="https://www.attorneygeneral.gov/taking-action/updates/case-update-election-fraud-in-197th-state-house-race-2" target="_blank">two years ago</a>&nbsp;announcing that a poll worker in Philadelphia pleaded guilty, along with a few other workers, in connection with voter fraud in a 2017 special election.</p>
<p>Though their crimes were not determined to have impacted the results of the state House race in question, the workers were involved in several incidents that the attorney general deemed "detailed harassment and intimidation against voters who wanted to vote for candidates of their choice but not the candidate being pushed by the city's Democratic Party machine," the release read.</p>
<p>The incidents included one Republican vote either not being cast or counted and a voter whose vote was tallied as a write-in for the Democrat, even though their vote was never completed or counted.</p>
<p>But in this case, too, none of the allegations involved mail-in or absentee voting.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign, in its attempt to prove that votes are being diluted and that voters are operating on an unequal playing field, is warning that voters could vote twice — once by mail, then in-person — without there being an immediate way for polling places to confirm whether the voter has already cast their ballot.</p>
<p>It makes reference in the recent filing, at one point, to 40 people voting twice in Philadelphia in June's primary election.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://www.inquirer.com/politics/election/pa-primary-election-mail-ballots-double-voting-20200616.html" target="_blank">Philadelphia Inquirer</a>, 40 people did return a mail-in ballot and vote in person, but 36 were caught in time and their mail ballots excluded — leaving four double votes that had already been tallied. It was likely the result of the county processing 92,000 voters' mail ballot applications after Philadelphia's poll books were printed, the Inquirer reported.</p>
<p>The Trump campaign claims that this example and others of electors receiving multiple ballots, dropping off multiple ballots or returning someone else's ballot is evidence of vote dilution that will help make their case.</p>
<p>Ms. Almeida said there are&nbsp;“always a handful of bad actors,” but that&nbsp;“we have a system that is set up to catch and prosecute those bad actors.”</p>
<p>“I think all of the instances of voter fraud or election misconduct — because many of them are not fraud [and] ‘misconduct’ is a different word — that they have alleged are one-off incidents,” Ms. Almeida said. “They are not evidence of systemic issues with our voting systems.”</p>
