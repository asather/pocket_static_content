<h1>As expected, PIAA gives green light for fall sports in Pennsylvania</h1>

<p><em><strong>This is a developing story and will be updated:</strong></em></p>
<p>High school athletes in Pennsylvania should buckle the chin strap, put on the shin guards, lace up the running shoes and clean the clubs. The PIAA says fall sports are on.</p>
<p>But it’s still up to every school whether to participate.</p>
<p>The PIAA board of directors voted Friday, 25-5, to conduct all fall sports as scheduled, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. The PIAA made its decision despite a recommendation recently from Gov. Wolf and the Pennsylvania departments of health and education that school and recreation sports stop until Jan. 1.</p>
<p>Although the PIAA gave the go-ahead for fall sports, the organization said every school in the state must now decide if it wants to participate. So, it will be up to school boards or superintendents to choose the fate of their sports teams. Football, boys and girls soccer, girls volleyball, boys and girls golf, boys and girls cross country and field hockey are the fall sports in the PIAA.</p>
<p>“We’re not mandating anyone to participate,” PIAA executive director Bob Lombardi said.</p>
<p>Some schools in Pennsylvania have already voted to cancel fall sports, including WPIAL schools Uniontown and Summit Academy. The WPIAL is part of the PIAA. Pittsburgh Public Schools will vote Wednesday whether to cancel fall sports for six City League high schools.</p>
<p>“We think we owed it to the schools to at least try,” Lombardi said.</p>
<p>As for the WPIAL, the next step is for the WPIAL board of directors to meet Monday afternoon when the league will decide on such things as schedules and guidelines to give to schools.</p>
<p>The PIAA could have decided to cancel fall sports and possibly move some, if not all fall sports, to a shortened season in the spring. According to playfootball.nfl.com, 17 states and the District of Columbia pushed football back to the spring, but 18 other states have decided to play football as scheduled. Thirteen other states delayed the start of the season.</p>
<p>The PIAA’s decision to have fall sports affects more than 100,000 high school students in Pennsylvania. According to the most recent National Federation of State High School Association participation statistics from the 2018-19 school year, Pennsylvania had 119,000 boys and girls competing in fall sports.</p>
