<h1>Chase Claypool has made a few big plays. Now he wants more</h1>
<article><div class='post-content'>
<p>Rookie receiver Chase Claypool only has six catches through three games, but he’s made the most of them. The Steelers drafted Claypool out of Notre Dame for his big-play abilities, and he has provided some in each of the first three games of his NFL career.</p>
<p>Three of Claypool’s receptions have been for 20 yards or more, including an 84-yard touchdown against the Broncos in Week 2. He is averaging a whopping 25.2 yards per reception.</p>
<p>And Claypool has produced those big plays despite playing only half the offensive snaps in the first three games. He has seen his playing time gradually increase. He played 30% of the snaps in the opener against the Giants, 37% against the Broncos and then 76% against the Texans, after Diontae Johnson could not finish the game after being concussed in the first quarter.</p>
<p>“It was good to get a full game under my belt just to know what to expect going in there the next time that might happen,” Claypool said. “It definitely speeds up your development, but I don’t think there’s too much more of a gap that I need to fill in.”</p>
<p>The Steelers practiced Monday morning, but they don’t have to release an injury report until Wednesday. If Johnson returns for Sunday’s game against the Eagles, Claypool’s playing time likely will decrease, but he has instilled confidence in his coaches and Ben Roethlisberger with his performance thus far.</p>
<p>“I feel good with everything,” Claypool said. “Just little things like timing will get better. That’s kind of what I’m working on now rather than learning the plays since I know them all. It’s more doing each play to [Roethlisberger’s] liking.”</p>
<p>While Claypool, who turned 22 in July, has made a seamless transition on the field, his family life has been put on hold. Claypool is from Canada, where the government requires anyone enters or leaves and reenters the country to quarantine for 14 days due to the COVID-19 pandemic.</p>
<p>“I left Canada a couple of weeks after the draft,” he said. “That’s the last time I saw them. It’s definitely been tough because I know they won’t be able to come to any games this year unless something crazy happens because they’d have to go home and quarantine for two weeks. So it’s a little tough, but I’m used to it. I went to school far away from them and I didn’t see them for long periods of time. I’m used to it. I stay in touch with them and I know they support me back home.”</p>
<p><strong>NFL contingency plans a mystery</strong></p>
<p>The COVID-19 outbreak in Tennessee along with the New England-Kansas City game being delayed a day due to positive tests brought the possibility of teams not being able to complete a 16-game schedule into the spotlight.</p>
<p>The NFL pushed back the Steelers-Titans game until Week 7, but the Titans’ game this Sunday against the Bills remains in doubt with at least 20 players or staff personnel testing positive over the past 10 days.</p>
<p>Steelers coach Mike Tomlin, a member of the NFL’s competition committee, revealed last week there were talks over the summer about how the league would proceed if all teams could not play a complete schedule.</p>
<p>“I know we had hypothetical conversations during the summer for such an event, so they have things in place in terms of playoff tiering if we move in that direction,” Tomlin said. “But I think that it is everyone’s hope that it doesn’t come to fruition.”</p>
<p>Major League Baseball had two teams that did not complete the revised 60-game schedule. The St. Louis Cardinals and Detroit Tigers played 58 games apiece. The Cardinals, who had an early-season outbreak that put their season on pause for two weeks, earned a playoff spot because no other teams in the National League were within two games of them when the regular season ended.</p>
<p>The NFL, which declined to share of any of their contingency plans for the playoffs, could take a similar approach. They could push back the playoff schedule and play postponed regular-season games if needed after Week 17.</p>
<p>Other possibilities surely exist, but the only public comments NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has made on the matter came via a Peter King story for NBC Sports last month.</p>
<p>“We’re prepared if we have to do that. We’ve obviously gone through work on that basis with teams,” Goodell said. “There will be potential competitive inequities that will be required this season because of the virus and because of the circumstances that we wouldn’t do in other years. That’s going to be a reality of 2020. If we feel like we have an outbreak, that’s going to be driven by medical decisions—not competitive decisions.”</p>
<p>Steelers outside linebacker Bud&nbsp;Dupree said teams that play fewer games should not be penalized when it comes to determining which teams make the playoffs.</p>
<p>“That’s wild,” Dupree said of the possibility some teams won’t be able to play 16 games. “That’s one of those situations where we just have to see what’s best for everybody and then come together as a whole and make the best decisions, so the best teams can be in the playoffs. Don’t leave anyone behind who is supposed to be in the playoffs. Whatever is the best way to do that we should come to an agreement and make that happen. They also need to include the players in that as well.”</p>
